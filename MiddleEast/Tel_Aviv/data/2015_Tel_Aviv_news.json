It\u2019s not simply that her life story features a brief stint in an Italian artists\u2019 commune, starting up a post-punk fanzine in the 1990s and birdwatching with Jonathan Franzen, or that, age 50, she has written one of the most exciting debut novels that will be published this year. It\u2019s not even that a week after her conversation with the Guardian, she emailed a nude photograph of herself, posing artistically by a German piano. No, it is that the world view of Zink is so startlingly unique, at once almost alienating in its oddness and dazzling in its rarity, that you leave the conversation feeling like your own life is frankly dull and one dimensional. Indeed, Franzen, widely considered to be one of the great American authors writing today, who can also be credited for discovering Zink, recently said her work \u201cinsistently raises the possibility that the world is larger and stranger than the world you think you know\u201d. Out in July, Zink\u2019s debut novel, Mislaid, tells the tale of a gay professor and lesbian student in 1966 Virginia who get married and have two children before the wife, Peggy, runs away with their daughter and adopts an African-American racial persona, despite both being white. Drawing on Zink\u2019s recollections of growing up in post-segregation Virginia in the 1960s it is, needless to say, an atypical take on the American family saga. The story of how Zink has gone from living in total obscurity in south Berlin to having Franzen acting as her agent, and eventually selling her debut novel, Mislaid, for \u00a3130,000 last year fits the eccentricities of Zink herself. Born in California in 1964, and raised in Virginia, her first encounter with writing for any kind of audience came in 1993 when, living in west Philadelphia as part of the anarchist scene, she began her own animal-themed post-punk fanzine. Animal Review featured submissions and interviews with punk musicians about their pets, from King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp writing about his rabbit Beaton Bunnerius Bun, to Jon Langford, of British punk band The Mekons, discussing his loach fish. \u201cYes, those were cute days\u201d Zink recalls. \u201cBefore then everything I\u2019d written had been completely secret... My zine ran in print from 1993 to 1997 with a tiny circulation that people consistently denied to my face. Like I\u2019d say, \u2018Around 80,\u2019 and they\u2019d say, \u2018You\u2019re lying.\u2019\u201d Following a spontaneous move to Tel Aviv with an Israeli poet called Zohar Eitan in 1997, after he wrote fanmail letters to her, she befriended an Israeli writer, Avner Shats, the man who, until 15 years later when Franzen first read her manuscripts, would be the one and only reader of her fiction. \u201cAvner and I just began writing for each other,\u201d says Zink. \u201cHe writes mostly Hebrew, which I can\u2019t read, so I sort of made a game out of trying to translate his stuff even though I can\u2019t read Hebrew very well. The first thing I wrote for him was a novel called Sailing Towards the Sunset by Avner Shats. It never crossed my mind anyone else would ever read my writing, and I deleted a lot of what I wrote back then.\u201d Even after Zink moved to Berlin in 2000 (\u201cI was tired of being in love with adorable men ... I realised if I moved here, I could have hot superficial sexual relationships with guys I otherwise ignored. This is so, so key for artistic praxis \u2013 frees up incredible amounts of time\u201d) she continued writing prolifically for Shats, including a novella about an estate agent in Florence, called European Story for Avner Shats, alongside finishing up a doctorate in media studies at the University of T\u00fcbingen. To quote Zink, this was to mark the one of the first moments in her career when things got \u201creally weird\u201d (it\u2019s a phrase she repeats several times and each time she is never wrong). While on a bizarre and ill-fated crusade to promote the work of German ornithologist Martin Schneider-Jacoby, she wrote a letter to author and keen twitcher Franzen out of the blue in 2011, demanding he feature Schneider-Jacoby\u2019s work in an article. Struck by Zink\u2019s brazen letter, Franzen replied and it was to be the beginning of what is surely one of modern literature\u2019s more extraordinary pen-pal relationships. \u201cMy impression was, from what Franzen wrote back, was that he at first thought I was some writer that he knew putting him on and he asked me what name I published under, so he could read my books,\u201d says Zink. \u201cSo I told him that I didn\u2019t have any books, unless you count what I wrote for my friend Avner. My sense at the beginning of our weird correspondence that Franzen seriously thought it was not possible, in this day and age, for any good writer to fall through the cracks and not be published.\u201d She says it was a strange feeling to suddenly find her writing, which had been purely a private, amusing exercise between her and Shats for over a decade, suddenly garner praise from any native English speaker, let alone a literary giant such as Franzen. Yet, Zink is honest \u2013 from the beginning it was a relationship marked as much by melodrama as mutual admiration. She adds: \u201cAt first Franzen refused to believe that I was writing seriously, so I told him \u2018well actually I do have a backlog of finished manuscripts\u2019 but it\u2019s not like he asked to see them. He just said \u2018well they\u2019re probably that arty crap that nobody wants to publish, so write something sellable and get back to me.\u2019 I am so grateful to him but it was a real conflict between us at times.\u201d In a bid to prove her worth as a writer to Franzen, she started work on her first book for an audience other than Shats in the autumn of 2011, though again without any expectation of it being published. \u201cI was so tired of Franzen saying that I should take myself seriously as a writer and I wanted to make very clear that there\u2019s a very clear distinction between taking your career seriously and taking your writing seriously,\u201d says Zink. \u201cSo I wrote the first part of a new novel, called The Wallcreeper, in just four days to show him that I knew what I was doing as a writer. And it was so unlike anything that I\u2019d written before because I hadn\u2019t written it for Avner.\u201d After she sent all her old manuscripts to Franzen in early 2012, the author took it upon himself to attempt to sell her 1998 novel, Sailing Towards The Sunset by Avner Shats, to publishers, judging the commercial potential to be better than that of The Wallcreeper. While he may be one of America\u2019s most lauded contemporary authors, Franzen proved less apt as a lone literary agent. In January 2013, the pair met up in California for a spot of birdwatching (while Zink is not a twitcher like Franzen, she says she likes birds \u201cjust fine\u201d) and Franzen conceded he had failed to get any small publishers interested in her novel. \u201cFor most writers you\u2019d think this would be a dream come true but actually after about a year of Jonathan Franzen trying to be my agent and failing, I ended up feeling sorry for him\u201d says Zink, laughing. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I wrote Mislaid because I thought, \u2018this poor guy he\u2019s trying to sell this really weird novel, so I\u2019ll write something with a little bit more commercial potential and make his life easier\u2019. I hated watching him suffer \u2013 particularly because he\u2019s so good at suffering.\u201d For a career that had moved at a glacial pace for several decades, things changed very quickly for Zink once she had completed Mislaid in late 2013. Franzen gave up on his own attempts to single-handedly get Zink published and passed it to his own literary agent, who almost immediately sold the book for a six-figure sum to a US publisher and HarperCollins in the UK. While Mislaid is labelled as Zink\u2019s official debut, the buzz around her as an author has been considerably helped, not just by having Franzen as a champion, but also by the US publication of The Wallcreeper, her story of a highly dysfunctional couple who move from Philadelphia to Switzerland, released in October last year by an independent micropress project called Dorothy. For a book by a tiny independent press, it has done astonishingly well- recent reviews from the New York Times called it \u201cheady and rambunctious...[it] bucks easy summary with such force it feels like a fool\u2019s errand to try corralling it for a review\u201d, while Dazed and Confused named it their best book of 2014, praising her uncompromising outlook on everything from marriage to sex. It is due to be published in the UK this July, closely behind Mislaid. Despite already being in the process of writing another novel about \u201ccrusty old punks\u2019, Zink still can\u2019t seem to get over her genuine bewilderment that anyone other than an Israeli poet living in Tel Aviv should want to read her works. In another email following our conversation, she expresses concern she may have \u201ctorpedoed\u201d herself in the interview. I admit the 10-minute interlude discussing sex was unconventional, as was the follow-up naked picture. But for an author who defies classification at every turn, frankly I would have been disappointed at anything less.

When people say chuzos, they think about 79th Street.\u201d (A chuzo is Colombia\u2019s answer to the kebab.) On the internet, however, Los Chuzos \u2013 a 24-year-old grilled meat and fresh juice counter owned by Casta\u00f1o\u2019s brother \u2013 wears a cloak of modern anonymity: it\u2019s not on Google Maps. The same is true of J&amp;C Delicias, a Colombian restaurant a few steps down 79th Street, and Jeri\u2019s Shim Myung Do, a martial arts school one block east. Olympya Beauty Salon, on Roosevelt off 78th Street, doesn\u2019t have any internet footprint at all. This neighbourhood, Jackson Heights, is a place where the commercial landscape confounds the vast reach of internet cartography. Many regular storefront businesses on Roosevelt Avenue are hard or impossible to find online. The challenge increases for the tax advisers, lawyers and medical professionals on the second or third floors. It goes without saying that any off-the-books establishment, from a taco cart or a sidewalk clothier to the truly illegal trades like drugs and prostitution, leaves little trace on the web. This divergence would have been unremarkable only a few years ago. But in that time, the internet\u2019s geospatial resources, or the \u201cgeoweb\u201d, have developed enough intricacy, sophistication and responsiveness to become an indispensable consumer tool. Just as, in an earlier generation of the internet, Craigslist obliterated the utility of printed classified ads, so the geoweb has supplanted road maps, restaurant guides and the Yellow Pages. Whether you want a pizza or a plumber, your search likely begins on a keyboard or touchscreen. In short, we now use the geoweb as though it were a perfect reflection of our world: 97% of US internet users, according to Google, look for local products and services online. A closer look, though, reveals that our digital mirror bears chinks and subtle distortions. Some businesses exploit loopholes to advance their virtual prominence. Others are obscured through their own ignorance. Still others don\u2019t appear on the internet at all.  That information bias permeates the internet is not news, of course. The amount of indexed Google Maps content per person is as much as 100 times greater in Scandinavia than in the Middle East or Central America; Tokyo has more geospatial data than Africa.     A busy retail street in Accra, Ghana. There is more geospatial digital data available for the city of Tokyo than for all of Africa. Photograph: Ulrich Doering/Alamy    But this effect is also evident within a city. Search Paris under Yelp\u2019s \u201chotwords\u201d program for brasserie, and you\u2019ll fine a virtual absence of the word in peripheral residential neighbourhoods like the 15th and 20th arrondissements. Google reveals those neighbourhoods to be as flush with steak-frites as any \u2013 but gourmands aren\u2019t writing about them online. Even in places where companies like Yelp, Bing and Google portray the commercial streetscape with perfect precision, search results are shaped by algorithms; the geoweb responds to each query with a fresh and limited permutation from its index. A husband and wife can receive different suggestions for Chinese food based not only on their choice of search engine, but their own search history. In effect, they see two different cities \u2013 try it with a friend! \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a true map,\u201d says Mark Graham, a senior research fellow at Oxford Internet Institute. \u201cEvery single map is a misrepresentation of the world, every single map is partial, every single map is selective. And every single map tells a particular story from a particular perspective.\u201d Because online maps are in constant flux, though, it\u2019s hard to plumb the bias in the cartography. Graham has found that the language of a Google search shapes the results, producing different interpretations of Bangkok and Tel Aviv for different residents. \u201cThe biggest problem is that we don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything we\u2019re getting is filtered through Google\u2019s black box, and it\u2019s having a huge impact not just on what we know, but where we go, and how we move through a city.\u201d As an example of the mapmaker\u2019s authority, Matt Zook, a collaborator of Graham\u2019s who teaches at the University of Kentucky, demonstrated what happens when you perform a Google search for abortion: you\u2019re led not just to abortion clinics and services but to organisations that campaign against it. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge power within Google Maps to just make some things visible and some things less visible,\u201d he notes. Last year, Google researchers found that only 55% of small businesses in the US had a website, while 19% had no online presence at all. With its new platform Google My Business, the company hopes to make it easier for small businesses to establish themselves online. Claiming or adding an online business listing is as simple as searching for it and verifying by phone or post.  \u201cBusinesses who are in big cities sometimes think that they can get most of their business from foot traffic, that their customer will walk past the store every day,\u201d says James Croom, head of marketing for Google My Business. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to a lot of them, and sometimes their view is, \u2018Well, actually, I don\u2019t need a website. I don\u2019t need to get online because people just walk down the street and find me.\u201d  The data in the large says otherwise. The 97% of internet users who search for local shops and services are acting on the results. Three-quarters of mobile searches trigger \u201cfollow-up actions\u201d like more research, a phone call or a visit \u2014 two per search, on average. Fully half of smartphone users visit a store within a day of their search (on PCs and tablets, it\u2019s slightly over a third). \u201cEffectively, every consumer \u2013 especially in urban areas \u2013 is using digital search to find businesses,\u201d says Damian Rollison, a vice president at Universal Business Listing, a company that helps small businesses increase their online presence. Failure in the digital realm can beget real-world losses. In Virginia, a former restaurateur who doesn\u2019t own a computer sued Google, unsuccessfully, after discovering that his listing had mistakenly said he was closed on the weekends. That restaurant, the Serbian Crown, closed last year \u2013 a victim of online sabotage, its owner insists, a claim that was in no way substantiated by the judge. Because a business can live or die on the strength of its digital footprint, a whole industry has emerged to offer what\u2019s called \u201clocal search engine optimisation\u201d. SEO Works, an Australian company, charges $1,990 (\u00a31,315) for a four-week \u201cGoogle Maps package,\u201d with a subsequent maintenance plan for $1,190 (\u00a3787). There are simpler options, too: the start-up Moz Local will maintain an online listing for $84 (\u00a355) a year, updating basic information such as opening hours on Google or Yelp. (For the record, it is free for businesses to claim and tend these listings themselves \u2013 and just as easy on Yelp or Apple as on Google.) As the influence of the geoweb grows, so does its appeal to transgressors. In January 2014, someone hijacked thousands of local hotel listings, redirecting them to the hotel-booking website Roomstobook.info (and two others with similar names). Companies like charter buses, teeth whiteners, cosmetic surgeons and strip clubs caught posting fake reviews have settled with state governments for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Certain industries have particularly low reputations. Local lawyers have proved notorious for hijacking local searches, providing misleading information to increase their digital prominence. \u201cIf you dig into these results what you\u2019ll find is that half of them have fake names and a third of them aren\u2019t really located where they say they are,\u201d says Mike Blumenthal, a local SEO consultant.  Abusive florists were weeded out, while the locksmith industry was an offender on such a scale that at one point, Rollison says, Google banned the keyword \u201clocksmith\u201d. In early 2009, there were so many fake listings (linked, in turn, to just a few telephone numbers) that midtown-Manhattan appeared to be home to nearly a thousand locksmiths \u2013 20 shops on one block of 34th Street alone.     Greenwich locksmiths. Photograph: Scott Lynch/FlickrVision    Consultants spend their days probing search algorithms to maximise their customers\u2019 exposure. But the blend of factors in a local search, on the side of both supply (quality of reviews, accuracy of a listing) and demand (geographic proximity, search history), make it a formidable field of study.  And what of those businesses, such as the Exotic Hair Salon on 76th Street off Roosevelt Avenue, that are completely digitally invisible? The owners and stylists, a pair of immigrants from Colombia and Honduras, did not seem perturbed by this state of affairs, and why should they be? The shop is busy, their customers are regulars, and they come in every week. You could perceive this part of Queens, then, as the muddled frontier of technology\u2019s domain. And perhaps the slow adoption of internet business strategies here isn\u2019t a sign of the weakness of virtual connections, but the strength of real-world ties: routine, word-of-mouth referrals, friendship, proximity, street presence, and so on.  Besides, it\u2019s not as if owners and customers here live in the recent past, finding their way on pocket street guides. Carlos Casta\u00f1a, the manager of Los Chuzos, hasn\u2019t gotten around to setting up a website for the restaurant \u2013 but he has no illusions about the influence of the virtual world. \u201cEverything happens on here,\u201d he said, holding up his iPhone. Except, perhaps, finding a place to have lunch.  This article was amended on 8 January 2015. An earlier version stated that listings can only be verified on Google Maps by post, and that the Serbian Crown\u2019s lawsuit was ongoing.

But she had some information that she had to tell someone. Her stepdaughter, a 14-year-old pupil at Royal Palm Beach high school, had told a friend that she\u2019d had sex with a middle-aged man who gave her money. The man was said to have a long face and bushy eyebrows and he lived in a big house at the end of a dead-end street. His name was Jeff. A teacher found $300 in the 14-year-old\u2019s purse.  That call to police \u2013 made 10 years ago this March \u2013 soon led Florida detectives to 358 El Brillo Way, a mansion owned by Jeffrey Epstein, one of America\u2019s wealthiest hedge fund tycoons. A decade later, the cascade of FBI investigations, secret plea deals and lawsuits which followed that telephone call would be felt 4,000 miles away, behind the gates of Buckingham Palace. The connecting thread was Epstein, now 61, a convicted sex offender and one-time friend of Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. The allegation: that Epstein forced another of his teenage victims into sexual encounters with Andrew on three separate occasions. The accusation, contained in a court filing first reported by the Guardian and Politico, has become headline news across the world this week, even as it was forcefully and repeatedly denied by the Palace.  It has thrown a spotlight on Andrew\u2019s relationship with Epstein and resurfaced questions over whether the disgraced financier used his extraordinary wealth and power to elude justice.  There is no suggestion Andrew ever encountered the 14-year-old \u2013 referred to in police incident reports as \u2018SG\u2019 \u2013 whose stepmother\u2019s call to police triggered the initial investigation into Epstein in 2005.  SG told detectives that Epstein had made her remove her clothes and give him a massage while he masturbated, according to a police report.  Within weeks the FBI was listening to Epstein\u2019s calls, rifling through his trash and searching for other potential victims. They eventually identified around 40.  Assistant US attorney Ann Marie Villafa\u00f1a relayed a summary of the investigation to Epstein\u2019s counsel in a letter in 2007.     Jeffrey Epstein in custody in West Palm Beach, Florida, in 2008. Photograph: Uma Sanghvi/AP    \u201cMr Epstein, through his assistants, would recruit underage females to travel to his home in Palm Beach to engage in lewd conduct in exchange for money,\u201d it said. She added that some of the girls were expected to strip naked and give massages to Epstein while he masturbated, while others had full intercourse with the financier. \u201cSome of those victims went to Mr Epstein\u2019s home only once,\u201d Villafa\u00f1a\u2019s letter added. \u201cSome went there as many as 100 times or more.\u201d One of those girls, referred to by police as AH, told detectives she was recruited by an associate of Epstein who overheard her tell a friend in a clothing store that she could not afford a holiday. She claimed the erotic massages also led to Epstein asking her to engage sexually with an eastern European woman, Nada Marcinkova \u2013 a female member of his entourage allegedly bought from her parents in eastern Europe as a teenager \u2013 while he watched. AH told detectives of her reluctance to go further than erotic massages with Epstein, who she said gave her $1,000 and a car. However, she recounted one incident during which Epstein \u201cbent me over the table and put himself in me\u201d without her permission. AH said Epstein stopped after she screamed \u2018no\u2019, but she was so sore after the incident that she had difficulty walking to her car. When police eventually raided Epstein\u2019s mansion, they discovered one of AH\u2019s high school transcripts along with a container of peach flavoured \u201cJoy Jelly\u201d lubricant and Amazon receipts for explicit books such as Slave Craft: Roadmap For Erotic Servitude Principles. There were dozens of stories from potential victims like AH and SG. An attorney who advised Epstein at the time said prosecutors did not believe AH to be credible.  But the accounts from around 40 Florida girls who said they were molested by Epstein were numerous and overlapping. Despite this, the US government eventually agreed to allow Epstein to plead guilty to just one count of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl under Florida state law. In the end, he served just 13 months of an 18-month jail sentence.  The circumstances that led up to that secret plea agreement have proved an enduring controversy. Epstein agreed not to contest civil claims brought by the 40 women identified by the FBI, but escaped a prosecution that could have seen him jailed for the rest of his life. Prosecutors agreed not to bring far more serious federal charges against Epstein, and not to charge \u201cpotential co-conspirators\u201d, including Marcinova and three other named individuals. Clearly, prosecutors had questions about the credibility of some of the teenage witnesses \u2013 doubts that were exacerbated when Epstein\u2019s lawyers and private investigators dug up dirt on their Myspace and Facebook pages. Yet Michael Reiter, the former Palm Beach police chief, believed Epstein had received \u201cvery unusual\u201d treatment in the deal, negotiated between officials in the US Department of Justice and a fleet of the best lawyers money could buy.  In a six-year legal battle, which is still ongoing, lawyers for some of those victims are challenging the plea agreement, which they say was negotiated without their knowledge and therefore violated their rights as victims.  At the very least, documents released through litigation suggest prosecutors cooperated with Epstein\u2019s lawyers to keep the deal under wraps. Using her personal Gmail account, for example, Villafa\u00f1a proposed to one of Epstein\u2019s lawyers that they could file associated legal papers in a different jurisdiction, a move she said \u201cwill hopefully cut the press coverage significantly\u201d. Villafa\u00f1a declined to comment on that email this week.  Epstein\u2019s adversaries have long suspected that the hedge fund manager somehow used his influence to lobby for a \u201csweetheart\u201d deal with prosecutors that protected him and his associates from serving significant jail time. No evidence has been publicly unearthed to substantiate that theory, although Epstein\u2019s private contacts book, seized by police, leaves no doubt he was once supremely well-connected.  There is no suggestion any of the individuals named in the book participated in or knew of Epstein\u2019s abuse of minors, or were involved in any effort to pressure prosecutors. But Epstein\u2019s contacts book \u2013 seen by the Guardian \u2013 reads like a directory of the world\u2019s global elite. Under the letter B alone are listed Tony Blair, Michael Bloomberg, and Richard Branson. Elsewhere there are multiple contacts \u2013 typically at offices, homes, and via aides\u2019 mobile phones \u2013 for Bill Clinton, Rupert Murdoch, Donald Trump, Dustin Hoffman, Naomi Campbell, and dozens of other A-listers.  The name that appears on page 31, opposite an entry for Formula 1 chief executive Bernie Ecclestone, looks innocuous alongside the directory of world-renowned figures. Epstein had 16 separate telephone numbers listed for this particular friend: Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. The Prince Andrew connection     Prince Andrew. Photograph: Hugh Routledge/Rex    Of all Epstein\u2019s glamorous and influential friends, none has had their reputation as tarnished by their association with the disgraced financier as badly as the Queen\u2019s second son. The prince\u2019s relationship with the playboy hedge fund manager had for years been cited as evidence of his poor judgment and it contributed, three years ago, to the termination of Andrew\u2019s cherished role as an official UK trade envoy. Andrew and Epstein made curious acquaintances. While Andrew benefited from the privilege bestowed by a British royal title, Epstein\u2019s ascent is a classic American success story. He was born in a rough Brooklyn neighbourhood, and never obtained a college degree. In 1976, he was plucked from a seemingly ordinary life as a mathematics teacher at a Manhattan private school in 1976 and given a job at the investment bank Bear Stearns. Within six years he was working on his own, managing the portfolios of an exclusive \u2013 and secret \u2013 club of plutocrats said to only include billionaires. The scale of Epstein\u2019s own net worth has long been a mystery, although the financier made little effort to conceal how he was spending his fortune.  Epstein became a major philanthropist, spending millions on science projects at Harvard University, and was famous for his extravagant parties. He was a modern-day Great Gatsby, bringing together film stars, property magnates and political leaders.  Andrew reportedly met Epstein in the 1990s after being introduced by Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the the media mogul Robert Maxwell. At the time, Ghislaine Maxwell was the financier\u2019s girlfriend.  The friendship returned to haunt Andrew this week courtesy of one the dozens of women the FBI identified as one Epstein\u2019s potential victims: Virginia Roberts. Like many of the other teenagers, Roberts sued Epstein; the civil claim she lodged in a Florida court six years ago told a familiar story of exploitation.  Roberts was working for $9 an hour as a changing room assistant at Trump\u2019s Mar-A-Lago beach club, where her father was a maintenance manager, when she claims she was recruited to work as a masseuse for Epstein. She claims the invitation came courtesy of Maxwell. It was 1998, and Roberts was 15 years old. Her civil suit, in which Roberts is referred to as Jane Doe 102, alleged that Ghislaine Maxwell, now 53, and Epstein quickly began grooming her for sex. Despite being told by Epstein, on the cusp of her 16th birthday, that \u201che would soon have to trade her in because she was getting too old\u201d, Roberts alleged she was thrust into a life of sexual servitude that lasted until 2002, when she fled to Thailand aged 19. But in one important way Roberts\u2019 allegations differ from those of many of the other Florida teenage girls who say they were victims of Epstein. Her lawsuit states that she was co-opted into Epstein\u2019s inner-circle, flown by private jet to his ranch in New Mexico, his Caribbean island, and his 51,000-square-foot mansion in New York, reputedly the largest residence in Manhattan. During the four years she claimed to have been a fixture in Epstein\u2019s hedonistic world, she claimed she saw Epstein and his close associates abuse women from across the world, including three French 12-year-olds who she alleged were sent to him as a birthday present. That lawsuit did not identify any alleged perpetrators other than Maxwell and Epstein. But Roberts\u2019 lawsuit did imply there was more to her story. One elliptical reference alleged that Epstein \u201crequired\u201d her to be sexually exploited by \u201cpoliticians, academicians, businessmen\u201d. These men were described in the document as Epstein\u2019s \u201cadult male peers, including royalty\u201d. Epstein and Roberts settled the lawsuit out of court, with Epstein paying Roberts \u2013 just as he paid a series of other girls who were suing him \u2013 an undisclosed sum in compensation.  Her cryptic allegation about \u201croyalty\u201d may never have been clarified were it not for the 13-page document submitted to Florida\u2019s southern district last week. That court filing related to the long-running lawsuit in which lawyers for some of the victims are challenging Epstein\u2019s controversial plea deal. It was being brought by two women, Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2. Roberts\u2019s lawyers wanted her and another woman \u2013 listed as Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 \u2013 to be added as new plaintiffs. The document briefly argued the case \u2013 and summarised the two women\u2019s allegations. That summary elaborated on the claims that Roberts had made, in her 2009 lawsuit, about being loaned out by Epstein to rich and powerful men.  The court filing alleged that Epstein forced Roberts \u201cto have sexual relations\u201d on three separate occasions with \u201ca member of the British Royal Family, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York)\u201d. The encounters are alleged to have happened in New York, at Maxwell\u2019s London home and in the US Virgin Islands as part of an \u201corgy with numerous other under-aged girls\u201d. Referred to as a \u201cminor\u201d in the document, Roberts is understood to have been aged 17 at the time she alleges the encounters took place. Epstein allegedly instructed Roberts \u201cto give the prince whatever he required\u201d and report back on the details of \u201cthe sexual abuse\u201d.  \u201cEpstein\u2019s purposes in \u2018lending\u2019 Jane Doe (along with other young girls) to such powerful people were to ingratiate himself with them for business, personal, political, and financial gain,\u201d the document alleged, \u201cas well as to obtain potential blackmail information\u201d. Strenuous denials  The Guardian contacted Buckingham Palace on Thursday last week, a day before it intended to publish its first article about the allegations about Andrew. That evening a Palace spokesperson emailed a reporter, declining the opportunity to respond. \u201cThe Royal Household would never comment on an ongoing legal matter,\u201d she said.     Buckingham Palace has been employing staff on zero-hours contracts. Photograph: David Noton Photography/Alamy    After the Guardian published the article, however, there was a dramatic reversal from the Palace, which issued the first in what turned out to be a flurry of statements forcefully denying the allegations as \u201ccategorically untrue\u201d. The Palace later again denied \u201cany form of sexual contact or relationship\u201d between Andrew and Roberts, adding: \u201cThe allegations made are false and without any foundation.\u201d Maxwell also dismissed the allegations, which she said were \u201cnot new and have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue\u201d. The statement released on her behalf added: \u201cGhislaine Maxwell\u2019s original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same.\u201d Yet by then British newspapers were delving back into the story, republishing interviews Roberts had given in 2011 in which she detailed her encounters with Andrew but stopped short of alleging sexual contact.     Virginia Roberts, centre, with Prince Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell. Photograph: PR    The stories were accompanied by a photograph, said to have been taken in 2001 at Maxwell\u2019s London home, where Roberts alleged her first sexual encounter with the prince occurred. The image showed Andrew grinning with his arm around the 17-year-old\u2019s midriff; Maxwell, also smiling, is in the background.  That image raises obvious questions for Andrew. Yet the strength of the denials issued by the Palace this week has not been matched by a willingness to address the details of the allegations made by Roberts. The Palace has declined to say, for example, why Andrew was in the company of a 17-year-old masseuse working for Epstein at Maxwell\u2019s home. The Palace also refuses to answer questions about Andrew\u2019s friendship with Epstein, or confirm the several occasions the two men appear to have partied together. Those reported encounters between Epstein and Andrew, some of which appear to be corroborated by flight logs for Epstein\u2019s private planes, which have been reviewed by the Guardian, stretch back more than a decade. They include parties at Windsor Castle and Sandringham, the Queen\u2019s Norfolk estate, an exclusive dinner in St Tropez and a holiday in Thailand when Andrew was pictured on a yacht surrounded by topless women. Indeed, the Palace has never offered a public explanation for Andrew\u2019s most controversial meeting with Epstein, which occurred in New York in 2011. That was two years after Epstein had been released from prison. He was, by then, a registered sex offender, and though some celebrities were still willing to be seen with him, he\u2019d been abandoned by many of the more influential figures he previously called his friends. Andrew\u2019s face-to-face meeting with Epstein might have remained secret had the pair not decided to go for a stroll in Central Park, where they were photographed by a tabloid newspaper.  Court cases  In the days since Roberts\u2019s allegations were made public, pressure has mounted on Andrew to provide a more detailed explanation of the extent and nature of his friendship with Epstein. That is partly because of the strategy adopted by another prominent figure, Harvard lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who faced similar accusations from Roberts in the same court filing. Dershowitz\u2019s denials were just as emphatic as those emanating from the Palace. But they were also considerably more detailed. Dershowitz also submitted himself to questioning from journalists \u2013 including five telephone conversations with the Guardian \u2013 and vowed to fight the allegations in court.  By Tuesday he had launched a legal bid to formally strike the \u201coutrageous and impertinent\u201d claims about him containing in court filing, promised imminent defamation proceedings against Roberts and her lawyers, in both US and English courts, and submitted a sworn affidavit denying the accusations.     Attorney and law professor Alan Dershowitz discusses allegations of sex with an underage girl levelled against him, during an interview at his home in Miami Beach. Photograph: Andrew Innerarity/Reuters    \u201cIf they\u2019re innocent, they should do what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Dershowitz told the Guardian when asked if others accused by Roberts should follow suit. \u201cYou can\u2019t do what I\u2019m doing unless you\u2019re 100% certain of your innocence.\u201d Dershowitz quickly added that someone in Andrew\u2019s position may be innocent and decide it \u201cwould be undignified to respond\u201d in the same way. Yet the aggressive legal strategy adopted by Dershowitz, a renowned criminal attorney who once served on the legal team advising OJ Simpson \u2013 who has occasionally written opinion pieces for the Guardian \u2013 raises the stakes for all involved. Roberts\u2019 lawyers appear willing to meet Dershowitz head on, filing their own, counter-defamation suit against the Harvard lawyer. Both sides are on a collision course, apparently determined to see the dispute resolved in court. That opens the possibility that Roberts \u2013 and, perhaps, Andrew \u2013 could be called as witnesses.  It is just one of several civil proceedings that could results in Roberts taking the stand. Her lawyers are believed to be considering whether to submit a criminal complaint in the US Virgin Islands or London, a move that could trigger a fresh criminal investigation. French model scout There was one name in Roberts\u2019 court filing that escaped the public attention heaped on others: Jean Luc Brunel. Brunel, who is French and in his 60s, is the co-founder of of MC2 Model Management, a Miami-based modelling agency with offices in New York and Tel Aviv. A well-known model scout since the 1970s, Brunel is credited with launching the careers of Milla Jovovich, Christy Turlington and Sharon Stone.  But his career has sometimes been marred by controversy. A CBS 60 Minutes documentary once accused Brunel of sexually exploiting young women, an allegation he denied. But Brunel\u2019s close friendship with Epstein has never been in doubt. The model scout\u2019s name appears frequently in the flight logs kept for Epstein\u2019s private jets and prison records show he visited Epstein 67 times when he was in jail.  The 30 December court filing relaying Roberts\u2019 allegations, however, went further than the innuendo that has occasionally surrounded Brunel\u2019s friendship with Epstein. It explicitly alleged that Epstein was effectively exploiting Brunel\u2019s access to young women for the purposes of sex trafficking. \u201cHe would bring young girls (ranging to ages as young as twelve) to the United States for sexual purposes and farm them out to his friends, especially Epstein,\u201d the filing states. \u201cBrunel would offer the girls \u2018modeling\u2019 jobs. Many of the girls came from poor countries or impoverished backgrounds, and he lured them in with a promise of making good money.\u201d Roberts alleged she was forced to have sex with Brunel, too, and was made to \u201cobserve\u201d the French model scout engaging in \u201csexual acts with dozens of underage girls\u201d. The Guardian made repeated attempts to contact Brunel to afford him the opportunity to respond to the allegations of impropriety, including those contained in the 30 December court filing. He did not respond.  Unimaginable luxury  Whatever the truth of the allegations, Epstein\u2019s friendship with Brunel certainly gave him access to the glamorous world of international modelling. It chimed with Epstein\u2019s reputation, cultivated through the early 2000s, as an international playboy with an intercontinental property portfolio, his own Gulfstream II and Boeing 727, a profile in Vanity Fair, and an apparently loyal coterie of beautiful young women. \u201cI\u2019ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,\u201d Donald Trump told New York magazine in October 2002. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d However, when it came to female associates, the evidence now suggests Epstein cultivated two separate spheres that rarely overlapped.  One \u2013 restricted to a small group of women co-opted as permanent fixtures in Epstein\u2019s entourage \u2013 was rooted in that world of almost unimaginable luxury. The other comprised working-class Palm Beach teenagers who told police they were enticed into giving massages and sometimes more at Epstein\u2019s mansion with the promise of cash.  Lawyers for SG, the 14-year-old whose stepmother initially triggered the investigation into Epstein, for example, accused Epstein in a lawsuit of cynically seeking out \u201ceconomically disadvantaged underage girls\u201d who would be \u201cless likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of improper conduct were made\u201d. Conflicting accounts The story SG told police back in 2005 became grimly familiar. A rebellious type hailing from Palm Beach\u2019s grittier west side, she told detectives she was recruited by Haley Robson, an 18-year-old working for Epstein. Robson, one of the four named \u201cpotential co-conspirators\u201d who were shielded from prosecution under Epstein\u2019s plea agreement, told police she was \u201clike a Heidi Fleiss\u201d, the notorious Hollywood \u201cmadam\u201d who claimed to procure women for rich and influential men in the movie industry. Teenagers told police that after being transported to the mansion by Robson, they were met by another aide, Sarah Kellen, another named \u201cpotential co-conspirator\u201d in the plea deal. A chef would often make them something to eat. Then, after being led by Kellen past walls adorned by pictures of naked women, they would arrive at an upstairs room where paid-for massages would allegedly descend into sexual abuse.      Jeffrey Epstein amassed a fortune while managing the portfolios of some of America\u2019s richest. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features    Reached on the telephone this week, Robson declined to discuss what she called \u201call the Epstein stuff\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve moved past all that,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a child now. I\u2019m not interested in speaking about it.\u201d Guy Fronstin, an attorney for Epstein, told police during the 2005 investigation that there had been a horrible misunderstanding. His client was simply \u201cpassionate about massages\u201d, Fronstin said, pointing to a $100,000 donation to the Florida state ballet to pay for massage therapy. \u201cThe massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound for him,\u201d Fronstin said. \u201cThat is why he has had many massages.\u201d That explanation stood in contrast to the account of Alfredo Rodriguez, a former housekeeper at the Palm Beach mansion, who told police that \u201che felt there was a lot more going on than just massages\u201d given the cleanup operation that typically awaited him afterwards.  Rodriguez\u2019s credibility as a witness was undermined after he was convicted for trying to sell a stolen copy of Epstein\u2019s contact book to lawyers for some of the young girls.  Prior to that, he had described Epstein\u2019s guests as \u201cvery young\u201d and explained how he was ordered to keep at least $2,000 in cash on him at all times to pay for Epstein\u2019s twice-daily massages. He felt like a \u201chuman ATM\u201d, he told police. Rodriguez said he once had to deliver a dozen red roses to AG at school. Epstein showed a different level of reward to the few who were permitted access to his inner circle.  If Roberts\u2019 allegations are to believed, she was one of them. Another was Johanna Sjoberg, who alleges she was also recruited by Maxwell, when she was a student in Palm Beach, and became captivated by the luxurious lifestyle. \u201cI made a pact with the devil in exchange for excitement and glamour,\u201d Sjoberg told an interviewer in 2007. Like Roberts, Sjoberg spoke of being persuaded to progress from a routine massage to more intimate activity. She said Epstein flew her to the Caribbean retreat, advising there would be \u201csex stuff\u201d going on.  Sjoberg, who was already in her early 20s and has said she was surprised at allegations involving Epstein and underage girls, later visited his New York mansion. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up poor,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I realised there was more money there than I could ever have imagined.\u201d  Epstein\u2019s flight logs show that he took frequent trips to the island with named girls such as Roberts and Sjoberg. According to one account provided by Roberts, Sjoberg was present during her second encounter with Andrew, in New York. Roberts and Sjoberg are both crucial witnesses in the whole saga. The pair are among the very few of the few alleged Palm Beach victims to cross over into Epstein\u2019s other world, a place where his chosen women were ferried around the world in the company of presidents and princes. Sjoberg, now 35 and running a beauty salon, declined this week to talk further about her experiences.  Roberts is now 30, a mother of three, and married. Since the contents of her lawyers\u2019 court filing was made public last week, she is believed to have gone into hiding in Colorado. Her only public statement about the affair was the one she issued to the Guardian after Maxwell, Dershowitz and the Andrew issued their fervent denials. \u201cI am looking forward to vindicating my rights as an innocent victim and pursuing all available recourse,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be bullied back into silence.\u201d To contact the authors of this story email paul.lewis@theguardian.com or jon.swaine@theguardian.com", "publicationDate": "2015-01-10T13:14:48Z", "title": "Jeffrey Epstein: inside the decade of scandal entangling Prince Andrew", "sentences": ["Brunel, who is French and in his 60s, is the co-founder of of MC2 Model Management, a Miami-based modelling agency with offices in New York and Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/10/jeffrey-epstein-decade-scandal-prince-andrew"}, {"tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Experimental music", "World music"], "article": "Morocco: Hafida \u2013 Ayan Dar Illa Zine There are some cracking videos of the Berber pop star and wedding singer Raissa Hafida out there \u2013 it\u2019s well worth watching her in full flow with her super laid-back all-female backing band.

It sounds completely unlike the hyper-powered, ear-boggling music of Sadat and Fifty; this Egyptian synthpop act who, well we have absolutely no idea. All we have is these two anonymous, lugubrious, romantic, Europhile cold-wave tracks that reference Victrola and Dazzle Ships era OMD.

Lebanon: Mazen Kerbaj \u2013 Starry Night At the end of last year I made the rash and bombastic claim that noise artist 20.SV had created the most terrifying sounding piece of Lebanese sound art, which caused a colleague to remind me that I was perhaps forgetting about Mazen Kerbaj\u2019s Starry Night (a short excerpt of which you can hear below). I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need (or indeed any scientific way) to prove which one is genuinely the more frightening, but in its entirety, Kerbaj\u2019s piece of improvised music will chill you to the core. This multi-disciplinarian artist recorded himself playing an improvised duet on trumpet with the sound of Israeli bombs that were falling near to where he lived on 16 July 2006 \u2013 the effect is nothing short of stunning. Probably more disturbing than the sound of the bombs themselves, is the unexpected noise of a symphony of car alarms set off by the attack.

The statue\u2019s disproportionately tiny head, topped with its disarmingly jaunty military hat, looks almost comical. Called Homage to Captain Dreyfus, it was created in 1986 by the political satirist Louis Mitelberg, known as TIM, and intended for the courtyard of Paris\u2019s \u00c9cole Militaire, the official headquarters of the French army. It was there that Alfred Dreyfus, convicted of treason, was subject to a military humiliation in 1895, his insignia ripped from his uniform and his sword broken in front of a crowd of thousands of jeering Parisians shouting \u201cDeath to the Jews!\u201d But in 1986, the army, whose upper echelons still contained officers unwilling to accept Dreyfus\u2019s 1906 rehabilitation, was not amused by the bitterly mocking tone of Mitelberg\u2019s bronze soldier, standing to attention at the behest of an army of fools. With the backing of President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, the army refused to accept the statue when it was completed, and it languished in storage until it was erected two years later in the Tuileries gardens. There, with pleasing historical symmetry, it was placed within spitting distance of the statue of another famous French Jew, three times prime minister Leon Blum. But in 1994, Dreyfus, or at least his statue, was moved again, this time to the Place Pierre Lafue, off the Boulevard Raspail, where it still stands. It is regularly daubed with offensive graffiti, a reminder that antisemitism still thrives even in the smartest and most sophisticated of Parisian enclaves. A full size replica of the statue stands in the courtyard of Paris\u2019s Museum of Jewish Art and History. The irony of the statue\u2019s peregrinations stands as a metaphor, albeit an imperfect one, for the situation of France\u2019s Jews today: facing regular episodes of antisemitic violence, but caught between a fear of what future exists for Jews in their beloved country and a confidence that the French Republic, whose values they have embraced, will keep them safe. After last week\u2019s atrocious events in Paris, which claimed the lives of 17 innocent people including journalists, two policemen and a policewoman, a maintenance worker and four Jewish shoppers at a kosher supermarket, France, home to the largest Jewish population in Europe \u2013 somewhere between 500,000 and 600,000 people \u2013 faces a brutal reckoning about the future of its second largest ethno-religious minority. Figures published in December show that last year, for the first time ever, more Jews moved to Israel from France than from any other country in the world \u2013 around 7,000, or more than 1% of the Jewish population in France \u2013 double the number in 2013. Others left the country for the UK, but also to the US, Canada and elsewhere in Europe. There are no precise figures of how many Jews left France in 2014, since France does not collect census information regarding religion and is surprisingly desultory about data regarding emigration, but it is probably in the region of around 2% of the overall Jewish population, a huge increase on all previous years. This dramatic increase in the number of Jews moving from France to Israel had already become the subject of international discussion before last week \u2013 with some commentators going so far as to invoke the spectre of Fascism during the 1930s. It is almost as though the fate of French Jewry is seen as a cipher for widespread, even existential, fears about the future of Europe itself. While it is emphatically not the case, as one concerned Jewish observer in England tweeted this week, that every single French Jew is working out how to leave, the situation is clearly cause for concern \u2013 not only for Jews but for France, and for Europe as well.    Last year, for the first time ever, more Jews moved to Israel from France than from any other country in the world    The French Jewish population, with its multiple family ties with Israel, is probably the most Zionist of all Jewish communities in the diaspora. During the exodus from French North Africa during the 1950s and 60s, around 300,000 Jews emigrated to France, while a similar number left for Israel. Many families were split, with one sibling heading for each destination. For many Jews in France, Israel is already sort of home. Those who can afford it have bought apartments in seaside towns like Tel Aviv, Netanya, Ra\u2019anana and Hertzliya as holiday homes. Younger adult members of these families can move to Israel straight into the family apartment. A third of the people leaving France for Israel are between 18 and 30, and many have left as much for reasons of employment and economic growth as for antisemitism. There has been a noticeable upswing in the phenomenon known as the \u201cBoeing Aliyah\u201d where a family moves to Israel but the main breadwinner still works in France, commuting to Tel Aviv on Thursday and returning to Paris on Sunday. * * * The history of Jews and France has ebbed and flowed in modern times, with the Jewish entitlement to citizenship being periodically called into question, as happened during the Dreyfus affair. The emancipation of the Jews under Napoleon \u2013 making them the first emancipated Jewish population in Europe \u2013 effectively put in place a contract that required Jews to adopt French culture, values and laws, and limit their religious identity to the private sphere. In return, Jews were given citizenship and equal status under the law. Throughout the 19th century and the first part of the 20th century Jews were identified not as Jews but as Frenchmen \u201cof the Jewish confession\u201d. Even after the dark years of the second world war, which saw 75,000 French Jews deported and murdered, the diminished population of French Jews took their place again as citizens of the country that had invented the Rights of Man, conscious of the unfathomable betrayal of the government and the fact that Jewish identity under Vichy had been racialised. This almost exclusively Ashkenazi Jewish population \u2013 with origins in central and eastern Europe \u2013 experienced an unprecedented demographic surge in the 1950s and 60s, with the arrival of 300,000 Jews from France\u2019s former colonies and protectorates, primarily Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. This immigration boosted not only the number of French Jews but also their confidence; more significantly, it marked the beginning of a subtle evolution in the politics of French-Jewish identity, and of French identity politics in general. As the French empire came to its bloody end in the middle of the century and the demographics of France began to change more than ever before, the revolutionary tradition of the \u201cright to be the same\u201d, politely accepted by the decimated post-Holocaust Jewish population, slowly began to be challenged by the ideology of the \u201cright to be different\u201d. A de facto multiculturalism has now evolved \u2013 and 21st-century France, a nation of multiple ethnicities, faces a distinctive challenge. More than 15 years ago, the historian Paula Hyman wrote, in her book The Jews of Modern France, that \u201chow France and her Jews together negotiate the balance between equality and particularism will determine the contours of Jewish life in France in the 21st century\u201d. That challenge now looks certain to shape all of French life \u2013 and to involve citizens of all faiths, including Islam \u2013 in the years to come. Jews, with a thousand-year history in France, have always been intensely patriotic in upholding the values of La R\u00e9publique; they have often been described as model citizens, accepting and conforming to the peculiarly French ideal of la\u00efcit\u00e9, which insists that the secular rules of the Republic take precedence over religious requirements. From the perspective of British and American multiculturalism, la\u00efcit\u00e9 is almost impossible to understand. When I first came to live in France I was shocked to discover that there was school on Saturday mornings, the traditional day of rest for Jews. (This remained the case until 2007.) What seemed to me to be clearly anti-Jewish discrimination has never been regarded that way in France; it was always accepted by Jews as an integral part of the Republican model, echoing back to the emblematic Napoleonic contract that gave them citizenship. But this allegiance to the Republic, which for Jews is an emblem of freedom and equality, can also become a tool of discrimination and prejudice. Last November the mayor of a town in central France with a small Muslim population announced that schools would no longer provide an alternative meal choice on days when pork was on the menu. The mayor said that he was \u201cnot under any obligation to provide meals in keeping with religious requirements; that is the principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9\u201d \u2013 which was in accordance with a 2011 government circular declaring that the provision of school menus to accommodate religious practices was \u201cneither a right for pupils nor an obligation for local authorities\u201d. Many observers saw the mayor\u2019s gesture as aimed at the local Muslim minority \u2013 proof that the protean nature of la\u00efcit\u00e9 allows it to become a tool of any ideology, from the far left to the far right. It was also a reminder that the abstract ideal of la\u00efcit\u00e9 might be too rigid in the face of social and demographic change.

Photograph: Jacques Brinon/AP    The main target of the racist extreme right today is not Jews but Muslims and immigrants. Old-school French antisemitism, with its nationalism and close association with Catholicism, waned dramatically in the latter part of the 20th century, as did the antisemitism of the far left. Neo-Nazi acts of violence against Jewish targets, such as the 1990 desecration of the Jewish cemetery in Carpentras, have almost entirely disappeared. The leader of the National Front party, Marine Le Pen, has been very careful to distance herself from antisemitism \u2013 though the same cannot be said of her father, Jean-Marie, or her party voters, who surveys indicate have more antisemitic prejudices than average. Meanwhile, President Francois Hollande is the latest in a line of postwar leaders who have gone out of their way to insist that the safety and protection of the Jewish population is a priority. But alongside the decline in traditional antisemitism, there has been a dramatic spike in anti-Jewish violence committed by Muslims since 2000, the year which marked a turning point in the relationship between France\u2019s two largest minority communities, and the two largest Jewish and Muslim populations living side by side outside Israel. (The number of Muslims living in France today is estimated to be around six million, or 8% of the population.) Official figures indicate that over the last two decades the number of antisemitic acts has tripled. Between January and July 2014 official figures show that there were 527 violent antisemitic acts in France as opposed to 276 for the same period in 2013. Meanwhile half of all racist attacks in France take Jews as their target, even though they number less than 1% of the population. Nonna Mayer, an academic at one of France\u2019s most prestigious universities, Sciences Po, describes it as an \u201cexplosion\u201d that dates from the beginning of the second intifada. \u201cThere have been violent and deadly acts, physical damage against synagogues, threats against people wearing a kippa. There is a fear of being seen as Jewish in the public space, graffiti, intimidation \u2013 and it follows very closely what\u2019s going on in the Middle East.\u201d Mayer calls it \u201can antisemitism of contact\u201d that breeds in mixed Arab-Jewish neighbourhoods, such as Paris\u2019s Buttes Chaumont. When I interviewed Mayer in September, she emphasised that such acts are carried out by a tiny minority, but added \u2013 presciently \u2013 that \u201cit\u2019s enough for a very small band of idiots to frighten a whole community\u201d. Joanna, a 37 year old journalist from Paris who asked that her last name not be used, told me this week that she had dreamed of moving to Israel for many years, but only recently begun to consider it seriously. \u201cIn France, for the last several months, even the last few years, there has been a real feeling of despondency about the future.\u201d Her two young children attend a Jewish primary school in a suburb of Paris. \u201cIt changes everything, when you are living every day thinking about your safety and your children\u2019s safety. It\u2019s quite overwhelming taking the children to school now, seeing so many heavily armed policeman and soldiers at the gates.\u201d     Police storm the kosher supermarket in Paris where four Jewish hostages were killed by Amedy Coulibaly. Photograph: Thomas Samson/AFP/Getty Images    Rachel Rimmer lives by the Buttes Chaumont park in Paris\u2019s 19th arrondissement, which gave its name to the terrorist cell to which the perpetrators of last week\u2019s attacks belonged. She still sees France as home. \u201cMy language, my culture, is French.\u201d But she has a sense that the Jewish community, appalled by events and afraid, is turning in on itself. More and more parents are choosing to send their children to Jewish schools, as though they are voluntarily choosing to separate from the wider community. \u201cJews belong in France, as they do in other countries. We have to continue to be part of the dialogue. And we must be able to live normally, at the same time as maintaining our Jewish identity.\u201d She has her children in state schools, but she worries about their future. \u201cThe difficult question we face is will our children know the same freedom that we did growing up Jewish in France?\u201d It has been claimed that up to 50% of French Jews are now \u201cconsidering\u201d moving to Israel (one survey of 2,000 people put the figure at 75%). But Benjamin Castel, a dentist who lives and works not far from Paris \u2013 one of the 99% of French Jews who did not make aliyah last year \u2013 said that \u201cthere\u2019s lots of talk, but most people won\u2019t leave. It\u2019s a way of sticking their heads above the parapet. Some will leave, a few will come back.\u201d Castel is staying put. \u201cI\u2019m totally aware of the fact that there are people in some towns or suburbs who feel that living a Jewish life is impossible where they are. If I were in their position I would leave too. But where I live I don\u2019t feel threatened \u2013 I\u2019ve never personally been the victim of an antisemitic act. I\u2019m an optimist. I trust our government.\u201d * * * The terrible events of last week have put the street violence that characterised the summer of 2014 in the shade. In July, Sarcelles, a modest suburb, or banlieue, outside Paris, became notorious when footage of young men taking part in violent anti-Jewish rioting was broadcast across the globe in response to the Israeli attacks on Gaza. A Jewish-owned pharmacy and a kosher delicatessen were gutted by arson, while a febrile atmosphere took hold in the country\u2019s Jewish population, still haunted by the 2006 kidnapping, torture, and murder of Ilan Halimi; the 2012 killing of a rabbi and three children at a Jewish elementary school in Toulouse; and the murder of four people, by a French citizen, at the Jewish Museum in Brussels in 2013. Sarcelles is a modest 1950s-era suburb half an hour north by suburban train from Paris. One third of the population is Jewish, and one third Muslim; both have their origins in the immigration from north Africa in the 1950s and 60s. Sarcelles today boasts one of the largest populations of Algerian origin in France, both Jewish and Muslim. The neighbourhood known as La Petite J\u00e9rusalem has the highest concentration of Jewish shops, restaurants, schools and synagogues in the greater Paris region. The small shopping centre, dated and a little drab, houses shops including a boutique selling shalwar kameez, a Turkish grocery, a Halal butcher and two large kosher supermarkets, including a branch of Hypercacher, the supermarket that was targeted in last Friday\u2019s attack. On a Wednesday afternoon in early December the shutters of the burnt out pharmacy and delicatessen remained closed, and the Little Jerusalem neighbourhood was subdued. Doubtless it is even more subdued after the events of last week. On Monday morning Bernard Cazeneuve, France\u2019s interior minister, announced that all synagogues and Jewish schools in France will remain under armed military guard for the foreseeable future. In Sarcelles that will make for a formidable military presence. In the 1980s and 1990s, almost 200 years after Clermont Tonnerre declared that \u201cJews should be denied everything as a nation, but granted everything as individuals\u201d, Sarcelles developed into a model for the development of community activity in the public sphere, as its Jewish population began to use communal organisations to express an assertive collective identity in defiance of the republican model of French Jewish citizenship. The town benefited from a policy of decentralisation in favour of local political leadership and from the renown of certain leaders of different ethnic communities, as well as a famous mayor \u2013 the disgraced former managing director of the IMF and presidential hopeful Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was mayor from 1995 to 1997, and then deputy-mayor until 2007. Sarcelles both helped to create and, according to sociologist Dominique Schnapper, came to embody, the evolution of a kind of identity politics that at the time was entirely new to France, and at least theoretically went against the rigid diktats of secular Republican ideology. Sociologist Michel Wieviorka describes this period as the advent of what he calls the \u201cneo-republican model\u201d, which brought with it a rise in antisemitism, as Jews seemed to be moving away from observing cherished French values. One Jewish woman in Sarcelles, who asked that her real name not be used, told me about growing up in Little Jerusalem alongside immigrants from all over both north and sub-Saharan Africa, both Jewish and not; her own parents were from Algeria and Tunisia. She pointed to the cit\u00e9, a high-rise housing estate a short distance away, acknowledging that it was not a place where she would feel safe. But she was keen to dispel the media\u2019s image of Sarcelles as a hotbed of interethnic conflict and violence, describing it as a warm, friendly, racially mixed environment. She said that the rioters in July were not from Sarcelles; they came from other banlieues to wreak havoc and sow fear precisely because of the high number of Jews there who live cordially alongside their non-Jewish neighbours. A week before the Sarcelles attacks, video footage of what horrified witnesses described as a \u201cpogrom\u201d in central Paris swiftly went viral. As a relatively small, largely peaceful demonstration against Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza was winding down, dozens of young men, many with their heads wrapped in kefiyehs, were filmed careering down a side street in the Bastille district of the capital, armed with makeshift weapons and heading towards a synagogue, where prayers for Israel were being held.     The riot in Sarcelle, a suburb to the north of Paris, in July 2014. Photograph: Pierre Andrieu/AFP/Getty Images    Bernard Abouaf, a journalist for the left-leaning Radio Shalom, was with friends nearby when he received a call on his mobile that the synagogue was being attacked. He rushed to the scene. \u201cThere were a hundred or so pro-Palestinian activists rushing towards the synagogue. There were 40 Jews outside defending the 160 people who were trapped inside. Let me tell you, I have never in my life defended the JDL [Jewish Defense League],\u201d he said. \u201cBut that evening, if they hadn\u2019t been there, the synagogue would have been destroyed, with all the people trapped inside.\u201d Abouaf insisted that I sit with him to watch a video that had spread widely after the incident, under a headline announcing that Serge Benhaim \u2013 the president of the synagogue \u2013 denied any attack had taken place. The video shows a young journalist, Julien N\u00e9ny, repeatedly asserting in an interview with Benhaim that the violence had been instigated by the notorious Jewish Defence League; his questions to Benhaim focus on the reputation of the JDL for violence rather than on the events of the afternoon. Under N\u00e9ny\u2019s insistent questioning, the quietly spoken Benhaim repeats that \u201cthat version of events is wrong\u201d Eventually, the spooling, repetitive question-and-answer becomes hard to follow. It was only after watching the video four times that I understood: Benhaim is repeatedly denying, in the same phrase, N\u00e9ny\u2019s repeated suggestion that the violence had been provoked by the JDL. His endlessly looping denial ends up being twisted by N\u00e9ny\u2019s bullying persistence into the opposite of what he is saying \u2013 it sounds as though he is denying that the synagogue was attacked. It\u2019s an impressive journalistic sleight of hand, so successful, indeed, that it made its way round the world, written about by journalists who may have simply read the headline and not even bothered to watch the video \u2013 evidence, perhaps, of a surprisingly widespread taste for the notion that antisemitic violence is a chimera, faked by Jews and supported by the government as part of a strategy to demonise Muslims in France and elsewhere. * * * In her recent book Muslims and Jews in France, historian Maud Mandel traces the history of the two main immigrant populations in France. The new Jewish and Muslim immigrants who left north Africa in significant numbers at the same moment in the post-colonial period shared \u201ccertain linguistic and cultural traditions and a common experience of displacement; both communities also experienced similar pressures to assimilate while as often feeling rejected by the nation seeking to integrate them.\u201d But the integration of north African Muslims and Jews into French society followed different tracks \u2013 in part because of decades of colonial policy, and in part because of divisive post-colonial policies that dealt very differently with the two populations when it came to integration. In Morocco, many Jews had, since the mid 19th century, benefited from being educated at the Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle schools, which provided French education to Jewish children in the colonies and elsewhere, and whose avowed mission was to \u201cmodernise\u201d Oriental Jews in order for them to gain emancipation. Meanwhile, in Algeria, the Cr\u00e9mieux decree of 1870, which bestowed French citizenship on 35,000 members of the Jewish population, effectively cut them off from their Muslim neighbours and established them almost on equal footing with the French colonial population. Inevitably these inequalities led to profound differences in terms of integration during the frenzied period when both Jews and Muslims were fleeing north Africa, and particularly during and after the bloody Algerian war for independence. Jews from Algeria, already French citizens, \u201cbenefited from all the subsidies and aid available to repatriating citizens\u201d; Jews from Morocco and Tunisia \u2013 many of whom were already significantly acculturated French speakers \u2013 did not have citizenship, but the authorities bent over backwards to help them gain it. Muslims arriving from those countries received little or no help of that kind, and found themselves dealing with administrative structures that treated them differently from other immigrants. Muslims escaping Algeria found themselves treated with particular suspicion. Where Jews from north Africa were able to join a longstanding, though profoundly wounded, Jewish population, with communal structures in place and a leadership prepared to defend their interests as Jews, Muslims arriving during the same period had no such structures in place, and the organisations that sought to speak for them were often \u201cprofoundly distrusted by French authorities, as sources of political instability\u201d.    Half of all racist attacks in France take Jews as their target, even though they number less than 1% of the population    What Mandel describes as the \u201cinequality embedded in French colonisation policies\u201d led to vastly different integration processes, the consequences of which are still rippling through French society today. Thousands of immigrants from north Africa, Muslim and Jewish, were housed side by side in newly constructed suburbs or in city centre housing estates, which were to become, 30 years later, the site of increasingly tense inter-ethnic relations between the grandchildren of the original immigrants. \u201cToday, in a situation of deep economic crisis,\u201d the Sciences Po academic Nonna Mayer told me, \u201camong people who don\u2019t have a degree or a job there is an enormous resentment against society, and a tendency to make Jews the scapegoat, because Jews are the minority that is seen as successful. \u2018Jews have money, Jews have power\u2019 \u2013 these stereotypes work very well. And the Israeli-Palestinian conflict adds an extra layer.\u201d There is a growing turf war, particularly around the Buttes Chaumont, between Jewish and Muslim gangs. People whose parents used to play cards together now find themselves pitted against each other. In a shockingly under-reported attack in 2003, the Jewish DJ Sebastian Sellam had his throat slit and his eyes gouged out by a childhood friend and neighbour, a petty criminal and drug dealer called Adel Amastaibou, in the underground car park of their apartment building in Paris\u2019s 10th arrondissement. According to Amastaibou\u2019s mother, after the murder he ran upstairs to the apartment they shared and shouted, \u2018I killed a Jew! Now I will go to heaven!\u2019 When the police arrived he told them, \u2018It was what Allah demanded.\u2019 Amastaibou claimed diminished responsibility, and he has never been tried; he remains in a psychiatric hospital in Paris, permitted out for occasional weekends. * * * Many accuse the media of stoking a \u201cbinary\u201d image of Jewish-Muslim conflict. In her study, Mandel explains how the media\u2019s \u201cnarrative of polarisation\u201d erases multiple and complex interactions, reducing everything to a hostility that is framed by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Others, including sociologist and historian of ideas Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff, claim that the media\u2019s \u201cmethodical stigmatisation\u201d of Israel and an increasing anti-Israel bias in France in general has encouraged the emergence of a Muslim Judeophobia. While the media may have its role to play, a contemporary phenomenon has emerged which is amplifying public antisemitic discourse to an entirely new degree. Michel Wieviorka, the sociologist, told me he believes that antisemitism is not necessarily on the increase, but the rapid transmission of antisemitic material on the internet makes it seem as if it is, stoking fear and anxiety among an increasingly nervous Jewish population. \u201cThe internet disseminates ideas and ideology faster and more widely than has ever been possible before,\u201d he said. France does seem to be a particularly fertile incubator for online antisemitism \u2013 perhaps because the country\u2019s stiff laws against racist hate speech make the internet a kind of free zone for expressing sentiments that are legally restricted in other media. In October 2012, the hashtag #unbonjuif \u2013 \u201ca good Jew\u201d, part of an antisemitic joke, often featuring ovens \u2013 became one of the most popular trends on Twitter in France; a high-court ruling later forced Twitter to hand over details that would allow the authorities to take action against individuals. No one has taken greater advantage of this peculiar fervour for spreading antisemitism online than the comedian Dieudonn\u00e9 M\u2019bala M\u2019bala. In 2013, he invented the \u201cquenelle\u201d, a hybrid gesture crossing a lowered Nazi salute and a bras d\u2019honneur, the French equivalent of sticking up two fingers. Both antisemitic and anti-establishment, the quenelle (which Dieudonn\u00e9\u2019s wife actually trademarked) became a viral internet phenomenon, with tens of thousands of fans posting images of themselves doing it in front of synagogues and Holocaust memorials, at the gates of Auschwitz, on the beach, in their bedrooms, or \u2013 like Nicolas Anelka \u2013 on the football pitch. Dieudonn\u00e9\u2019s enormous popularity, which cuts right across political and ethnic lines, appealing equally to Muslim youth and Le Pen supporters, and even to middle-class professionals, has been largely a product of the internet, which he uses to remorselessly test the limits of free expression, enticing the government to play into his hands. Manuel Valls was so infuriated by Dieudonn\u00e9\u2019s jeering incitement that in early 2014 he banned some of the comedian\u2019s live shows \u2013 which feature an extraordinary array of viciously antisemitic sketches \u2013 before attempting, unsuccessfully, to suppress his presence online. One of the debates that has been reignited in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre, principally among high school students, is why, if freedom of speech is so sacrosanct, the same right to offend was not granted to Dieudonn\u00e9. (It\u2019s a good question, actually.) Dieudonn\u00e9\u2019s only comment so far on last week\u2019s attacks has come in the form of a tweet, #JeSuisCharlieCoulibaly \u2013 Amedy Coulibaly was the gunman who murdered four Jews at the kosher supermarket \u2013 and a gloating Facebook post after Sunday\u2019s solidarity march, which concluded with \u201cTonight, I feel like Charlie Coulibaly.\u201d By yesterday morning Dieudonn\u00e9 had been arrested for \u201ccondoning terrorism\u201d, to widespread outrage on Twitter and no doubt to his great satisfaction.     Binyamin Netanyahu addresses the memorial service held at Paris\u2019s Great Synagogue for those killed in the attacks. Photograph: Haim Zach/GPO/Rex    Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Taguieff prefers not to talk of old style antisemitism. He believes that what he calls a new \u201cJudeophobia\u201d, a mix of archaic prejudices and anti-Zionism, is thriving in the midst of widespread indifference and no longer arouses real indignation. One of the glimmers of hope that has emerged from the last week is that the attention of the country has been galvanised by the fact of an attack on a Jewish target. (After the 2012 murders of two soldiers of north African origin, a rabbi and three Jewish children in Toulouse, only a few thousand turned up to march in their memory in Paris and around France, most of them Jews.) As Valls has said many times \u2013 most recently with extraordinary and moving passion at the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale \u2013 the destiny of the Jews of France is inextricably tied up with that of France itself: \u201cWithout the Jews of France, France will no longer be France \u2026 When the Jews of France are under attack, France is under attack, and universal values are under attack.\u201d The Jews of France are indeed intricately bound to the Republic. Jews were present at its birth and their emancipation was emblematic of the new post-revolutionary order. Jewish respect for Republican ideals and la\u00efcit\u00e9 has been largely unwavering. But it is perhaps not hard to imagine that much as Valls\u2019s magnificent speech will have encouraged and reassured the Jewish population of the government\u2019s commitment to ensuring that they can live in freedom and safety in France, it will at the same time have been heard by many Muslims as a bitter reminder that they, unlike Jews, are not considered to be \u201cthe soul of France\u201d. There have been widespread reports that Muslim high school students across France refused to participate in last Thursday\u2019s minute of silence for the Charlie Hebdo victims, which correlates with a refusal in some areas to study the Holocaust (a compulsory part of the school curriculum). There is resentment that other historical French crimes, including slavery, are not given the same emphasis on the curriculum. Addressing the seething anti-establishment and anti-Jewish sentiment that is increasing among young Muslims is one of the many key challenges for the future. The events of last week have shattered Jews in France. There is a palpable sense of depression as people struggle to get used to a new order and also get on with their lives. There was a striking moment on Sunday evening, when Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu accompanied Hollande and Valls to the memorial service at Paris\u2019s Great Synagogue. To enthusiastic cheering, Netanyahu stood and gave a speech, taking the opportunity to invite those present to leave France and live in that well-known safe haven, Israel. (He was later roundly criticised for his opportunism by French Jewish leaders.) When he finished his peroration, the congregants applauded and sang the Israeli national anthem, Hatikvah. And then, in an appa rently unplanned gesture, a congregant took the microphone and spontaneously led the congregation in the national anthem of France. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread  This article was amended on 16 January.

They were in the process of bestowing world heritage site status on something called the White City, a set of more than a thousand modernist buildings of the 1930s, built in what was called the Bauhaus style. At the end of the book, after tracing the emergence of this city and the things that had to happen to its neighbours in the process, Rotbard finds the Unesco staff toasting the successful listing in May 2004, only a few miles from the mass deportation of Palestinians in nearby Jaffa. \u201cAs the \u2018White City\u2019 Unesco afterparty raged, the streets of the \u2018Black City\u2019 were being \u2018swept clean\u2019.\u201d Clean enough for the White City to stay whiter than white. According to Rotbard, an Israeli historian and architect, architecture, like war, is politics by other means. White City Black City charts how Tel Aviv, founded in the early 20th century and developed in the interwar years by\u00a0Jewish settlers in tandem with the British mandate\u2019s colonial administrators, grew out of and then consumed its parent, the ancient city of Jaffa. Rotbard\u2019s account begins with what appears at first to be a triumph of modern town planning and architecture, and then pans out to the area around it, and the clean lines and smooth surfaces begin to look more and more like a hurried facade placed over a scene of devastation. This scene, he argues, is the truth of modernism; \u201cthe\u00a0best place to examine modern architecture remains outside Europe, in urban spaces that developed under colonial regimes\u201d, where the real violence supporting the \u201cvisual and stylised violence inherent in modern architecture\u201d can be seen clearly and ambiguously at work. Whether or not that wider point is\u00a0tenable, as an architectural and political history of Tel Aviv and Jaffa, this book is a truly comprehensive demolition job. Myths are knocked down one by one in the first part, focusing on the White City itself. According to the story given official benediction by Unesco, German-Jewish architects trained at the Bauhaus school in Dessau fled the Nazi suppression of modern architecture in 1933 and built a\u00a0city according to their ideals in mandatory Palestine. In reality, Rotbard notes, only four Bauhaus students ever emigrated to Palestine, only one of whom left a\u00a0major architectural legacy: Aryeh Sharon, who designed workers\u2019 settlements in Tel Aviv and kibbutzes elsewhere. On being asked about the Tel Aviv Bauhaus style, Sharon was dismissive: \u201cThe Bauhaus is neither a concept nor a uniform institution.\u201d Rather than Sharon\u2019s anti-aesthetic communes, what the White City really entailed was\u00a0speculative low-rise apartment buildings designed by French- and Belgian-trained eastern European architects, on a street plan by the influential Scottish town-planner Patrick Geddes, stopping off between his projects in Edinburgh Old Town and Mumbai (in Haifa, the service was provided by future planner of London and Plymouth, Patrick Abercrombie). Bauhaus became just a brand name. The emergence of the idea of the White City is traced to the 1980s, as a reaction against a turn in Israeli politics that favoured a Levantine, traditionalist (and Likud-voting) identity whose emblematic city was Jerusalem, rather than a central European, modernist (and Labour-voting) identity centred on Tel Aviv. The White City endeavour, popularised in Ha\u2019aretz columns and preservation movements, was partly a\u00a0rediscovery of a humane modern architecture against the gigantic postmodernist developments of 80s Israel, but also involved rediscovering a better\u00a0Zionism, without colonialism or zealotry. Rotbard is sympathetic to the former, but considers the latter a pipe dream, instead making the case that Tel Aviv\u2019s very emergence encapsulated the dispossession and, eventually, expulsion of the Palestinians. Rejecting the Orientalist styles favoured by early emigrants as \u201ca combination of Baghdad and Berdichev\u201d, Tel Aviv architects\u2019 preference for a whitewashed modernism entailed a rejection of anything eastern European or Middle Eastern in favour of a purely Ashkenazi identity. Planned by Geddes to circumvent and cut off Jaffa, then the largest city in Palestine, it would essentially wipe this largely Arab city \u2013 which was designated a Palestinian enclave in the partition plan of 1947 \u2013 off the map in the war of 1948, and then annex it to Tel Aviv as an impoverished suburb, blanked or left off the city\u2019s actual maps. The book\u2019s second part traces what happened to Jaffa next. Its centre was first demolished, then reconstructed in the early 60s as\u00a0a\u00a0heritage district, with residence restricted to artists (how prescient!). The\u00a0greatest insult of all was the Etzel Museum, a Mies van der Rohe-esque glass box \u201cnailed to the ruins\u201d of a Palestinian house, intended to \u201cfreeze the special moment and time of day when Jaffa was liberated\u201d, described sharply here as \u201cTel Aviv\u2019s poor allegory of itself\u201d. Yet in becoming the\u00a0place where all things not whiter than white were dumped, Jaffa became a complex, multicultural city, and that becomes the only hopeful aspect of a\u00a0grim, bloody story. White City Black City is a superbly researched and exemplary architectural study. However, Rotbard occasionally spoils his case with an unnecessarily nostalgic reading of the area\u2019s pre\u201120th-century history (traditional cultures are\u00a0always welcoming and considerate of their neighbours, we\u2019re told) and a rather too sweeping condemnation of modern architecture as being necessarily colonial. This isn\u2019t helped by some inexact architectural comparisons. Showing a picture of art deco apartment blocks in Dakar and Algiers alongside the more confident modernist work in Tel Aviv does not, as he believes, show their formal and political similarity as belonging to a colonial international style: they don\u2019t look remotely similar. Rotbard inadvertently downplays the possibility of a Palestinian modernity \u2013 he claims that Jaffa actually built more\u00a0international-style buildings than Tel Aviv in the interwar years, but tells us nothing about them, not giving a single example, something which impoverishes his account of the Black City. The many and varied modernisms that emerged across formerly colonised countries between the 1950s and 80s have no place in this blanket narrative. The ethnic cleansing and \u201curbicide\u201d of Jaffa is not, perhaps, as unique as Rotbard makes out, as similar things happened at the same time in Breslau, K\u00f6nigsberg, Wilno or Lw\u00f3w; but then none of these cities were destroyed by\u00a0a specially built neighbouring city. Also, given the centrality of the British empire to the creation of Tel Aviv and\u00a0the erasure of Jaffa, it would be intriguing to follow the parallels in how\u00a0the same town planners reworked Plymouth, Hull, Alexandria or Mumbai as well as the cities of mandate Palestine; certainly, in Tel Aviv\u2019s Dizengoff Square you can see traces of\u00a0the new town precincts of the 1950s, and in the bypasses that severed it from Jaffa, you can see embryonic versions of the cordons sanitaires that enclose most British town centres from their inner cities. Yet these absences don\u2019t affect the book\u2019s main argument, and if\u00a0you want an explanation of the roots of the Israel-Palestine conflict \u2013 and of just how deep they go, right into the very foundations of the buildings \u2013\u00a0this book gives one of the most unusual and convincing accounts. \u2022 To order White City and Black\u00a0City or \u00a311.99 (RRP \u00a314.99), go to bookshop.theguardian.com or\u00a0call\u00a00330 333 6846.", "publicationDate": "2015-01-22T10:30:01Z", "title": "White City Black City: Architecture and War in Tel Aviv and Jaffa \u2013 a demolition job\r\n\r\n", "sentences": ["White City Black City charts how Tel Aviv, founded in the early 20th century and developed in the interwar years by\u00a0Jewish settlers in tandem with the British mandate\u2019s colonial administrators, grew out of and then consumed its parent, the ancient city of Jaffa.", "Whether or not that wider point is\u00a0tenable, as an architectural and political history of Tel Aviv and Jaffa, this book is a truly comprehensive demolition job.", "In reality, Rotbard notes, only four Bauhaus students ever emigrated to Palestine, only one of whom left a\u00a0major architectural legacy: Aryeh Sharon, who designed workers\u2019 settlements in Tel Aviv and kibbutzes elsewhere.", "On being asked about the Tel Aviv Bauhaus style, Sharon was dismissive: \u201cThe Bauhaus is neither a concept nor a uniform institution.\u201d Rather than Sharon\u2019s anti-aesthetic communes, what the White City really entailed was\u00a0speculative low-rise apartment buildings designed by French- and Belgian-trained eastern European architects, on a street plan by the influential Scottish town-planner Patrick Geddes, stopping off between his projects in Edinburgh Old Town and Mumbai (in Haifa, the service was provided by future planner of London and Plymouth, Patrick Abercrombie).", "The emergence of the idea of the White City is traced to the 1980s, as a reaction against a turn in Israeli politics that favoured a Levantine, traditionalist (and Likud-voting) identity whose emblematic city was Jerusalem, rather than a central European, modernist (and Labour-voting) identity centred on Tel Aviv.", "Rotbard is sympathetic to the former, but considers the latter a pipe dream, instead making the case that Tel Aviv\u2019s very emergence encapsulated the dispossession and, eventually, expulsion of the Palestinians.", "Rejecting the Orientalist styles favoured by early emigrants as \u201ca combination of Baghdad and Berdichev\u201d, Tel Aviv architects\u2019 preference for a whitewashed modernism entailed a rejection of anything eastern European or Middle Eastern in favour of a purely Ashkenazi identity.", "Planned by Geddes to circumvent and cut off Jaffa, then the largest city in Palestine, it would essentially wipe this largely Arab city \u2013 which was designated a Palestinian enclave in the partition plan of 1947 \u2013 off the map in the war of 1948, and then annex it to Tel Aviv as an impoverished suburb, blanked or left off the city\u2019s actual maps.", "The\u00a0greatest insult of all was the Etzel Museum, a Mies van der Rohe-esque glass box \u201cnailed to the ruins\u201d of a Palestinian house, intended to \u201cfreeze the special moment and time of day when Jaffa was liberated\u201d, described sharply here as \u201cTel Aviv\u2019s poor allegory of itself\u201d.", "Showing a picture of art deco apartment blocks in Dakar and Algiers alongside the more confident modernist work in Tel Aviv does not, as he believes, show their formal and political similarity as belonging to a colonial international style: they don\u2019t look remotely similar.", "Rotbard inadvertently downplays the possibility of a Palestinian modernity \u2013 he claims that Jaffa actually built more\u00a0international-style buildings than Tel Aviv in the interwar years, but tells us nothing about them, not giving a single example, something which impoverishes his account of the Black City.", "Also, given the centrality of the British empire to the creation of Tel Aviv and\u00a0the erasure of Jaffa, it would be intriguing to follow the parallels in how\u00a0the same town planners reworked Plymouth, Hull, Alexandria or Mumbai as well as the cities of mandate Palestine; certainly, in Tel Aviv\u2019s Dizengoff Square you can see traces of\u00a0the new town precincts of the 1950s, and in the bypasses that severed it from Jaffa, you can see embryonic versions of the cordons sanitaires that enclose most British town centres from their inner cities."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/22/white-city-black-city-architecutre-and-war-in-tel-aviv-and-jaffa-review"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Bayern Munich", "Rangers", "Football politics", "Sport", "Fifa"], "article": "Man of the week Ex-Rangers director Dave King, correcting any wrong impressions given by his 41 tax fraud convictions.

Damian Pachter, who flew to Israel, had reported that the prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, had died with a bullet to the head in his Buenos Aires home on 18 January.  Nisman\u2019s death occurred the day before he was due to answer questions in public about his allegation that Argentina\u2019s president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, had conspired to derail his investigation of into the 1994 bombing of a Jewish charities federation office in which 85 people were killed. Pachter, who works for both the Buenos Aires Herald and Israel\u2019s Haaretz, wrote in Haaretz of \u201cthe craziest 48 hours of my life\u201d. He told of obtaining his scoop about Nisman\u2019s death through a source who gave him \u201csolid information\u201d and whose name he will never reveal. After Pachter had tweeted his exclusive, he claimed the government tried to cobble together an \u201cofficial\u201d story. He writes:   \u201cOn Friday, I was working at the Buenos Aires Herald newsroom when a colleague from the BBC urged me to look at the state news agency\u2019s story on Nisman\u2019s death.  The piece had some serious typos but the message was even stranger: The agency quoted a supposed tweet of mine that I never wrote. I realised that this tweet was a kind of coded message\u201d.  A friend told him to leave the city, which he did by bus. But, at a remote bus station several hours later, he thought he was under surveillance. His friend arrived and confirmed his suspicions, pointing to an \u201cintelligence guy\u201d. Pachter writes: \u201cI then had to consider the best thing to do, because when an Argentine intelligence agent is on your tail, it\u2019s never good news\u201d. So he went to Buenos Aires airport, where he gave other journalist friends an interview about his situation. He then flew, via Montevideo and to Madrid, to Tel Aviv. Pachter writes:  \u201cI have no idea when I\u2019ll be back in Argentina; I don\u2019t even know if I want to. What I do know is that the country where I was born is not the happy place my Jewish grandparents used to tell me stories about... Argentina has become a dark place led by a corrupt political system. I still haven\u2019t figured out everything that has happened to me over the past 48 hours\u201d.  Nisman had been set to go before a congressional hearing to talk about his claim that Kirchner and foreign minister Hector Timerman of shielding Iranian officials implicated in the 1994 bombing.  Nisman\u2019s accusation was contained in a 280-page document in which he contended that Kirchner\u2019s government had agreed to swap grain for oil with Iran in exchange for withdrawing Interpol arrest notices against former and current Iranian officials who are suspects. Argentine courts have previously demanded the extradition of eight Iranians, including former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, former defence minister Ahmad Vahidi and Iran\u2019s former cultural attache in Buenos Aires, Mohsen Rabbani, for the bombing. But in 2013, Kirchner signed a memorandum of understanding with Tehran agreeing to set up a \u201ctruth commission\u201d to investigate the bombing and allowing Argentine prosecutors to question the suspects in Iran. The rapprochement was vehemently opposed at the time by Jewish community leaders who said it was \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d After Nisman\u2019s mysterious death, Kirchner said she believed he had been murdered in a plot by \u201crogue elements\u201d in the intelligence services to implicate her government.

She will be returning to Auschwitz for the third time, as part of the US presidential delegation, along with her daughter, Lesley Weiss We lived in B\u00f3tr\u00e1gy, a very small, mostly poor town in Czechoslovakia with a population of approximately 1,000 mainly farming families, including about 10 Jewish families. The town was a typical low-income community with a tailor, a shoemaker, a grocery store, where people struggled to get by, but where everyone knew each other and there was easy communication between the neighbours, though that didn\u2019t mean we were equal.  When I was eight years old Czechoslovakia broke apart and we became part of Hungary. That was when our problems started, because the Hungarians were allied with the Nazis. It was a difficult time for Jewish families, as suddenly the law no longer protected us and overnight we lost our civil rights. My father\u2019s lumber business was confiscated and given to a non-Jew, and we received no compensation. Jewish children were thrown out of Hungarian schools, so right away we had no choice but to concentrate on hunkering down and trying not to bring attention to ourselves. We couldn\u2019t ride the trains and we had to wear the yellow star. It was a free for all. With no law to protect us, it was common for Jews to get beaten up or thrown off the train.  It\u2019s an incredibly scary feeling when you\u2019re exposed to anyone\u2019s raw feelings and enmity. These young Nazis habitually roamed around and did tremendous damage to many individuals.

The very first task the German government gave the Hungarians was to round up Jewish families and deport them to Auschwitz. There was a huge rush to take half a million Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz and it was completed in just six weeks, in 147 cattle cars. So in the spring of 1944 my family \u2013 my parents and their six children, the oldest of whom was 17 and I was 13 \u2013 found ourselves in the Munk\u00e1cs ghetto and from there being taken on cattle carts to Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland.   Related: Auschwitz: a short history of the largest mass murder site in human history    Imagine it like this: three generations of your family have lived in the same house in the same town. They\u2019ve struggled to raise a family, put kids through school, to feed them all. You have your friends and family. All of a sudden you are told to leave it all and walk out with a single suitcase.  I remember the night of the packing very well. Things went in the suitcase, things were taken out of the suitcase. In the end my mother filled it with food she had cooked and warm clothing and bedding. Then it was full. Plus we took a watch, some earrings, a wedding ring with us to exchange for food if necessary. The next day my father was forced to hand over his remaining money to a delegation that included the mayor and the school principal as they rounded us up at the town hall. We had been absolutely unaware of such a place as Auschwitz. It was a stunning reversal of the life we had had up until then. And I cannot emphasise enough how utterly scary it is to be at the mercy of your fellow human beings. As a child I could not understand what we had done to deserve going there. My father surveyed the scene from the train and could see prisoners, uniforms and barracks so we immediately thought it was a work camp, and that was reassuring \u2013 if we can work, it can\u2019t be such a dreadful place. We had heard about the stories in Poland of lots of mass shootings of Jews or people being taken into the forest and shot, so it was a relief to see out the window that there was actually a system. Even though we were victims of discrimination at that stage that\u2019s all it was, as we had no clue then that this was a very carefully orchestrated plan of genocide. We could not have imagined that they would kill little children, until we realised that killing children was their primary goal to prevent any new generations. Because desperate people will always look to find some sign of hope, we thought to ourselves even if we have to work, at least we\u2019ll see each other occasionally. But the German system was full of this sort of deception. It counted on people\u2019s normal perception of things. Thinking we were going to a work camp. Thinking that you were going to take a shower when in fact you were going to the gas chambers \u2013 that was the ultimate deceit.    All of a sudden you are told to leave it all and walk out with a single suitcase  Irene Fogel Weiss     When we arrived it was, as I later found out, the usual story, though not to us at the time. Our family was torn apart on the platform on arriving. My sister, Serena, was chosen for slave labour. My mother and the younger children were sent off to one side and my father and 16-year-old brother to the other side. I held tightly on to the hand of my 12-year-old sister and for an instant I was mistaken for being older than I was, probably because I was wearing a headscarf that my mother had given me.  My sister was sent with my mother, while I went to the opposite side. That was the first chance I had to survive. Unbeknown to any of us at the time, two Nazi soldiers had been asked to make a photographic document of the deportation of Hungarian Jews from the moment they got off the train \u2013 through the entire system of arriving, going to the bath house and getting their prison clothes \u2013 so I ended up in a picture at the very moment I was separated from my sister. It captures me standing alone without my family on the Auschwitz platform, and I\u2019m leaning inwards to see where my little sister has gone. Another picture we discovered shows my family waiting in line for the gas chamber. Two little boys, my brothers Reuven and Gershon, are shown dressed in hats, one struggling to put on his winter coat. For a long time I failed to find my mother and was very unhappy. But I spent hours looking at these photos with a magnifying glass and one day I found her little face sticking out. The pictures only came to light 25 years ago and, despite them showing moments from around 45 years before that, they completely captured the entire experience as it had been in my mind all that time. I was dumbfounded and devastated, having had no idea they existed, and I have spent literally hundreds of hours scouring them, trying to find my father and brother. The pictures have reassured me that I was not imagining it all, as I sometimes thought I might have done. The reality of where we were, struck home fairly quickly. I was stationed near crematorium number four, and we witnessed the columns of unsuspecting women and children entering the gate of the crematorium; they would have been dead within half an hour. When the Hungarian Jews arrived they had the gas chambers going day and night. How can you wrap your imagination round that? I still can\u2019t. I was with my older sister Serena and we were sent to be forced labourers together in the Birkenau section of Auschwitz. Many times we were threatened with separation but somehow we managed to stay together. Later on, to our great relief we ran into my mother\u2019s two younger sisters, our aunts Rose and Piri, who were in their early 20s. It was like finding our parents. They were such a huge moral and emotional support for us.  On about 17 January or 18 January 1945, the SS dragged thousands of us out of the camp to walk to Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp deep into central Germany. I don\u2019t really know why. We were in terrible straits with no proper clothes, nothing suitable for marching through the snow. It was as if the cruelty would never end. If anyone sat down out of exhaustion, they were shot. Later we were transported yet again, and my aunt Piri became ill and was killed. As the Soviets approached, the SS left and I, Serena and Rose took shelter in an empty house nearby. The Russians came but for some reason left again immediately, so we were left to fend for ourselves. We spent months trying to get to Prague where we knew we had some relatives and from there we went to the Sudetenland. I got to go to school, my sister found work in a factory and Rose was sick at home with tuberculosis.      Some of the 600 children who survived Auschwitz show their identification numbers. Photograph: Reuters    We initially had no idea what had happened to the rest of the family and had no access to a phone. But on buildings everywhere lists were put up stating who was still alive. Everyone you met you asked, every meeting of refugees was dominated by trying to find out where your relatives were. Eventually I discovered that of around 100 people from my town who were deported, only about 10 survived, only two of whom were children \u2013 my sister and me. But there was not one parent and child who lived. All of them were killed.    This is my last chance to make sure this tragedy is not forgotten  Irene Fogel Weiss     Serena now lives in New Jersey with her family, including three children and grandchildren. We\u2019ve both managed to hang on in there, but she can\u2019t come to Auschwitz because her elderly husband is sick. For years when we talked about our experience she\u2019d say to me: \u201cYou probably don\u2019t remember, you were too young,\u201d as I was four years younger, but some things I remembered even more sharply than her and my aunt. I\u2019m often asked how I have coped. I never went to a psychologist and I never will. Quite simply, I kept it at a distance. I saw and understood, and yet I didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve never cried over the columns of children and mothers I saw. When I was in Auschwitz I thought: \u2018This is not actually on earth.\u2019 It was a system of masters and slaves, gods and subhumans and I thought to myself: \u2018No one knows about it. It\u2019s the forest, surrounded by multiple layers of fence, it\u2019s not actually real.\u2019 I never let it penetrate that my parents were killed and I even thought: \u2018After this we\u2019re going home and everyone will be there again.\u2019 Those who never managed to keep it distant killed themselves.

I married young, I had three children, (I now also have four grandchildren) and then I went to college and became a teacher. You fall into a routine and do the best you can. But I\u2019ve never lost the feeling of how unreliable human beings are and neither am I fooled by superficial civilisation. But I realise that loss of faith in people is more devastating than loss of faith in God. I won\u2019t be going back to Auschwitz again after this visit. So it\u2019s my last chance to make sure this tragedy is not forgotten. I found out only about a week before I was due to leave that I will be one of two survivors who will be part of the US presidential delegation, headed by the secretary of the treasury, Jack Lew, and I feel very honoured, but it has much to do with the fact that many others who could go are ill and unable to travel.  Joseph Mandrowitz, born in Czemierniki, Poland in 1923. He now lives in Toms River, New Jersey, and is returning to Auschwitz for the second time with his second cousin     Joseph Mandrowitz, Auschwitz survivor Photograph: Tim Knox    We had a quiet life until the day they took 1,000 Jews away from my village of Czemierniki, a typical Polish village with a big square around which community life took place. My father was a bootmaker, my mother was a seamstress and everyone worked hard. There was always some antisemitism, but it was mainly fairly harmless, consisting of kids at our school who during religious education taunted the five or six Jewish kids in the class with \u201cJews killed Jesus.\u201d I had trained as a tailor and had left home before we were deported, when I went to work four miles away on a ranch. It was taken over by the SS, so suddenly I found myself working for them. In May 1943 they lined us up one day and told us to empty our pockets. If they found even a single zloty in anyone\u2019s pocket, they were shot on the spot. We were transported to Majdanek, which was only 19 miles away \u2013 a torture camp in the true sense of the word. For 500 metres there were just ditches full of bodies, legs, heads. We were deported to Auschwitz four weeks later. We arrived in the early morning and they gave us a bed, a real shower, they cleaned us well with disinfectant and shaved us. After that they gave us striped uniforms and tattooed us. I was given the number 128164 on my left arm and from that point on I was a number, no longer a name.  From there we were sent to Buna (an Auschwitz sub camp) and were set to work. After a few months there, I went for a walk one day and saw a few tomatoes growing. I was starving by then so tried to take them and was given a beating so severe, I don\u2019t know how I survived it. I still have the scars from it today. I was taken to hospital and knew the rule: if you didn\u2019t heal in four to five days, they\u2019d take you to Birkenau and you\u2019d be gassed.  I was 20, about 1.7 metres (5ft 7in) tall, blond, not bad looking and, despite the beating, in pretty good shape. When my limit in the hospital was up, they sent me to the gas chambers. There I met Dr Mengele, who asked me what was wrong. I said: \u201cYou can see, I\u2019ve been beaten up.\u201d Instead of sending me to the gas chambers, I was sent back to the hospital, presumably he saw the potential for labour in me. As I had trained as a tailor, he decided I had my uses there. The soldiers wanted to look nice, so they\u2019d come to me in the hospital if they wanted their uniforms fixed up. The very fact that my new job meant I didn\u2019t have to get up in the morning in the harsh winter in thin clothes standing around for hours for the headcount was a big thing. It meant that being a tailor saved my life. That Mengele \u2013 they call him a doctor, but he was as much a doctor as I\u2019m an army general. A complete fake of a man who I was too scared to look in the eye. I saw him day in, day out for months and was one of 152 Jews in his \u201ccare\u201d. One of the experiments he carried out on me was to take blood from my arm and inject it in my rear end. I\u2019ve no idea what that was trying to prove. For some astonishing reason he \u201csaved\u201d me a second time, after the decision was made to clear the hospital and 150 people were sent to the gas chambers except for me and a boy from Saloniki. That\u2019s not to say I liked him at all \u2013 he was a hateful man, who hated himself first and foremost and then everyone else around him.     Joseph Mandrowitz just before he went into the camp. Photograph: Tim Knox    In 1944 we were sent on a death march from Birkenau to Oranienburg and from there to Buchenwald. Then to a quarry, where we were ordered to drill into the mountains to make some sort of secret city. From there we walked back to Buchenwald. Whoever was incapable of walking was shot. From there, big trains took us to Theresienstadt just as the Soviets were bombing the rails. We could sense that the Germans were almost destroyed. For 17 days we had no water, no food, nothing. Despite the hardship I was doing OK compared to others. I still had the capability to clamber on to the cattle trains without help. We were liberated from the Russians at Theresienstadt on 9 May. I developed typhus and spent several weeks in hospital before I could go anywhere. I decided to go back to my village as I had nowhere else to go. But of the 1,000 or so of us who had been deported, only eight to 10 had survived. Some people had warned me not to go back, saying there had been attacks on those who had returned, including the Jewish woman I had worked for when I\u2019d done my tailor apprenticeship. She\u2019d gone back to reclaim some possessions she had left behind in somebody\u2019s house and they killed her rather than return the items. She and her husband had been the only couple in Czemierniki to survive and then they went and murdered her when she came home. I had had parents, two brothers, three sisters, two nephews, two nieces, an aunt, an uncle, and all of them died. I found out the rest of my family were taken to Treblinka in 1942. When I finally returned to Czemierniki in 1993, despite the years in which Jews had lived there I could not find a trace either of my family or of Jewish life. Even the cemetery where my grandfather had been buried had been razed. The synagogue was gone. I went to ask the local priest, who said they had taken the tombstones and crushed them for building materials or something like that. I believe they deliberately destroyed any sign of Jewish life so as to be rid of us for ever.    When I watch programmes on the Holocaust  it\u2019s as if I\u2019m watching some made-up horror film    The Jewish Federation brought me to America. I deliberately chose against going to Israel as it would have meant I would have had to fight and kill and the US seemed the next best choice. They put me up in a hotel on 35th and 36th street until I got myself sorted out. I was desperate to get to work and make up for all those wasted years. I started looking for work as soon as I arrived, finding a job earning $35 (\u00a323) a week and by 1955 I had opened up my own business in Brooklyn, Queens, as a tailor and I think I did OK. I worked for some dignitaries, including Henry Kissinger and Nancy Reagan, and I also did a lot for the Johnsons. I\u2019d be putting together the garments designed for them by the likes of Oscar de la Renta and Geoffrey Beene. The US gave me a pretty good life. In fact I\u2019d say I found my heaven here. Of the 1,000 Jews taken from my village, only three of us are still alive, one living in Israel, one in Baltimore and myself. We stay in touch. I still drive my car, though not at night any more. I get jumpy when someone honks their horn, and occasionally I have bad dreams and wake up at night, my wife asking me: \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d, and I tell her I\u2019m being chased by Germans. But that\u2019s the story of my life. I still can\u2019t believe it happened. When I sit down and watch programmes on the Holocaust on the History Channel it\u2019s as if I\u2019m watching some made-up horror film. I have to go back to Auschwitz one last time. I feel like I own the place, having spent almost two years of my life there. I never forget it and I don\u2019t want to forget it because it\u2019s effectively the story of my life.\u201d Eva Umlauf, born in December 1942 at a labour camp in Nowaky, Czechoslovakia, in what is now Slovakia. She now lives in Munich, Germany, and works as a psychotherapist. She is returning to Auschwitz for the third time. Her book on the Holocaust is due to be published in 2016     Eva Umlauf in her Munich apartment Frank Bauer Photograph: Frank Bauer    I was not even two when we arrived at Auschwitz in 1944. I have no conscious memories of that time, but plenty of subconscious ones. My mother told me later how when they tattooed my arm with a needle, it was so painful that I passed out. The number they gave me and that I still have was A26959. My mother\u2019s ended in 8. I was probably the youngest child to have been tattooed who survived. My mother was four months pregnant when we arrived. My sister Nora was born there in April 1945. Had we arrived just two days earlier, we would have been gassed immediately. Our transport was the first from which no one was taken to the gas chambers, probably because they knew by then that the Russians were very close. We arrived on 2 November and on 30 October, 18,000 mothers and children who had arrived from Theresienstadt were killed. On the two occasions I have returned to Auschwitz, in 1995 and 2011, although I haven\u2019t got memories as such of the time I spent there, something is triggered deep inside me, both physically and in my inner being. I get very nervous and the death, the cold, the expanse and the emptiness of it swamps me \u2013 it\u2019s a feeling that it\u2019s hard to explain but it\u2019s everywhere. I can feel the burnt earth everywhere I walk. When Auschwitz was liberated in January 1945, we were already extremely sick, so we had to stay there. A Jewish paediatrician from Prague said my mother and her baby would not survive. She had rickets, TB and jaundice. But in April, against the odds, my mother gave birth to my sister, helped by prisoners who were doctors.     Eva Umlauf with her mother. Photograph: Frank Bauer    My mother never talked very much about our time there, mainly to protect us and herself. She was 21 when we were finally able to leave, with a two-year-old and a six-week-old. She also took with us a four-year-old boy who was parentless and she spent months searching for his relatives, who she did finally track down. At the same time, she had lost her husband and was mourning him. There was an unspoken ban on speaking about any of it. We went back to live in Tren\u010d\u00edn, the small town in Slovakia where my mother had moved when she married my father, and where the Red Cross found us a room. There was a frantic search to see who had survived and to look for relatives. But none of our relatives were still alive. My grandmother, great-grandmother and great-grandfather, my mother\u2019s three siblings \u2013 all had died. Probably my earliest memories of anything at all are of walking through the streets of Tren\u010d\u00edn and people stopping in their tracks and saying with amazement: \u201cYou\u2019re back!\u201d \u201cWhat a miracle that you\u2019re alive!\u201d I understood as a three-and-a-half to four-year-old that I was a miracle because I got to hear it so many times, but I didn\u2019t really understand what the word meant. Only much later could I recognise what a miracle it really was that I had survived, when I learned that of the thousands of Slovak men and women who were deported to Auschwitz, only a few hundred returned. My mother put every effort into giving us a normal life. She sent us to school and made sure we studied. She was loving and resourceful. It was only later when she got old that she was gripped by depression. Having held everything together and been so capable and diligent for so long, she just fell apart as if under the burden of it all, and she died at the age of 72. It\u2019s no accident that I and my sister became doctors \u2013 we had an absolute primal need to help people and save lives. I later qualified as a psychotherapist, a job which I enjoy immensely, but which confronts me with the suffering caused by the Holocaust on a daily basis. My patients are from \u201cboth sides\u201d \u2013 either victims or perpetrators, or their relatives \u2013 and many are what you\u2019d call transgenerationally affected \u2013 carrying around with them the issues and traumas that their parents or grandparents never dealt with, and which unless cured are like a contagious disease that they\u2019ll pass on to the next generation. I married a Polish Jew and we settled in Germany, the \u201cT\u00e4terland\u201d \u2013 the land of the perpetrator \u2013 after being forced out of Czechoslovakia after the collapse of the Prague Spring in 1968. It does sometimes feel like a strange decision to live in Germany because the Holocaust is just so omnipresent here and there is a growing antisemitism that scares me, especially when you feel it in Germany, of all places, which is why I always repeat what Primo Levi wrote: \u201cWhat happened can happen again.\u201d     Eva Umlauf\u2019s numerical tattoo, still visible today. Photograph: Frank Bauer    That\u2019s why I go into schools and talk to 15 year olds in and around Munich because we have to repeatedly confront it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m returning to Auschwitz on Monday. It will be the last time many people return, the end of an epoch. The wounds might heal, but they leave scars which are still very visible.

She is returning to Auschwitz for the first time, with her grandson Anthony, 33     Susan Pollack at her London home Photograph: Graeme Robertson/Guardian    From the moment I arrived in Auschwitz with my mother and brother in May 1944, the terror of it just invaded my whole being. My mother was immediately taken away and I later learned that she had been gassed. I only recently discovered that my father had been there too. My whole world was turned upside down by the brutality of it. We had not in any way understood what had been going on, only later recognising all the sources and streams that led to the Holocaust. In my small Hungarian village, information had been very restricted. We didn\u2019t know about anything, like the Wannsee conference (where the Final Solution was planned), and neither could we have imagined it. We were told by the authorities that we were being resettled, which is why I took my sewing machine with me. I took my sewing machine! The process of losing any kind of hope was a very gradual one. We were transported in cattle wagons in which many babies and children suffocated, in what it turned out was the last transport of Hungarians. We had no water, no food, there was no hygiene. That diminished our hope and increased the feeling of being trapped. But despite that, you always retained a glimmer of hope. Always. I had become aware of antisemitism from a young age, when my uncle had his head chopped in two when he was attacked by fascists while driving up to Novograd where he lived. While his attacker was convicted, he was hardly punished, and continued to live opposite my uncle\u2019s wife and child. But as a child you don\u2019t think about these things all that much. My family had a wood and coal business and, like most people in those days, my father was self-employed. As they started to restrict us, he lost his licence to operate and then he faced the enormous task of trying to find work. Meanwhile, my mother was at home trying to keep the family together, with all of us all involved in domestic life. I recall the time in Auschwitz as single moments, short encounters, smells. We tried to distract ourselves from the reality of it by trying to recall our home lives in what turned into a game of momentary escapism. Quietly, the children would huddle together and ask each other: \u201cWhat will you have for breakfast?\u201d And I remember saying: \u201cMaybe an egg or a piece of bread and butter,\u201d and tried to conjure up memories of home.     Susan Pollack\u2019s parents. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/Guardian    I vaguely recall the death march to Bergen-Belsen. I was so weak by then. The conditions were appalling and they\u2019d put us in a barracks. I remember crawling out of it \u2013 because by that time I was too weak to walk, but I couldn\u2019t bear to stay among the corpses any longer \u2013 and bumping into a neighbour who was as surprised to see me as I was her. Our British liberators were amazing \u2013 they were heroes for me in the real sense of the word. After their long battle to reach Belsen, they had a campaign to organise a rescue mission. To this day I\u2019m aghast that they were so saintly. They brought little ambulances in and drove around picking us up. I was trembling and virtually lifeless, lying near the barracks, the stench of corpses everywhere, and unable to walk or lift myself up, when they arrived with a little ambulance. I don\u2019t think I was able to talk to the soldier who approached me, my comprehension had long gone, but I remember the gentleness in him. We couldn\u2019t eat and I remember fainting when I tried to get out of bed. Gradually they administered the food, but I didn\u2019t trust anyone and I hid the food in my bed, afraid that they would suddenly take it away. Even now I feel that sense at every meal time of how lucky I am, and I often say to those at the table: \u201cIsn\u2019t this wonderful?\u201d and \u201c Aren\u2019t we lucky?\u201d After our liberation I went to Sweden where we were looked after marvellously. The physical recovery was not as bad as the emotional and mental one, which I\u2019m still working on. I am still touched by the memory of a doctor who taught me how to walk again, as through the malnutrition I was incapable. Such a simple thing, but he told me: \u201cI have a daughter like you,\u201d and how vital that statement of his was to my sense of becoming a human being again. It was amazing to be compared to someone having felt completely dehumanised for so long. After what happened, and having lost 50 members of my family, it was very important for me to have my own little family, to have again that sense of belonging. I really wanted to have children and was just 18 when I got married to a fellow Holocaust survivor from Transylvania. But I\u2019ve always been careful not to tell my children too much about what I went through so as not to traumatise them. They\u2019re entitled to a carefree youth, I always thought, and I didn\u2019t want to be spreading bitterness and hate.    I\u2019ve always been careful not to tell my children too much about what I went through so as not to traumatise them  Susan Pollack     I have had a good life. I was a Samaritan and I\u2019ve been going to schools and talking to 15-year-olds for the past 20 years. I try to tell them how small streams of hatred can quickly lead to unstoppable, horrific things, so they should stand up to any type of persecution or discrimination, whether bullying or malicious gossip. I did go back to my village, in 1995. But there was never any sense of any culpability and it seemed a futile exercise for me to try to find out who had betrayed us. Returning to Auschwitz is going to be a cold, painful and tearful experience. It is a shadow that has always been with me and I\u2019m hoping that by facing it for one last time at the age of 84 I will be able to live my life more peacefully, but I am extremely anxious. I lost my husband just days ago and I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll finally be able to release my emotions when I\u2019m there, as I\u2019ve never really been able to cry much about anything. I\u2019m comforted by the thought that there will be strength in numbers and that I\u2019ll be there with perhaps 100 or so other survivors, which makes it easier. I would not go on my own. I appear to be a strong person, but inside I\u2019m really quite fragile.  Mordechai Ronen, born in Dej, Transylvania, in what is now Romania, in 1933. He now lives in Toronto with his wife, Ilana.

Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images    We lived in a white-painted brick house on Kodur Street in Dej, which had a population of about 15,000, around a quarter of whom were Jewish. I was the youngest of five, and we spoke Yiddish within the community and Hungarian and Romanian outside. We had a garden and backyard, full of plums, peaches, cherries and apples. Among the smells of my childhood were my mother\u2019s goulash and the scent of Shabbat candles. My father was a merchant, a travelling salesman. My mother had the full-time job of keeping the house and family. I remember the lullaby she used to sing me, Schaefeleh, schluf mein tier kind (Sleep well, my precious little child). The synagogue or shul was the centre of communal life, and the centre of my life from three years upwards. I don\u2019t remember any overt antisemitism, just my parents warning me to be inside before dark: \u201cLest some Christian kids decide they don\u2019t like the look of your sidelocks and pick on you.\u201d I just thought my parents were being overprotective. We had no daily paper, no radio or phone, so the only news we got of the second world war was from newcomers to town. The change started at the end of 1942-43, when people began expressing their anger towards us, especially the Hungarian neighbours. We\u2019d hear: \u201cZsid\u00f3k, menjetek ki, Gyer\u00fcnk haza!\u201d (\u201cJews, get out of here, Go home!\u201d) I was in the synagogue singing when a rock shattered the stained-glass window. The rabbi tried to convince us it was just some drunk, but as a 10-year-old, I knew better. One day, four or five men came to our synagogue. They had escaped from Poland and came with stories we found impossible to believe \u2013 of Nazis rounding up Jews, looting their possessions, murdering them. People said the men were meshuggah (crazy). The only impact these stories had on my family was the cache of extra potatoes and bread that I discovered stashed away in our basement. But by 1943, we started getting clearer signs. My father\u2019s beard was shaved by some locals, who grabbed him. I stopped going to school. My parents gave me a lantern to carry with me after dark. Then I wasn\u2019t allowed out at all. One day the Hungarian gendarmes came to our house and ransacked it. In 1944, the Nazis ordered all Jews living outside Budapest to be rounded up and placed in ghettoes. Then it was our turn and that was the day our misery truly began. In the spring of 1944 we were part of a contingent of 7,500 Jews who were corralled into a makeshift ghetto in the Bungur forest. We had to wear the yellow stars of David. That was the day when almost one-and-a-half centuries of Jewish life in Dej came to an end. In our forest ghetto I remember a local man, Mihai, who brought his cow to help us out with milk, having heard we were starving. He was arrested and beaten to a pulp and remained a paraplegic for the rest of his life. Two weeks into our ghetto life, we were sent to Auschwitz, 435 miles north-west of Dej.     The Auschwitz fence. Photograph: Mondadori Collection/UIG/Rex    At this point my family was still together. They told the women and children to go to the left, and that\u2019s what my mother and two sisters did. My father and I were inspected by [Josef] Mengele, who was holding a baton, and went to the right. It was the last time I saw my mother and sisters alive. Other Jews responsible for telling us the rules approached us and said: \u201cFarvos inem gehenem zayn\u2019 du kumen aher?\u201d (\u201cWhy the hell did you come here?\u201d) \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear the warnings?\u201d I saw some soldiers toss a baby up and shoot it in mid air for fun and from then on I had no doubt about what awaited us here. I worked out pretty quickly certain survival tricks. That if the guards called us to line up in front of the barracks, I should hide or sneak into another barracks. The safest place I could find to hide was in the yard near the bathrooms where all the dead bodies were brought and piled up \u2026 I would get on the pile, lie down next to the dead bodies and pretend I was one of them. They gave us food in barrels. When the barrel was empty, I could get inside and scrape the leftovers from the bottom. In that way my dad and I got extra food. I remember the chimneys with dark, thick smoke rising from them; dogs barking all the time. From Auschwitz, they moved us to Birkenau, then to Mauthausen-Gusen. Every morning there were dead bodies along the barbed wire fences around the camp. The electrified fences instantly killed anyone who touched them. Perhaps these were simply acts of suicide.  When we were in Gusen penal camp, my father, who was 50, one day just gave up and said he couldn\u2019t continue. From that moment I was totally alone. In February 1945 they moved us to Gunskirchen, Upper Austria. It was here that I witnessed starving people eating human flesh. We were liberated by Americans and Canadians in Gunskirchen. The Germans had simply left the camp, and with an absence of drama we just walked through the gates. The first thing I did was to knock on a local resident\u2019s door and ask for permission to take a shower. Somehow, I managed to meet up with my brothers, David and Shuli. We had no desire to return to Dej, to the people who had betrayed us. I wanted to go to Israel, as that had been my father\u2019s dream, but it wasn\u2019t easy to get there. There was no independent Jewish state then and it was run by the British, who wanted to limit immigration. In Italy I joined the Irgun, the Zionist underground organisation fighting for Israeli independence led by Menachem Begin (later prime minister of Israel), and travelled with an arms smuggling ship, the Altalena, to Tel Aviv. All the time I kept with me my prison uniform, as proof of what had happened to me. We arrived on the shores of Tel Aviv on 20 June 1948 and I found myself at a pivotal moment in Israeli history, in a boat full of weapons that Ben-Gurion would not let on shore. It could easily have turned into a civil war. I was shot at by Israel Defence Force troopers as I jumped into the water and the Altalena was set ablaze and sunk by the IDF. With it sank my suitcase of clothes and my striped prisoner uniform, including my hat, coat, shirt and a knife. Henry Korman, 94, born in Radom, Poland. He now lives in Hanover, north Germany. He will be returning to Auschwitz for the first time, with the 17-year-old son of his nephew, Ethan. \u201cI had just finished high school in 1939 and had had all sorts of plans for my future. My family ran a hat factory, making hats for every occasion and purpose. But as the authorities began clamping down and the antisemitism grew, much of it fuelled by the Catholic church, gradually everything was confiscated \u2013 our house then the business. We tried to get out \u2013 we\u2019d seen the signs of what was to come, not that we could really have known the full extent of what would happen. My uncle had worked in Palestine in 1917 but had been forced to return to Poland when he got sick. We tried to use the contacts he still had there to escape, but the British (who were in control of it) wouldn\u2019t give us permission to go there. In my mind they carry a lot of the blame for the deaths of many of the Jews \u2013 especially the Polish Jews \u2013 who perished. We were sent to the Radom ghetto, where I spent the first years of the war working for the Jewish committee. But when they started taking the ghetto leaders to Auschwitz, I quickly changed jobs and began working in a munitions factory instead, hoping that if I kept my head down, I might be OK. But after moving from one factory to another, I too was deported to Auschwitz when the ghetto was liquidated in 1942. I was separated from my parents and three sisters, all of whom were taken to Treblinka.     The Auschwitz gate bearing the words Arbeit Macht Frei (Work Makes You Free). Photograph: Mondadori Collection/UIG/Rex    On our arrival at Auschwitz they chased us off the cattle wagon, which stopped right in front of the gate with the sign Arbeit Macht Frei (Work Makes You Free). I thought I was entering a labour camp, but little did I know. They asked me my profession, and I said painter as I\u2019d picked up the advice en route to say something practical and useful. If I\u2019d said I\u2019d just finished high school they\u2019d have sent me straight to the gas chambers. One of the first people I encountered was Mengele. He told us to undress and stand in line and he went through the ranks deciding who was strong and healthy and fit for work, and who was only fit for the gas chamber. After inspecting me, he put his thumb up high, so they gave me the striped uniform and sent me to get a number tattooed on to my arm. I don\u2019t remember the number. It\u2019s there still, but I never look at it because it brings back too many painful memories.     Dr Josef Mengele, left, with Rudolf Hoss, Commandant of Auschwitz, Josef Kramer, Commandant of Belsen and an unidentified German officer. Photograph: Universal History Archive/UN/Rex    After Auschwitz they transferred me to Mauthausen, then Gozen and Hanover. From there they sent us on foot to Bergen-Belsen, where I was finally liberated. It was 14 April (1945). I was so weak I could hardly stand and it was all I could do to lift my head slightly from the ground where I was lying as British army tanks started arriving to save us. But for all the great things the British did then, I can only say they made many other mistakes and what\u2019s going on in Israel now is largely Britain\u2019s fault. I also resent the Americans for knowing what was going on but doing nothing about it until 1944. As soon as Hitler wrote Mein Kampf they should have known what was going on. So I ended up in Sweden where I learned that my sister had also been in Belsen. In Stockholm I studied chemistry and it was there I found out, having lost all my family in Europe, that I had relatives in America, an aunt \u2013 my father\u2019s sister \u2013 who had emigrated in the 1920s, so I went to live with them. I\u2019ve never sought any counselling or professional help \u2013 I never thought it would help. My therapy has been to go and talk to schoolchildren about my experiences. My advice to them is to respect their teachers and have a clear plan for the future. I did go back to my home town, Radom, just once in 1996 or 1998. I saw our house, and stood in the backyard, but my heart was bleeding so much, I didn\u2019t dare go in. I walked up the street and it was like walking on history \u2013 something lost and far away, but also very close. Here was the road on which I used to run to school, to the factory, but I had to get away very quickly. I was thinking: \u201cI\u2019m here, but where are all of them, my family?\u201d    Auschwitz has been in my head all these years. I just need to close my eyes and instantly the horror comes back to me  Henry Korman     I now live in Hanover, Germany, which doesn\u2019t feel strange to me to be living in the land of the murderers, because it\u2019s a different country now. At least people listen to my story here. When I travel to the US nobody asks me, so I never say anything. But I have a hunch that as soon as his feet touch the ground in Auschwitz, my nephew\u2019s son will start to ask questions. I never dared to start my own family or have children of my own. I was just too afraid of making those close bonds. When your relatives die, there\u2019s usually a place you can go to pay your respects, like a cemetery with a grave where you can lay a stone and talk to them. The only place I have is Auschwitz and going back there for the first time will be the first and last chance I have to be able to return to the people I loved who I lost there and in other concentration camps. My family are always with me. I carry pictures of them in my pocket the entire time, wherever I go, even when I go to sleep they are with me. To this day I still don\u2019t know the circumstances of their deaths or even where they died. Auschwitz has been in my head all these years. I just need to close my eyes and instantly the pictures of the horror come back to me. I worry what will happen when I and others like me are no longer here to tell the story. I want people to keep reading about it and for them to leave tears on the paper.

Now it is claimed Sara Netanyahu also pocketed thousands of shekels from recycled bottles between 2009 and 2013. In what has quickly become known as \u201cbottlegate\u201d, the prime minister\u2019s wife is alleged to have instructed her staff to take empty bottles from state functions, at their official residence in Jerusalem, to a supermarket for recycling \u2013 and then hand the cash over to her. As the prime minister has himself confirmed, in 2013 Sara Netanyahu wrote a cheque to the state coffers for 4,000 shekels (\u00a3680), which he maintains is the total sum that had accrued at the residence from the bottles, which Sara had used as petty cash. However a former employee of the Netanyahus, Mani Naftali, is suing the couple for 1m shekels for various grievances, and claims the amount pocketed is much higher \u2013 more like 24,000 shekels. Since Sara Netanyahu is being treated as a private individual and not a government official, state comptroller Joseph Shapira handed the brief over to the attorney general, who has instructed police to begin examining the case \u2013 which could end in criminal charges. In a Facebook post responding to the claims, Netanyahu wrote it off as an old story that is being recycled by the media in an effort to try and topple his Likud party and bring a \u201cleftwing\u201d government into power in next month\u2019s election. Members of Likud\u2019s youth movement held a demonstration outside the Tel Aviv offices of Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth last week, to protest what they claim is the media\u2019s efforts to defame Netanyahu. In a separate matter, the state comptroller announced on Monday that he will publish a comprehensive report on the alleged exorbitant spending by the prime minister at his official residence and the excessive use of state funds for personal consumption. The report, prepared over the last eight months following complaints, is due to be published on 17 February, exactly one month before the election. Netanyahu\u2019s lawyer, David Shimron, was denied an appeal to have its publication delayed till after the election. Shapira told the attorney general, Yehuda Weinstein, that there is credible evidence the prime minister committed \u201ca violation of ethics that could amount to criminal offences\u201d, the broadcaster Channel 10 reported. A statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said \u201cit will be proven that everything was done legally\u201d. The allegations against Sara Netanyahu have opened up the floodgates to speculations on various aspects of the Netanyahus\u2019 lavish lifestyle. Reports said that the PM\u2019s residence spent 100,000 shekels on alcohol over two years. Tzipi Livni, co-leader of the opposition Zionist Union, took the opportunity to slam Netanyahu. \u201cThe price of the alcohol Netanyahu drinks in a month is like the monthly salary of nearly 1 million workers in Israel,\u201d she said at a public event. Netanyahu\u2019s lawyer released a statement claiming that in 2009 and 2010, only 88,964 shekels were spent on booze. Meanwhile, the journalist Raviv Drucker leaked a draft of another alleged Netanyahu graft case examined by the state comptroller over two years ago, known as \u201cBibitours\u201d. The report, which has not yet been published, claims that as finance minister a decade ago, Netanyahu\u2019s overseas trips were funded by private individuals and entities. Yet none of these scandals have affected Netanyahu at the polls, which in recent days show Likud ahead of Zionist Union. According to Prof Yedidia Stern, of the Israel Democracy Institute, there is a large gap between public opinion and the media. \u201cIsraelis don\u2019t trust the media or the legal system,\u201d he says. \u201cThose that have consistently voted for Netanyahu are not doing so because of his personality but because they don\u2019t see any substitute on the right,\u201d he said.", "publicationDate": "2015-02-04T17:51:48Z", "title": "\u2018Bottlegate\u2019 allegations fail to dent Netanyahu poll lead", "sentences": ["Members of Likud\u2019s youth movement held a demonstration outside the Tel Aviv offices of Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth last week, to protest what they claim is the media\u2019s efforts to defame Netanyahu."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/04/impropriety-allegations-fail-to-dent-netanyahu-poll-lead"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Palestinian territories", "US news", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "One of the few things most world leaders, and doubtless much of world opinion, can agree on is that they\u2019d like to see the back of Binyamin Netanyahu. The iciness of the relationship between Israel\u2019s prime minister and Barack Obama turned to permafrost long ago, but even Bibi\u2019s fellow rightists find him unbearable. Note the unguarded remarks of Nicolas Sarkozy picked up by an open mic in 2011: \u201cI cannot stand him. He\u2019s a liar,\u201d the then French president confided to his US counterpart. \u201cYou\u2019re fed up with him?\u201d said Obama. \u201cI have to deal with him every day.\u201d There was nothing much either of them could do about Netanyahu. Only one group of people \u2013 Israeli voters \u2013 can get rid of him, and on 17 March they\u2019ll have their chance. No doubt those outside Israel, given a vote, would find the decision straightforward: ejecting Netanyahu as punishment for last summer\u2019s Gaza bombardment, which cost more than 2,100 Palestinian lives, or for his continuing building of settlements in the occupied West Bank. But Israelis have a host of additional reasons to prise Bibi from the prime ministerial chair he\u2019s been glued to for nine of the past 19 years. A series of conversations I had in Israel this week made clear that close to the top of that list is his catastrophic handling of Washington, a relationship regarded as the bedrock of Israel\u2019s security. Netanyahu has alienated Obama personally \u2013 not least by hosting what was all but a campaign rally for his opponent Mitt Romney in 2012 \u2013 but has now infuriated the Democratic party too, by accepting a Republican invitation to address Congress in March, an initiative in which the White House played no part. Until now, US support for Israel has always been bipartisan. But Netanyahu\u2019s insistence on behaving like an honorary Republican has put that in peril. Likud leaders have wrecked US-Israeli relations before \u2013 famously Yitzhak Shamir in 1992 \u2013 and the voters booted him out as a result. But it goes further. Many Israelis, especially those who travel in, or do business with, the wider world are aware that their country is on course to becoming what one Israeli journalist described to me as \u201can isolated, pariah state\u201d. They know that Israel has to change course \u2013 to end the occupation and pursue an accommodation with the Palestinians \u2013 if it is not to be pushed further out into the cold. European parliaments voting to recognise Palestinian statehood, irritable Democrats in Washington: the signs are already there. Tellingly, a group of heavy-hitting business tycoons, Israeli and Palestinian, have formed a pro-peace group called Breaking the Impasse. \u201cIf we do not come to an agreement with the Palestinians, our ability to retain our economic success almost disappears,\u201d Yair Lapid, the outgoing finance minister and leader of the Yesh Atid party, told me at his regular corner table in a Tel Aviv cafe. The complaint against Netanyahu is not that he has failed to make peace or solve the problem \u2013 most know how hard that it is. It is that he offers no political horizon at all, merely an everlasting status quo. With Bibi it\u2019s all today, no tomorrow. I was told that Israel\u2019s military brass fear the West Bank could \u201cblow up this year\u201d, partly because Palestinians see no prospect of any change. Some insist such worries are the preserve of the elite. But the rest of Israeli society has its own reasons to dismiss Bibi. Israel has gone from one of the world\u2019s most equal societies to one of the most unequal in a generation, the gap between the super-rich and the rest widening each year. I met professional couples in excellent jobs who can\u2019t afford to buy a home without parental help. Mass social protests in 2011 proved how deep this fury went \u2013 but Bibi has done little to address it. Add to that the constant swirl of accusations about the Netanyahu household \u2013 including the upcoming findings of an investigation into the spending habits of the first couple \u2013 and it\u2019s not hard to see why a recent poll found that 66% of Israelis wanted him gone. The end of the Bibi era would be a clear boost for those desperate for change in the apparently never-ending Israeli-Palestinian conflict. My conversations with those hoping for a place in the next government were full of talk of new approaches, including thinking regionally: seeking an understanding with the wider Arab world, especially that part of it whose fear of a surging Islamic State might outweigh its unwillingness to engage with Israel. Those who have grown pessimistic about a deal with Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, can nevertheless imagine reaching a bargain with a coalition of Arab states, one that would include an Israeli pullback from occupied Palestinian territory. Banishing Bibi could unlock all sorts of possibilities. And yet few would bet it\u2019s going to happen. The polls have shown an uptick for Netanyahu\u2019s Likud in recent days, and that might be down to his opponents, a supposed dream ticket of Labour\u2019s Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni, the former foreign minister. A visit to their HQ suggested a low-energy campaign, lacking the sheer hunger necessary to oust a bare-knuckle fighter like Bibi. Herzog has a version of Ed Miliband syndrome: the smart scion of Labour aristocracy who just doesn\u2019t look like a prime minister. The Haaretz political correspondent Barak Ravid says Herzog is leading a \u201cbad campaign, that\u2019s disorganised, lacking in creativity and with nothing on the ground\u201d. He has failed to capitalise on the inequality issue or to channel the public\u2019s deep frustration, despite promoting several leaders of the 2011 protests to Labour\u2019s senior ranks. But the problem goes deeper. \u201cBibi is still the authentic voice of the majority of Israelis,\u201d says the author Tom Segev. The one thing no Israeli ever wants to be is a freier \u2013 a sucker, a naive fool who\u2019s taken in. Even if Israelis dislike Netanyahu and despise his wife, they don\u2019t fear that he will be a freier in negotiations with the Palestinians or anyone else. An Israeli electorate still on its guard, still anxious about personal security \u2013 however irrational that may seem to people far away \u2013 might well conclude that it\u2019s safer with Bibi than with the untested freier-in-waiting they detect in Herzog. This being Israel, everything could change between now and March 17. Labour only has to edge a single seat ahead of Likud for Netanyahu to be finished. But right now his opponents look like a team facing an open goal and poised to miss. They need to raise their game \u2013 and fast. Otherwise he will renew the lease on an office he has come to regard as his own. Of course a change at the top will arrive eventually \u2013 but Israel itself might have to change first.", "publicationDate": "2015-02-06T20:00:14Z", "title": "Israelis have a chance to dump Netanyahu.

The plot was reportedly thwarted because a Hezbollah security official was working undercover for the Israelis and tipped them off in advance. The date or location of the alleged attack were not published. Al-Arabi al-Jadeed, a London-based Arabic daily newspaper, broke the sensational-sounding but hard-to-verify story about clandestine warfare between bitter enemies from Beirut,  attributing it to unnamed political sources with close links to Hezbollah. Neither Israeli nor Hezbollah officials commented on the report, but there has been partial confirmation from an Israeli newspaper report that security around Olmert, now retired, had been tightened a year ago due to fears of possible retaliation for the killing of Imad Mughniyeh in Damascus in 2008. Haaretz gave no source for its story. As prime minister, Olmert launched Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon in 2006. Mughniyeh, Hezbollah\u2019s military chief, was held responsible for deadly attacks on American and Israeli targets in Lebanon and abroad over two decades. Until the emergence of Osama Bin Laden and al-Qaida in the 1990s he was probably the most wanted man in the Middle East. Mughniyeh was walking down a Damascus street in February 2008 when a bomb planted in a parked SUV exploded, killing him. Prior to the blast, a team of CIA spotters were monitoring his movements in the Syrian capital as Mossad agents remotely triggered the bomb from Tel Aviv, according to a recent detailed report in the Washington Post.  Al Araby al-Jadeed said the plan to kill Olmert, who was Israel\u2019s prime minister in 2008, was not carried out due to information provided by Mohammad Shawraba, a senior official in the external operations branch of the Iranian-backed Shia organisation. Shawraba was arrested several months ago by Hezbollah\u2019s internal security force and is said to have admitted to collaborating with Israel. Arab media have said he foiled attacks against Israeli targets in Azerbaijan, Turkey, Cyprus and Peru, with the information that he is said to have provided to Israel. In 2012 a suicide bombing attack that killed five Israeli tourists and a Bulgarian was blamed on Hezbollah. Shawraba, a businessman, was recruited by the Mossad in a \u201cwestern Asian country\u201d, according to a December report in the Lebanese daily al-Nashra. Hezbollah has not commented on those reports but has acknowledged that Shawraba was arrested and admitted working with Israel. Hassan Nasrallah, the group\u2019s leader, acknowledged this openly three weeks ago in an interview. According to the Washington Post, which quoted former US officials, the CIA and the Mossad were jointly responsible for the assassination of Mughniyeh. Last month, Mughniyeh\u2019s son, Jihad, also a high-ranking Hezbollah operative, was killed in an air strike in Syria that was widely attributed to Israel.

They obsess over ultra-rare Ethiopian jazz 45s from the 70s. They go to Japan and shell out thousands for a single piece of vinyl. Their houses (and spouses) are overwhelmed by the breadth of their habit. Some, like Gilles Peterson, take a targeted approach but still end up with 30,000 records in their possession. Others are completists who hoover up entire back catalogues without any regard for quality. Some collect as an investment or to make art projects, others for the sheer love of the music. Paz, on the other hand, is a casual collector. \u201cI like to have music on vinyl,\u201d he tells me, \u201cbut I don\u2019t need to have specific records. I\u2019m just a music lover really.\u201d An Israeli photographer who established his career in Tel Aviv, he moved to New York in 2008, just as the recession was kicking in. Out of work, Paz spent his free time haunting record shops and was drawn into the New York vinyl scene. The idea for Dust &amp; Grooves came about when he photographed the owner of Tropicalia in Furs, a now-defunct record shop in the East Village, picking out rarities and oddities for the camera. More collector portraits followed but there was no grand plan at first. \u201cIt was just a fun personal project for me,\u201d says Paz. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think about it as a book or even a proper website. Then the blog started generating a lot of reaction from the community \u2013 collectors were really excited to see other people\u2019s collections. So what started out as a photography project evolved into a cultural exploration.\u201d     Gilles Peterson photographed for the Dust &amp; Grooves book. Photograph: Eilon Paz    Whenever he travelled back to Israel or flew to Europe on a job, Paz would try to fit in a few interviews. Two years in, one of his subjects, the funk DJ King Britt, suggested he turn the project into a book. Paz was sceptical at first; it was only when he printed a batch of his photographs and laid them out on a table in his Brooklyn studio that he realised how much great material he\u2019d gathered. A Kickstarter campaign in 2012 gave the project a boost and helped fund a 35-day road trip around the US a year later. Having started with a focus on younger vinyl enthusiasts, many of them DJs, producers or label bosses, Paz began visiting old-timers such as Joe Bussard, who maintains a legendary stash of early blues and gospel 78s at his home in Maryland, and collectors with no direct involvement in the music industry: retired truck drivers, socialites, recluses.   Related: What does a \u00a32,500 record sound like?    Some were protective of their hoards and reluctant to let them be photographed, but by and large the vinyl community welcomed Paz\u2019s interest and repaid it generously. Sometimes too generously. \u201cWorking on these features, you get bombarded with information,\u201d he says. \u201cYou talk to a music nerd about the stuff they like the most and they get so enthusiastic, which is so much fun, but it can be overwhelming. So I made a rule to pick only one record [to track down] and only one learning experience from each collector.\u201d One story, told by the musician Joey Altruda, underlines for Paz the value of investing in vinyl in this age of digital intangibility. \u201cI asked him why he collects and he showed me a record that was given to him by his grandfather. That same record he\u2019s going to give to his son. This is something you cannot do with digital music. Of course you can move an MP3 around but it has no essence, you can\u2019t really hold it. Vinyl records, like physical books, you can give them away, cherish them, pass them along. A record can move through generations. It\u2019s a whole different experience.

Doron Myersdorf\u2019s solution takes only a minute. His Israeli company, StoreDot, has developed a battery that can be charged in 60 seconds which he says can end dead-phone dread because no handset will be lifeless for long. \u201cThe whole anxiety of your phone [going] dead goes away because if [recharging] happens in one minute, there is not an issue,\u201d Myersdorf says.  Although the StoreDot battery does not last as long as conventional phone batteries, its makers argue that the short charging time more than compensates. Myersdorf adds that handsets will become more innovative as a consequence.  \u201cOnce you have an unlimited battery \u2013 because this is what we are offering \u2026 your whole applications and your whole usage model of the phone changes so you have better devices which are more energy-hungry, you have more applications which do amazing things.\u201d The StoreDot battery system emerged from the nanotechnology department of Tel Aviv University, a by-product of research being carried out into Alzheimer\u2019s disease.  Researchers found interesting properties in a certain peptide molecule \u2013 a chain of amino acids \u2013 that affects neurons in the brain and causes Alzheimer\u2019s. It turned out that these molecules had high capacitance, the ability to hold an electrical charge.  When two of these molecules are combined, they make a crystal which is two nanometers in size \u2013 two billionths of a metre. These \u201cnanodots\u201d form the basis of the StoreDot technology. Because of their increased capacitance, they can make batteries which rapidly absorb and hold a charge.  That has led to a three-tier system from StoreDot for charging a mobile phone: the battery within the phone; a special charger which can pump a strong electrical current into the phone; and the system within the phone which manages power use efficiently . \u201cThe charger itself is not a normal charger. We need to pump 40/50 and up to 80 amps of current into this battery in order to charge in one minute. No normal charger can do that. So we had to develop a very strong charger that is, first of all, cost effective but also small enough to be carried in your pocket,\u201d Myersdorf said. Early examples of the battery, which weighs the same as current smartphone batteries, show a graphic dial on a phone lighting up as the seconds go past before finally reaching full capacity.  As the electronics industry is heavily focused on battery charge length \u2013 in everything from tablets to the new generation of wearable tech such as the imminent iWatch \u2013 the advent of any new form of battery attracts major interest.  Any debate about the features of a particular smartphone turns inevitably to the longevity of the battery.  As phones have expanded from the basic task of making calls and sending texts to filming and screening video clips, the demands on batteries have increased.  Users have been advised to turn the screen brightness down, switch to airplane mode and turn off Wi-Fi to save the battery during the day, as well as shutting down apps running in the background     Doron Myersdorf, founder and chief executive of StoreDot Photograph: Gali Tibbon/Handout    However, the new battery itself will not have a prolonged lifespan. The current generation of StoreDot batteries will last about one-third less of the time than those in standard smartphones at the moment.  This means that heavy users with a StoreDot battery will probably recharge their phone about once during the day. However, Myersdorf says their research shows that 60% of heavy mobile phone users leave the house with a charger at present anyway.  By 2018, StoreDot says that its battery will also outlast current smartphone batteries, which typically last a day, depending on how heavily they are used. If a manufacturer adopts StoreDot technology, it will add just over \u00a330 to the bill for a handset. Talks are taking place with 15 smartphone manufacturers with StoreDot wanting to sign launch agreements with \u201cone or two\u201d by the end of this year.  It hopes to have a phone with the battery system in the hands of consumers by Christmas 2016. The system cannot be retrofitted to an existing phone. \u201cThe problem is that there needs to be a sequence of developments which needs to take place in parallel to what StoreDot has done and these are a specially designed smartphone, a specially designed charger which is based on our charger, and a certification of the battery in terms of safety,\u201d says Myersdorf. \u201cFrom our analysis we believe that 30% of the people will pay a little bit more \u2013 roughly $50 (\u00a332) more \u2013 on the phone model if it charges faster.  \u201cIf one of the big guys [phone manufacturers] feels that this is a game-changer like we do, they put it on their roadmap. They can make it happen. StoreDot alone cannot make it happen.\u201d The main problem for users adapting to the new system would be to get people used to the idea of charging once during the day, he says. So far, the company has received $48m in funding from a number of investors including Samsung and Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich. The same technology can be used, according to StoreDot, to power up electric vehicles within five minutes.  A further investment would allow StoreDot to show they can power a car which would then be able to drive for 150 miles on that five-minute charge, says Myersdorf. Again, compared with rival products the StoreDot car battery would be more expensive although the price will inevitably come down as its popularity increases, he says. The technology can also be used to power brighter computer and smartphone screens.  StoreDot aims to penetrate 2% of the smartphone market in the first year after launch and 6% in the second, says Myersdorf. It is a market where well in excess of 1 billion units are sold each and every year, so a solution to dead phone anxiety could prove lucrative.

In a foreword to the latest issue, Gideon Joffe, head of the Jewish Community of Berlin, which publishes the magazine, wrote: \u201cIsraelis are beaten up in Berlin solely on the grounds that they are Israeli Jews. We are not yet \u2013 I repeat yet \u2013 at the stage where Jews are being murdered in Germany just because they are Jews.

There have been a handful of antisemitic attacks in Berlin in recent years. Most recently, 26-year-old Israeli Shahak Shapira was assaulted by Muslim youths on New Year\u2019s Day as he tried to film them. The magazine J\u00fcdisches Berlin, or Jewish Berlin, was first published in 1998, providing information about Berlin\u2019s community as well as articles on issues relating to Jewish life in Germany.

The recent deadly attacks in Copenhagen prompted Angela Merkel to reiterate the importance of Jewish life in Germany, and to call on Jews living there to stay. In recent months, there have been several reports in the German media about how safe Jewish people in Berlin feel, with some having reportedly stopped wearing the kippah in public.  Berlin police have said there was no rise in antisemitic attacks in the city in 2014, but Jewish schools, community buildings and cemeteries continue to be under round-the-clock police guard. At the same time, latest migration statistics show there has been an increase in the number of people emigrating from Israel to Germany, up from just over 2,300 in 2011 to more than 2,700 in 2013.

Over the past two years, he has risen through the ranks of the organisation to a leading role within the foreign jihadi corps that comprise a large part of the group\u2019s fighting force.   Related: The voice alleged to be that of Mohammed Emwazi from London - audio    He also played a lead role in the negotiations to free European hostages captured by the jihadis from 2012-13. Two officials involved in the discussions say the person they spoke to via Skype sounded identical to the person now identified as Mohammed Emwazi. \u201cJihadi John\u201d is one of a trio of Britons who held hostage Spanish, French, Danish, British and US nationals. The hostages were captured in northern Syria, some in Idlib province, others in Aleppo and a third group in and around Raqqa province, which has since become the main Syrian stronghold of Isis. The jihadi cell that spawned Isis was initially strong in Idlib province, having taken root there in the summer of 2012. From there it spread to Aleppo, where hostages that had been captured at that point were held in one of two locations \u2013 under the eye hospital in the centre of the city or in a factory deep in an industrial zone on its northern outskirts.  By February last year, all the hostages, including Briton John Cantlie, who is one of two remaining western hostages, were moved to Raqqa. It was in Raqqa that the hostages first became aware of the status that Emwazi had developed among Isis. One former hostage described him as \u201ccold, sadistic and merciless\u201d.       It is also widely believed that Emwazi played a leading role in the jihadis\u2019 IT security, which has been able to disguise the origins of all communications between Isis leaders in Raqqa and governments, or envoys, handling hostage negotiations. Both GCHQ and the NSA have been unable to penetrate the digital security network. When they have tried, communications from the group had been masked to appear as though they originated in Tel Aviv. It is believed that Emwazi\u2019s activities were largely confined to the area near Raqqa. He has not been injured during the US-led air campaign. He has been prominent in training camps held for new recruits west of Raqqa, where another senior foreign jihadi \u2013 an Australian \u2013 has frequently worked alongside him. The Australian is a sniper trainer. Emwazi has acted as camp leader. The camp, in an area called Muscana, was bombed by fighter jets in the weeks before Christmas.  While Emwazi has rank among the foreign corps and the trust of the leadership, he is a long way from the IS decision making group. \u201cHe is like a sergeant in an army,\u201d said a US member. \u201cIraqis run the state, Syrians are second and the foreigners will never get close to them.\u201d Though widely known within the foreign fighter ranks, few within Isis knew Emwazi\u2019s real identity. He was widely referred to by his nom de guerre, Abu Abdullah al-Britani. Two former Isis members who left the organisation late last year said that when would-be jihadis cross into Isis-controlled areas they are encouraged to focus on their new identities and eschew their pasts.   \u201cI saw him many times,\u201d said one former member. \u201cI knew it was him from his build and profile. The people with me knew who he was too. But we could not ask questions.  \u201cThat would have been too dangerous.

There\u2019s a big wooden terrace, where we eat whenever it\u2019s sunny. The floor is concrete with rugs, and the furniture is modern Danish. It\u2019s completely calm and restful.

My grandchildren are seven and four, and they\u2019re always running around and joining in the conversation, so meals together are quite crazy. I really like very simple, humble food. That said, my one luxury would be lobster, but in a miso soup. You make a vegetable stock of onion, celery, carrot and a touch of tomato, then cook lobster in the stock. Once done, strain everything and reduce the broth, then stir in the miso at the last minute. Then you return the lobster meat to the broth and top with a handful of chopped chives.

It\u2019s a dirty word, and in some parts of the world, a taboo. But everyone does it \u2013 the average person alone produces 72.5kg of faecal matter annually. Some of it gets treated, some of it is left to float around, but nearly all of it has an economic value. Last year, the UK\u2019s first bus powered by human poo hit the roads of Bristol and in January this year, the Janicki Omniprocessor, a machine that turns human poo into water was revealed. Janicki Bioenergy, the company behind the machine, is soon to ship a processor to Dakar, Senegal, where it will produce 10,800 litres of water. Here are some other examples of how waste is being integrated into sustainable, circular design and production with environmental and social benefits. Stools made from stools      There are seats made from urine and sand, so it\u2019s almost inevitable that there would be furniture fashioned from poo, or to be more precise, a mixture of horse manure, straw and other agricultural waste. The stools and lampshades, known as Terra, were the creation of Tel Aviv-based designer Adital Ela. Ela believes the idea could inspire the future of interior design and that anyone could eventually make their own household items from waste collected locally. After use, the objects can be remoulded with water or composted. She even envisages a future where the making process could become a craft and provide communities in developing countries with added income. Poo to the slaughter      In Kenya, Maasai pastoralists in Kajiado County are generating electricity for a slaughterhouse using byproducts from the animal killing process: blood, guts and even poo. The facility can pipe gas to local businesses, while any waste sludge is turned into fertiliser. The group of 320 pastoralists expect to sell cylinders of the gas from March. Each one would be priced at Ksh 700 ($8/\u00a35.20) \u2013 roughly half of the price of standard gas. Usually the slaughterhouse waste would be burned, so with more than 500 cattle and sheep being killed daily, the process will also ensure that a lot of methane doesn\u2019t enter the atmosphere. Let cow poo provide the power      In the future, poo won\u2019t just be the fertiliser that grows the fruit, vegetable and crops. It could also close the nutrient cycle by powering food production systems. A team of Stanford University PhD students are developing a low-cost machine for pasteurising milk that runs on methane from dung. According to Sarah Rizk, co-founder of the technology, Vorpal, a cow\u2019s poo can pasteurise 10 times the amount of milk it produces. By relying on the animal to power the biodigestor, the system can ensure that methane emissions are reduced, less milk is spoiled and farmers\u2019 incomes are boosted. \u201cThe cow provides all the power we need to pasteurise the milk. With this system, farmers can be fully self-sufficient and customers wouldn\u2019t have to pay [more to cover the costs of] electricity for pasteurisation,\u201d explains Rizk. \u201cWe use a high voltage pulse to directly kill bacteria rather than heating up the whole volume of milk. Because of this, we cut energy use in half.\u201d Writing on rhino poo      Standard paper production can use vast amounts of water and chemicals and emit high levels of CO2. A number of small businesses have found an alternative to energy-intensive virgin wood: elephant and rhino poo \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of it going around: according to the WWF, Indian elephants can excrete 220lb (100kg) of dung a day. Mumbai-based Elrhino is one of the businesses recovering the waste and converting it into a range of stationery. The dung is a perfect raw material because it\u2019s high in celluose (the main fibre used to make paper), explains ElRhino\u2019s co-founder Nisha Bora. The company manages the dung production chain from the sourcing and preparation to the selling. Bora says that \u201cthe art of making paper by hands is dying\u201d, so having control over the supply chain means they can train local women and young people to provide them with economic opportunities and skills. It currently has several dozen employees. ElRhino claims that the products sold are created using 44% less energy than virgin wood and generating 50% less waste. Run your vehicle on panda poo      Biofuels from corn can be worse than gasoline when it comes to carbon emissions, according to experts. Researchers from the Mississippi State University concluded that waste plant material, such as corn cobs and stems, would be ideal alternative sources, with a little help from a cute animal: the panda. Ashli Brown, who co-authored a report based on the research, presented at an American Chemical Society meeting, realised that the bear\u2019s poo could help in the process of converting the waste \u2013 it contains a number of microbes needed to break down the material, thanks to the bacteria in the bear\u2019s gut, which it uses to break down its diet of bamboo. The panda\u2019s ability to naturally convert material into the type of sugars that can be fermented into bioethanol is a sharp contrast to the current carbon-intensive options.

As he flew out of Ben Gurion airport, Netanyahu described his 48-hour trip to Washington as \u201ca fateful, even historic mission\u201d, which is to culminate in a controversial speech to Congress in which he will speak out against an emerging pact with Iran over its nuclear programme. \u201cI feel deep and sincere concern for the security of Israel\u2019s citizens and for the fate of the state and of all our people,\u201d he said. \u201cI will do everything in my power to ensure our future.\u201d Netanyahu will address the American Israel public affairs committee (Aipac) on Monday, before delivering his speech to Congress on Tuesday.  Dozens of Democrats are threatening to boycott the address and the White House will get its retaliation in first at Aipac on Monday when national security adviser Susan Rice urges Israel to give the benefit of the doubt to the international talks, which are aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, rather than pursue what she has a called a destructive intervention. \u201cThere is no question that the way the [Netanyahu] speech has come about has created a great deal of upset among Democrats in Congress ... it\u2019s created some upset outside Capitol Hill and frankly it may have upset some people in this room,\u201d Howard Kohr, Aipac chief executive, told the commitee\u2019s opening session.    I believe Israel is a lot safer with an agreement that\u2019s agreed to by all of the big powers including ourselves  Senator Dianne Feinstein     \u201cAll of us should be concerned that care so deeply about the bipartisan support for the US-Israel relationship, but ... when the leader of our greatest ally in the region comes to Washington to talk about the greatest challenge of our time, we urge members of Congress to hear what he has to say.\u201d Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday tried to calm tensions ahead of the speech but insisted the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic record with Iran entitles the US to \u201cthe benefit of the doubt\u201d as negotiators work toward a long-term nuclear deal.  Kerry said in an interview broadcast before he arrived in Switzerland for talks with Iran\u2019s foreign minister on Monday that Netanyahu was welcome to speak in the US and that the administration did not want the event \u201cturned into some great political football\u201d. More than 30 Democrats have threatened to skip the speech but even those planning to attend are angry that Netanyahu claims to be a \u201crepresentative of the entire Jewish people\u201d on the issue. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t at all speak for me on this,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein told CNN on Sunday. \u201cI think it\u2019s a rather arrogant statement. I think the Jewish community is like any other community; there are different points of view. \u201cI happen to believe Israel is a lot safer with an agreement that\u2019s agreed to by all of the big powers including ourselves, than it is if there is no agreement and if Iran decides to breakout. Then Israel attacks Iran, Iran attacks back, then what happens?\u201d The warning was echoed by the US administration, which has refused to send any representative to the speech or meet Netanyahu at the White House.    We are going to test whether or not diplomacy can prevent this weapon from being created  John Kerry,  US secretary of state     The secretary of state, John Kerry, said in an interview on ABC: \u201cI can\u2019t promise you we can [reach a nuclear deal with Iran] ... but we are going to test whether or not diplomacy can prevent this weapon from being created so you don\u2019t have to turn to additional measures including the possibility of a military confrontation.\u201d  But the evident tensions with the White House are relished by many Republicans, who see the clash as an opportunity to underline their support for Israel. John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives who extended the invitation to the Israeli prime minister, dismissed criticism that the controversy surrounding the visit had undermined Netanyahu\u2019s ability to make his argument. \u201cThe demand for seats in the house, the demand for tickets, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Everybody wants to be there,\u201d Boehner told CBS news. \u201cIt\u2019s been frankly remarkable to me the extent to which, over the last five or six weeks, the White House has attacked the prime minister, attacked me for wanting to hear from one of our closest allies.\u201d Netanyahu is also facing domestic criticism for his Washington demarche, which significantly comes just two weeks before an election in which the prime minister is seeking a third term. On Sunday, a group representing nearly 200 of Israel\u2019s top retired military and intelligence officials slammed the move as a direct assault on the US-Israel alliance, claiming it would actually bring Iran closer to a nuclear bomb. \u201cWhen the Israeli prime minister argues that his speech will stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, he is not only misleading Israel, he is actually strengthening Iran,\u201d Amnon Reshef, the former head of Israel\u2019s armoured corps and the founder of Commanders for Israel\u2019s Security, said at a press conference in Tel Aviv on Sunday morning. Reshef was joined by five other generals who called on Netanyahu to cancel his speech, warning of its dangers to Israeli security. \u201cIran wants Netanyahu\u2019s speech \u2013 since it understands that it will weaken Israel\u2019s bipartisan bond with the US,\u201d said Amiram Levin, ex-commander of the northern command and former deputy chief of the Mossad. \u201cFor Iran, a strategically weak Israel is an asset which will help Iran\u2019s efforts to obtain nuclear weapons, since they know that it will prevent a viable military option against them. \u201cI taught Bibi [Netanyahu] how to navigate and hit the target, but I\u2019m afraid to say that this time, Bibi missed. The target is Tehran, not Washington,\u201d he said.", "publicationDate": "2015-03-01T23:53:38Z", "title": "Netanyahu arrives in US to oppose Iran nuclear deal", "sentences": ["\u201cWhen the Israeli prime minister argues that his speech will stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, he is not only misleading Israel, he is actually strengthening Iran,\u201d Amnon Reshef, the former head of Israel\u2019s armoured corps and the founder of Commanders for Israel\u2019s Security, said at a press conference in Tel Aviv on Sunday morning."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/01/netanyahu-to-arrive-in-washington-to-deliver-controversial-congress-speech"}, {"tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Culture"], "article": "Mbongwana Star - Malukayi Mbwonga Star are in the same general ballpark as Ibibio Sound Machine.

There will be an album on World Circuit in April, followed by a European tour. Bring a bottle \u2013 not to drink, to bash along rhythmically.       Fever Dream - Serotonin Hit Fever Dream are a three-piece from London, although they could be from anywhere: their shoegaze/dreampop is redolent of the Thames Valley bands who used to do this sort of thing in their sleep, and they also recall the American sloth-rock wing (Dinosaur Jr et al), as well as today\u2019s guitar-haze purveyors, who are as likely to come from St Petersburg as they are from Reading. In fact, they have an album out in April, called Moyamoya, on Pinkshinyultrablast\u2019s label Club AC30, so if you like this MBV-ish blur of bass, drowsy drums and serrated guitar, make sure you start saving now.       Thomston - Collarbones Keep a couple of quid back for another April EP: Backbone, from Thomston. Born in London, raised in Auckland, managed by Saiko, who also looks after Lorde \u2013 one of these facts may have a bearing on Thomas Stoneman\u2019s future. Still only 19, the classically trained singer and producer\u2019s 2014 Argonaut EP has been streamed over four million times on Spotify, which augurs well for Backbone. Basically, if you like the idea of Sohn\u2019s slow, sparse moodtronica warbled by Justin Timberlake in a state of quiet nocturnal distress, you\u2019ll love what Thomston does.

The Young Professionals \u2013 TYP to their friends and family in Tel Aviv \u2013 comprise producer Johnny Goldstein and Israeli mega-star Ivri Lider, who is currently a judge on Israel\u2019s X-Factor. Their debut single was a version of Ottawan\u2019s D.I.S.C.O. \u2013 the original was written by Daniel Bangalter, dad of Daft Punk\u2019s Thomas, which makes sense because TYP peddle a similar kind of electronic quasi-disco to DP, with \u2013 if All Of It But Me is any measure \u2013 a novelty pop quality that would lend itself quite nicely to Eurovision, should they feel inclined. The guest vocals from Anna F make what was already infectious positively viral: think tATu frolicking with the Pet Shop Boys.            Lung Dart - B.OK Lung Dart (who recently soundtracked Simone Rocha\u2019s AW15 show at London Fashion Week, so prepare to be awed into trendy submission) are Tim and James \u2013 not to be confused with Tim from James \u2013 a London duo whose late-night laptop R&amp;B has been described as the missing link between Jon Hopkins and How To Dress Well. They don\u2019t just make warm soultronica \u2013 or at least, they do, but it\u2019s created from the least \u201cwarm\u201d sources: sounds, recorded on their mobile phones, ranging from wind from a hill in Leicestershire to a broken washing machine.

Youssou N\u2019Dour and Neneh Cherry \u2013 7 Seconds This 1994 duet saw the titan of African music, Youssou N\u2019Dour, team up with Swedish-born Neneh Cherry for a song that achieved the very rare feat of putting \u201cworld music\u201d at the top of mainstream music charts around the globe. Sung in Wolof, French and English, the song explores the first seven seconds of a child\u2019s life, when he is still blissfully oblivious to the politics of skin colour. Cherry and N\u2019Dour will both perform at Womadelaide \u2013 separately and, if we\u2019re lucky, together.

Traditional Korean instruments like the piri (similar to an oboe), the haegeum (a vertically-held instrument with two silk strings played with a bow) and geomungo (a Korean zither) are used to create a postmodern racket. Time of Extinction is an apt title for this ominous instrumental piece.

Luzmila Carpio \u2013 Misk\u2019i Takiy Anyone who has spent time on long-distance buses in the Andes will be familiar with the traditional huayno music piped over the PA system, soundtracking the hairpin turns on precipitous mountain roads.

Related: Spies, cover-ups and the mysterious death of an Argentinian prosecutor    The advert, framed in the light blue of Argentina\u2019s flag, also argued that the country should revive a controversial agreement with Iran which was at the centre of Nisman\u2019s explosive allegations against President Christina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. Nisman was found shot dead on 19 January, the day before he was due to give testify before Congress that Fern\u00e1ndez had conspired to cover up Iran\u2019s alleged involvement in a 1994 attack on a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires which killed 85 people. But the adverts which appeared on Wednesday said that Nisman\u2019s allegations were \u201cplagued with contradictions and a lack of logic\u201d, and cast doubt on the late prosecutor\u2019s motivation.  \u201cCould there be any hypothesis other than that he was trying to destabilise politics?\u201d it asked.  The prosecutor had alleged that a 2013 memorandum of understanding (in which Iran and Argentina agreed to to jointly investigate the bombing) was the fruit of secret negotiations in which Fern\u00e1ndez agreed to shield five Iranian officials in return for trade concessions.  The memorandum was never ratified by Tehran, and last year an Argentinian court declared the deal unconstitutional, but Wednesday\u2019s adverts argued that the deal still offered the best hope for clarity over the bombing. Iran denies any responsibility for the attack on the Amia Jewish centre; nobody has ever been convicted over the bombing.  \u201cIn this context, it is only possible to ratify the path drawn by the executive branch and congress through the memorandum of understanding, a tool that would enable us to interrogate the Iranian citizens accused,\u201d the advert said.  \u201cThis situation would put the Argentinian state in a better position regarding Iran and the international community to demand extradition or negotiate a trial in a third-party country.\u201d  Last week Judge Daniel Rafecas dismissed Nisman\u2019s 298-page accusation,  saying there was \u201cno document, no testimony, no intercepted phonecall\u201d to support the allegations. But on Wednesday morning, prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita, appealed to a higher court to overturn Rafecas\u2019s ruling. Rafecas is a controversial figure, having been removed from a previous case involving alleged wrongdoing by the Fern\u00e1ndez administration.  A major judicial scandal erupted in 2012, when it was revealed that, while presiding over a corruption investigation into Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s Vice-President Amado Boudou, he had given advice to defence lawyers on how to proceed in the case. A higher court ruled that there was a clear conflict of interest, and removed Rafecas.  Fern\u00e1ndez has always denied Nisman\u2019s accusations, and since his death, she has continued a one-sided confrontation with the late prosecutor. On Sunday, she upped the stakes with the suggestion that his death had somehow benefited Israel in its opposition to nuclear talks between US and Iran. \u201cThe US is currently negotiating a nuclear agreement with Iran, with strongopposition from the Republican Party and Israel,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said in a speechto congress referring to Nisman\u2019s death as part of a Middle Easternconspiracy unfolding on Argentinian soil. \u201cDoesn\u2019t anybody link thesethings?\u201d During the four-hour speech, Fern\u00e1ndez also seemed to revive a theory that Israel was itself responsible for another unsolved bombing in Buenos Aires - the 1992 attack on the Israeli embassy which left 29 dead. \u201cThat was on Israeli soil,\u201d the president said, referring to the embassy\u2019sextra-territorial status. \u201cI still can\u2019t understand why the state of Israel demands [justice] for Amia but not for the blowing up of its own embassy.\u201d The comments prompted a swift reply from the Israeli embassy in which it reaffirmed Tel Aviv\u2019s demand for justice in the unsolved attack.

Attached to most were handwritten signs decrying Israel\u2019s cost of living and other social issues. Tiny in comparison to the social protest camp that occupied this same spot four years ago \u2013 when half a million Israelis joined demonstrations against the country\u2019s high prices and social inequalities \u2013 on Wednesday lunchtime there were just five people in the camp. A few passersby, some in fancy dress ahead of Purim holiday, stopped to the read the signs: a man wearing a jaunty green Robin Hood cap with a red feather; some men in judo outfits. At one point a male voice shouts at the protesters: \u201cGet a job!\u201d If there is a paradox about the small scale of the protest, it is to be found in the fact that the complaints the campers represent are the biggest issues concerning voters in elections that take place on 17\u00a0March, with 56% of Israelis telling the Knesset Channel that they will vote on socioeconomic issues. By comparison, the threat of a nuclear Iran, the issue embraced by rightwing prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu in his campaign for re-election almost to the exclusion of all others, has been much further down the list. The reality is that an overwhelming media focus on the figure of Netanyahu and Iran has created the impression of a peculiarly dissonant campaign where the concerns of ordinary Israelis have been sharply at odds with the political narrative imposed from above. It has been a campaign, by and large, where it has often seemed that the figure of Netanyahu \u2013 and the question of whether he should continue in office \u2013 has sucked the air out of the debate. On Wednesday those sitting in the camp told stories familiar to most Israelis: of the struggle to find and pay for accommodation; the impossibility of buying somewhere to live; and of holding down several jobs at once to pay for necessities. Tal Jacob and Ronen Ratner arrived when the camp was set up last Sunday. Wearing an Adidas sports cap, Ratner says he has two jobs. On the minimum wage, he says: \u201cAn hour\u2019s work is enough to buy a plate of falafel. The basic problem is the cost of living. It is very expensive to live here.\u201d Hillel Konigsberg arrives with a bandaged wrist wearing a black T-shirt with yellow Hebrew lettering reading: \u201cThe people demand social justice.\u201d A driver, who grew up on the Bogside in Londonderry to mixed Catholic and Jewish parents before moving as a young man to Israel, he injured his arm two and a half months ago. Unable to work, he has struggled to make ends meet and feed his wife and baby, who have also spent time at the camp. \u201cWe are all facing the same problems,\u201d he says, disclosing he has begged for food on Facebook. Government statistics released last week underline the scale of the problem, and not just for Israel\u2019s poorest, but for its battered middle class too. According to the central bureau of statistics, 41% of Israelis are in a constant state of overdraft with more than a third owing at least 10,000 shekels (\u00a31,650), and most blaming the high cost of living. As a hard-hitting report by the state comptroller revealed last month, house prices have rocketed in the last six years by almost 55% and rents in the same period rose 30% even as wages have remained largely stagnant. Dahlia Scheindlin, an independent pollster and political consultant who has worked in the past with the Labour party, headed by the main opposition leader Yitzhak Herzog, says there is \u201cno question\u201d that social issues are at the forefront of Israelis\u2019 concerns across the political spectrum. And in theory at least, the importance of social and economic issues should benefit the Zionist Union \u2013 the party jointly led by Herzog and former justice minister and chief negotiator with the Palestinians Tzipi Livni, who have been marginally leading Netanyahu\u2019s Likud in most recent polls. A survey released on Friday, asking the voting intentions of Israel\u2019s poorest voters, suggests Herzog\u2019s party leads far more convincingly among the lowest economic sector. The same issues have also bolstered support for two smaller right-leaning centrist parties \u2013 Yesh Atid, led by former finance minister Yair Lapid, who was catapulted on to the political stage after the 2011 protests,\u2013 and the new Kulanu party led by former Likud minister Moshe Kahlon, who some believe could be the king maker in negotiations to form a coalition after the elections. The issue of social justice has also propelled former leaders of the social protests \u2013 including Stav Shaffir, now Israel\u2019s youngest MP \u2014 to high spots on the Zionist Union\u2019s list, suggesting its continuing potency, even if it can no longer draw half a million on to Rothschild. \u201cIn all polling that has been done, the cost of living and housing issues are number one, usually by a double-digit gap,\u201d says Scheindlin. \u201cThat is pretty big, although you have to remember that in Israeli politics, people\u2019s electoral choice is influenced by more than just their first policy priority.\u201d Explaining why people have not come back to the streets as they did four years ago, she says that the phenomenon of the 2011 social protests bucked a trend at a time when participation in all kind of demonstrations in Israel was declining, benefiting perhaps from the fact that they took place during the summer when people could join in. \u201cIn the elections that followed there was a choice \u2013 did people go for change or Netanyahu? They went for Netanyahu and hoped to bring change by electing newer parties under Netanyahu promising social change. The system bent \u2013 it didn\u2019t break.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s response has been either to attempt to avoid the issue or distract from it. Following the report on high housing costs, he was widely lambasted for responding on Twitter with remarks about Iran. \u201cWhen we talk about housing prices, about the cost of living, I do not for a second forget about life itself. The biggest threat to our life at the moment is a nuclear-armed Iran.\u201d On Friday too, in another widely criticised misstep, an internet video advert put up by Likud lumped together disgruntled port workers along with Hamas as \u201cvictims\u201d of Likud\u2019s policies, leading to the video being quickly pulled. And whoever wins on 17 March will find untangling Israel\u2019s woes complex. The feted \u201cstartup nation\u201d is burdened with defence costs as a proportion of GDP far higher than many of its competitors, while it has subsidised the development of settlements in occupied Palestinian territories at the cost of spending inside Israel. Interest groups, from the settlement movement to the ultra-orthodox on the issue of state subsidies and education, have carved out deeply held and self-interested positions that any coalition must negotiate. Although Netanyahu will be boosted by figures released on Friday by the OECD, showing Israel\u2019s staggeringly high food prices in recent years have for the first time begun to drop by an annual 4.1% in the last year, some feel it may be too little and too late. Manuel Trajtenberg is the economist who chaired the committee to look into the country\u2019s socioeconomic problems after the 2011 protests \u2013 first triggered by outrage over the high cost of cottage cheese. These days he is Herzog and Livni\u2019s pick to solve the economic problems. He believes that the electorate\u2019s priorities are changing. \u201cIn these elections the socioeconomic issues are really important, contrary to the past where issues relating to conflict were prominent. What we saw in the mass protests in summer 2011 was that there is complete mismatch in Israel between macro-economic issues and micro-economic ones, especially around welfare. \u201cIn the first respect people have been doing very well and the signs are positive on all sorts of issues from employment to the balance of payments. But at the same time there has been this explosion of public discontent with people demanding social justice. And not just marginalised people, the usual suspects. We are talking about the mainstreams of society. \u201cNetanyahu has focused on the macro side and lost sight of whether it helps the wellbeing of people. But the concept of trickledown is not working and inequality has been increasing because the cost of living, including housing prices, have skyrocketed in the last six years in real terms.\u201d Trajtenberg, like others, blames in part the increasing dysfunction in the coalition cabinet system that, under Netanyahu, has seen key ministerial positions subcontracted to being run along the basis of party interest, lacking a joined-up strategy. Back on Rothschild Boulevard, the small cluster of protest campers are dubious, not least Konigsberg. \u201cThe situation got worse, not better after 2011. We embraced the politicians who came to support us. We were stupid,\u201d he says bitterly. Whoever is elected he does not hold out much hope. \u201cI blame them all,\u201d he says.", "publicationDate": "2015-03-07T20:41:05Z", "title": "On the streets of Tel Aviv, it\u2019s the price of falafel, not Iran\u2019s bombs, that matters", "sentences": ["On a small dusty section of the strip in the middle of Tel Aviv\u2019s Rothschild Boulevard last week a dozen tents were set."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/07/israel-netanyahu-election-campaign-cost-living-housing-iran-bombs"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "Tens of thousands of Israelis attended a rally in Tel Aviv\u2019s Rabin Square on Saturday evening to call for the prime minster, Binyamin Netanyahu, to be replaced in elections later this month.

Israel police estimated around 40,000 attended the rally, while the organisers claimed the number was closer to 80,000. Michal Kestan-Kedar, the widow of a lieutenant-colonel killed in last summer\u2019s war in Gaza, pleaded with Israelis to vote for a leader who would not send soldiers into another war. \u201cYes, Mr prime minister, what\u2019s important is life itself, but it\u2019s impossible to speak all the time about Iran and to turn a blind eye to the bloody conflict with the Palestinians which costs us so much blood,\u201d she said on the stage.

To motivate them to vote, to not be apathetic. To vote for change.\u201d One Million Hands has been conducting an online campaign since elections were called in December to get 1 million Israelis to sign a petition to oust Netanyahu. So far they have around 260,000. The Likud wrote the rally off as part of the left\u2019s campaign to depose Netanyahu. \u201cThe [rally\u2019s] goal is to replace the Likud government led by Netanyahu with a left government headed by Tzipi and Buji that will have the support of the Arab party.\u201d  The latest polls show Netanyahu\u2019s Likud and the Zionist Union neck and neck.

Two new polls suggest a lead of three to four parliamentary seats for the Zionist Union, with internal polling from both parties indicating a wider gap.   A text message sent to Likud activists, imploring them to get friends and relatives to vote on Tuesday, reads: \u201cWe are in danger of really losing!\u201d   It goes on: \u201cWe must save the day and make sure that every single one of our friends/acquaintances/family makes it to the polls on election day and votes for the Likud. Wake up!\u201d Herzog, the Labour leader who has formed an electoral alliance with former justice minister Tzipi Livni under the Zionist Union banner, has been running neck and neck with Netanyahu, who is campaigning to serve a fourth term as prime minister. Under Israel\u2019s system of proportional representation which invariably produces coalition governments, Netanyahu still has an advantage. But in the last days of the campaign, there is a new sense of optimism among Zionist Union\u2019s supporters and MPs. At a campaign meeting on Tuesday in Be\u2019er Sheva, in the Negev desert, Herzog told a gathering of the faithful, the curious and a handful of supporters of other parties that he represented hope for those who felt excluded within Israel\u2019s dysfunctional economy and for those who sought the possibility of peace. He and Livni promised to end Israel\u2019s increasing isolation in the international community.     Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog addresses a rally in Be\u2019er Sheva.  Photograph: Peter Beaumont for the Guardian/Peter Beaumont      According to MP Erel Margalit, Zionist Union supporters were buoyed by the large turnout at an anti-Netanyahu rally in Tel Aviv at the weekend and by leaks of internal surveys that suggest Netayanhu\u2019s position is worse than published polls suggest.  \u201cI\u2019ve become optimistic in the last few days,\u201d Margalit said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t so optimistic before. In the last few days I have felt a sense of building momentum. I feel a change is coming. People want a leadership based on something else than fear.  \u201cThe sense of fatalism that has been around in a large part of the campaign \u2013 people thinking that whatever happens they will get Netanyahu as prime minister again \u2013 I think that is what has changed.\u201d Aron Klipper, 71, a retired engineer echoed Margalit\u2019s sentiments. \u201cI\u2019m here because we desperately need a change of atmosphere in Israel. We need young people to be able to earn enough and afford places to live,\u201d he said. But with six days to go before the election, a key question is whether Herzog can defeat Netanyahu when it comes to the post-election horse-trading over forming a government.  In the tortured electoral mathematics of Israel\u2019s coalition-building, Netanyahu still has a theoretical marginal advantage with six potential parties he can negotiate with to form a government, against Herzog\u2019s five.     Young supporters of Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog cheer as he enters a rally of supporters in the Israeli town of Be\u2019er Sheva on Tuesday night. Photograph: Peter Beaumont for the Guardian/Peter Beaumont     Among the factors that will come into play is whether some of the smallest parties \u2013 including the leftwing Meretz \u2013 win enough votes to meet the electoral threshold for representation in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. And if the election turns out as close as the polls currently suggest, President Reuven Rivlin could insist on negotiations for a national unity government embracing both Likud and Zionist Union. Herzog has tried hard to increase his visibility in a campaign dominated by the personality of Netanyahu, not least in a long interview with the author and columnist Ari Shavit that sympathetically depicted the opposition leader munching peanuts for energy on the campaign trail and visiting Likud strongholds.  The stall Herzog has laid out has been a practical and emotional soft nationalism, open to negotiating a two-state solution with the Palestinians, and seeking a pragmatic middle way through Israel\u2019s problems.  \u201cI am a social democrat who wants both a free market and a just state. I am a pragmatist who tries to act fairly. I try to bring the contradictions into harmony and unity,\u201d he told Shavit.  In contrast, rivals have often sounded inflammatory appeals, not least foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman on disloyal Israeli Arabs: \u201cThose who are against us, there\u2019s nothing to be done \u2013 we need to pick up an axe and cut off his head.\u201d  In the last days of the campaign, Herzog has aimed his fire most heavily at the area where Netanyahu is seen as being most vulnerable \u2013 his failure to deal with Israel\u2019s domestic problems.   But the party of his roots \u2013 Labour, the dominant political force in the early years of the Israeli state \u2013 has not occupied the prime minister\u2019s office since Ehud Barak in 1999. Before that Israel had returned only one Labour prime minister since 1977 - Yitzhak Rabin. \u201cIt used to be the thing that parties were from the cradle to grave,\u201d said Einat Wilf, a former Labour MP and author of a book on Israel\u2019s electoral system.  \u201cNow they are built on shifting sands. People make their decision at the last minute or people vote for different parties from election to election. \u201cOne reason is a global one: the end of ideology. So the party machines have declined and everywhere it has become much more personal.

It compiled film and testimony gathered by volunteer field researchers on the ground, tallied daily casualty figures that were used by the local and international press, and released names of individual Palestinians killed by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). B\u2019Tselem\u2019s founders intended it to serve a purpose unlike any other organisation in Israel\u2019s fractious political atmosphere: to provide pure information about the Israeli military\u2019s treatment of Palestinians, without commentary or political agenda. But by last summer, this stance had become a source of controversy. For many Israelis, identifying human-rights violations by the Israeli military, but not its enemies, was tantamount to treason. When B\u2019Tselem tried to run radio ads listing the names and ages of 20 Palestinian children killed in Gaza, Israel\u2019s national broadcasting authority banned them on the grounds that they constituted a political message masquerading as neutral information. A group called Mothers of Soldiers Against B\u2019Tselem was formed; Avigdor Lieberman, Israel\u2019s foreign minister, endorsed one of their protests. That morning on the radio, the host, a journalist named Sharon Gal, pressed El-Ad over and over to agree that he believed Hamas is a \u201cterrorist organisation\u201d. El-Ad reminded Gal that B\u2019Tselem, by its very core principles, declined to make that kind of characterisation because it believed doing so would be a political act. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about armed Palestinian organisations; that is the professional term, and we criticise their activities when they are illegal,\u201d he said. Gal responded that Israel was locked in a battle for its survival; at such a moment, he argued, refusing to call Hamas a terrorist group was a political \u2013 and disloyal \u2013 act. Newspaper columnists were still talking about it a month later. \u201cHagai El-Ad has essentially become a Hamas apologist,\u201d one declared. Three and a half months after the end of the Gaza war, in early December, I met El-Ad at Talbia, a wine bar beneath the Jerusalem Theatre. Forty-five years old, he looks barely over 30. He has a soft, almost hushed voice, glasses that press down on the tops of his ears, making them flop over like wings, and a frequent, mirthful smile. \u201cDon\u2019t sneeze,\u201d he laughed, as a waitress propped a cork under a wobbly leg of our table, creating a fragile balance. El-Ad arrived at B\u2019Tselem last May after spells as the director of Jerusalem Open House, Jerusalem\u2019s premier gay-advocacy group, and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel. B\u2019Tselem, in Hebrew, means \u201cin His image,\u201d from the line in the Book of Genesis: \u201cAnd God made man in His image.\u201d El-Ad possesses a fierce belief in Israelis\u2019 ability \u2013 and duty \u2013 to live up to their human godliness by being just and manifesting an expansive empathy. \u201cI self-identify as a Jew who cares deeply about the Jewish future and the Jewish identity,\u201d he told me. \u201cTo be Jewish is to treat people with dignity.\u201d He grew up in Haifa, on the Israeli coast, and takes as the basis for his personal creed an anecdote from a visit Golda Meir paid to the city during the 1948 Israeli war for independence, when she noted that scenes of Palestinians fleeing their homes reminded her of images of Jews fleeing Poland before the second world war. \u201cIf Golda Meir could notice the similarities,\u201d he said, smiling, \u201cthen anybody can recognise Palestinians as human beings who ought to be treated with equal rights.\u201d For someone who holds these views in a society that does not, legally, extend legal rights to all Palestinians under its rule, El-Ad is also strikingly unemotional. He lays out his moral reasoning in proofs. Before he made a career change to work for the Jerusalem Open House, he was on track to become one of Israel\u2019s leading scientists, accepted into an exclusive honours programme at Hebrew University called the Amirim. His subject was astrophysics: in the late 1990s, he spent several years on a fellowship at Harvard, studying parts of space void of galaxies. He left with impeccable English and the eyes-on-the-stars, even-keeled nature to appear on another radio show the morning after the Sharon Gal showdown and say the same thing, in the same neutral tone: \u201cWe criticise Hamas\u2019s activities when they are illegal.\u201d     Hagai El-Ad, the director of B\u2019Tselem, an Israeli human rights group. Photograph: The Guardian    El-Ad has taken over B\u2019Tselem at a precarious moment in its history. The group\u2019s employees have always identified with the Israeli left and believed that the military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza must end. They have also, historically, argued that it was important to remain objective and dispassionate in their work, to avoid full-throated political activism, in part because they believed neutrality would make their information impossible for Israelis to dismiss. But if that has turned not out to be true \u2013 if it is less and less accepted in rightward-drifting Israeli society that there can be such a thing as non-political information, and B\u2019Tselem\u2019s traditional activities are dismissed as treason \u2013 what point is there in trying any more? Why not embrace their true beliefs and take projects such as the radio ads in a stronger, more explicitly political direction? It\u2019s a bind. For such a turn would enable Israelis to dismiss the group further: to say, it\u2019s not us, it is you who has changed. Already, after the Gaza war, El-Ad told me, \u201cpeople come to us and say, \u2018You\u2019ve lost us. You\u2019ve become too extreme.\u2019 We get that all the time.\u201d * * * When El-Ad gave me a tour of B\u2019Tselem\u2019s office, in a residential neighbourhood not far from Jerusalem\u2019s German Colony, he drew my attention to two things: a long, floor-to-ceiling bookshelf filled with film of decades of protests and incidents in the West Bank and Gaza, the heart of the group\u2019s work; and the many international awards B\u2019Tselem has won. Inside the main conference room is the newest trophy, the 2014 Stockholm Human Rights Award, a heavy statuette El-Ad lugged home from Sweden in November. B\u2019Tselem was founded at a moment of concern over the face Israel presented to the world. When the first Palestinian intifada began in 1987, the sight of strikes, boycotts, and protests across the West Bank and Gaza distressed many Israelis. Until then, they had believed Palestinians were happy to be out from under Jordanian rule and that the Israeli military occupation was relatively \u201cmild and light\u201d, in the words of Einat Wilf, a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute and former Israeli Labor party member of parliament. For Israelis like herself, Wilf told me last December, the government\u2019s harsh reaction to the protests \u2013 Yitzhak Rabin, then the Israeli defence minister, instructed the 80,000 Israeli troops deployed into the West Bank to \u201cbreak [the protesters\u2019] arms and legs\u201d \u2013 created an appalling \u201creversal of images\u201d that deeply unsettled the sense of moral rightness Israelis had held dear since the country\u2019s birth out of the ashes of the Holocaust. \u201cThe Palestinians were wielding the slingshot and the Israelis were in tanks,\u201d she remembered. \u201cIt upended the Israeli founding myth, which was built on the David and Goliath story. There was a lot of questioning whether we are the ones who are right and they are the ones who are wrong.\u201d In response, a group of a hundred prominent politicians and intellectuals, including the novelist AB Yehoshua and the law scholar Amnon Rubinstein, signed a petition calling for the creation of a human-rights watchdog that would help Israelis police their own behaviour. \u201cWe wanted to try and to gain more direct and clear information about what was going on,\u201d Haim Oron, a politician and one of the members of B\u2019Tselem\u2019s founding body, told me. \u201cThere was a lack of verified information that wasn\u2019t propaganda.\u201d Oron was also a founding member of the Israeli NGO Peace Now, which advocated a total withdrawal of Israeli settlements and the military from the areas they had occupied after the 1967 six-day war. He believed the main obstacle to that withdrawal was most Israelis\u2019 ignorance of the real conditions in the West Bank. Once they knew, he thought, they would elect governments dedicated to a two-state solution.     A protest in Tel Aviv against Israel\u2019s attack on Gaza in 2014. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images    This was called the \u201cawareness theory\u201d. To influence the widest range of Israelis, he felt it was crucial that B\u2019Tselem \u201chave a claim to non-partisanship\u201d. In 1990, an interview in the Guardian with another B\u2019Tselem founder noted that \u201cthe far left and the lunatic fringes have been deliberately excluded from its board\u201d. B\u2019Tselem\u2019s early work establishing incident records during the last several years of the first intifada was widely quoted in the local and international press, and more quietly relied upon by the Israeli army, which checked its own list of fatalities against those compiled by B\u2019Tselem. The group was never uncontroversial, but it was also \u201ccentral\u201d, said Amir Tibon, a prominent Israeli journalist with the website Walla! News. Throughout the rest of the first intifada, which ended in 1993, and for the remainder of the 1990s, the group issued casualty information sheets (\u201cTotal fatalities in Intifada reaches 422. 27 killed in April. Nearly 700 houses destroyed\u201d), reports on incidents between the IDF and Palestinians, and dispassionate analyses of various technical aspects of military occupation. Often topped by a single quote from article 3 of the universal declaration of human rights, \u201ceveryone has the right to life, liberty and the security of person\u201d, the reports were dry in tone, heavy on numbers, and fastidiously situated within a sense of objective morals. A 1990 report on the occupation\u2019s education system began with a Hebrew University professor\u2019s explanation of the concept of the right to education throughout human history; a 1997 investigation of allegations of torture by Israeli interrogators included an exhaustive reprinting of penal codes. * * * A few days after I met El-Ad in the wine bar, I drove with him and his lead field researcher, Kareem Jubran, a burly, chain-smoking B\u2019Tselem veteran, out of Jerusaelm towards a region in the West Bank called Bir Nabala. Late autumn, but still warm, the old city\u2019s green caper-bushes tumbled like the wild hair of a mermaid down the white-stone ramparts. Tour buses spilled out pilgrims in T-shirts. Minarets stretched alongside cypresses to touch the sky. At a stoplight, a cluster of Haredim in their black felt hats hurried across Jerusalem Brigade Street as a backpacker with a guitar loped in the other direction. El-Ad, sitting in the back of the car, leaned into the space between the two front seats and tapped me on the shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s the Jerusalem Cinematheque,\u201d he said. He wanted to point it out because it was a local treasure, completed in the early 1980s and a hub for arty Jerusalemites \u2013 but also because it illustrated a concept he had been thinking about a lot lately: the deeply abnormal nature of the whole of Israeli society, despite its superficially normal, even happy appearance. In 2011, he explained, the Israeli parliament passed a piece of legislation called the Nakba Law. Supported by right-leaning NGOs, it authorised the government to penalise any state-funded institution for organising events connected to Nakba day, which Palestinians observe alongside Israel\u2019s independence day, in mid-May, to commemorate their displacement at the founding of the state. (\u201cNakba\u201d means \u201ccatastrophe\u201d.) \u201cIf a budgeted entity spends part of its resources on commemorating the Nakba, then the minister of finance has the authority to deduct up to three times the amount on the said action,\u201d El-Ad said. No institution had yet run afoul of the law. But, to understand it, El-Ad continued, we needed to take a flight of the imagination. \u201cIf I\u2019m the director of the Jerusalem Cinematheque,\u201d he said, \u201cand you suggest a film festival with documentaries of the Nakba, I have to think: it could cause me trouble. So I just don\u2019t do it. And it\u2019s not even going to be in the news. You\u2019re not going to know about it.\u201d \u201cSo,\u201d he concluded, as we zipped over a hill and the theatre vanished from sight, \u201ceven an institution like the Cinematheque isn\u2019t free in this country. It operates under restrictions. But people don\u2019t see that.\u201d He and Jubran wanted to show me Bir Nabala because it represented a change in the focus of B\u2019Tselem\u2019s work \u2013 an effort to make visible what has remained out of sight for Israelis. There have been no recent incidents between the IDF and Palestinians in Bir Nabala. But the security barriers Israel has built since 2000 have divided what was a fairly contiguous swath of territory into what El-Ad called \u201cbubbles\u201d: areas separated by gates, walled highways leading to Israeli settlements, and checkpoints. Farmers had been divided from their olive groves, and passages between villages that used to take 10 or 15 minutes now took hours, requiring roundabout drives through traffic-choked Ramallah. The goal of showing me Bir Nabala, El-Ad said, was \u201cto expose the daily reality of the occupation. How things are, day in day out, year in year out, for Palestinians.\u201d Last October, B\u2019Tselem published a report on Burqah, an area of the West Bank just east of Ramallah, to illustrate the daily humiliations of Palestinian life under Israeli military control. \u201cWe chose to focus on Burqah precisely because it is unexceptional,\u201d the report says. A \u201crather unremarkable village,\u201d it nevertheless \u201cendures severe travel restrictions [and] massive land grabs,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe Israeli authorities always put the interests of the settlers and the settlements before those of the Palestinian population.\u201d The report begins with a biting piece of testimony from a Palestinian Burqah resident, highlighted in a grey box: \u201cWe think a thousand times before we build, go on vacation, study, work, trade, or grow crops. It\u2019s not because of laziness, or inability. It\u2019s because of concerns about the obstacles, about harassment and attacks by the Israeli military or by settlers. It\u2019s as if we live in a big prison, with invisible walls.\u201d Before we descended into Bir Nabala, we stopped on a ridge and got out to look at the valley that stretches out from northern Jerusalem up to Ramallah. Behind us was Ramot, an old Israeli settlement of red-roofed houses. \u201cIn 1982, for 17 days, I was a construction worker here,\u201d Jubran said, and gave a short laugh. The valley was a patchwork: pale-green hills striated with chalky ribs of rock, olive groves, and a geometrical square or two of dark pine. Starting in the 1900s, Jews have planted more than 240 million trees all over the Holy Land. It\u2019s one of the things Israelis are proudest of about their country: Israel is one of only two nations on Earth that ended the 20th century with more trees than it had at the beginning. Locals mention it to tourists all the time. \u201cNot a small number of forests in Israel are planted over destroyed Palestinian villages,\u201d El-Ad told me as we gazed down at the pine grove. On many weather-friendly weekends for the last decade, he\u2019s competed in the amateur sport of orienteering. Organisers set up a navigational course through different terrains and woodlands, which competitors navigate using only a map and a compass. \u201cIn the beginning, I was so naive,\u201d he smirked. It took him a long time to realise the ruined walls that made for such interesting way-points along the courses were relics of what he now views as a tragedy.  El-Ad grew up with virtually no awareness of Arabs. On the slope of Mount Carmel, where his father, a journalist and environmentalist, had settled the family, \u201clife was 100% Jewish,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed completely natural.\u201d As a \u201cgeeky\u201d young boy, he loved Star Trek and Israel in equal measure. Of all the Israelis I\u2019ve met, he still retains some of the purest eagerness about the country\u2019s landscape and innovative spirit. His Facebook page features photographs he takes of natural features in the Negev desert. During my visit, he peppered me with restaurant recommendations, touting a new inventiveness in Jerusalem cuisine. At age 10, he queried his father about \u201cthe terrible thing that happened in 1948 with the Arabs that you were not supposed to ask about.\u201d His father said, \u201cThere was a war, many of them fled, some were convinced to leave, and some were forced.\u201d It was a turning point for him. \u201cThat last bit: \u2018Forced.\u2019 At that time, in 1979, the [Israeli founding] story didn\u2019t have that many holes in it. The first crack in the story is a very powerful moment.\u201d After coming out as gay while at Hebrew University, he involved himself in the gay student union, becoming its chairperson in 1997. The organisation welcomed both Jewish and Arab students. \u201cI began to get a bigger picture\u201d of life in Israel, he said. His experience in gay activism also gave him the idea that an initial backlash against changes in Israeli society could, in time, die down. At the 2005 Gay Pride march in Jerusalem, a religious objector stabbed three marchers with a kitchen knife; in 2006, the march required the second-largest police mobilisation that year in the country after the disengagement from Gaza. After that paroxysm, though, much of the opposition vanished, he remarked. \u201cNow they accept the change of status quo in the city.\u201d His growing awareness of the Palestinian condition corresponded with the unfolding of the Oslo peace process, which seemed to bring glimmers of hope. In 1999, he told me, B\u2019Tselem convened a conference on the occasion of its 10th anniversary. It was called \u201cWhither B\u2019Tselem?\u201d \u201cThey thought about all the possible things B\u2019Tselem could do once Israel doesn\u2019t control the West Bank. One was simply shutting up shop. Another was transferring the organisation and its assets to a Palestinian group. Another was transferring the organisation into Israel and applying its expertise to another human-rights issue, like domestic violence.\u201d He wasn\u2019t there, but the conference has become a piece of B\u2019Tselem lore because it seems, in retrospect, fantastically naive. * * * Down in Bir Nabala, off the Ramot ridge, the weather changed. There were far fewer trees; the heat rose and made beads of sweat pop out on our faces and the backs of our necks. Dust swirled around the Qalandia checkpoint, a huge bottleneck of beat-up cars and sagging trucks that divides East Jerusalem from Ramallah. It was midday, and the drifting grit had the effect of making things look brighter, catching and holding the sunlight like the dust-plumes around a star. It was so bright that El-Ad, Jubran, and I squinted at each other.     Israel\u2019s separation barrier in Jerusalem. Photograph: APAImages/REX    The famous barrier Israel has been constructing to separate Jewish population areas from Palestinian areas is often referred to as a \u201cwall,\u201d calling to mind an unbroken rampart, like the Great Wall of China. In fact, it is many walls set at angles to each other, this way and that. Some are tall, some are shorter. Some are mesh, some solid. The West Bank is increasingly penetrated by Israeli settlements, and as more settlements and roads leading to them are built, the more the wall becomes a labyrinth. We stopped before one section, overlooking some olive groves. It was steel netting topped with barbs. Far in the distance, we could see Jerusalem, high on the hill from which we had come. Beyond that fence, the Bir Nabala \u201cbubbles\u201d become smaller and smaller. A walled-off highway divides the bigger bubble, a formerly bustling commercial area, now sepulchral thanks to its separation from Jerusalem, from a smaller one. A heavy gate with a security camera divides that smaller bubble from the smallest one, which is nothing more than a single home surrounded on all sides by the Israeli settlement of Givon Ha\u2019Hadasha. We paid a visit to that final bubble. It was almost surreal: a rather elegant, terracotta-roofed home, with herb gardens and children\u2019s SpongeBob SquarePants shorts fluttering on a laundry line, entirely enclosed by heavy steel webbing some eight metres tall, like the protective netting around a kid\u2019s backyard trampoline, or a birdcage. Unlike his neighbours, the house\u2019s owner, Sabri al-Ghorayeb, refused to move to make way for the Israeli settlement, and he had the paperwork he needed to prove he had a right to stay. Six children, five boys and one girl, ran back and forth along one length of the fence, looking out at Israel. \u201cThe wall encloses them,\u201d El-Ad said, setting up one of his proofs. \u201cBut what\u2019s less easy to see is that it encloses Israelis, too.\u201d On our way to al-Ghorayeb\u2019s house, we had driven under the Menachem Begin Expressway, a sleek intra-Jerusalem freeway that also helps link the city to settlements to the north. El-Ad had asked Jubran to stop the car. He got out and, for several minutes, stood and stared up at the overpass. \u201cI\u2019ve driven on the highway so many times, and I wanted to be close to it from the other side,\u201d he said when he climbed back into the car. The highway was surrounded by its own high walls. \u201cWhen you pass through,\u201d he said, \u201cyou see nothing of what\u2019s here below. You only see the concrete borders.\u201d * * * The events of the last 15 years have created new emotional barriers between Israelis and Palestinians to rival the physical ones, and dramatically narrowed the space for public debate in Israel over matters of security. The writer Yossi Klein Halevi documented the change in an essay published last year in the New Republic: \u201cI moved to Israel from New York in 1982 ... and Israeli society was tearing itself apart\u201d over the asymmetrical war the army was fighting in Lebanon, he wrote. By contrast, this summer, \u201caccording to one poll, 95% of Jewish Israelis backed the war with Hamas \u2013 this, in a country where there is rarely consensus on anything.\u201d Einat Wilf, the former Labor member of parliament, was one of those transformed. \u201cI belong in terms of my upbringing to what\u2019s called traditional Labor Zionism,\u201d she said. \u201cI was of the view in the \u201880s and \u201890s that the day the Palestinians get their own state is the day we have peace ... Like many people of my background, though, the last 15 years have been years of growing scepticism and the rethinking of what the conflict is really all about.\u201d First came the 2000 Camp David summit. Both Ehud Barak, then the Labor party prime minister, and Bill Clinton publicly blamed the failure of the Camp David talks, and the final collapse of the Oslo process, on Palestinian unwillingness to accept a two-state solution. Wilf called that moment \u201cdevastating\u201d to the Israeli left, because it was Barak, a liberal, who shattered the concept that Palestinians could ever be good-faith negotiating partners. Shortly after that, the second Palestinian intifada broke out. Unlike the first, it pushed the conflict into Israel. In 2001, there were 40 bombings within Israel, many of them suicide bombings, up from five in 2000. In 2002, there were 47.     A sunken road on the West Bank. Photograph: Dirk-Jan Visser/Hollandse Hoogte/eyevine    A sense of normalcy in ordinary life is something Israelis treasure, visible in the atmosphere of the trendy German Colony near B\u2019Tselem\u2019s offices, where people tuck into pasta on fairy-lit patios. The second intifada\u2019s targeting of restaurants and buses contributed to the sense that what Palestinians could not endure was the everyday routine of Israeli life. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018What do they want?\u2019\u201d Wilf recalled. \u201cIf they want a state in the West Bank and Gaza, I\u2019m prepared to support their cause in Israel. \u201cBut if what they want is for my life not to exist, then I will fight them. And the amazing thing is where the first intifada was a time of kind of moral grey and moral questioning, the second intifada \u2013 and this is why the left collapsed politically \u2013 was a moment of moral clarity. A lot of Israelis said, \u2018If you\u2019re telling us we need to choose between them and us, then we choose us, without any compunction.\u2019\u201d Everyone I spoke to about B\u2019Tselem acknowledged that the second intifada had made the group\u2019s fundamental message \u2013 that Israelis ought to care about the human rights of individual Palestinians and recognise the military occupation\u2019s abuses as the primary human-rights violations in the region \u2013 much, much harder for Israelis to accept. Yaron Ezrahi, a liberal professor of political science at Hebrew University, told me that in the past 15 years the Israeli public had come to believe that the Palestinians are \u201contological adversaries\u201d, possibly bound to oppose Jewish Israelis forever. The answer is to contain them \u2013 and wall off one\u2019s own heart. An old friend of mine who moved years ago from the US to Israel remarked that he consciously avoided interactions with individual Arabs because it would weaken his political resolve against them as a collective, which he believed was necessary to protect his family\u2019s safety. Back inside the bubble of Bir Nabala, we drove past a statue the residents had recently erected. Shaped like the entire territory of Palestine, it said, \u201cThe history of my homeland teaches me that blood draws the borders.\u201d Even the B\u2019Tselem employees agreed that the last decade had hardened Israeli concerns about security. \u201cWhen a million and a half Israelis are in and out of bomb shelters fearing Qassam rockets, it\u2019s hard to talk about human rights,\u201d Sarit Michaeli, B\u2019Tselem\u2019s spokesperson, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about the human rights of somebody who deliberately ran over someone\u2019s family member.\u201d Jubran, towards the end of our drive, suddenly confessed that \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a place for real peace in the region here.\u201d Another B\u2019Tselem field researcher, Iyad Hadad, pointed to the rising support among Palestinian intellectuals and activists for \u201canti-normalisation,\u201d which encourages Palestinians not to work with Israeli groups at all. To explain why Israelis feel they are in an existential struggle to survive, Wilf pointed to events like a student rally last November at Al-Quds University in East Jerusalem, which, according to an account published in the Atlantic, \u201cfeatured actors playing dead Israeli soldiers and a row of masked men\u201d making a \u201cstiff-armed salute\u201d. I have spent the past six years working in South Africa, and my experience of that country is that a great deal of what appeared to be existential antipathy against white South Africans vanished once whites no longer controlled black people\u2019s movements. Wilf told me she could only entertain the human-rights message of B\u2019Tselem once she felt absolutely certain Palestinians had accepted that Jews \u201care indigenous to the land of Israel, that they have emerged from it, that they have returned home\u201d. \u201cWhat will lead them to accept that?\u201d I asked. \u201cTime,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Israeli power.\u201d * * * One sunny morning on Ammunition Hill in Jerusalem, the site of some of the bloodiest fighting in the six-day war, I met Ronen Shoval, a blue-eyed former philosophy student from outside Tel Aviv, who has dedicated himself to bolstering Israeli power. The hill now houses a museum honouring the IDF. \u201cThe purpose of the IDF is to ... foil attempts by its enemies to disrupt normal life within the State of Israel,\u201d a plaque declared. A month and a half earlier, three blocks away, a Palestinian drove his car into a light-rail station, killing a baby. Shoval, born in 1981, experienced the 1990s in Israel as a time of unsettling, even disappointing, calm. His grandfather fought in the Haganah, the early-20th-century Jewish militia that preceded the IDF. \u201cWhen I was 16 years old, I had the feeling I was born in the wrong time,\u201d he told me, as we settled into a little amphitheatre displaying a map of the Israeli military\u2019s successes. \u201cWe had already created Israel. We won the 1948 war. I couldn\u2019t even fight in the [1973] Yom Kippur war. Everything had already happened. Then, buses started to explode because of Oslo. I began to understand I didn\u2019t only have to read history. I could take part in history.\u201d Shoval came to believe Israelis risked a dangerous complacency towards the threats they faced and had lost faith in the beauty of Zionism. \u201cIt was a miracle, that we came home after 2,000 years,\u201d he said with emotion. In 2006, he decided to create Im Tirzu, a lobby group dedicated to promoting a \u201csecond Zionist revolution.\u201d Like B\u2019Tselem, Im Tirzu takes as the inspiration for its name a Hebrew phrase central to Israeli life: Theodor Herzl\u2019s famous line, \u201cIf you will it, it is no dream.\u201d Just like Hagai El-Ad, Shoval said he believed Israelis had a unique moral duty. \u201cTo be what\u2019s called in the Bible a light unto the nations,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I close my eyes and think about Italy, I have an idea of pasta. If I close my eyes and think about America, I think of capitalism. If I close my eyes and think about Israel, I think of moral character.\u201d For Shoval, though, that means a love for Zionist ideals, rather than a bent for self-criticism. \u201cWe are fighting against people who tell you it\u2019s not OK to love your land, it\u2019s not OK to have pride in your heart, day after day,\u201d he said. Because self-defence is essential to Israeli survival, he said, any human-rights organisation that repeatedly and principally criticises Israeli soldiers ultimately espouses the view, \u201cLet\u2019s cancel Israel as a Jewish state.\u201d This critique is supported by the current Israeli government. In the campaign the Israeli elections on 17 March, Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party released an advertisement that shows two black-flag-waving Isis fighters hurtling along a highway in a pickup truck. They stop to ask an Israeli motorist for directions to Jerusalem. \u201cGo left!\u201d the motorist replies, as they cheer and fire guns into the air. \u201cThe left will give in to terrorism,\u201d it concludes. \u201cIt\u2019s us or them.\u201d Though Im Tirzu\u2019s explicit mission, according to its own website, is to build \u201cpositive Zionism\u201d, it largely works to tear down groups like B\u2019Tselem. \u201cB\u2019Tselem is at the tip of the spearhead against Israel,\u201d Shoval told me. Im Tirzu writes pamphlets, drives social-media campaigns against human-rights groups, and, in happy-warrior style, openly embraces cloak-and-dagger tactics to demonstrate that outfits like B\u2019Tselem constitute a fifth column to be resisted by any means necessary. In 2013, it emerged that Shoval had hired private investigators to dig up dirt on the leaders of several human-rights organisations. When asked by a lawyer whether he had personally dispatched spooks to the offices of the New Israel Fund, a US-based NGO \u201cdedicated to religious pluralism and civil rights in Israel,\u201d he replied, \u201cNo, but it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Im Tirzu is one of a number of organisations founded after Oslo\u2019s collapse that treat human-rights groups as Israel\u2019s subtlest but most dangerous enemy. There\u2019s NGO Monitor, which critiques both international and local humanitarian groups for presenting a skewed picture of Israelis as the perpetual oppressor and Palestinians as the victims, and the Israel Project, which \u201cfights to get the truth out about Israel\u201d. These groups are now players in mainstream politics: in the upcoming election, Shoval is a parliamentary candidate for Jewish Home, the insurgent religious Zionist party led by the current minister of economy Naftali Bennett. Netanyahu himself has identified Israel\u2019s chief problem as one of \u201chasbarah,\u201d or PR. That\u2019s why the fact that B\u2019Tselem\u2019s figures about Palestinian injuries and deaths at the hands of Israeli soldiers are so regularly quoted in the western press \u2013 something that gave the group credibility at its founding \u2013 now provokes particular distaste. \u201cDuring the Gaza war, Hagai El-Ad was going from al-Jazeera to the BBC attacking our right for self-defence,\u201d Shoval spat, when I asked him about El-Ad. \u201cI have children aged eight, four, and two, who were sitting in bomb shelters, terrified. And he was criticising the IDF, which wants to preserve my life. He is a traitor.\u201d    I have children aged eight, four, and two, who were sitting in bomb shelters, terrified. And he was criticising the IDF    Sarit Michaeli, the B\u2019Tselem spokeswoman, described the Israeli public atmosphere in which the group operates as a \u201cboxing ring\u201d. The melee last summer over the radio ads reading the names of dead Palestinian children was a turning point. \u201cWe thought it was the most banal thing imaginable,\u201d she claimed. (\u201cEveryone tries to claim they\u2019re nonpolitical, but everyone is always political,\u201d Wilf told me. \u201cTo think otherwise is naive.\u201d) The ads did essentially reproduce, in spoken form, B\u2019Tselem\u2019s very first press releases in the late 1980s, which listed the names of Palestinians killed in the first intifada \u2013 publications for which the group won plaudits. But in the contemporary moment it was banned as an act of incitement. Michaeli also thought El-Ad had approached his radio interview with Sharon Gal in a manner keeping with B\u2019Tselem\u2019s core principles. \u201cB\u2019Tselem doesn\u2019t use the term terrorist. We don\u2019t use that kind of language. But that was twisted into accusing him of being a terrorist sympathiser.\u201d As the left has become publicly marginalised, its ideas about what would be required for peace have become more radical, making the right\u2019s assertions that the left wants to dismantle Israel as we know it a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. On a walk El-Ad and I took together through Jerusalem\u2019s new Train Track Park, a historic railway converted into a pedestrian path decorated by benches and plantings, he pointed out the whitewashed houses that abutted the park, the fragrant citrus trees, a man in Spandex zipping by on a racing bicycle. It\u2019s important to understand all of this could be imperilled in a just solution, he said. \u201cIt will be tremendously difficult, and dangerous, and costly, and challenge basic assumptions of people here in a broad array of ways. And ask deep questions about Jewish privilege here in this society.\u201d When I asked El-Ad whether he thought a moral society in Israel could remain Jewish, it was the closest I ever saw him to expressing anger. \u201cI think the narrowing of Jewish identity to demographics \u2013 that\u2019s profoundly un-Jewish,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWhen you build a wall in this city to expunge, reject, thousands of people on a demographic basis, that\u2019s un-Jewish.\u201d \u201cWhat is Jewish?\u201d I asked. \u201cTreating people with dignity,\u201d he answered. \u201cI think that\u2019s enough.\u201d * * * In mid-December, I had a conversation with Raja Shehadeh, the Orwell prize-winning Palestinian writer and lawyer, who founded Al-Haq, the Ramallah-based human-rights group that shared the 1989 Carter-Menil Human Rights Award with B\u2019Tselem. Throughout B\u2019Tselem\u2019s 25 years of existence, he said, \u201cthey did excellent work\u201d, noting a particular report on \u201cthe theft of land and explaining the law. It was very clear and very helpful. It was very good for them to do that report.\u201d But, he added, \u201cthe effect, in tactical terms, of this report was nil\u201d. Shehadeh wondered whether in continuing to espouse the principle of neutrality in a society that decreasingly recognises the possibility of it, B\u2019Tselem was trying to \u201cpreserve something that isn\u2019t there. It might be time to consider taking the thing further and crossing that [neutrality] border. And calling for an end to occupation and perhaps even supporting a recourse to international courts. Or how about a public discussion on how Israeli society is unwilling to consider the human aspect of their neighbours?\u201d He paused. \u201cOf course, that will also be politicised,\u201d he added.     An Israeli soldier photographs a riot in the West Bank city of Hebron on March 6, 2015. Photograph: Mussa Issa Qawasma/Reuters    On our walk through Train Track Park, El-Ad and I stopped for a minute and gazed together at the houses lining the route. Their window-shutters were shut up tight against the heat, disclosing nothing within. \u201cIn my most optimistic moments, the violent backlash [against B\u2019Tselem] I see as a sign of weakness,\u201d he remarked. He said he believed the public image of a singular, closed Israeli mind disguised a more complex reality: that behind sealed shutters many Israelis still objected to the military occupation but kept quiet. Everywhere I went in Israel, I was struck by how much the private discourse among ordinary people differed from the public stance of martial unity. It became difficult to believe the single poll claiming 95% of Israelis backed the war, or at least that they backed it unreservedly. A great range of Israelis, young and old, expressed serious reservations about the whole way their country related to Palestinians. But they felt there was no political alternative, no way to make a difference; 15 difficult years after Oslo\u2019s collapse, there no longer appeared to them to be any other solution besides this fraught containment. The left\u2019s political energies have drained out of the security situation and into intra-Israel issues like food prices. \u201cIsraeli society is self-involved,\u201d Shehadeh told me. \u201cThere is a security problem. They believe they\u2019re in an area where nobody wants them and nobody accepts them. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a possibility this will change through more reports \u2013 whatever level these reports may be \u2013 reports won\u2019t make a difference. I think the only thing that will make a difference is if the sense of impunity is broken.\u201d El-Ad, though, still believes it\u2019s possible to reach people, to persuade them of the necessity of deep changes. He told me he wants to \u201cnarrow the space of avoidance\u201d between Jews\u2019 moral duties and their actions. \u201cPeople need to make a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cFive hundred children died in Gaza. These are the consequences of the way things are here.\u201d In this way, he remains a liberal Zionist at a time when this species has almost completely faded from view. But an aspect of the classical stance, the hesitation to be combative, is changing. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided we need to get in Israeli society\u2019s face,\u201d he told me. In the coming months, B\u2019Tselem will be \u201cmaking a shift from \u2018just facts\u2019 to a place that also speaks a language which is more emotional.\u201d This January, B\u2019Tselem released its final report on the recent Gaza war. Instead of legalese, it began with a beautifully written, heart-wrenching personal story of one Palestinian family\u2019s experience at the hands of the IDF. \u201cI lost my whole family, and my home. I have nothing left,\u201d the segment began. The report concluded that the killing of civilians became \u201cone of the appalling hallmarks\u201d of the Israeli military campaign in Gaza and that the military appeared to have targeted residential homes on purpose. At a press conference, El-Ad emphasised the report\u2019s conclusion that the Israeli military violated international humanitarian law. In keeping with Ronen Shoval\u2019s fears about B\u2019Tselem\u2019s impact on the narrative coming out of the Middle East, the assertion was reported by al-Jazeera and the BBC. \u201cIsraeli Group Says Military Attacks on Palestinian Homes Appeared to Violate Law\u201d was the headline in the New York Times.

The last polls in the election campaign, published on Friday, suggested Herzog\u2019s party was continuing to creep ahead of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud, with its two-seat lead a week ago doubling to four. Under Israeli election rules no polls can published in the last four days of the campaign, so the parties must now wait until exit polls are released at 10pm on Tuesday. The top-selling Israeli daily Yedioth Aharonot showed Likud\u2019s main challenger, the Zionist Union coalition, winning 26 of the 120 seats in parliament against 22 for Netanyahu\u2019s party. A second poll published jointly by the Jerusalem Post and Maariv dailies showed the same four-seat gap between the parties, with the Zionist Union winning 25 against 21 for Likud. Both gave third place to the Arab-Israeli Joint List with 13 seats. Herzog and Netanyahu are now battling for a handful of seats that will determine who will lead the country.  Despite his party trailing in polls, under Israel\u2019s electoral system Netanyahu may still find it easier to form a right-leaning coalition and stay in power. Much depends on who two centrist parties led by Yair Lapid and Moshe Kahlon decide to back. At the finale of a closely fought campaign, both Netanyahu and Herzog used interviews to reject suggestions they could alternate power in a national unity government. With evidence that Netanyahu has failed to inspire his political base, the media strategy seems designed to scare wavering Likud voters \u2013 or those considering voting for another party \u2013 to turn out on Tuesday. Following mounting criticism from within his own party over his campaign, Netanyahu has granted a series of interviews to the Israeli media in which he has conceded that he risks losing the election. Supporters of Israel\u2019s rightwing parties also plan to rally in Tel Aviv\u2019s Rabin Square on Sunday in an event organisers have said they hope Netanyahu will attend. With the relative balance between the two main blocs of political parties from which a coalition might be formed still so close, the last four days of the campaign are regarded as crucial, not least in an electorate where perhaps upwards of 20% of voters are expected to decided who they will back during this period. Netanyahu has continued to pursue his strategy of warning that an Israel without him at the helm would be in danger. \u201cI think our security is at great risk because there is a real danger that we could lose this election,\u201d he told the Jerusalem Post in an attempt to reverse the drift of voters away from him.  \u201cIf the gap between the Likud and Labor continues to grow, a week from now Herzog and [Zionist Union partner Tzipi] Livni will become the prime ministers of Israel in a rotation with the backing of the Arab parties. That will cause such a monumental shift in policy that it will endanger the security of Israel \u2013 and anyone who wants to stop it has to vote Likud to narrow the gap. \u201cThere is no privilege now to vote for other parties,\u201d Netanyahu added. In his interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 2 repeated the claims he has made in recent days that \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d had been channelled from \u201cEuropean states\u201d and from \u201cleftwingers overseas\u201d to prevent his re-election.  \u201cThere are governments that oppose me and want to bring down the right,\u201d he said.", "publicationDate": "2015-03-13T09:33:26Z", "title": "Netanyahu begins final push to cling to power in Israeli election", "sentences": ["Supporters of Israel\u2019s rightwing parties also plan to rally in Tel Aviv\u2019s Rabin Square on Sunday in an event organisers have said they hope Netanyahu will attend."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/13/netanyahu-final-push-israeli-election-yitzhak-herzog"}, {"tags": ["Benjamin Netanyahu", "Israel", "World news", "Politics", "Tzipi Livni", "US news"], "article": "Jerusalem\u2019s Mahane Yehuda market has long been a stronghold of Likud, the rightwing party of Israel\u2019s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. It is a bustling place of stalls stacked with wet fish, spices, nuts and tubs of olives. Last week Netanyahu visited the market\u2019s lanes on an election campaign stop that was \u2013 bizarrely \u2013 unannounced even to the local media. One market figure who greeted Netanyahu in the past was, however, absent from the tour this time: Yaron Tzidkiyahu, the market\u2019s \u201cpickle king\u201d, who runs two deli stands. A Likud party activist for 40 years, including as a member of its central committee, Tzidkiyahu had decided only a few days before that this year he was not voting for Netanyahu. This time he would vote for Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing rival, Avigdor Lieberman. His decision to defect \u2013 which surprised even his family when he announced it at a Shabbat dinner \u2013 was not an isolated incident in a campaign which has been overtaken by the strong whiff of panic emanating not only from Likud but from Netanyahu himself. It is an anxiety driven by the knowledge that they are losing stalwart supporters like the pickle king. On Thursday Tzidkiyahu explained why he had left the party. \u201cI grew up in Likud,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this time I have decided to back Avigdor Lieberman. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t respect Bibi,\u201d he added, using the Israeli prime minister\u2019s nickname, \u201cbut he has disappointed people by not doing more about the social and economic issues facing Israel. \u201cAnd in this campaign Bibi made all the possible mistakes. He ignored the issues people cared about and only spoke about security \u2013 about Iran, Hamas and Isis. He\u2019s great on security issues, but there are other things Israelis are concerned with.\u201d As we spoke, a regular customer, Moti Freed, a pensioner, approached him. \u201cI hear you\u2019re voting for Lieberman,\u201d said Freed, who later declared that his own preference is for a centre-left party. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d Tzidkiyahu said he knows other disappointed Likud voters. \u201cThere are many and most will vote for another party. Not the left but Lieberman, or someone like Moshe Kahlon [a former Likud minister who has launched his own party]. \u201cNetanyahu has done everything wrong,\u201d he said, adding that there had been efforts to persuade him to change his mind. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t allowed other people to have their say. The only one allowed near the microphone is him.\u201d In the last few days, confronted with the increasing lead that is being opened up by his main rival, the Labour party\u2019s Yitzhak Herzog, Netanyahu has seemed increasingly desperate. Equally worrying for his campaign, the previously wide gap between Netanyahu and Herzog on the question of who voters believe to be most suitable to lead Israel had, by Friday, closed to a narrow margin. \u201cDon\u2019t stay at home and don\u2019t waste your votes,\u201d Netanyahu pleaded with voters on local radio last week. \u201cI will not be elected if the gap is not closed, and there is a real danger that Tzipi [Livni] and Bougie [Herzog] will form the next government.\u201d Herzog and Livni are the joint leaders of the centre-left Zionist Union alliance that is competing in the election. And in the last days of the campaign the message from Likud has been to remind Israelis of 1996, when voters stayed faithful at a similar moment of truth and Netanyahu was elected to office for the first time. His message, as spelled out in a Q&amp;A with voters on his Facebook page on Friday, is that Israel stands at a \u201ccritical juncture between two ways\u201d, warning that his rivals \u201cwill make concessions all along the way \u2013 the achievements we have gained while preserving the vital interests of the country\u201d. The reality \u2013 as Netanyahu understands as well as anybody else \u2013 is that Tuesday\u2019s vote will be a referendum on his leadership and personality. Even if he can find a way to build another coalition, possibly with fewer seats than Herzog\u2019s party \u2013 which can happen in Israel\u2019s political system \u2013 the politician who has been a key figure for a quarter of a century will look like damaged goods. Most Israelis, as polls have consistently made clear, would rather he was gone. (According to one poll published on Friday, 72% of Israelis want change.) As well as his perceived shortcomings on the domestic front, he has brought Israel\u2019s key relationship \u2013 with Washington \u2013 to a historic low point and increased the country\u2019s isolation on the international stage. In large part Netanyahu\u2019s electoral problems are his own doing: he has provided an object lesson in how not to conduct a political campaign. Unwilling to debate with his opponents on television or draw up an electoral manifesto, his biggest setpiece political event was not even in Israel but in Washington, where he addressed the Israeli lobby group Aipac (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and the United States Congress. Prior to the last-minute media blitz last week that saw him take to television, print and Facebook, he has largely dodged those Israeli journalists that he has accused of being part of a hostile conspiracy to unseat him from office, and has kept even party activists at an arm\u2019s length. The result has been a Netanyahu campaign that has seemed remote and largely devoid of substance, except on the question of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme and Israel\u2019s security, neither of which, polls have consistently suggested, are the principal concerns of an electorate far more preoccupied with social and economic issues. His belated and grudging response on key points \u2013 given at the end of the week \u2013 was not to offer concrete proposals but to promise that he will do better next time, as he finally admitted that the cost of living and skyrocketing house prices \u201cwere not dealt with effectively\u201d. And it has not only been his opposition rivals who have gone on the attack. In the last two weeks anonymous Likud officials have not been backward in coming forward to denounce their own party leader\u2019s campaign, most recently in Haaretz on Friday. \u201cEven if we manage to form the next government, this campaign was a colossal failure,\u201d bemoaned a senior official quoted by the paper. \u201cNetanyahu is primarily responsible.\u201d Those anonymous voices were joined on Friday by several former senior Likud figures who made no bones about making public their opposition to Netanyahu. One, Dan Meridor, told the Hebrew newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth: \u201cBibi is the biggest phoney in the world. He may talk sweet, especially in English, but if psychologists or other experts analyse his speeches, it is clear they are just hot air.\u201d What seems extraordinary in hindsight is that when Netanyahu called snap elections in early December after firing justice minister Tzipi Livni and finance minister Yair Lapid, senior Likud officials believed that he had no serious rival and would steal a march on figures such as Herzog and Lapid in the election preparations. It was a certainty that was acknowledged even on the left which, for the first half of the campaign, subscribed to a fatalistic certainty that Netanyahu would be re-elected. That mood was prevalent enough to draw mockery from Israel\u2019s leading satirical television show Eretz Nehederet which has depicted Netanyahu as a figure cursed as a child to be Israeli prime minister for eternity. His only chance to break the spell, it suggested, was to become its worst-ever leader. His speech to the US Congress too, officials have intimated in recent interviews, was supposed to be a master stroke that would clinch the deal and send him cruising to election victory, even at the risk of the damage that it has done to relations with President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. Except that something else happened. What little bounce he did get from the polls in the immediate aftermath of the speech only brought him level with Herzog, and he has slipped in the intervening period. If the public opinion polls have made for increasingly grim reading for Likud, leaks of internal polling, conducted both by Likud and the Zionist Union, have spread even more alarm among the party faithful, suggesting an even bigger deficit for Netanyahu\u2019s party and reflecting the fact that Likud has underperformed in the polls on election day in the previous two campaigns. Yaron Tzidkiyahu\u2019s disillusionment is echoed by other accounts that have been bleeding out of the Netanyahu campaign, including the dismal picture painted by Haaretz\u2019s Yossi Verter of a recent meeting of senior Likud figures in Tel Aviv. By Verter\u2019s account, \u201cdozens of leading Likud figures, mayors, deputy mayors and heads of party branches received urgent phone calls asking them to show up the following morning at a hall in Yehud, east of Tel Aviv, for a meeting with their party head. Not everyone, however, was prepared to ditch other plans. \u201cThose who did show up encountered a leader under pressure. They got the impression from Netanyahu that the situation vis-\u00e0-vis Likud was far from rosy \u2026 \u2018People want to vote Likud\u2019 they told each other, \u2018but don\u2019t feel like voting for Bibi again.\u2019\u201d All of which has converged to produce an election that is still too close to call. And despite the increasing optimism in Herzog\u2019s camp and others in the \u201canyone-but-Bibi\u201d tendency, Netanyahu \u2013 for all his problems \u2013 is not yet finally down and out. Instead, even if he secures fewer votes than Herzog\u2019s party, the peculiarities of Israel\u2019s complex system of coalition building mean that Netanyahu could still return to the prime minister\u2019s house on Balfour Street. In the end it will be Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin \u2013 known to Israelis as \u201cRuby\u201d \u2013 who must decide on the basis of the results and the recommendations of the individual parties who to approach first to invite to form a coalition \u2013 assuming he does not insist the parties\u2019 leaders negotiate a national unity government. And despite being a member of Likud himself, Rivlin is reported still to be raw over the efforts made by Netanyahu last year to block him from becoming Israel\u2019s president. The Jerusalem Post\u2019s chief political correspondent, Gil Hoffman, told the Observer he believes that the next prime minister is likely to be defined as much by Rivlin\u2019s decisions as by the result. \u201cI have been saying this for a long time, but I see this election as being about Ruby, Ruby and nothing but Ruby,\u201d he said. Hoffman pointed out that Netanyahu has previously governed with only 19 party seats, but is unconvinced that the Likud leader could scrape by again in a coalition with such a low haul, and he suspects Rivlin would insist that he join a national unity government. That would be seen as a defeat for Netanyahu as much as a Herzog-led coalition. And with the last polls published on Friday, Israel will now have to wait until Tuesday at 10pm, when the first exit polls come out, to see whether it is the end of \u201cKing Bibi\u201d or whether he survives to lead Israel for another term. BIBI\u2019S RISE TO POWER Born on 21 October 1949, Netanyahu grew up in the US after his father Benzion, a history professor, was considered so rightwing in the Labour-dominated Israel of the time that he was forced to leave. Before attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he served in an elite Israeli army commando unit, rising to the rank of captain, and was wounded in combat. He was deeply affected by the death of his elder brother Yonatan, who was killed leading the 1976 Israeli commando raid to free the passengers of an Air France plane hijacked by Palestinians to Entebbe, Uganda. His career took off when he was posted to Israel\u2019s embassy in Washington and was later made ambassador to the UN. When he was first elected in 1996, Netanyahu was Israel\u2019s youngest-ever prime minister. If re-elected, he will become the second longest-serving after the country\u2019s founding father, David Ben-Gurion. He was defeated in 1999 by the Labour leader Ehud Barak. Under Barak\u2019s successor, Ariel Sharon, he served as foreign minister and finance minister. In late 2005, he took over as leader of the rightwing Likud party after Sharon left to found the centrist Kadima. He led Likud to a humiliating defeat in 2006, but the party bounced back three years later. After Likud came out on top in the 2013 election, Netanyahu fought to form a coalition, but it failed to become established, and he took the gamble last December of calling the election two years early.

Trailing his closest rival Yitzhak Herzog in the polls by up to four seats \u2013 and with two days to go before the country votes \u2013 Netanyahu delivered an uncompromising speech designed to appeal to an audience largely made up of national religious voters and settlers. On the subject of settlements, Netanyahu vowed: \u201cAs long as the Likud is in power, there will be no concessions or withdrawals [from the occupied territories].\u201d And returning to one of his key themes in the media blitz he has launched in recent days, Netanyahu once again accused a conspiracy of foreign governments and Israel\u2019s leftwing of plotting to bring him down. Claiming a \u201cmassive fortune\u201d in foreign funds had poured into Israel from abroad he warned that, because of this, the Right did not have enough votes to put together a strong governing coalition. \u201cIf we don\u2019t close the gap, there is a danger that a leftwing government will come into power, despite the fact that most of the public wants me as prime minister,\u201d Netanyahu said.  Promising to rally a Likud party in the last days of the campaign that has struggled to motivate voters he said: \u201cWe will go street by street, neighbourhood by neighbourhood to gather the people to vote to bring a nationalist government.\u201d To cheers he added: \u201cWe are building in Jerusalem, in all Jerusalem. This isn\u2019t the way of the left, this isn\u2019t the way of Tzipi [Livni] and Bougie [Herzog]\u201d \u2013 Netanyahu\u2019s main rivals and leaders of the opposition Zionist Union. Netanyahu was followed on the stage by far-right leader Naftali Bennett who promised that Israel would never cede \u201ca centimeter of land\u201d to the Palestinians. \u201cA people cannot be an occupier in its own land,\u201d he added. But if Likud\u2019s campaign organisers had hoped to eclipse the recent rally called by the left wing to call for Netanyahu\u2019s replacement, they will have been disappointed with the visibly smaller turnout. Whereas two weeks ago the streets on the edge of square were crowded this time they were largely empty. Even of the thousands who did attend, many bussed in from cities across the country, a significant proportion wore T-shirts or carried banners supporting smaller pro-settler parties, while the crowd was bulked out with many teenagers too young to vote. Among those who did come to the square to support Netanyahu many \u2013 like Netanyahu \u2013 blamed the prime minister\u2019s problems on a conspiracy of the leftwing and foreign governments which the prime minister claims is trying to unseat him. \u201cI support Binyamin Netanyahu because he is a strong leader who will protect Israel from the Arabs and others who would threaten it,\u201d said Eli Binyamin who had come to Tel Aviv from the city of Yavne. \u201cIt is a fact that foreign money has been invested to help bring Bibi down. That is why he is having problems. \u201cWhen you have a prize-winning race horse,\u201d said Suzanne Madar, aged 59, \u201cyou don\u2019t change it for a donkey with a broken leg.\u201d The rally was organised by Daniella Weiss, head of the Nachala organisation which promotes the construction of illegal Jewish outposts in the West Bank. Netanyahu\u2019s appearance was seen as a risky strategy by both associating him so closely with the pro-settlement movement in the last days of the campaign ahead of the vote on Tuesday and because it risks bolstering support for Bennett among rightwing voters. It comes, too, amid a last-minute media blitz by Netanyahu to attempt to close the gap with the Zionist Union of Yitzhak Herzog which polls suggest is set to become the largest party in the Israeli Knesset, although in Israel\u2019s electoral system that may still not be enough to bring in Herzog at the head of a new government. As Netanyahu has toured television stations and newspapers in recent days after what has generally been judged a lacklustre campaign that has been remote form voters concerns, Netanyahu settled on a new strategy of accusing a shadowy coalition of the left and largely unnamed foreign governments and media interests of trying to depose him. That has included a rambling Facebook post charging that \u201cleftist activists and the foreign and international media are conspiring to get Tzipi [Livni] and \u2018Buji\u2019 [Herzog] elected via illegitimate means, using innuendo and foreign money. Netanyahu repeated the claim on Israel\u2019s Army Radio on Sunday, adding that unnamed \u201cforeign powers\u201d have spent millions of dollars as part of an orchestrated campaign against him.  \u201cThose sending the money, they don\u2019t think about our problems here in Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want one thing. They want to make sure the left rises to power.\u201d In another move calculated to bolster his faltering position on Sunday he also publicly offered the key finance ministry portfolio to a potentially king-making rival Moshe Kahlon in exchange for his support. Kahlon, a former member of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party whose newly formed centrist party could be a deciding factor in who becomes prime minister, dismissed the offer as a pre-election stunt. \u201cNetanyahu already promised me the position of head of the Israel Land Authority and the finance ministry (in the past) and didn\u2019t keep his word,\u201d he wrote on Facebook, referring to the body which oversees land development. \u201cIt\u2019s flattering but it doesn\u2019t solve the critical problems facing Israeli society,\u201d he said. \u201cWith 48 hours left until the election, there was no doubt we would see spin like this.\u201d ", "publicationDate": "2015-03-15T21:27:42Z", "title": "Netanyahu makes last attempt for rightwing vote at Tel Aviv rally", "sentences": ["Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s faltering campaign for re-election as Israel\u2019s prime minister appeared to be dealt another blow on Sunday evening when a rally called to support the Israeli right saw far fewer in attendance than a recent rally called by the left in the same Tel Aviv square.", "\u201cI support Binyamin Netanyahu because he is a strong leader who will protect Israel from the Arabs and others who would threaten it,\u201d said Eli Binyamin who had come to Tel Aviv from the city of Yavne."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/netanyahu-rightwing-tel-aviv-rally-vote-israel-campaign"}, {"tags": ["Benjamin Netanyahu", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Religion", "World news"], "article": "Israel\u2019s prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu has unequivocally ruled out the establishment of a Palestinian state as he vowed to strengthen construction of settlements in occupied east Jerusalem should he be re-elected on Tuesday.

His remarks were made in an interview with a website owned by US casino magnate Sheldon Adelson - Netanyahu\u2019s biggest backer - and were being viewed by his political opponents as a last-ditch effort to sway voters away from the rival far-right Jewish Home party of Naftali Bennett. \u201cI think that anyone who moves to establish a Palestinian state and evacuate territory gives territory away to radical Islamist attacks against Israel,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cThe left has buried its head in the sand time and after time and ignores this, but we are realistic and understand.\u201d When asked if that meant a Palestinian state would not be established if he is elected, Netanyahu replied: \u201cIndeed.\u201d   Related: Only sanctions can change Israeli policy | Letters    While his remarks will be seen in large part as election rhetoric designed to cement his standing with his country\u2019s hard right at a time when Netanyahu has been struggling in his campaign, they will further strain relations with the US and other key allies should he win a third consecutive term. Netanyahu\u2019s remarks signalled the most comprehensive rebuttal of his 2009 Bar-Ilan speech when he committed himself to a two state solution and the creation of a Palestinian state.  He added \u201cYou can\u2019t carry out the things that were laid out in the Bar Ilan speech... when all you have on the other side is terror. There are no forces for peace, no partner for peace,\u201d he said. \u201cThis speech was given before the Arab storm - the so-called Arab spring - which has overwhelmed the Middle East bringing with it radical Islam. Any territory which would be handed over would be taken over by radical Islamists.\u201d Despite that speech, as critics have noted, Netanyahu had done little to advance movement towards that goal, while settlement building increased during his premiership. The comments appear bound to set him at odds with most of the international community including Israel\u2019s main ally, the US, should he emerge at the head of the Israeli government for a further term when votes are counted. In the last two days of the campaign Netanyahu has tacked sharply right in a effort to secure re-election, addressing a rally in Tel Aviv organised by hardline pro-settlement activists and visiting the settlement at Har Homa in occupied east Jerusalem. His comments came as leaders of Israel\u2019s political parties made their final appeals to voters on Monday on the eve of an election widely seen as a referendum on the leadership of prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu. In a vote that has been presented as a stark choice between two contrasting visions for the country\u2019s future, millions of Israelis will head to the polling stations across the country on Tuesday in what has been a close and bitterly fought campaign. The final opinion polls \u2013 released on Friday ahead of a four-day moratorium on publishing surveys of voter intentions \u2013 put the centre-left Zionist Union, headed by opposition leader Yitzhak Herzog and former peace negotiator Tzipi Livni, ahead with 25 to 26 seats, and Netanyahu\u2019s Likud taking 20 to 22 in the 120-seat Knesset. Amid warnings from Netanyahu to his supporters that he risks being voted out as prime minister \u2013 and his claims of the existence of a well-funded conspiracy involving Israeli leftists and foreign governments to depose him \u2013 Likud has spent the past few days targeting those intending to vote for the rival right-wing parties. Netanyahu has based his campaign on security issues, largely ignoring economic issues that have played a central role in campaigning by the centre-left Zionist Union and several other parties. At stake \u2013 according to Israeli analysts \u2013 are a handful of seats that many believe could define the outcome of an election too close to call.     Yitzhak Herzog (third from right) poses for selfie photographs with supporters on Monday. Photograph: Nir Elias/Reuters    Visiting his party headquarters, an upbeat Herzog talked about a \u201ccrucial\u201d vote for the country and warned against splitting the anti-Netanyahu vote among the various centrist parties, including charismatic leader Yair Lapid\u2019s Yesh Atid Party.  \u201cWhoever wants an upheaval has to vote for us,\u201d he added. Since its first election in 1949 no Israeli party has won an outright majority and the complexities of its electoral system mean that often the leader who can assemble the most stable coalition \u2013 not necessarily the party with the most seats \u2013 gets to form a government. While polls suggest that Netanyahu might find it easier to assemble more mandates for a right-wing coalition, this election \u2013 called in early December \u2013 has a number of new variables including the emergence of a new centre-right party, Kulanu, whose leader Moshe Kahlon, a former Likud minister, has kept a close counsel over whom he might back for prime minister. On Sunday, Netanyahu offered Kahlon the finance portfolio to Kahlon, who immediately dismissed the overture as \u201cspin\u201d. Two other small parties \u2013 the leftwing Meretz and Yisrael Beiteinu, led by rightwing foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman \u2013 stand on the verge of failing to make the electoral threshold for representation, which could also affect the outcome. Netanyahu made one of his last stops in his campaign in occupied east Jerusalem as he sought to persuade hard-right supporters drifting to other rightwing parties. Visiting the settlement at Har Homa, Netanyahu vowed to preserve Jerusalem\u2019s unity \u201cin all its parts\u201d and said he would \u201ccontinue to build and fortify\u201d the city to prevent any future division. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party has been lagging in opinion polls, and he has stepped up his nationalist rhetoric in the final days of the campaign. \u201cThe choice is symbolic: the Likud led by me, that will continue to stand firmly for [Israel\u2019s] vital interests, compared with a leftwing government ... ready to accept any dictate,\u201d he told residents.  Netanyahu\u2019s visit to Har Homa followed his appearance at a rally in Tel Aviv attended largely by settlers and national religious voters, in a move some commentators warned might backfire. Among them was usually right-leaning Ben-Dror Yemini, writing in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, who noted that Netanyahu has spoken not at a Likud rally but at one representing largely settler and national religious interests. \u201cHe spoke at the rightwing rally.

Herzog, 54, is the scion of a powerful and wealthy political dynasty of eastern European Jewish origin. His late father, Chaim, born in Belfast, was a general who was Israel\u2019s president from 1983 to 1993; his uncle, Abba Eban, its famously mellifluous foreign minister. Herzog\u2019s grandfather was chief rabbi of Ireland, and then of Palestine under the British mandate, and Israel after 1948. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite true that Herzog was born with a silver spoon in his mouth,\u201d commented Ronit Vardi in a Yedioth Ahronoth profile last year. \u201cHe had the whole dinner set.\u201d Educated in Israel and the US, Herzog worked in his father\u2019s prestigious Tel Aviv law firm and entered public life as a Labour MP in 2003, when the party was long past its heyday as the dominant force in Israeli political life, and when the second intifada had grimly underlined the intractability of the conflict with the Palestinians.   Related: On the streets of Tel Aviv, it\u2019s the price of falafel, not Iran\u2019s bombs, that matters     His experience as minister of housing, welfare and social services means he is better placed than the security-obsessed Netanyahu to focus on the issues of social justice and the economy that have been a central preoccupation of these polls. He became Labour leader in 2013.  Herzog\u2019s Zionist Union alliance with a small party led by the former foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, straddles the centre-left ground of a fragmented political system and a divided society. It has little appeal, as the name suggests, for Israel\u2019s Palestinian minority.  Bland, bespectacled, and smartly suited, Herzog is handicapped by a reedy voice and a geeky and uncharismatic manner, not helped by his nickname \u2013 Bougie \u2013 which his mother Aura has explained referred to his doll-like appearance as a child.  In a country where national service is mandatory for Jews and military experience still matters, Herzog recently tried to burnish his image by mobilising former comrades-in-arms to tell stories of his time in an intelligence unit in the late 1970s, when he rose to the rank of major.   Unlike Netanyahu, Herzog is committed to a two-state solution to resolve Israel\u2019s conflict with the Palestinians, though it is hard to imagine a ground-breaking approach to the perennially thorny issues of settlements and Jerusalem.  In an interview with Haaretz, Herzog confessed that his personal motivation was bound up with his privileged family background. Asked what spurs him on, he answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know, but there is a sort of very powerful internal motor that I carry on my back, perhaps from generations past. At times, I think I am a little screwed up in this regard.\u201d  For all that, he has a reputation for being level-headed and competent. But his unexciting profile may turn out to be what many Israelis want after Netanyahu\u2019s long, attention-grabbing stint in office.

I call on everyone to go out and vote, to believe it can be better here \u2013 that we, Arabs and Jews, can with our own hands, create a better future for our children.\u201d Responding to Netanyahu\u2019s statement, Knesset member Dov Khenin, a member of the Arab-Jewish socialist Hadash party and the only Jewish Israeli with a realistic chance of being voted in on the Joint List, said the prime minister had \u201ccrossed a red line of incitement and racism\u201d against the Arab citizens of Israel, who have every right to take part in the democratic system.  \u201cYes, we plan to be the third latest power in the next Knesset. And yes, we are calling on the Arab public to go out and vote. But every single mandate of ours is a mandate of peace and equality, of social and national justice. Our mandates, as opposed to those of the right, will represent the entire public, even those who do not vote for us,\u201d the Joint List said in a statement. Many voters who poured out of a polling station in central Jaffa said they had voted for the Joint List in the hopes that some kind of change will take place. \u201cI want there to finally be an Arab minister in government,\u201d said Abu Din Muhammad, 51, indicating his hope that if Isaac Herzog is the next prime minister, he will invite the Arabs to join the coalition, something that has never happened in Israeli history and which Herzog indicated he will not do. A group of young women, their heads covered in hijab, refused to say their names but all nodded that they had voted for the Joint List in the hopes of \u201cchange\u201d and that this was not their first time voting. \u201cI voted Arabs in the past and I voted for Arabs today,\u201d said Ibrahim Abu Lisan, a man in his 70s. Michael Aboromanh, a Christian Arab from Jaffa in his 30s, voted for Herzog. \u201cThe country needs change and the only way to guarantee that change is to vote Bougie [Herzog].\u201d There were also some first-time voters. A 26-year-old resident of Jaffa who preferred to remain nameless said he had never voted before because it \u201cwasn\u2019t interesting. It\u2019s good they joined up, it\u2019s worth voting now\u201d. Rami Younis, 30, a Palestinian activist and writer with the independent Hebrew online magazine Local Call, said he usually boycotts the elections.  \u201cI support the boycott discourse, but in order to develop this discourse, we need highly developed political consciousness. The unification of the Arab parties as a response to oppression is a testament to a very positive development,\u201d he said. \u201cI am voting for Palestinian unity on 1948 lands, in the hopes that our unity will be used as inspiration for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. I am voting for the Joint List despite their presence in the Knesset, not because of it.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 19 March 2015.

Elections are invariably followed by days or weeks of negotiations, with alliances forming and sometimes collapsing before a final deal is done, policy guidelines agreed and the key ministerial portfolios are divvied up.  Tuesday night\u2019s exit polls showing near deadlock between the rightwing bloc over the rival centre-left camp in Israel\u2019s tightly-fought general election are only the beginning of what could be a long and nail-biting story.   Related: Israel\u2019s election is too close to call, but here are some possible scenarios    Horse trading will begin at once to work out which party will join which bloc, each racing to garner the 61 of the Knesset\u2019s 120 seats required to form an absolute majority so that Reuven Rivlin, Israel\u2019s president, calls on its leader to form the next government. Even the final count of votes will not necessarily indicate clearly who that will be. Still, on the basis of normally accurate exit polls \u2013 and the mood in party headquarters \u2013 Israeli analysts said it was more likely that the Likud\u2019s Binyamin Netanyahu, the current prime minister, will end up again getting the top job, over the Labour leader, Isaac Herzog, who had run as head of the new Zionist Union list \u2013 and campaigned on a slogan of \u201cchange and hope\u201d.

The 13-seat showing for the United Arab List of Ayman Odeh suggested it won wide support from the non-Jewish 20% of Israel\u2019s population, but not enough to guarantee a Herzog-led coalition.  Netanyahu\u2019s expression of alarm at Arab voters heading to the polling stations \u201cin droves\u201d \u2013 swiftly denounced as racism by his critics \u2013 was telling, as were his accusations that unnamed \u201cforeign governments\u201d and leftwing organizations were trying to oust him. Other medium-sized parties or smaller factions now find themselves in a pivotal position. The new Kulanu (All of Us) movement of the populist ex-Likudnik Moshe Kahlon, with an estimated 10 MPs, could be an indispensable kingmaker for Netanyahu \u2013 or, even more dramatically, as some pundits predict \u2013 break with him and join a centre-left bloc. Yair Lapid\u2019s Yesh Atid will be a vital supporter for Herzog. Two ultra-Orthrodox parties lean to the right and would not easily sit in a coalition that included the militantly secular Lapid.     Supporters of Binyamin Netanyahu celebrate as election results come in at his election campaign headquarters. However, it\u2019s not yet clear whether he has won. Photograph: Lior Mizrahi/Getty Images    Another distinct possiblity is a national unity government \u2013 a broad-based coalition that includes the big parties and excludes the extremes of right and left. In the past such governments have seen a \u201crotation\u201d of top jobs for agreed terms and policies of the lowest common denominator. Several small parties, including the liberal-left Meretz party, had feared they might not win enough votes to pass a raised threshold to enter parliament. Yahad, on the far right, suffered that fate. \u201cThe (Israeli) voter doesn\u2019t know what his or her vote will be used for,\u201d Nahum Barnea, the country\u2019s best-known political commentator, wrote in Yediot Aharonot. \u201cWill it be part of the construction material for a national unity government? Will it contribute to the creation of a narrow government? Will it be invested in the opposition? Or will it be wasted on a party which won\u2019t pass the election threshold?\u201d Every seat counts: thus the impassioned appeal by Naftali Bennett, leader of the far-right Bayit Yehudi (Jewish Home) party, to his supporters not to defect to the safety of the Likud \u2013 arguing that the bigger his own following the greater influence he will be able to have if Netanyahu does form another government.  Bennett remains suspicious that the Likud leader is not a sufficiently zealous supporter of Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank. In 1997, he recalled bitterly, Netanyahu, then in his first term, \u201chanded\u201d Hebron to Yasser Arafat \u2013 one of the agreements that followed the Israel-PLO Oslo accords of 1993.

Photograph: Ammar Awad /Reuters    Overall, the great question of the future of Israeli-Palestinian relations played a relatively minor role in this campaign, with a scaremongering Netanyahu focussing relentlessly on the Iranian nuclear programme and terrorism, and Herzog on social and economic issues.  But the shape of Israel\u2019s next government will clearly make a difference to future prospects for peace in the Holy Land \u2013 however slim they appear. Netanyahu\u2019s eve of poll pledge that he no longer believed in a two-state solution to the conflict is not necessarily his last word on the subject \u2013 though his previous commitment to it was extremely vague and highly-qualified. \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s promises mean nothing,\u201d commented Barnea. \u201cThey were written on ice on a very hot day.\u201d  While there is no doubt that the Palestinians, Arab and western governments \u2013 including the US and EU \u2013 would be happier with Herzog.

A series of exit polls released at the close of voting on Tuesday night had suggested the Zionist Union and its leader, Isaac Herzog, were neck and neck with Netanyahu.  But by Wednesday morning official results had stretched to a decisive five-seat lead for Likud, making it almost certain that Netanyahu would serve a third consecutive term as prime minister. Herzog said he had spoken with Netanyahu to congratulate him on his election victory. \u201cA few minutes ago I spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and congratulated him on his achievement and wished him luck,\u201d Herzog told reporters.

Link to video    As it emerged that Herzog had faltered at the last minute having gone into voting with a lead of up to four seats in opinion polls before Tuesday, Netanyahu and his closest allies vowed he would seek to form a rightwing government with the far-right, pro-settlement leader of the Jewish Home party, Naftali Bennett. Netanyahu sealed the deal at the end of a fractious campaign marked by mud slinging, stunts and an appeal to the fear among Israel\u2019s rightwingers that a defeat for him would have dire consequences for the country\u2019s security. In the last few days he made a direct appeal to national religious and settler votes, vowing in unequivocal terms not to allow the creation of a Palestinian state and promising to continue building in occupied east Jerusalem. He warned in vague terms of a conspiracy by the left and foreign governments to remove him from office and, on election day, posted an inflammatory Facebook video in which he accused pro-Herzog activists of bussing in Israeli-Arab voters. \u201cThe rule of the right wing is in danger.

But by early on Wednesday morning it was becoming clear that the exit polls had underestimated turnout for Likud, which had mobilised support in recent days. Despite the sense of euphoria on the right, the result would seem to set a Netanyahu-led Israel on a collision course with both Palestinians and the international community. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat expressed those sentiments as it became clear that Netanyahu was heading for victory. \u201cIt is clear that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will form the next government, and for that, we say clearly that we will go to The Hague tribunal; we will accelerate, continue and intensify,\u201d he declared.

Speaking on a visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem on Wednesday afternoon, Netanyahu said he was \u201cthrilled by the heavy responsibility\u201d of his victory. According to reports in the Hebrew media, Netanyahu has already approached Aryeh Deri of the ultra-orthodox Shas party, Avigdor Lieberman, who leads Yisrael Beiteinu, and former Likud minister Moshe Kahlon, who leads a new centrist party Kulanu, which campaigned on social and economic issues.

Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPA    Likud itself took 30 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, but despite the scale of the win, Netanyahu\u2019s victory is likely to carry heavy political and diplomatic costs for Israel.  Netanyahu appears locked on a collision course with Palestinians and the international community after disavowing his previous support for a two-state solution made in a speech in 2009. His return to power on the back of his unequivocal opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state \u2013 a key policy of Washington and the European Union \u2013 seems certain to exacerbate his already difficult relationship with the US administration of Barack Obama during the president\u2019s final two years in office. Assuming he can form a government before the beginning of next month, Netanyahu will face an immediate crisis, with Palestinians determined to present on 1 April claims of war crimes against Israel over its 48-year occupation of the West Bank and last year\u2019s war in Gaza. The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, expressed those sentiments as it became clear that Netanyahu was heading for victory.  \u201cIt is clear that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will form the next government, and for that, we say clearly that we will go to The Hague tribunal, we will accelerate, continue and intensify,\u201d he declared. If Netanyahu follows through on his pledges it would put him in conflict with the Obama administration and the EU, which has been weighing steps including trade measures to sanction Israel for its settlements policy.  His victory also raises questions about what happens to policy on Iran, with Obama determined to pursue negotiations on its nuclear programme and Netanyahu determined to scupper any deal.

Republican Senator Bob Corker said the foreign relations committee plans to vote next Thursday on a bill that would require Congress\u2019 approval for any nuclear agreement with Iran, in direct opposition to the president\u2019s wishes. If approved by the committee, the bill would move to a vote in the Senate.But Corker\u2019s bill, if it reaches the Oval Office, will face a presidential veto, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, calling on Democratic senators to reject it. \u201cPassing this kind of legislation would interfere in the negotiations,\u201d he said, and would also impinge on presidential authority.\u201d Meanwhile, the House committee on foreign relations angrily interrogated deputy secretary of state Tony Blinken about talks with Iran, which resumed in Switzerland hours earlier. Both Democrats and Republicans searched for weaknesses in the Obama administration\u2019s plans and seized on almost every opportunity to argue for greater influence. Blinken urged Congress not to disrupt negotiations, for instance by passing new sanctions taking action that would \u201ccall into question the president\u2019s authority to make commitments that the United States will keep,\u201d such as the open letter to the Iranian regime signed by 47 Republican senators.. \u201cNegotiating with a foreign nation is the president\u2019s responsibility,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cIf there is confusion on this basic point, no foreign government will trust that when a president purports to speak for our country he actually does.\u201d Blinken attempted to placate several angry representatives who demanded Congress have more authority in the negotiations, saying the administration has \u201cmore than 200 meetings, calls, [and] briefings\u201d with elected officials regarding the talks. But he made clear that the Obama administration will seek a \u201cnon-binding agreement\u201d that, like most international agreements, is not technically a treaty requiring Congress\u2019s advice and consent. \u201cHaving a non-binding agreement allows us to have the flexibility we need to snap back sanctions immediately, not having to wait for international partners,\u201d he said. Congress would have a role in lifting sanctions only if Iran \u201cdemonstrates compliance\u201d over the course of years, Blinken said. But representative Ed Royce called the administration\u2019s statements that Congress has a role to play \u201cdisingenuous\u201d, in light of a limited vote on lifting sanctions, held off at least for several years. Blinken described the threat of future sanctions as \u201ckeeping that sword of Damocles hanging over the head of the Iranians\u201d that would keep it in line with an inspections regimen and the terms of the deal.  A one-year breakout time for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, the estimate under the proposed terms of the deal, was actually \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cmore than enough time not only to detect abuse of the agreement but also to act on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIntrusive\u201d inspections would continue indefinitely, Blinken added, and target Iran\u2019s program \u201cfrom cradle to grave of the production process: mines, mills, factories, centrifuge facilities.\u201d  When several representatives asked about what effect a military option might have on Iran\u2019s program, Blinken tried to convince his interrogators that negotiations were more pragmatic: \u201cthey have the knowledge, and we can\u2019t bomb that away, we can\u2019t sanction that away.\u201d Adam Szubin, undersecretary of the Treasury Department, testified to the committee that Iran \u201cremains under massive strain\u201d under sanctions. \u201cThe size of the hole that Iran is in,\u201d Szubin said, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about a hole that could be described in one sense as a $200bn hole, which are the losses that we assess they\u2019ve suffered since 2012 due to sanctions.\u201d However the representatives had little patience for many of Blinken\u2019s arguments, with Democrat Brad Sherman saying it was \u201cpreposterous\u201d to believe Iran would adhere to a deal. The deputy secretary also tried to reassure the committee that the Obama administration is working \u201cvirtually every day\u201d to bring American citizens imprisoned in Iran home, and that the US does not trust the Iranian regime. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we think these are good guys who like the United States. It\u2019s that there are some people who are more pragmatic for what Iran needs to do for its own future,\u201d he said. Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu also loomed large over a congressional hearing on US negotiations with Iran on Tuesday, prompting one representative to deliver a tirade denouncing Netanyahu for an \u201cinsult to this government\u201d. Democratic representative Gerry Connolly angrily interrupted a hearing of deputy secretary of state Tony Blinken to turn on his Republican colleagues who had criticized President Obama for his \u201cdisdain\u201d for the recently re-elected prime minister. \u201cA foreign leader has insulted the head of state of the United States government,\u201d Connolly said, referring to Netanyahu\u2019sthe Israeli prime minister\u2019s controversial speech to Congress on just two weeks before his re-election.

Anyone pondering the bleak meaning of Netanyahu\u2019s shifting and highly-qualified pledges, and his dog-whistle polling-day warning that the country\u2019s Arab citizens were coming out to vote \u201cin vast numbers\u201d should look at an important book that throws new light on a familiar story.   Related: Netanyahu's victory is clear break with US-led peace process    Menachem Klein\u2019s Lives in Common looks at Arab-Jewish relations before and after 1948 \u2013 the year of Israel\u2019s independence and the Palestinian Nakba. The familiar staples of politics, diplomacy and war cannot be avoided but here, unusually, momentous events form the backdrop, allowing ordinary people to take centre stage in Jerusalem, Hebron and Jaffa over the 130 years or so since Zionist settlement began. The first two cities were (and are) holy to Muslims and Jews alike, while Jaffa, now a stunted, gentrified appendage to Tel Aviv, was the commercial and cultural capital of Arab Palestine. By the final decades of Ottoman rule in the late 19th century all had substantial populations of native-born Arabic-speaking Jews. For them the East European Zionist immigrants who arrived en masse under the British mandate were far less familiar than the Muslims and Christians who then made up the vast majority of the population. Klein\u2019s story is written more from the streets, shared courtyards and markets than from the archives of politicians and bureaucrats. It draws on autobiographies, diaries and the Hebrew and Arabic press to recreate a lost world where two communities lived alongside each other, cooperated in shared institutions and respected each others\u2019 religious traditions. Even as the confrontation between two national movements escalated, Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazis used Palestinian-Arabic slang, while in Hebron in 1929 \u2013 a watershed moment \u2013 hundreds of Orthodox Jews escaped a frenzied massacre by hiding in the homes of their Muslim neighbours. Arab Jaffa\u2019s exotic nightlife remained a magnet for Jews long after modern, emphatically European Tel Aviv sprang up on the sands to the north - and where (unthinkable today) cinemas showed popular Egyptian films. History as written by the Israeli victors has glossed over much of this human interaction, projecting a contemporary calculus of zero-sum conflict back in time; Palestinian writers, mourning their catastrophic loss and emphasising an unfinished national struggle, have played down the pre-Zionist Jewish presence and the interface between two peoples. Klein not surprisingly identifies 1948 as marking the death of any shared non-sectarian Palestinian identity, and painstakingly catalogues the ways Israel\u2019s conquest of the rump of Arab Palestine in the 1967 war paved the way for determined and continuing Jewish dominance. The takeover of Arab parts of Jerusalem today echoes what happened when Jewish settlers first moved back to Hebron in the 1970s - exercising a \u201cright of return\u201d that is still denied to Palestinians. Right-wing, religious Jewish nationalists are targeting the remaining Arab areas of Jaffa. Co-existence is not entirely dead but it is in very short supply: Netanyahu\u2019s racist warning about Arab voters underlined the point dramatically. Lives in Common is a work of deeply humane scholarship. It has been criticised by some as an expression of nostalgia for an irretrievable past or wishful thinking about an unattainable future. Yet Klein is neither a hopeless romantic or an ivory tower academic. He helped draw up the Geneva initiative for Israeli-Palestinian peace and, when Israel and the PLO were still negotiating, acted as an adviser to the Palestinian side - a remarkable example of open-minded commitment to a common good. Like anyone monitoring the current condition of the conflict, from home or abroad, he is pessimistic about a happy end, but still argues that, given the story so far, a two-state solution remains the best option \u2013 even if the chances of it coming about have suffered another grievous, Bibi-shaped blow in recent days.", "publicationDate": "2015-03-20T15:10:18Z", "title": "Lives in Common:  Arabs and Jews in Jerusalem, Jaffa and Hebron  by Menachem Klein - review", "sentences": ["The first two cities were (and are) holy to Muslims and Jews alike, while Jaffa, now a stunted, gentrified appendage to Tel Aviv, was the commercial and cultural capital of Arab Palestine.", "Arab Jaffa\u2019s exotic nightlife remained a magnet for Jews long after modern, emphatically European Tel Aviv sprang up on the sands to the north - and where (unthinkable today) cinemas showed popular Egyptian films."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/mar/20/intertwined-histories-in-palestine-and-israel"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "US news", "Islamic State", "World news"], "article": "The result was not the worst of it. Indeed, buried in the detailed numbers of this week\u2019s Israeli election were odd crumbs of consolation. No, what made Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s emphatic win so dispiriting were the depths he plumbed to secure victory. He made two moves in his desperate, and ultimately successful, effort to woo back those Israeli rightists who had drifted from Likud into the hands of more minor nationalist parties. Netanyahu reassured them that they could forget the lip service of the past few years, the diplomatic niceties he had served up since returning as prime minister in 2009: there would be no Palestinian state on his watch. On election day itself, he sank lower still. In a Facebook video, he posed in front of a map of the Middle East, as if in a war room, and used the idiom of military conflict to warn that \u201cArab voters are advancing in large numbers towards voting places\u201d and that this was \u201ca call-up order\u201d for Likud supporters to head to the polling stations. It\u2019s worth pausing to digest the full meaning of that move. The enemy against whom Netanyahu was seeking to rally his people was not Islamic State or massed foreign armies, or even the Palestinians of the West Bank or Gaza. He was speaking of the 20% of the Israeli electorate that is Palestinian: Arabs who were born in, live in and are citizens of Israel. A prime minister was describing the democratic participation of one-fifth of the country he governs in the language of a military assault to be beaten back.    Imagine if a US president warned the white electorate that black voters were heading to the polls in 'large numbers'    Imagine if a US president broadcast such a message, warning the white electorate that black voters were heading to the polls in \u201clarge numbers\u201d. Or if a European prime minister said: \u201cQuick, the Jews are voting!\u201d This is the moral gutter into which Netanyahu plunged just to get elected. It worked. Not because it won fresh recruits to the right camp, but because it summoned disenchanted hawks back home. That\u2019s the small consolation. The numbers suggest Israel did not lurch rightwards on Tuesday. Indeed, the nationalist and religious right bloc merely held steady, gaining just one seat. Netanyahu\u2019s success came by recutting that pie to give himself a bigger slice. But it is a cold comfort. For the Likud leader was able to siphon off votes from the far right by absorbing its message of belligerence and bigotry. Some will say that\u2019s hardly new. Only the naive could look at Netanyahu\u2019s nine years in office (spread over three decades) and conclude he was ever serious about either equality or the pursuit of a two-state solution. But now we have his explicit word, confirming that everything his harshest critics said of him was true. The result is despair \u2013 in liberal Tel Aviv, where Bibi\u2019s Labor challenger, Isaac Herzog, topped the poll; in foreign capitals, who will note that Netanyahu has now officially disavowed the near-universally preferred solution for the Israel-Palestine conflict; and in the Jewish diaspora, which has long clung to the hope that Israel at least wants to end the post-1967 occupation, even if it has still not managed to do it. Mindful of the damage his win-at-all-costs moves had wrought, Netanyahu lost no time trying to unsay what he had said. In his victory speech, he promised to be prime minister of all Israelis, Jewish and non-Jewish alike. And in a US TV interview on Thursday, he insisted that he does want a \u201csustainable, peaceful two-state solution\u201d after all, so long as \u201ccircumstances\u201d change.    I know of at least one European leader who now says privately that Netanyahu\u2019s credibility is shot    But it\u2019s too late. I know of at least one European leader who now says privately that Netanyahu\u2019s \u201ccredibility is shot\u201d and that \u201cno one will want to work with him\u201d. And in the fellowship of world leaders, that will not be a minority view. How then should those outside Israel react? Some will seize on the disavowal of two states to push instead for their favoured option: a so-called one-state solution. It sounds both simple and enlightened, everyone living together under one roof, with one person, one vote. But as the Palestinian-Israeli writer Sayed Kashua argued powerfully this week, any conceivable path to such a destination would be \u201cgrounded in the trampling of the Palestinians\u201d. The more obvious objection is the one summarised by the Israeli novelist and veteran anti-occupation activist Amos Oz: \u201cAfter one hundred years of blood, tears and disasters, it is impossible to expect Israelis and Palestinians to jump suddenly into a double bed and begin a honeymoon.\u201d And yet we cannot go back to mouthing the same old platitudes about two states, not when we\u2019ve heard Israel\u2019s leader admit he has no intention of allowing any such thing. The right response is surely to match Netanyahu\u2019s honesty with our own. In this regard, the Obama administration has already performed better than Europe. While EU diplomats greeted Netanyahu\u2019s victory with the same tired formulas, invoking a nonexistent peace process, Washington voiced its displeasure at Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cdivisive rhetoric\u201d and let it be known that it was ready to make things uncomfortable. Until now, Washington has always acted as Israel\u2019s diplomatic protector, blocking hostile resolutions at the UN and the like. Now the White House, still smarting over Netanyahu\u2019s Republican address to a Republican Congress, wants to remind Netanyahu that such support is not unconditional. The core message, and it should not be delivered by the US alone, would be simple. It would say, of course the world has to respect the decision of the Israeli electorate. But if this is the path Israel is taking, there will be consequences. If Israel is effectively ruling out a Palestinian state \u2013 and given that it rejects a one-state solution whereby Israel absorbs millions of Palestinians and gives them the vote \u2013 then it has committed itself to maintaining the status quo, permanently ruling over another people and denying them basic democratic rights. And that is a position the world cannot accept. Such a stance might entail US withdrawal of diplomatic cover. It might mean tougher European sanctions of the kind proposed in Friday\u2019s EU report on settlement activity in East Jerusalem. It could mean a growing shift towards divestment and sanctions, targeted at the occupation, without the polarising tactic of boycott that tends to alienate as many potential supporters as it recruits. Whatever form they take, there will be consequences for Netanyahu\u2019s actions. He was ready to sink to a new low to save his skin, but it will be Israelis \u2013 and their Palestinian neighbours \u2013 who pay the price.", "publicationDate": "2015-03-20T19:44:54Z", "title": "Netanyahu sank into the moral gutter - and there will be consequences | Jonathan Freedland", "sentences": ["The result is despair \u2013 in liberal Tel Aviv, where Bibi\u2019s Labor challenger, Isaac Herzog, topped the poll; in foreign capitals, who will note that Netanyahu has now officially disavowed the near-universally preferred solution for the Israel-Palestine conflict; and in the Jewish diaspora, which has long clung to the hope that Israel at least wants to end the post-1967 occupation, even if it has still not managed to do it."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/20/inyamin-netanyahu-israel-election"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "World news"], "article": "At 11 in the morning last Thursday, plenty of the cafes in the city of Jaffa, south of Tel Aviv, were already packed. Over the clinking of plates amid the serving of hummus and orders being called out to the kitchen, one topic of conversation inevitably dominated. It was a day since election results had been announced, giving prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his Likud party a third consecutive term, and two days since Netanyahu\u2019s warning that \u201cArabs were heading to the polls in droves\u201d. In the final days of a tight campaign, Netanyahu also stated there would be no Palestinian state under his watch. Unsurprisingly, the mood of the Palestinian waiters and staff was downbeat. \u201cI\u2019ve got my canned goods, my tape and my nylon sheets ready,\u201d said Ibrahim, 30, with a sardonic smile, alluding to his preparedness for a future conflict he thinks could happen this summer. Yet there was at least one reason to be cheerful. The Joint List, an unprecedented alliance of three Arab and one Arab-Jewish party, won 13 seats (440,000 votes), making it the third-largest party in the Knesset. This success sent a clear message that the Palestinian minority in Israel is willing to forgo its many differences to form a united front. \u201cIt was a vote against [Avigdor] Lieberman,\u201d one worker told me, referring to the outgoing government\u2019s foreign minister, who campaigned on the transfer of Palestinian citizens out of Israel and championed the law that raised the threshold for parties to enter the Knesset from 2% to 3.25% of the vote \u2013 seen as a way to eliminate the small Arab parties and the impetus for the Joint List\u2019s emergence. \u201cI\u2019m glad they got so many votes, but I don\u2019t expect anything to change,\u201d he said. None of the cafe employees were willing to give their full name or place of work, worried that some Jewish customers would withdraw their business. \u201cWe got hurt during Operation Protective Edge,\u201d said Muhammad, a 23-year-old college student. \u201cPeople were boycotting the place, not soldiers actually, but right-leaning Jewish customers.\u201d Palestinians historically voted in large numbers for Zionist parties in the early decades of the state, but have largely voted for Arab parties since the 1990s. There is also a portion of the population that actively boycotts elections or just doesn\u2019t show up to vote. The Joint List was a novel experiment and now the Palestinian street is taking stock. \u201cI voted with a heavy heart,\u201d said Ayman Sikseck, an author who lives in Jaffa. \u201cIt\u2019s a catch-22. On the one hand, you want to vote with your beliefs, but on the other hand it\u2019s doubtful the party will be able to gain legitimacy in the current Israeli reality and also whether it can remain united and overcome its own internal divisions.\u201d The mood among activists was that voter turnout alone \u2013 10% higher than the previous election, at 65%, and the highest since 1999 \u2013 was a massive achievement. \u201cThe list managed to organise the population on the basis of their national identity. It empowered the Palestinian minority, reminding them they are not irrelevant,\u201d said Sami Abu Shehadeh, the secretary-general in Tel Aviv-Jaffa for Balad, one of the four parties. Although Arab parties have never been part of a ruling coalition, some had hoped that, if Yitzhak Herzog\u2019s Zionist Union had won, it would form a centre-left coalition with the Joint List. Others judged that the Zionist Union would enter a national unity government with Likud, leaving the Joint List to lead the opposition \u2013 which would also be unprecedented in Israel. Neither scenario played out. However, Abu Shehadeh was not disappointed that Netanyahu, known as Bibi, won. \u201cHerzog is Bibi-light, he denies that we are Palestinians. Netanyahu\u2019s win will increase international pressure on Israel to end the occupation,\u201d he said. He was, however, disheartened by what he deems the failure to galvanise Jewish voters who believe in full equality. An estimated 7,000 Jewish citizens voted for the Joint List, compared with more than 10,000 for the progressive Arab-Jewish Hadash party in 2013. \u201cWe need to have a deep discussion about why that happened and how to change it,\u201d he said. Asma Aghbarieh-Zahalka, the head of the Da\u2019am Workers party, an Arab-Jewish party that ran in the last election but did not make the threshold, believed the Joint List could not offer genuine change. \u201cWhy should I vote for them? Because they are Arabs, and I am an Arab? If we want to replace the irreplaceable [Netanyahu], we need a Jewish-Arab political breakthrough built by the political and social forces here that can offer an alternative for both peoples,\u201d she said. While the List did not get the support of many Jewish voters, it did get their attention. Ayman Odeh, leader of the Joint List, was familiar to Palestinians but virtually unknown to Jewish Israelis and was catapulted into Israel\u2019s mainstream media: \u201cI cannot be happy about Bibi\u2019s win,\u201d he said, \u201cbut our success proves we have legitimacy across the country. They tried to take us out of the political game, but we chose to participate. People need hope, and that is what we are providing them.\u201d Odeh believes non-violent protest is the key to change. He plans to organise a march from Nazareth to Jerusalem this summer to raise awareness about the party\u2019s programme to promote greater equality between Jewish and Palestinian citizens. Although the establishment of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories along 1967 lines is one of the party\u2019s main platforms, the List currently appears to be focused on improving the rights of Palestinian citizens. As Mohammed got back to serving hummus, he told of a meeting at his college a few weeks ago in which Haneen Zoabi, a Knesset member, was attacked by rightwing Jews who stormed the stage and prevented her from speaking. During the chaos, he overheard some rightwing Jews saying: \u201cOh, the Arabs suddenly have balls now.\u201d \u201cBut I always had balls,\u201d Mohammed told me. \u201cI just know when to pick my battles.\u201d  This article was amended on 22 March 2015 to correct the quote attributed to Asma Aghbarieh-Zahalka and insert other clarifications.

There is the Palestinian city whose residents did not participate in last Tuesday\u2019s election. There is the city of the ultra-Orthodox Jews who voted (or refrained from doing so) on the orders of the rabbis. And there is the city of the Likud party and other rightwing groups. Within this last are a few tiny enclaves of mainly secular middle-class Israelis who support the parties of the left. Altogether last Tuesday they amounted to only 15% of the vote. On Wednesday morning, in a cafe in one of these enclaves, they sat huddled over their cappuccinos, asking themselves how it happened. \u201cI just can\u2019t understand why someone in his right mind votes for Bibi again,\u201d exclaimed a yoga instructor. \u201cI look at the numbers and it just doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d answered her friend, a film editor. \u201cSo many people falling for his same old tricks.\u201d Outside, a small car covered in Netanyahu posters drove slowly down the street. The driver, delirious with joy at the latest results, called from a loudspeaker (\u201cThank you for all voting in the right way\u201d), oblivious to the baleful stares of those within. Yet again they had allowed themselves to believe that Israel was \u201ccoming to its senses\u201d, only to have their hopes cruelly dashed by the exit polls, which showed Binyamin Netanyahu making a comeback and closing the gap on Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog. And then, a few hours later, came the second blow when it transpired that in the actual results Netanyahu was ahead by a comfortable margin. Where had all his supporters come from? And just a few days earlier, in this very enclave, all had seemed possible. A group of men in their early 30s were drinking at a nearby pub, discussing politics. They were all from families who had invariably voted Likud since emigrating to Israel in the 1950s. This time would be different. \u201cYou can\u2019t have someone in power for so long,\u201d one of them said of Netanyahu. \u201cIt all goes rotten and corrupt.\u201d \u201cBibi lost sight of ordinary people\u2019s problems and, instead, just wants to frighten us with stories about Iran and the Palestinians,\u201d said another. They were planning to vote for Kulanu, a new centrist party, headed by a former Likud minister who had fallen out with Netanyahu, had run on a social and economic reform platform, and was widely expected on the eve of elections to join a Herzog-led coalition. They said many of their friends and family members were planning to do the same \u2013 part of a demographic that the pollsters had detected leaving Likud and endangering Netanyahu\u2019s re-election. His defeat suddenly seemed possible, if not probable. The next morning, 48 hours before the polls opened, on a train from Jerusalem, making the winding journey downhill to Tel Aviv, the passengers, mainly soldiers and police officers returning to their bases after a weekend\u2019s leave, were talking about the election. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to vote Bibi, he\u2019s been around too long, but now there\u2019s a danger of the left coming to power, so we have to vote Bibi,\u201d was a sentence I heard repeated up and down the train. The fatigue that most Israelis felt for Netanyahu was very real. In poll after poll large majorities answered that they would prefer change and more votes were cast for parties who were critical of his policies and whose leaders, if they could find a way of sitting together in one government, would have gladly replaced him. So how did Netanyahu manage in the last six days of the campaign to convince more than 250,000 voters to change their minds and vote Likud? Why did his rivals fail so miserably at mobilising the anti-Netanyahu sentiment into a coherent and cohesive political force? Netanyahu won the election because he succeeded in stoking a deep and irrational fear of the left. A left which \u2013 or so runs the line \u2013 is too complacent, too cosmopolitan, too secular and too lacking in an ideological backbone to stand up for Israel\u2019s interests. Netanyahu\u2019s cynical ploy on election day, when he warned in a personal message on his Facebook page of \u201cdroves of Arabs\u201d descending on the polls, was appealing less to the racism of his potential voters than to their fear that the left was incapable of keeping a hold on power and would be easily manipulated by outside forces. He was warning them that should they vote for someone else, Jews would be losing control of their destiny in their land. An interview last Sunday with a small weekly newspaper, read mainly by religious settlers, in which Netanyahu seemed to be ruling out the possibility of his ever agreeing to the establishment of a Palestinian state, made headlines around the world. It is now the reason for yet another crisis in his relationship with the international community. In Israel it barely caused a stir. Save for a relatively small number of settlers still traumatised by past evacuations of settlements in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip and the retreat from parts of the West Bank at the start of the Oslo accord, it is barely an issue. A majority of Israelis in opinion polls still support in principle the two-state solution, but it seems so distant. Their concerns are more immediate. Can they buy their own flat? Will their monthly income be sufficient or will they have to yet again enlarge their overdraft? What prospect of prosperity can their children look forward to? Netanyahu sought to make the election about his determination to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. That flawed strategy nearly cost him his fourth term. His opponents, many of whom do support a two-state solution, barely mentioned that either, focusing instead on the rising cost of living, and six days before Israelis went to the polls, that narrative seemed to be winning. Netanyahu, in his own tiny bubble of privilege and sycophancy, was on the verge of losing the election. But he emerged in time to stoke the primal fears of his electorate of their fate. It was a destructive tactic that took advantage of racism and ignorance and jeopardised Israel\u2019s diplomatic position within the international community. It won the election but has divided Israel like never before.

The mayor of Bethlehem, Vera Baboun, most recently appealed directly to Pope Francis at a meeting with him in February. A delegation of 16 bishops also visited Cremisan earlier this year. Representing the episcopal conferences of Europe and North America, they reiterated their commitment to oppose the construction of the barrier. A delegation of representatives of EU member states also visited the site to protest against the planned construction. The campaign against the route of the barrier at Cremisan was taken up by William Hague when he was UK foreign secretary, and the archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Nichols. The Israeli court also rejected an alternative proposal from Israel\u2019s defence ministry that would have allowed for a door in the wall connecting the two sites, instructing the army to come up with an alternative proposal. Israel says that the wall is necessary for security, but local residents have long charged thatits real purpose was to allow the connection of the illegal West Bank settlement of Har Gilo to the Jerusalem settlement of Gilo. The planned route would in effect have cut off a large amount of privately owned Palestinian land from about 50 mainly Christian families and Vatican land owned by the two Salesian monasteries. Also under threat had been the continued viability of the Salesian Sisters\u2019 convent school, which educates several hundred children from the surrounding villages. Under Israel\u2019s original plan, the school would have been on the Israeli side of the barrier while almost all of the pupils would have been on the Palestinian side, meaning they would have to cross an Israeli military checkpoint to get to class. In making its ruling, the court ordered the military to find a route less harmful to Palestinians living in the Cremisan valley.  Welcoming the decision at a press conference at the Salesian convent on Thursday, attended by families whose land had been under threat, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Fouad Twal, told the Guardian: \u201cYou can see the happiness of everyone who is here. It has been the result of a campaign not only by local people but by Vatican officials, the foreign consuls who came here and all those who raised the issue internationally. Coming before Easter, this is a joyous resurrection for us.\u201d Lawyers involved in the campaign warned that the military could theoretically introduce a new order to reroute the wall, but they believed that the court\u2019s ruling \u2013 in particular the parts relating to the impact on local people \u2013 made that unlikely. Also at the convent on Thursday was Samia Khanaliyah, an architect for the Palestinian town of Beit Jala, whose families have already lost land to the wall and were threatened with losing more. \u201cThe land is important to people. Not just for those who make a living farming their trees, but because with so few parks it is an important open space. \u201cIt has not been easy for us to fight this. We need to get permission to go to court in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv to hear a case in a language that is not our own. Over the years some people lost hope, but we never did.\u201d The court\u2019s ruling is the second victory for Palestinians over the routing of the wall through the area in recent months.  In another recent court case judges froze the planned construction of the wall near the village of Battir a few miles from Cremisan \u2013 through a Unesco world heritage site.", "publicationDate": "2015-04-02T13:42:14Z", "title": "Israel's top court blocks extension of separation wall through Cremisan valley", "sentences": ["We need to get permission to go to court in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv to hear a case in a language that is not our own."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/israels-top-court-blocks-extension-of-separation-wall-through-cremisan-valley"}, {"tags": ["Gardens", "Life and style"], "article": "In the spring of 1967, a teacher in Jerusalem shared a disappointment with her kindergarten class. The previous autumn, they had planted a handful of daffodil bulbs in the school garden, and the teacher, Batsheva, had told the children how the dry bulbs would wake and sprout: first roots, then leaves and, finally, beautiful yellow flowers. But there was no such display. One member of the class, Oron Peri, knew why, however: he had been so fascinated by his teacher\u2019s description that he had stolen the bulbs. They were fulfilling their promised potential, but in his parents\u2019 garden, where he had replanted them. Peri now lives in Kiryat Tiv\u2019on, halfway between Nazareth and Haifa, where he works as a garden designer. When his collection of bulbous plants outgrew his garden, he knew he needed help. \u201cIt became a nightmare,\u201d he says. \u201cMy cats had nowhere to lie down but on my precious plants.\u201d The solution came in the form of a friend, Mansour Yassin, who had helped build gardens for Peri\u2019s clients, and in a plot of land down the road. \u201cMansour was the obvious choice,\u201d Peri says. \u201cI knew how much he loved nature, and he is practical.\u201d Yassin is Muslim and Peri is Jewish: did that cause problems? \u201cThe area where we live is mixed; it is not an issue here. Unlike in Tel Aviv, say, Arabs and Jews have been living and working together here for centuries. Maybe we are naive, but it is our tradition and very natural.\u201d Yassin adds, \u201cWe have the same ideas about relationships between Christians, Jews and Muslim people. We don\u2019t hold to stereotypes about where you come from.\u201d     Romulea clusiana. Photograph: Yadid Levy    Peri realised the time had come to formalise the way he shared plants with other enthusiasts. So Seeds of Peace was born; a scheme where seed sales of garden-worthy bulbous plants support conservation of rare species. Yassin is gradually matching up botanic names with the Hebrew he naturally uses for plants he has known since playing in the mountains as a boy. His parents and grandparents would collect the leaves of wild plants for food, and he keeps the tradition alive by taking his young family out to gather wild asparagus and chicory to eat at home. For Peri, the collection represents 20 years of travel and botanising, specialising in plants from the Mediterranean and Middle East. Indigenous populations have suffered due to tourism (particularly on the Greek islands and Cyprus) and illegal harvesting for the bulb market. Some plants are endangered in the wild, with no conservation scheme to protect them in their native country. They give these refugees, as Peri refers to them, a place to thrive and set seed. The nursery\u2019s raised beds allow each species to find their optimal depth, which saves the time-consuming job of cleaning and repotting the bulbs each year. Part of the plot is netted for cyclamen and other woodlanders that need shade; Yassin and Peri have sealed the nursery against wild boars and porcupines, which eat the bulbs. Rare seeds are collected and stored, then made available free of charge to botanic gardens and collectors around the world. The money-earners are the plants grown solely for their beauty \u2013 crocus and iris are particularly popular. The pair joke that maybe these will boost their pension income, but at the moment they pay only for the land rental and Peri\u2019s botanising trips abroad. The display of muscari, irises and anemones set against the backdrop of the Jezreel Valley is a long way from Peri\u2019s first daffodils. I ask whether he ever owned up to his early misdemeanour. \u201cNo,\u201d he says sheepishly, then he and Yassin roar with laughter.

For many, it is a time of fear and distress. Antisemitism is on the rise, fed by trends that threaten the fabric of European consciousness and values. Extreme right-wing movements are thriving \u2013 and they often carry elements of age-old European antisemitism. Europe has also been hit by the sectarianism and fanaticism that seeps out of the Middle East. Violent jihadism has struck in Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels and Toulouse. Violent radicalised youths only represent a tiny minority of Muslims, but they are dangerous and their numbers are growing in Europe. Their ideology of hatred finds fertile ground in pauperised suburbs and the racism that populist parties promote when they stigmatise immigrants. It sometimes feels as if Europe is caught in a vicious circle where dismal economic figures and identity problems make communities ever more suspicious of one another. The lessons of Europe\u2019s history should be drawn on constantly as an antidote to much of this. In 1989 I started travelling to Eastern Europe after the Berlin Wall fell, and some of the most moving experiences I had came from visiting the many places where Jews had disappeared because of the Nazi genocide: the ruins of villages in former shtetl lands; the empty, abandoned synagogues of Hungarian or Ukrainian cities; the neighbourhoods of Prague and Warsaw where Jewish artists, intellectuals and writers once brought a unique and essential ingredient to European culture. There are 1.4 million Jews living in Europe today. They are an intimate part of the continent and what it should stand for, which is tolerance, and the acceptance that our continent has always been a mosaic of cultures and religions, each contributing to exchanges that make life more fulfilling. Some voices, among them Israel\u2019s leader Benjamin Netanyahu, have called on Europe\u2019s Jews to emigrate to Israel for security. Fear can be understandable, but that kind of message is not what is needed. It would mean the negation of Europe\u2019s diversity and very identity. There has been no better time to treasure that diversity and listen attentively to the myriad individual experiences that compose it.  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bensahel, 51, Paris, president of the Israelite Reform Union at the synagogue in Paris where in October 1980 a bomb exploded, killing four people      \u2018People are saying they have to leave because it\u2019s too dangerous in France\u2019: Jean-Francois Bensahel. Photograph: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonnet/Observer    The rise in antisemitism is a European phenomenon, but it was in France that the assassins\u2019 bullets started. The strong republican state that imposes shared values cements our society, but over the past 40 years secularism and assimilation have given way to multiculturalism and ghettoisation, and we are suffering the consequences. The Charlie Hebdo attacks in January showed that the \u201cJewish question\u201d is also the \u201cFrench question\u201d. Now lots of people are saying they have to leave because it\u2019s too dangerous in France, and they\u2019re afraid of being attacked in the street for wearing a kippah or a Star of David. More and more people believe their identity can be summed up by their religion. The French didn\u2019t react to antisemitic killings in the past, and for the past 30 to 40 years they have made excuses about the radicalisation of Muslims, blaming their social and economic situation and seeing it as an extension of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We pulled the emergency alarm cord many times in the past, but these events have crossed a line. People are not only angry but feel despair and resignation. There is a fear that we are not heard and will never be heard. People ask me what the next act of barbarity will be, and they worry about the spread of antisemitism. We have heavily armed soldiers in front of the synagogue, and while this is reassuring it\u2019s also profoundly worrying. The French government is making a lot of effort, but our role is to convince those around us that it\u2019s not just us in the attackers\u2019 sights, it\u2019s also you, the French, Europeans. Dalia Golda, 33, Bucharest, founder of Gan Eden Kindergarten, a Jewish kindergarten and after-school centre in the Romanian capital, where Jews are a tiny minority of the population     \u2018I received hundreds of phone calls in the middle of the night saying: \u201cYou Jew\u201d\u2019: Dalia Golda in her office at the Jewish kindergarten, Gan Eden, she founded in central Bucharest, Romania. Photograph: Davin Ellicson/Observer    There are very few Jews in the whole of Romania \u2013 officially 7,000. We were wiped out [during the Second World War]. It is important to have places like the Holocaust Memorial, which opened in 2009, in order to remember, but we also need to educate. When I used to work for the Jewish Cultural Centre I received hundreds of phone calls in the middle of the night saying: \u201cYou Jew!\u201d It didn\u2019t stop me. My grandfather was a Holocaust survivor. After the war, Jews lived two different lives: one in normal society, the other with your family. Romanians were not allowed to have religion in communist times, though we had permission to have choir classes every Sunday where we learnt everything religious and traditional. It was an open secret. In my town we never had problems, but in larger cities there was more fear. Part of the Jewish community left Romania when my mother was young, then more went in the early 90s for economic reasons and because they felt they couldn\u2019t have a Jewish life here. Most of my family moved to Israel or the States \u2013 only my parents stayed. When I was born in Suceava, a small city in northern Romania, there were about 30 young Jewish people there. At my bat mitzvah, when I was 12, we were six. Now that community is almost dead. There is increasing antisemitism across Europe, for sure, but not really in Romanian society. There\u2019s not such a big difference between how Romanians and Jewish Romanians live. If the Jewish community had bigger houses, more money, it could be a problem. Jewish culture is part of the identity of Europe. If you lose it you lose a big part of Europe. Amit Jacobi, 34, Berlin, Israeli-German actor and director who moved to Berlin 12 years ago. He made headlines in February after being secretly filmed walking through Berlin wearing a kippah, following similar experiments in New York and Paris     \u2018A young Caucasian man recently told me to go back to Israel. It took my breath away\u2019: Israeli dancer, actor and director Amit Jocobi. Photograph: Malte Jaeger/laif    Being Jewish and a target is not something you can get away from \u2013 it\u2019s part of your identity, even if you\u2019re a modern hipster, arty, non-believer person in Berlin, like me! This is the city, after all, from which my grandfather escaped when he was around my age, and from where my great-grandparents were deported to Auschwitz and murdered. I\u2019m part of a wave of young Israelis who have come to Berlin. I can\u2019t say I feel unsafe here, but I\u2019m not part of a Jewish community \u2013 it\u2019s not like we all gather in a caf\u00e9 with Jewish symbols, which would be targeted. The most blatant antisemitic attack I\u2019ve faced here was not so long ago. A young Caucasian man came up to me and an Israeli visitor with whom I was speaking Hebrew, and told us to \u201cfucking go back to Israel\u201d. It took my breath away. Netanyahu, who has made Israel a very unsafe place for years, has a nerve to call on Jews to leave Europe because it\u2019s unsafe \u2013 that\u2019s pure manipulation. Once I was concerned about my parents because missiles were nearing Tel Aviv, and someone said: \u201cTell them to vote for another government\u201d, assuming that because they and I are Israeli we\u2019re responsible for its politics. I get this again and again. When I made the kippah video, some people looked at me strangely, but I had no negative encounters or remarks. From what I can gauge, the situation is much better here in Berlin than in Paris. But antisemitism is part of European culture. It\u2019s always been there \u2013 it didn\u2019t originate with Hitler \u2013 and I guess it\u2019s not going away. I don\u2019t feel at all inclined to stop speaking Hebrew here or cover up a Hebrew book I\u2019m reading. This is my city, and I\u2019ll live my life freely. Karen \u015earhon, 56, Istanbul, linguist and academic who founded Turkey\u2019s first Sephardic music group     \u2018I\u2019m not very optimistic about the future of this community\u2019: Karen Gerson Sarhon. Photograph: Holly Pickett/Observer    The atmosphere for Jews in Turkey is very negative. Every day you see right-wing newspapers writing lots of bullshit. \u201cThe flies are flying sideways \u2013 it\u2019s because of the Jews\u201d, that sort of thing. People ask about my name \u2013 Karen is not a Turkish name \u2013 so I say I\u2019m Jewish and they say: \u201cOh \u2013 you don\u2019t look Jewish.\u201d My husband, who\u2019s in the business world, has experienced more antisemitism than me. After Gaza [last summer], he sold some beauty salon machines and the first question was: \u201cWhere do they come from? If they come from Israel we won\u2019t buy them.\u201d Animosity on social media is growing as people are being fed lies all the time by the media \u2013 especially by fundamentalist writers and preachers, who say we are the cursed people. Most of the Jewish community\u2019s budget is spent on security, because we have to have guards and metal detectors everywhere \u2013 at synagogues, the Jewish museum, the Jewish school. It didn\u2019t used to be like that 20 years ago, but it\u2019s becoming worse, with the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, criticising Israel so openly. The government kindles the animosity. Erdogan is always talking about Israel and not distinguishing between the Jews in Israel and the Jews here. You always ask yourself: \u201cWhat are they going to do?\u201d It\u2019s in our genes to ask: \u201cAre we going to be kicked out?\u201d Unless the political situation changes, I\u2019m not very optimistic about the future of this community. If things get worse, people will have no choice but to leave. I say if \u2013 at the moment we\u2019re not there yet. It\u2019s very difficult to leave a country you were born and raised in. We love this country. It\u2019s a beautiful country and the people who have not been brainwashed are very nice, but the political situation is not very pleasant. Roger Abravanel, 68, Milan, retired management consultant and author who grew up in Libya     \u2018After Gaddafi came to power, my family fled, losing everything. I\u2019ve been lucky in Italy\u2019: Roger Abravanel. Photograph: Mattia Balsamini/Luz    When I hear about antisemitic incidents, I get the same feeling that I had in Libya, where I grew up. My father, who started out a poor man, made a fortune. He was the only Jew invited to sit alongside the king. There had always been antisemitism in Libya, but it exploded with Israel\u2019s independence and its wars. You can\u2019t imagine how often I was discriminated against. As a kid going to school, I was beaten up. I\u2019d never been to Israel, I had a Libyan passport, and here were these guys coming at me just because I was a Jew. When I was 16, my father said: \u201cThis is no place for you\u201d, and I went to study in Milan. After Gaddafi came to power, my family fled. My sister was smuggled to the airport in the boot of a car. We lost everything. In my book, Meritocrazia [Meritocracy], I thanked Gaddafi \u2013 because of him I had to achieve everything by myself. I\u2019ve been lucky in Italy, others less so. A million Jews were kicked out of Arab countries \u2013 a little-mentioned exodus. I fear this may be happening again, but in Europe, where Muslim antisemitism has added to traditional European antisemitism. I\u2019m an Italian. I love this country. I owe it a lot, and I\u2019ve always tried to give back \u2013 I did military service, which I could have avoided; I\u2019ve paid a lot in Italian taxes, and I\u2019m currently working pro bono for the government. I\u2019m a great supporter of the national soccer team, and of Juventus. I have personally never encountered serious antisemitism among Italians. Well, maybe something like: \u201cYou guys\u201d \u2013 meaning Jews \u2013 \u201care better at handling money.\u201d But prejudices exist, mostly among less-educated people. One Italian in four says they wouldn\u2019t like to dine with a Jew. Rachel Silveira, 38, London, deputy director of Three Faiths Forum, which promotes understanding among people of all faiths and beliefs     \u2018There\u2019s more fear being expressed, and some friends won\u2019t go to events at a synagogue\u2019: Rachel Silveira. Photograph: Suki Dhanda/Observer    The UK is one of the richest places in Europe in terms of the number of different Jewish organisations. In London there\u2019s been a huge growth of alternative expressions of Judaism outside traditional synagogue communities. I\u2019ve never experienced antisemitism directly, but I would imagine it is different for people who wear more visible signs of Judaism. When I worked for the Jewish Council for Racial Equality 15 years ago, I couldn\u2019t understand negative reactions from within the Jewish community to refugees, when all our families were immigrants. Having done a lot of work since, I realise that these fears and concerns are very common. In the last few months, the tone on my Facebook feed has changed. There\u2019s more fear being expressed, and some friends won\u2019t go to events at a synagogue or Jewish community centre now because of the security aspect. Three Faiths Forum works with about 10,000 young people a year. Over the past few months, their questions have become more pertinent and can lead to very challenging discussions. Questions we\u2019ve had to Jewish speakers include: \u201cYou said Jews believe in charity \u2013 do you also believe in killing Palestinian babies?\u201d and \u201cWhy do Jews keep money under their hats?\u201d We had to explain that the man the student had seen was probably adjusting his kippah under his hat, and that Jews keep money in pockets like everyone else. Martin Krasnik, 43, Copenhagen, journalist, TV host and author, whose refusal to be cowed during interviews has attracted abuse     \u2018The terror attack in Copenhagen underlined a feeling of not truly belonging\u2019: Danish journalist Martin Krasnik. Photograph: S\u00f8ren Solk\u00e6r/Observer    The Jewish community in Denmark has been here for 350 years and is highly integrated, but the terror attack in Copenhagen underlined a feeling of not truly belonging. There was incredible sadness, but also an absence of shock after the young Jewish man was shot dead outside the synagogue, as everybody had expected something like this to happen. From the prime minister\u2019s reaction to the rabbi\u2019s speech by the grave, it was as if the script had already been written. For years the Jewish community asked for better protection and Danish authorities reacted with naive leniency, almost indifference. The big question is whether it is even possible to have Jewish schools and institutions here. To put guards in front of a synagogue is a huge thing in a country like Denmark. It\u2019s a cultural issue more than a question of resources. Last year during the Gaza conflict, I interviewed the Norwegian doctor Mads Gilbert on TV and challenged the view that Israel was systematically bombing schools and hospitals. The comments from viewers were extreme and abusive. People recycled deeply rooted antisemitic attitudes and told me I couldn\u2019t do my job because of who I was. It prompted me to write the book Fucking J\u00f8de! [Fucking Jew] and wrestle back the right to define myself. In Denmark there is an ostrich mentality when it comes to antisemitism \u2013 we can\u2019t live with the idea that it exists here. Martin Varsavsky, 54, Spain, telecom and new media entrepreneur based in Madrid     \u2018Madrid continues to feel like a safe haven compared to the antisemitism gripping other countries\u2019: Martin Varsavsky.    When Spain\u2019s Real Madrid lost to Maccabi Tel Aviv in Europe\u2019s main basketball tournament last year, it wasn\u2019t the game\u2019s final score that made headlines around the world. Instead it was the thousands of antisemitic tweets unleashed on Twitter by Spanish fans, referencing gas chambers and the Holocaust.  Jewish organisations responded quickly, asking prosecutors to investigate nearly 18,000 tweets, while media around the world drew quick conclusions about antisemitism in Spain. But as a Jew who has lived in Spain for the past 20 years, I feel it must be said that the situation is very different on the ground. While it\u2019s true that many in Spain harbour prejudices against Jewish people, much of this sentiment is rooted in ignorance. The number of Jews who exist today in Spain is absolutely insignificant. I would estimate that about 6,000 Jews live in Madrid and maybe another 10,000 or so across Spain. Most Spaniards have never met a Jew. In 1492 we were 10% of the population in Spain. Today there\u2019s just a ghost of the Jewish community in Spain. The community has increased security as a precautionary measure, but Madrid continues to feel like a safe haven compared to the antisemitism gripping other countries. As an entrepreneur who has founded several telecom and new media companies, I would move to Israel more because it\u2019s a mecca of technology rather than for safety.  As Spain struggles to recover from its double-dip recession, it has began its own campaign to lure Jews back again, promising legislation to fast-track citizenship for the descendants of Sephardic Jews. It\u2019s great but not a game changer, with 50% youth unemployment and more than 20% unemployment overall in Spain.

And it made me realise we can use the TV to help these animals that are depressed and bored.\u201d According to Levi, DogTV\u2019s initial research showed that 57% of Americans already left their TV on at home during the day for their pets, but that even channels like Animal Planet weren\u2019t really suitable for a four-legged audience. \u201cThere are a lot of commercials, a lot of different sound levels, a lot of talking,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of crocodiles that can scare your pet. These channels were not designed for animals.\u201d Thus: DogTV. Not CatTV, despite Charlie inspiring the idea. \u201cWe thought that there was a real need with dogs: people feel really guilty leaving their dogs at home,\u201d he says. \u201cMost cats are like \u2018you go to work, I\u2019ll be fine! I\u2019ll take care of this palace\u2026\u2019.\u201d            Levi stresses the science behind DogTV\u2019s content, with its shows grouped into three categories: Stimulation, Relaxation and Exposure. The first to stimulate dogs\u2019 brains, the second to chill them out, and the third to expose them (gently) to things they may find frightening in the real world, from fireworks and traffic to vacuum cleaners. \u201cWe spent our first three years researching, learning about dog vision and hearing: studies on areas like colours and sound frequencies. Then we produced two hours of content and tested it in a study in LA and New York, where we built security cameras into 38 apartments and monitored dogs watching TV,\u201d he says. Hence the lesson that cats weren\u2019t a hit with the target audience. \u201cBut also that dogs don\u2019t respond too well to barking sounds. We had a lot of them at first, and some dogs got irritated and started to bark. So we took that out,\u201d says Levi.   Related: ATM dog: Forgotten your pin? Please join the queue for the dachshund    In some countries, DogTV is a subscription-based channel \u2013 $5 a month in the US, for example \u2013 while in others it\u2019s free. Levi says it has subscribers from 35 different countries, but prefers not to reveal how many. \u201cWe\u2019re available to 60m eyeballs around the world, but some of our new platforms aren\u2019t even subscription. It\u2019s a little shift from subscribers to users, if you will. We have millions or tens of millions of users, and we see the broader picture. So many people are discovering DogTV on different platforms: we\u2019re free on YouTube and we have millions of views,\u201d he says. Levi says that he\u2019s relaxed about DogTV being treated as a gimmick in some quarters, before listing a series of reasons why it should be taken seriously. They include science \u2013 \u201cthree years of research and 60 different studies from universities\u201d \u2013 as well as its \u201cdream team\u201d of four dog experts, including British dog trainer Victoria Stilwell, of It\u2019s Me Or the Dog TV fame. Also patents. \u201cWe patented all the content. We have 11 different patents, which is huge. The colours that we have that are very specific to dog-vision, the sound frequencies, the music \u2026 it\u2019s all patented,\u201d says Levi, who also says that DogTV continues to refine its art over time. \u201cNormally with music and visual content, people try to do more: another cut, another camera angle to make it more interesting. With dogs, it\u2019s the opposite, you have to do less,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf you do more, you\u2019re going to lose your audience. Another cut, and the dog is \u2018where did that go?\u2019 and you\u2019ve lost them. They have brains like two-year old kids: if you do another camera angle suddenly or go point-of-view, you\u2019ve lost the dog. You lose your audience, and they get irritated.\u201d     DogTV has \u2018millions, maybe tens of millions\u2019 of viewers.    What about the future? More TV deals in more countries, and the growth of DogTV\u2019s digital channels on YouTube and through its apps for mobile devices and connected TVs. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest thing internationally: to bring this to as many dogs in the world as possible,\u201d says Levi. What about cats? Charlie and his sad eyes ... \u201cWe get asked about cats every day! We get so many cats already watching the channel. There are some people with parrots who have subscribed. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re going to see a ParrotTV or a FishTV, but CatTV makes sense. But for now, we are focusing on the dogs.\u201d   Related: TV industry faces its \u2018ketchup\u2019 moment: \u2018Mobile is now the first screen\u2019    And their owners. In the US, DogTV has picked up on a trend for people to watch its channel with their pets, and started airing a few shows designed for co-viewing. There\u2019s even a show called Dogstar, which is (sadly) nothing to do with Keanu Reeves\u2019 now-defunct rock band, but is instead a show for viewers to send in videos of their own dogs. Levi is optimistic. \u201cEvery year I see less and less cynicism, and more people not just knowing about DogTV, but understanding DogTV as not a joke or a gimmick, but as a real thing that can help dogs feel more relaxed,\u201d he says. Levi claims that DogTV regularly hears from viewers whose dogs were on medication for separation anxiety, but have come off the drugs since their owners subscribed to the channel. \u201cDogs get bored. Dogs are bored being home alone all day doing nothing. We don\u2019t expect them to sit being a couch potato all day, but we\u2019re giving them something in the background to help them be less depressed or stressed,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we can help there, then we\u2019ll have really achieved something.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-04-14T08:22:14Z", "title": "Don't press paws: how DogTV built a global TV channel for man's best friends", "sentences": ["No cats, though, even if the original launch was inspired by a feline: a British cat called Charlie that Levi took with him when moving from the UK back to Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/14/dogtv-global-tv-channel-dogs-no-cats"}, {"tags": ["Photography", "Art and design", "Art", "Culture"], "article": "Under a blue sky smeared with cloud, a woman rounds a bend in the road carrying her shopping bags. The photographer has been awaiting her arrival. She\u2019s just passing through on her way somewhere. Beyond her, blocky white buildings climb the rocky hillsides, built over other homes now long destroyed. I don\u2019t know how far she has walked or how far she has left to go. It is an ordinary scene in which this anonymous Palestinian woman is the only visible human presence. There are very few people in Thomas Struth\u2019s photographs at Marian Goodman Gallery, his first UK show since his 2011 Whitechapel retrospective. In 2009, Struth was one of 11 international photographers (alongside Jeff Wall, Steven Shore, Rosalind Fox Solomon and Nick Waplington) invited to Israel and the West Bank by French photographer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Brenner, for the photographic project This Place. Now he has combined the works he made there with photographs taken in military technological facilities in California. These too are unpeopled, excepting one taken at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, where we meet a polymer human head with a blonde wig mounted on a stick and surrounded by equipment. The intermingling of the two series is at first inexplicable. On the side of Tel Aviv City Hall, some men are just visible in a window-cleaning cradle. The building almost fills the shot, which was taken at sunset from the spot where Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995. It is a photograph of unremarkable architecture, flat on, complimenting the flat objectivity of Struth\u2019s tone. His photographs are filled with absences and things unsaid. My eye crawls the images, looking for reason.     City Hall, Tel Aviv, 2011 by Thomas Struth. Photograph: Marian Goodman Gallery    There is a single family portrait here \u2013 three generations of a Jewish Yemeni family posing outside their house, their eyes meeting the camera. You sense their wary complicity in making the photograph. Other than that, there\u2019s no one: I scanned the barren landscapes, the windows at sunset, the outskirts of Nazareth and Ramallah, the distant refugee camp in east Jerusalem, but there was no one there. In the front yard of a building in East Jerusalem, among banana palms and a clump of flowering nasturtiums, hangs a bunting of blue and white Israeli flags, like dishcloths on a washing line. And on the outskirts of Ramallah, among piles of rocks and weeds, a little pond reflects the sky. It could be a water-filled bomb crater. On the far side, right in the middle of the image, stands a small tree \u2013 though it is harder to see than its reflection. The bare trunk and branches lightning-fork the still water. The tree looks dead. It is a nothing sort of place where you don\u2019t expect miracles. Struth leaves us with bafflement. An image of a wrecked building, with a great wedge of concrete dangling in space, depicts the destroyed Syrian mosque at Hushniya. A view across a vast landscape, taken from Mount Bental on the Golan Heights, is a place where the military and the touristic coincide.     Basilica of the Annunciation, Nazareth, 2014 by Thomas Struth. Photograph: Marian Goodman Gallery    Barricades on the streets of Al-Khalil, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, block off the Palestinian town to protect the Jewish settlers who have taken over the town. The place looks empty, the doors are closed. Apart from the blur of a few passing cars, the astonishing townscape of Har Homa, built in violation of international law, is like a deserted resort clinging to a hillside before an endless devastated beach, the levelled land before it a promise of further development. Among these images of places and non-places, barricaded and blocked-off streets in Hebron, Struth interjects his shots of hi-tech laboratory equipment, rigged-up experiments and the infernal machinery of scientific investigation. As though to drag us from one incomprehensible situation to another, he goes inside the Z-Pinch Plasma lab at the Weizmann Institute of Science at Rehovot, just south of Tel Aviv. In another lab, he shows us a High Harmonic Generation Spectrometer. I have no idea what any of this stuff does, and neither, perhaps, does he. After the wastelands of east Jerusalem and the bleached light of the Al-Ram Quarry at Kafr\u2019Aqab, the barbed wire and corrugated iron barricades and dessicated landscapes, these images come with a jolt. How do these worlds connect?     Z-Pinch Plasma Lab, Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, 2011 by Thomas Struth. Photograph: Marian Goodman Gallery    Dazzled by these images of high technology, with their shining metal, exposed wiring, lenses and lights and congested apparatuses, one suddenly comes across the only black-and-white image in the show, which depicts the interior of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in east Jerusalem (supposedly the site of Christ\u2019s entombment) with its columns and ancient shadows, and another shot of the altar of the Basilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth. This, too, looks like some sort of experiment, with its symbols and objects, the formal arrangement of its elements, the complexity of its architecture. I know that there are stories here, and that they demand some sort of explanation. Incomprehension, bafflement, a sense that one is in a state of ignorance pervades. These images mean something \u2013 they must mean many things \u2013 but their stories are withheld. You look and look again, all the same. These are reticent, almost reluctant images of a world suspended in a state of unnerving calm. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 May 2015 to remove a description of the the project The Place as Israeli-sponsored.", "publicationDate": "2015-04-30T17:30:43Z", "title": "Where have all the people gone?

Indeed, judging by its manifesto, it wants to replace theatres with pubs (ones you can smoke in) and galleries with tourist centres celebrating British heritage. Rule Britannia, and all that. What we used to call the mainstream parties talk about the creative industries and the importance of creativity in general \u2013 which is generally made to feel like an attribute of the entrepreneurial spirit and thus is folded into the whole capitalist ethos. Only the Greens specifically say they will raise arts funding, by \u00a3500m. In an age of austerity and utilitarianism, the arts are an easy target, the low-hanging fruit of those scouring public finances for cuts. So why the arts? Because as politics becomes ever more homogenised and defensive \u2013 as indicated by the present election \u2013 the arts should be one of the places to challenge the idea that our political and financial masters have a monopoly on what counts as established reality. As I sat watching Caryl Churchill\u2019s fine Light Shining in Buckinghamshire at the National Theatre last week, I realised how much the politics of 1649 were so much more interesting and expansive than the dreary fare of 2015. It reminded me of something we used to call vision, a sense that the world could be otherwise, that our political assumptions can always be turned upside down. That used to be the role of religion. It widened the lens and stimulated the political imagination to consider broader social perspectives. But in a secular age, that responsibility now resides primarily with the arts.    Like the prophets of the Hebrew scriptures, the best theatre should risk being pelted with rotten tomatoes    My friend Assi Dayan died exactly a year ago, on 1 May 2014. He was a troubled actor and filmmaker, whose deep resources of existential honesty produced some of the most critical films of Israeli cinema, launching broadsides against unthinking loyalty \u2013 loyalty to the sort of militarism that his father, the famously eye-patched Moshe Dayan, had done so much to inculcate into Israeli culture. When Moshe saw Assi\u2019s first collection of poems, he dismissed them as kishkush (nonsense) \u2013 the standard reaction of the right to any sort of expression that refuses the parameters of accepted discourse. Last week, on Israeli independence day, I showed one of his films, Life According to Agfa, at the JW3 Jewish cultural centre in north London. A member of the audience was angry I had chosen this day, of all days, to show a film in which Israeli soldiers murder fellow Jews in a Tel Aviv bar. My argument back was that self-criticism can be another, sometimes deeper, form of loyalty, an attempt to hold something you love to a higher standard. Which is why the arts, unless they become mere entertainment and propaganda, should often elicit just this sort of reaction. Like the prophets of the Hebrew scriptures, the best theatre should risk being pelted with rotten tomatoes. For the primary vocation of the prophets was not to predict the future but to tell a wider (and often unpopular) truth about the present. But in this way the arts revivify the possibilities of human experience, and suggest that our familiar patterns of political expression may have a dark side that we refuse to acknowledge. The irony is that Agfa \u2013 that is, film, or now video \u2013 is partly responsible for this. Our politicians hunker down in front of the cameras, terrified to say anything that may fall outside the safety of accepted parameters. For as well as being a medium for critical thinking, \u201cAgfa\u201d can just as easily encourage a stultifying one-dimensionality. And it is the job of the arts proper to disrupt this. Which is why it is so convenient for mainstream politicians to divert its funding into pubs or heritage or \u201cthe creative industries\u201d \u2013 as a result of which arts organisations which require substantial funding can easily become playthings of the wealthy donors that support them. And so the boundaries of our (political) imagination contract further, to the detriment of us all. @giles_fraser ", "publicationDate": "2015-05-01T17:56:00Z", "title": "The arts are much more than simply money-making \u2018creative industries\u2019 | Giles Fraser", "sentences": ["A member of the audience was angry I had chosen this day, of all days, to show a film in which Israeli soldiers murder fellow Jews in a Tel Aviv bar."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2015/may/01/arts-are-much-more-than-simply-money-making-creative-industries"}, {"tags": [], "article": "Here in the UK, one topic has dominated conversation above all others this week. Not the royal baby \u2013 OK, admittedly that was a minor diversion for a while \u2013 but the subject of who will form the next government after Thursday\u2019s election. With both Labour and the Conservatives tied in the polls and Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s Scottish nationalists on the charge, it is proving one of the hardest elections to call in the country\u2019s history. Unfortunately the Guardian Weekly\u2019s print deadline precludes us from bringing you the result in this week\u2019s edition, so can I instead direct all you election addicts to the Guardian\u2019s brilliant online coverage, where you\u2019ll find all the news, analysis and multimedia to keep you in the picture once the polls close at 10pm BST on Thursday. As May Day passes, our cover this week takes a different tack from the norm, looking at the positive ways in which recession-hit workers around the world have formed co-operatives to salvage their shuttered livelihoods. From Andalucia to Argentina, there are stories of uncertainty, sacrifice and financial risk. But above all they bear inspiring messages of what people in adversity can achieve when they work for one other. Coverage inside the paper reflects another week in a fragile world under pressure, from Nepal, trying to regroup after the devastating earthquake, to Brazil, where Amazonian tribes are uniting against hydropower schemes that threaten their ways of life. We also hear from Kazakhstan, where fears are growing that the central Asian country may be next on Vladimir Putin\u2019s repossession hit list, and from the Central African Republic, where a leaked report containing allegations of child abuse by French UN peacekeeping troops has caused shockwaves. Our long-read Review section takes us to Cuba and the charming tale of a Havana ice-cream parlour that in many ways encapsulates the life of the island under Castro. There\u2019s also an encouraging piece from Le Monde about how some French libraries are reattuning themselves with the 21st-century needs of their communities, a subject I found particularly interesting as my own local library in south London wrestles with similar issues. The Washington Post introduces us to Israel\u2019s Jews of Iranian heritage and their concerns over the nuclear deal so vilified by their adopted country. Our Eyewitnessed picture spread, meanwhile, has a brilliant shot of police attacking Ethiopian Jews at a demonstration in Tel Aviv. Both serve to remind us of the internationally diverse nature of Israel\u2019s population.

An Eritrean who recently arrived in South Sudan after six years in Tel Aviv, Tesfahannes is one of a new wave of refugees forced out of Israel by the country\u2019s increasingly tough stance towards migrants.  He is covered in tattoos, including a message on his right arm to Israelis: \u201cI hate them but I can\u2019t live without them.\u201d Tesfahannes says that with \u201cno money I have no aims. But you have to keep moving, always. I live risk to risk.\u201d     Robel Tesfahannes Photograph:  Antony Loewenstein    Tesfahannes left Eritrea in 2008, fleeing mandatory military service in a regime that tolerates no dissent, and travelled through Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt before arriving in Israel. He says he was briefly imprisoned before being released into the community.  \u201cThe Israeli government said bad things about us Africans,\u201d he says, \u201cand I felt Israelis looked at us suspiciously.\u201d He alleges that he was routinely harassed by Israeli police and eventually decided that he had to leave.  The country recently announced a deal with Rwanda to deport Eritrean and Sudanese migrants there, claiming they would be given visas and allowed to work. In return, Rwanda would receive economic benefits. But Tesfahannes says the promise of work and security never materialised.   Instead his journey from Israel to the world\u2019s newest nation was a tortuous one. Given $3,500 (\u00a32,200) in cash on departure by Israeli officials, he was flown to Rwanda earlier this year with 10 other Eritreans. Tesfahannes says he was given three nights\u2019 accommodation in Kigali before being told by a Rwandan official that he had to pay $150 (\u00a398) to secure safe passage to Uganda. No work opportunities were ever discussed, he said.   With no identification, passport or money, the 25-year-old is in limbo, dreaming of making the journey north to Europe.   No protection   Related: Israel to deport Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers to third countries    Until recently, Israel provided a one-off monetary incentive for asylum seekers to leave the country voluntarily if they signed a document giving their written consent.  Now the state will give them 30 days to leave; those who refuse will face a hearing that could lead to indefinite detention. Israel has around 50,000 Africans within its borders, including 2,000 at the Holot detention camp in the Negev desert. The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has referred to them as \u201cinfiltrators\u201d. A report recently published by two Israeli NGOs supported Tesfahannes\u2019s claim that African migrants sent from Israel to Rwanda, Uganda or elsewhere in Africa under the new policy are given no work rights or protections when arriving. \u201cThe fees for two nights\u2019 stay at a local hotel in Uganda are paid for by the state of Israel. After that, the asylum seekers are asked to leave,\u201d the report says, \u201cwith no identification documents and no possibility of proving where they have come from\u201d. A day after a boat sank in the Mediterranean in April causing the deaths of 700 migrants, the country\u2019s transportation minister Yisrael Katz said that the drownings justified Israel\u2019s policy and its fence along its border with Egypt \u201cwhich blocks the job-seeking migrants before they enter Israel\u201d.  Last Sunday in Tel Aviv thousands of Israelis and ethnic Ethiopians protested to highlight the racism against Africans, after a video emerged showing a black Israeli soldier being assaulted by a policeman. Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon denies that the country harasses migrants: \u201cAfrican migrants in Israel are treated fairly and humanely,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police intervenes when Israel\u2019s laws have been broken. It does so with restraint and acts under legal scrutiny.\u201d           Migrants describe their experiences in Holot detention centre, in the Negev desert in Israel.     A spokeswoman for the Rwandan directorate of immigration declined to comment on the allegations, while Uganda has denied any agreement with Israel to receive migrants. \u2018I\u2019m not scared of drowning\u2019 Tesfahannes says that he came to South Sudan because other Eritrean migrants in Kampala told him it was a safer place to stay before making the move towards north Africa, and eventually Europe. In Juba, Tesfahannes has little money. A brother still working in Israel has sent him some US dollars, but he has few friends and no family here. His tattoos have scared off potential employees. \u201cI\u2019m like a dog,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Africa dogs are shot and killed, we\u2019re like animals. Dogs are not killed in Europe.\u201d The majority of migrants arriving in South Sudan from Israel live in Shirikat, a poor area near the capital city, on the road to Uganda. In the single, dirty rooms of a guesthouse people-smugglers arrange the dangerous trip to Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, one stop on the way up to Libya. Tesfahannes acknowledges that he may have to stay in South Sudan if he can\u2019t raise the funds to leave. \u201cI\u2019m not scared of drowning in the Mediterranean,\u201d he says. \u201cGod decides my fate. I want to have a wife and kids one day if I don\u2019t die first.\u201d  He cannot return to Eritrea because of the regime\u2019s ongoing repression, and is stateless \u2013 like many migrants making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean.

South Sudan, a country riven by civil war with millions facing food insecurity, is ill-prepared to handle this influx of outsiders. The government does not know how many Africans are crossing its borders, though Eritreans in Juba say it\u2019s in the thousands, with more on the way.

The agreement on a new coalition government \u2013 made possible after Netanyahu struck a deal with far-right party Jewish Home, led by Naftali Bennett \u2013 appears to set the scene for a period of unstable government, as well as for new difficulties for Israel on the international stage. The influence of the hardline Bennett, whose political base is the rightwing national religious constituency, raises scant prospect of a return to peace negotiations with the Palestinians, even at a time when Israel is under mounting international pressure. That includes moves by France to draft a fresh UN security council resolution calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state and growing frustration with Israel in both the EU and within the Obama administration in the US.

Bennett has also called for the annexation of parts of the West Bank, which goes beyond Netanyahu\u2019s pledge to continue to build settlements only in areas Israel intends to keep in any future peace deal with the Palestinians. With a majority of one seat in the 120-seat Israeli Knesset, the new government comprises Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing Likud, the new centre-right Kulanu party led by Moshe Kahlon, and the ultra-orthodox Shas and United Torah Judaism, in addition to the pro-settler Jewish Home.  While Netanyahu \u2013 whose party won 30 seats in March elections \u2013 had been expected to form a right-leaning government easily, the withdrawal of Avigdor Lieberman and his Yisrael Beiteinu party on Monday plunged the talks into chaos and left Netanyahu with a government many pundits suspect will struggle to survive.

Announcing the new government, Netanyahu hinted heavily at this prospect. \u201cI said that 61 is a good number and 61 plus is even better,\u201d he said, \u201cTime is short because we have to form a strong and stable government by next week.\u201d Opposition figures and analysts criticised Netanyahu for his handling of the negotiations, they said had produced an unstable government doomed to collapse.     Analysts think recruiting Isaac Herzog could be the government\u2019s best chance of survival. Photograph: Nir Elias/Reuters    Writing on Facebook, Herzog \u2013 whose Zionist Union was defeated by Netanyahu in March \u2013 said the new coalition was a \u201cnational failure government\u201d and predicted it would be \u201cirresponsible, unstable and unable to govern\u201d. Critics have accused Netanyahu of agreeing to onerous conditions from his new partners. These included promises to reverse legislation cutting state subsidies to the ultra-Orthodox, soften measures designed to encourage them to undertake mandatory military service, and hand Jewish Home the justice ministry. Equally serious is the perception that Netanyahu will be held hostage to party and individual interests and will struggle to push through legislation.

Photograph: Stringer/Israel/Reuters    Although previous prime ministers have managed to govern with such a slight majority, the assessment is that Netanyahu lacks the personal and political skills to hold such a coalition together. Writing in Yedioth Ahronoth, commentator Eitan Haber said: \u201cA 61-seat government is hell for members of the coalition and primarily so for the person who shoulders the responsibilities of coalition chairman \u2026 The coalition chairman is going to have to be a magician and a contortionist to maintain a permanent majority in the plenum. \u201cAnd those are only the smaller problems. An overtly rightwing government, such as the one that is going to be sworn in next week, will have to fight nearly the entire world diplomatically.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-05-07T12:52:58Z", "title": "Shaky Israel coalition spells trouble for Netanyahu and peace process", "sentences": ["Moshe Kahlon, head of new centre-right party Kulanu, waves to supporters at party headquarters in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/07/binyamin-netanyahu-clings-to-a-coalition-precipice"}, {"tags": ["Sculpture", "Art", "Israel"], "article": "The many works produced by the Israeli sculptor and painter Menashe Kadishman, who has died aged 82, often surprised and provoked, blurring the boundaries between art and non-art. At the 1978 Venice Biennale, he displayed a live flock of sheep stained blue (a \u201cmoving painting\u201d, he called it). He took care of the sheep through drawing on his experience as a shepherd on a kibbutz in his youth. Sheep became a major motif in his art, especially in painting, and the story of the shepherd who turned into an artist became part of his myth. Kadishman\u2019s large physique, wild beard, loose garment and sandals enhanced his image of a child of nature. In his sculptures, Kadishman developed a signature style of cutout silhouettes made of steel, some reaching a height of 5 metres or more, somehow preserving the sensitive qualities of the line drawings from which they derived. In 1997, the round, open-mouthed faces, made from iron, that had been part of his previous works were accumulated and spread on a gallery floor in Tel Aviv, with the title Shalechet \u2013 Hebrew for fallen leaves. This work grew and was exhibited elsewhere, culminating in a permanent installation of 20,000 pieces in Daniel Libeskind\u2019s Jewish Museum in Berlin. Walking on the metal heads \u2013 as there is no other way of seeing it \u2013 is an unforgettable experience.     Menashe Kadishman\u2019s installation Shalechet (1997), at the Jewish Museum, Berlin. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod    Kadishman experimented with works exploring the relationship between nature and art. A series of environmental works, The Forest (Montevideo, Uruguay, 1969; New York Central Park, 1970; Haus Lange Museum, Krefeld, Germany, 1972) combined man-made yellow plates with the natural environment. Going one step further, he painted a tree in yellow organic paint (Jerusalem, 1972). His sculpture spanned two different trends in the art of the second half of the 20th century. The first, concerned with its own form, materiality and gravity, peaked in the mid-1960s to mid-1970s, especially in Britain and the US, and Kadishman was a fluent contributor. Examples include the minimalist aluminium and glass sculpture Segments (1968) at the Museum of Modern Art in New York; the yellow painted Suspense (1966) at the entrance to the Israel Museum, Jerusalem; Uprise (1967-74) in the Habima National Theatre Square, Tel Aviv; and Suspended (1968-76) at the Storm King Art Center, New York. The other trend, from the early 1980s, related to art as a carrier of meaning: myths, memories and narratives, personal and collective. The sacrifice of Isaac was a major theme in Kadishman\u2019s sculpture of the 1980s, which developed from the paintings of sheep he had started doing in 1979 and continued until his last days. In the early 1990s he began a poignant series of works on a theme rarely approached by a male artist: birth. In these works the child is brutally detached, head down, from the mother\u2019s body in a moment of mutual pain. Kadishman was born in Tel Aviv to Bilha, a teacher and painter, and Ben Zion Kadishman, an industrial worker and sculptor, who emigrated from Ukraine in the early 1920s. He received his first artistic training from 1947 to 1950 with the sculptor Moshe Sternschuss, one of the founders of the modernist art group New Horizons, and then with the sculptor Rudi Lehmann, known for his sculptures and prints of animals. In 1959 Kadishman went to London to study at St Martin\u2019s School of Art, at the time the hub of the New Generation of British sculptors led by Anthony Caro. After a year or so he moved to the Slade School of Art and studied with Reg Butler. The transition of British sculpture from the figurative and mythical tendencies of the 1950s to the abstract, industrial-influenced works of the 1960s is apparent in Kadishman\u2019s early sculpture as he replaced bronze and stone with aluminium, glass and steel. The curator of his 1965 first solo show in London\u2019s Grosvenor Gallery, Charles S Spencer preferred to link his work to the artist\u2019s native land, Israel \u2018with its harsh, linear landscape, vast deserts (sic!), bare mountain ranges\u2019 and to his \u2018Hebraic attitude\u2019. In 1967 Kadishman won the first prize for sculpture at the 5th Paris Biennale for young artists and in 1968 participated in Documenta 4 in Kassel, Germany. Being a foreign artist in Britain was not easy in those days, as Kadishman related in the 2011 book on his sculptures by Marc Scheps. Being Israeli, without a British passport, prevented him from participating in official exhibitions, a painful experience that made him feel as if he did not belong in art circles. But it also had a liberating effect: \u201cI suddenly understood that whether I followed or did not follow a certain trend, or was or was not influenced by a certain artist, my work emanated from within me \u2013 with no passports, permissions and accepted notions.\u201d In 1965 he married Tamara Alferoff, a British psychotherapist, and they had two children, Ben and Maya. In 1972, they separated and he returned to Israel. His career prospered in the following years, both in Israel and internationally. In 1995 he was awarded his country\u2019s highest honour, the Israel Prize. He is survived by his children and six grandchildren.

Her two novels, The Wallcreeper and Mislaid, will be published in Britain next month after eliciting praise and astonishment in the US. Her debut, The Wallcreeper, features a spectacularly ill-matched American couple, Tiffany and Stephen, whose misadventures take in sex, drugs and eco-terrorism. The New York Times lauded it as \u201ca very funny, very strange work of unhinged brilliance\u201d and it was among several publications to declare the novel 2014\u2019s best literary debut. Zink, 51, grew up in rural Virginia and her CV includes \u201cbricklayer\u201d and \u201cnoise band guitarist\u201d. She lives in Bad Belzig, a very small town in north-east Germany, from where she can presumably view the fuss around her sudden literary career from a safe distance. As a precocious and unhappy child, Zink resolved to \u201c[pitch] my tent outside the folds of humanity\u201d. She has stayed there, it seems, ever since. After attending the College of William and Mary in Virginia, she had a brief spell of homelessness before moving to Philadelphia, where she published a fanzine titled Animal Review in which musicians wrote about their pets. It featured, for example, King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp paying tribute to his rabbit, Beaton Bunnerius Bun. She had been writing fiction since she was a child, but for 15 years her readership numbered precisely one: the Israeli writer Avner Shats, with whom she struck up an epistolary friendship after her then-husband, Zohar Eitan, a poet, composer and lecturer at Tel Aviv university, introduced them. In 2010, she wrote a letter to fellow birder Jonathan Franzen in response to a New Yorker piece he wrote about the illegal hunting of songbirds. Franzen was so charmed by her erudition and the strange dazzle of her prose that he correctly suspected her to be a writer of fiction. A correspondence ensued and by 2012 he had convinced her to send him her collected manuscripts. Soon afterwards, he became a vocal advocate of her work, to her bemusement. As she put it in a recent New Yorker magazine profile: \u201cI was hailed on my life raft by the passing container ship Franzen.\u201d Eventually, Franzen\u2019s agent secured Zink a six-figure deal for Mislaid, a provocative, cunningly hilarious novel that begins with the coupling of a teenage lesbian, Peggy, and Lee Fleming, a male poet and professor who is \u201cqueer as a three-dollar bill\u201d. Peggy, a white woman, gives birth to a daughter and runs away with her, disguising themselves, in official papers at least, as African Americans. The Washington Post called it \u201ca subversive minstrel show sprung from an encyclopedic mind drunk on the Mad Hatter\u2019s tea\u201d. Zink explained: \u201cI was so tired of Franzen saying that I should take myself seriously as a writer and I wanted to make very clear that there\u2019s a very clear distinction between taking your career seriously and taking your writing seriously.\u201d So she wrote most of The Wallcreeper, she said, \u201cin four days, to show him that I knew what I was doing as a writer\u201d.

Reed \u2013 who is dressed in purple pants, a Hawaiian shirt, and sports a Skrillex-style haircut \u2013 started renting this house in March. Up until then, he was bouncing around from studio to studio, but now he has a two-story abode that he rents exclusively to work in. (One bedroom is for vocals, another is for production, and so on.) It turns out that when you craft hit after top 10 hit, you get to do things like rent an entire house for the sole purpose of churning out party songs. If you\u2019ve never heard of Ricky Reed \u2013 or his solo act Wallpaper \u2013 odds are you\u2019ve bobbed your head or become earworm fodder for at least one of the tracks he has produced. Whether it\u2019s for top 40 mainstays such as Pitbull (Fireball), Jessie J (Burnin\u2019 Up), or Fifth Harmony (Bo$$). Yet Reed\u2019s biggest success came as a result of putting together a beat on a whim for Jason Derulo.  \u201cAt the time, he had broken his neck and hadn\u2019t been very active,\u201d Reed explains as he sways back and forth.  \u201cI was in the studio doing a session that was not fruitful and this A&amp;R, Miles Beard, came in and played me a song he heard while on vacation in Tel Aviv. When the horn part came in and I was like, \u2018Fuck. That\u2019s huge.\u2019\u201d   It only took a few hours for Reed to flip that sample (Israeli band Balkan Beat Box\u2019s 2007 track Hermetico) and come out on the other end with Talk Dirty, one of the ubiquitous party anthems of last summer and a song that rocketed Derulo into relevance once again.  \u201cTalk Dirty was meteoric and I was only a cog in its creation,\u201d says Reed of his success with Derulo, which they also achieved with another risqu\u00e9 top 10 smash, Wiggle. \u201cReal hit songs are different from just a veteran artist releasing a solid song. A hit is a guy like Jason having a song where it changes people\u2019s opinions, and is startling, polarizing, and infectious.\u201d The rise Reed is referring to didn\u2019t start in southern California, but in the San Francisco Bay area, a place that he says formed him musically and gave him the attitude of an underdog.  \u201cA lot of people from the Bay, especially musicians, feel like northern California is not the place where everything\u2019s poppin\u2019 off and not quite on the cutting edge artistically as New York or LA,\u201d Reed explains.      Novena Carmel and Ricky Reed of Wallpaper perform on the BMI Stage during 2014 Lollapalooza at Grant Park in Chicago. Photograph: Erika Goldring/FilmMagic    \u201cPeople from the Bay feel like they have something to prove, and I always love feeling like I have something to prove.\u201d  With zero connections to anyone in show business, Reed built his career on a bedrock of rejection until Wallpaper \u2013 a solo project he started initially as a joke. Complete with wild beats, exaggerated Auto-Tuned and frat-boy lyrics \u2013 the solo act soon became locally, then nationally well known. Reed quickly honed his voice with Wallpaper, which lyrically bridged the gap between songs that extol the virtues of partying while also having a heart.  As a result of fostering that quirky knowhow \u2013 and not to mention all the recent hits \u2013 Reed\u2019s manic brand of pop is in high demand at the moment. Today\u2019s artists would kill for a chance to head to Reed\u2019s sleepy studio house and concoct the next big smash. Whether it\u2019s from already established artists on the charts (Janelle Mon\u00e1e is penciled in for a session this month) or up-and-comers looking for a break \u2013 Reed fields requests with a keen sense of discernment. \u201cWe had a choice after Talk Dirty went big \u2013 make the big money by immediately producing 10 more similar tracks for other artists and then be forgotten about, or move on to the next.\u201d Reed wisely chose the latter route and painstakingly chooses his follow-up projects, all of which run the gamut musically. He\u2019s producing the next single for Swedish girl duo Icona Pop (best known for their 2013 hit I Love it), but Reed is most excited about collaborating with the less-known Colombian band Bomba Est\u00e9reo (a project he recently spent two weeks in Bogot\u00e1 for, the outcome of which is \u201cinsane\u201d). In addition, he\u2019s the executive producer of Twenty One Pilots\u2019s next album, is gearing up for Derulo\u2019s follow-up album to Talk Dirty, Everything is 4, and he\u2019s also the mastermind behind Lunchmoney Lewis, an artist that could best be described as CeeLo Green crossed with a southern preacher.  It is with Lunchmoney\u2019s quirky debut single Bills that Reed could see his next big success, as it\u2019s quickly scaling the charts, buoyed by its inherent potential to go viral \u2013 it\u2019s an insanely catchy track about the simple downsides of paying bills, after all. \u201cI became kind of obsessed with doing a modern-day spin on gospel rag,\u201d says Reed of the impetus of Lunchmoney\u2019s sound. \u201cWhen I played Lunch a beat I made, he randomly jumped up and was like, \u2018I \u2026 got \u2026 bills!\u2019 It was so hooky and so odd. He went into the booth for an hour and a half rolling with those lyrics. By the end of the day we knew it was a thing.\u201d By now, Reed knows how to navigate the delicate process of working with a variety of artists: \u201cCollaborating with someone on music is the same way you\u2019d go about hanging out.\u201d  \u201cYou have to listen more than you talk. Everybody that I\u2019ve worked with I\u2019m already in love with from afar, so when I get in a room with them I\u2019m like, \u2018What do you want to do? What do you want to try?\u2019  \u201cEvery collaboration with a new person is like when you take a bin of Legos and dump them on the floor. All of the pieces to work with are right there. A floor full of Legos is full of possibilities.\u201d Sadly, there aren\u2019t any Legos around to make this analogy come to life, but despite that fact, Reed is attempting to lend that basic vibe full of possibilities to his house, including applying a wall full of moss imported from Italy in the vocals room (it\u2019s supposedly great for acoustics), as well as installing an indoor, vertical living wall of succulents (he\u2019s not sure how they\u2019re going to water it yet). It\u2019s all in an effort to keep up with the supreme goal of making quality pop he can be proud of.  \u201cI had a session with Andrew WK once,\u201d he explains, while sitting in his hammock and sipping a bottle of water. \u201cHe said, \u2018Some people say that alcohol clouds your mind and blurs your vision. In my opinion, partying actually strips all of the barriers between people.\u2019 And he\u2019s right. When you\u2019re in that headspace where everything is great and you\u2019re with your favorite people, that\u2019s when you\u2019re most connected. Whether it\u2019s love and sex or friendship, that\u2019s at the core of [the music]. It\u2019s an idea as old as time but ever-changing, and I find it endlessly fascinating.\u201d  Speaking of, how much does the purveyor of party music party himself? \u201cNot very often,\u201d he notes. \u201cTo keep up the work output, I can\u2019t be showing up to the studio hungover. But if I\u2019m on tour and it\u2019s time to go \u2026 I really go.\u201d Sounds like the perfect sentiment for his next hit.", "publicationDate": "2015-05-18T15:24:08Z", "title": "Producer Ricky Reed: 'I always love feeling like I have something to prove'", "sentences": ["\u201cI was in the studio doing a session that was not fruitful and this A&amp;R, Miles Beard, came in and played me a song he heard while on vacation in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/18/ricky-reed-music-producer-wallpaper"}, {"tags": ["Crawley Town", "League One", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "The first thing to report is that John Gregory is in good health. Sitting in a restaurant in central London, Gregory looks and sounds remarkably well for a man who underwent open heart surgery at the start of the year and it says much about the speed of his recovery that he is already talking about the next chapter of a managerial career that in recent times has taken him from Israel to Crawley via Kazakhstan. That breathless feeling Gregory experienced after climbing a flight of stairs has gone and at the age of 61 his appetite for football management burns as strong as ever. \u201cI\u2019m in better condition than the vast majority of the managers in the game at the moment because my heart is perfect now,\u201d says Gregory, who was referred to a cardiologist in December while in charge of Crawley. \u201cIt\u2019s not a stress issue. I had a faulty valve, I\u2019ve got a brand new one now.\u201d Gregory is in good spirits, enjoying life and free from any discomfort \u2013 at least that is the case until we discuss Saturday\u2019s FA Cup final between Arsenal and Aston Villa and, in the same breath, row back to the last time when the Midlands club were in this position. The year was 2000, Chelsea were the opponents, Villa lost 1-0 and Gregory was in charge. A largely forgettable match was settled by a second-half Roberto Di Matteo goal following a mistake from David James. Except Gregory has never thought of the game in that way. \u201cJamo got us there, he saved two penalties in the semi-final in the shootout. I\u2019d never point a finger, I look at myself. I could have done more and I\u00a0should have done more. I should have been more offensive, maybe put on another striker, risk losing the game 2-0 or 3-0 but have a go. \u201cYou just put the trust in the players and maybe on the day there wasn\u2019t too many in the team who performed as well as they had done in the league games that year. But it\u2019s gone. And I\u2019ve felt guilty ever since. It keeps me awake at night. Even now. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t been back there in the FA Cup since \u201957, so it was 43 years. But we didn\u2019t win it and that still haunts me. And to this day, I never ever want to talk about that final to people because we lost. It\u2019s failure. And that feeling \u2013 and I talk about this with my family at times, you kind of look back and think: \u2018You\u2019ve done this, this, this and this, you ain\u2019t done badly in your life.\u2019 And it\u2019s like: \u2018Yeah, I know, but I didn\u2019t win the FA Cup.\u2019\u201d Gregory had appeared in the FA Cup final as a player for Queens Park Rangers against Tottenham Hotspur in 1982 and he tells a nice story about how he received a telegram beforehand from a former classmate that said: \u201cEvery schoolboy\u2019s dream.\u201d QPR were beaten by Spurs in a replay, courtesy of a Glenn Hoddle penalty, yet Gregory never felt anything like as bad about that defeat. With a manager, he says, the sense of responsibility is so much greater and even more so when there is an emotional attachment, which was the case with Gregory and Villa. He had played and coached at Villa before being appointed manager in 1998 and the overwhelming feeling at the end of that Cup final against Chelsea was that he had let people down. \u201cI had 40,000 Villa fans there that day and as I walked out the tunnel, in what was the old Wembley, all the Villa fans were at that end of the stadium. The sight was beautiful. It wasn\u2019t just \u2018wow\u2019, it was a thing of beauty: \u2018This is my team.\u2019 I can see it all now still, it was just washed in claret and blue. The thought that went through my head, of course, was: \u2018You\u2019ve got to come back past this lot and back into the dressing room. Make sure you win.\u2019\u201d At the time of the final Gregory had been Villa manager for a little more than two years and the one consolation for him in the wake of that defeat was that there was a chance to put things right in seasons to come. Yet despite taking Villa to the Premier League summit in three of his four seasons in charge, there was no silverware and Gregory resigned in January 2002 after becoming exasperated with Doug Ellis, the chairman at the time, for refusing to sanction the signing of Muzzy Izzet several months earlier. \u201cWe were top of the league and I couldn\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t want to make that jump to get another player,\u201d he says. Ellis, in Gregory\u2019s words, \u201cwasn\u2019t the worst\u201d and the two of them always exchange pleasantries whenever their paths cross these days, yet there were plenty of times when the Villa chairman would drive him round the bend, whether it was complaining about paying a right-back more than \u00a310,000 a week or being stuck in a time warp. \u201cI always remember I criticised our training ground once, before they rebuilt Bodymoor Heath, and Doug told me: \u2018Bill Shankly said that\u2019s the best training ground he had ever seen\u2019 \u2013 which Bill Shankly had said. But he said it 25 years before. That was where it was hard sometimes dragging Doug into the next century.\u201d There were no shortage of egos in the Villa dressing room back then and Gregory shakes his head as he recalls some of the things he had to deal with while in charge. He remembers being in Cannes on holiday in 1998 and being criticised for not controlling his players in the wake of Stan Collymore physically assaulting Ulrika Jonsson. \u201cI had the Women\u2019s Liberation on the phone asking why I wouldn\u2019t give them an interview,\u201d he says. Gregory\u2019s Villa teams were, by his own admission, workmanlike rather than entertaining and so it was no real surprise that David Ginola\u2019s move to the club never worked out. Although Ellis pushed and pushed to sign Ginola \u2013 \u201cHe came back from Mauritius, where he\u2019d met David one summer and he was in love with him\u201d \u2013 Gregory says that the deal would not have gone ahead without him agreeing to it. It was a decision that all parties would later come to regret, perhaps with the exception of Ellis, who seemed to enjoy having his photo taken with Ginola at various points. The biggest problem for Gregory, who had been talked about as a potential England manager at one stage, was coming to terms with life after Villa. \u201cI thought I\u2019d never leave. I thought I\u2019m going to be here for ever,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I also remember saying to people very close to me when I left Villa: \u2018It\u2019s all down hill now.\u2019 I knew it wouldn\u2019t get any better than that. And that\u2019s how it\u2019s been.\u201d Gregory had spells with Derby and QPR before going out to Israel but he has always kept a close eye on things at Villa. Gregory is, essentially, a Villa fan, as anyone who follows him on Twitter would know. On the day of the semi\u2011final against Liverpool, Gregory posted a picture of himself next to the Villa dugout at Wembley, titled \u201cThe winners\u2019 enclosure\u201d. \u201cThat was before the game kicked off,\u201d he says, smiling. Gregory is full of praise for the job that Tim Sherwood has done since replacing Paul Lambert. \u201cI think Tim\u2019s been brave, he could have come in and taken a really cautious approach but he hasn\u2019t done that. He\u2019s selected offensive teams and I think that\u2019s really commendable. You get a honeymoon period and Tim has now given himself until next January because he\u2019s got all the fans onside. I follow a lot of Villa fans on Twitter and there is one guy who has basically made a full blown apology after slagging Tim off when he first came in.\u201d It is difficult to know where Gregory will show up next on the back of his last few experiences. He managed two clubs in Israel, Maccabi Ahi Nazareth and Ashdod, between 2009 and 2011, and thoroughly enjoyed his time in the country, even if he ended up pleading for a bit of rain on a morning to provide some respite from the sunshine. Gregory has been back to Israel since and says that he never had any security concerns while he was out there. \u201cWhen I was in Ashdod there was a little bit of trouble because Ashdod is right in the south, 25kms further than Tel Aviv, so you\u2019re heading towards Gaza. So the sirens used to go off, every apartment has got a bomb room, which is lined with steel and the advice was always to go and get in that. But I never feared for my own safety. I\u2019m realistic, get on with it, don\u2019t spend your life worrying.\u201d As for Kazakhstan, the city of Almaty did not quite tally with the image that Gregory had in his head when he flew in to become manager of FC Kairat in 2011 and pictured Sacha Baron Cohen. \u201cI landed, got picked up at the airport, there were Porsches, Mercedes, BMWs everywhere. And then we drove past a Bentley garage. I was thinking, obviously, Borat, pony and trap, and here were all these fantastic cars. It was like Mayfair.\u201d Gregory returned to management in England for the first time in six years when he took over at Crawley in 2013 and it is a source of frustration that surgery prevented him from seeing the job through \u2013 Dean Saunders was appointed on an interim basis in December \u2013 and having a shot at keeping the club in League One. It is unlikely, however, to be the last time that we see Gregory in a dugout. \u201cI think out there somewhere there will be a job for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got the right financial backing, and the right support, and someone who has got common sense and doesn\u2019t sit there reading the message board all day\u00a0\u2026 I worked for Briatore at QPR, I had no chance, nor did the other nine that followed me in two years because it was all about Flavio and every decision appeared that he was just making it on a whim, similar with the guy at Leeds. But I\u2019ll be ready to go back whenever it may be.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-05-27T21:00:04Z", "title": "Fit-again John Gregory\u2019s heart still aches over Aston Villa\u2019s lost FA Cup final", "sentences": ["\u201cWhen I was in Ashdod there was a little bit of trouble because Ashdod is right in the south, 25kms further than Tel Aviv, so you\u2019re heading towards Gaza."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/john-gregory-aston-villa-fa-cup-final-2000"}, {"tags": ["Religion", "Scotland", "UK news"], "article": "The lifestyle of the Cistercian monks in Nunraw Abbey provides the closest approximation of what the daily regime of a radical leftwinger such as me ought to look like. They rise before dawn to praise God for the gifts He has bestowed upon them: their food, their fellowship, their very being, and then spend the rest of the day in quiet study and contemplation and working their little corner of glorious East Lothian pasture to provide for each other. In this stripped-down existence, free from any notion of greed, ambition, violence or lust, they can each help their fellow community members to be of service to each other. Also, they are as environmental as anything. Indeed, I\u2019d estimate their collective carbon footprint to be little more than that of a dragonfly and certainly no more than a size one, in Clarks terms. When they pray, which they do often, they pray for justice, forgiveness, reconciliation and an end to all war. By putting God at the centre of their lives, they can co-exist peacefully with each other. Being of the left, though, my comrades and I would all be seeking to put ourselves at the centre of everything. Before long, life would be more chaotic than a bag of monkeys. The concept of a life characterised by fidelity to leftwing values being analogous with the rule of St Benedict may appear absurd, but I\u2019ve always felt that the life that many of us on the left feel called to must possess more than a degree of monasticism. Denying yourself many of the trappings of rampant capitalism while endlessly seeking to eradicate inequality, unfairness, deprivation and food banks is bloody hard work. In a world of easy access, fast cash and instant gratification, living a pure, leftwing existence can be a tough gig. Being sprung from a family of trade unionists and Labour supporters and activists, it might safely have been presumed that a life of waking starvelings from their slumbers and annexing the fruits of all our toil was always going to be just the ticket for me. Before long, you find yourself being tribal about everything and interpreting events according to your leftwing agenda. I can\u2019t even watch a European football match without taking sides and will seek any small ripple in the curtain of a club\u2019s history for a sign that they are the right sort. I used to watch the big Rome derby between Lazio and Roma before discovering, to my horror, that for years I\u2019d been inadvertently rooting for the fascist bad yins because of some loose talk in a pub. So I\u2019m always happy when Barcelona, Boca Juniors, St Pauli, Marseilles, Feyenoord and Hapoel Tel Aviv all win and cheer when such as Real Madrid, Zenit St Petersburg, Hamburg and Chelsea all get their fat, reactionary arses skelped. As you became increasingly politicised in your teens, you began to avoid certain newspapers and recoil from authors if they had been politically unedifying in their writing. This was a monochrome world, with Margaret Thatcher at one end of the spectrum and the miners at the other. Everything in between was simply a shade of one or the other and to espouse support for either would be a significantly defining aspect of your character. Lately though, I feel as if I\u2019ve let things slip. If I were to be arrested and charged with seditious activities or revolutionary truculence, would there be enough evidence to convict me? I fear not. I recently purchased a car that the motoring supplements might refer to as a high-performance marque. It\u2019s nowhere near new, you understand, and I\u2019m paying for it over years, but I love the colour and the fact that the engine emits a low growl. That it does only a few miles to the gallon isn\u2019t a problem either, as this chimes with my rather less than leftwing approach to the environment, which hovers just above the \u201ccouldn\u2019t give a fuck\u201d level. Though I will never refuse an invitation to a pub, in recent years I have developed an attachment to the sorts of wine bars favoured by persistent rightwing types who wear pinstripe suits for no apparent reason and refer to immigrants as fuzzy-wuzzies. Worse, I have developed a Madame Bollinger approach to drinking champagne: \u201cI drink it when I\u2019m happy and when I\u2019m sad. Sometimes, I drink it when I\u2019m alone. When I have company, I consider it obligatory. I trifle with it if I\u2019m not hungry and drink it when I am. Otherwise I never touch it \u2013 unless I\u2019m thirsty.\u201d The prospect of using public transport has lately become anathema to me, while first-class rail travel, once a company perk, has now become habitual. My most agreeable drinking companions are rightwingers whose views on the economy resemble Cuba\u2019s before the fall of Batista. Several years ago, I worked for the Daily Mail in Scotland in a specially made role that I now know amounted to \u201cToken Leftie\u201d; they were five of the happiest years of my career. I read Dear Mary in the Spectator for heaven\u2019s sake and once sent her one of my own behavioural dilemmas: how to avoid sharing train journeys with acquaintances you have just encountered on the platform without giving offence. The dilemma remains unsolved. The prospect, too, of an extended stay in an NHS hospital ward fills me with horror, though I know it must occur sooner or later. My only defence, I suppose, is that when the revolution comes, not only will there be a redistribution of land but also of champagne, fast cars and first-class travel. One of my favourite newspaper columnists is Chris Deerin, who writes for the Scottish Daily Mail and who stands on the other side of almost every political position I hold dear. Last week, for the sin of being an ardent unionist and rightwinger, he was the subject of a very personal attack by another Scottish journalist whose work I also admire. It was personal, vindictive and undeserved.

The British former prime minister has been appointed as chairman of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation a week after he announced that he would stand down as the envoy of the quartet on the Middle East. In an article for the Times, in which he sets out his plans for his new role, Blair says that he will campaign against the abuse of religions which has become a \u201cmask behind which those bent on death and destruction all too often hide\u201d. Blair says he will be campaigning to implement the recommendations of a report by the council which outlined legislative proposals to give greater power to judiciaries to prosecute hate speech, to lower barriers to what constitutes incitement to violence, and to make Holocaust denial illegal. Blair\u2019s proposals will revive memories of some of the laws he tried to introduce in Britain in the wake of the 9/11 attacks which prompted a debate on civil liberties. In the joint article (paywall) with Moshe Kantor, the president of the council and of the European Jewish Congress, Blair warns that Europe is entering a dangerous era as it is experiencing the slow rate of economic growth last seen on the eve of the first and second world wars.  Blair and Kantor write: \u201cThere have been three points in the past hundred years when annual GDP growth in Europe went below 1%: first in 1913, just before the first world war, second in 1938, just before the second world war and third, in 2014. Economic decline fuels instability and we know these concerns are being felt across the world.\u201d The pair cite work by the Kantor Institute at Tel Aviv University which found that 2014 was the worst year in the past decade for antisemitic incidents. It recorded 766 violent antisemitic acts compared with 554 in 2013.  They write: \u201cAs has been said before, but is worth repeating, prejudice and racism often starts with the softest targets, be it Jews or others, but it never ends there. Antisemitism is not a Jewish problem, but one infecting the whole of society and needs to be tackled for the sake of us all.\u201d The announcement of Blair\u2019s new role comes just a week after he announced that he would stand down as the special representative of the international quartet \u2013 the UN, US, EU and Russia \u2013 on the Middle East. Friends said Blair would continue to work towards peace in the Middle East amid criticism that he had failed to notch up any great achievements during his eight years as the envoy, a post he took up when he resigned as prime minister in 2007. Blair faced criticism during his time in the position for being overly sympathetic to Israel. The Palestinian Authority\u2019s former chief negotiator Nabil Shaath said Blair had \u201cachieved so very little because of his gross efforts to please the Israelis\u201d. The new appointment suggests that Blair, who has been criticised for his worldwide business interests, sees a need to promote tolerance and to confront extremism closer to home. BHe runs a faith foundation and challenges the idea in his Times article that faith fuels conflicts and says extremists abuse religion. Blair and Kantor write: \u201cIt is our firm belief that it is not religion or faith per se that causes or foments conflict. It is the abuse of religion, which then becomes a mask behind which those bent on death and destruction all too often hide. The real issues are far more complex and demand greater tolerance, understanding and legislative powers to achieve a solution.\u201d The council chaired by Blair believes it should promote education and ideas for legislation to confront extremists, leaving governments to deal with security and intelligence. Outlining a set of legislative proposals, they write: \u201cThe legislation includes giving greater power to judiciaries to prosecute hate speech, lowering the barriers to what constitutes incitement to violence, making Holocaust denial illegal, entrenching state funding for religious institutions into law, creating clearer definitions of what is racist and antisemitic, and securing educational programmes about tolerance in national legislation.\u201d Blair replaces the Polish former president Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski who served as the council\u2019s president between 2008-14. Board members include Blair\u2019s friend and political ally, the Spanish former prime minister Jose Mar\u00eda Aznar.", "publicationDate": "2015-06-04T00:59:10Z", "title": "Tony Blair appointed as head of European body fighting antisemitism", "sentences": ["Economic decline fuels instability and we know these concerns are being felt across the world.\u201d The pair cite work by the Kantor Institute at Tel Aviv University which found that 2014 was the worst year in the past decade for antisemitic incidents."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/04/tony-blair-appointed-head-of-european-body-antisemitism"}, {"tags": ["Iran", "Israel", "The Mossad", "Saudi Arabia", "Hezbollah", "US foreign policy", "The Iranian revolution", "Middle East and North Africa", "US news", "World news", "Islamic State", "Palestinian territories", "Iraq", "Kurds", "Saddam Hussein", "Turkey", "Hamas", "Syria", "Bashar al-Assad"], "article": "Thirty-three years after he left the Mossad, Israel\u2019s external intelligence arm, one memory sometimes wakes Yossi Alpher at four in the morning. What if Mossad had agreed to a request in early 1979 to kill Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then still in exile near Paris? \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to answer,\u201d Alpher said in an interview. \u201cBut there is a case to be made for the centrality of very charismatic leaders, and so for the consequences of their disappearance.\u201d Alpher relates the bare bones of incident in his recent book Periphery: Israel\u2019s Search for Middle East Allies. He was summoned by Mossad head Yitzhak Hofi and told that Mossad\u2019s Tehran representative, Eliezar Shafrir, had received a plea to assassinate Khomeini from Shapour Bakhtiar, appointed caretaker prime minister by the Shah to head off growing protests.  Another official present gave a negative reply: if Khomeini returned to Iran, he\u2019d be dealt with by the army and the Shah\u2019s security police, Savak. Alpher took a deep breath and suggested: \u201cWe simply don\u2019t know enough about what Khomeini stands for, and what his chance are, to justify the risk.\u201d Underestimating Khomeini was a failure not just of Mossad, but of the United States, Britain, and Savak itself. Knowing what he knows now, what advice would Alpher have offered? \u201cIf the conversation had been a few months later, I would have said it\u2019s worth the risk,\u201d Alpher said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying the head of Mossad would have decided differently had I offered a different opinion, but it\u2019s an incident that stays with me.\u201d   Related: Trying to remember Khomeini - 36 years after the revolution in Iran    In power, the revolutionaries quickly revealed their intentions. \u201cWe saw how they dealt with the rest of the opposition, all the executions, and we got an appreciation of their determination,\u201d said Alpher. \u201cThey made no bones of their plans to export revolution...Bakhtiar had apparently understood all this, but we didn\u2019t know Bakhtiar and we certainly didn\u2019t know the clergy. We just didn\u2019t get it.\u201d Alpher\u2019s riveting book - based on experience and a raft of interviews - surveys a \u201cPeriphery Doctrine\u201d developed in 1957-8 in the office of prime minister, David Ben Gurion, through which Israel found regional allies against the hostile \u201cArab core\u201d of states led by Egypt under Gamal Abdul Nasser. \u201cThe Mossad is under the prime minister, there is no anomaly whatsoever in the fact that Ben Gurion the prime minister assigned this task to the Mossad,\u201d Alpher explained. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t skirting the foreign ministry. These were secret relations and that\u2019s the job of the Mossad, which reports to the prime minister.\u201d Mossad operatives like Alpher courted both countries and ethnic or religious minorities within them. These variously included Ethiopia, Sudan, Morocco and Greece as well as Lebanese Maronites, Iraq\u2019s Kurds, and the south Sudanese. Mossad operatives were in northern Iraq training Kurdish fighters for the battles with Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq, until the Shah pulled the plug, ending support for the Kurdish rebellion with his 1975 Algiers agreement with Saddam. The \u201cflagship\u201d of Israel\u2019s search for Middle Eastern allies was Trident, an intelligence alliance with Turkey and Iran from the late 1950s. With Iran this lasted until the 1979 Revolution, and with Turkey until prime minister Recep Erdogan took a distance from Israel around 2009. \u201cThe head of our trade mission in Tehran was a highly experienced ambassador,\u201d notes Alpher. \u201cHe had access to the shah, but he didn\u2019t have [formal] rank, he was never invited to diplomatic cocktails, because the Iranians wanted a degree of deniability [about their relationship with Israel] vis-a-vis the Arabs.\u201d   Related: Declassified: Washington\u2019s hesitant plans for a military coup in pre-revolution Iran    Overall, the periphery doctrine waned in the 1980s with progress in peace talks with \u2018core\u2019 Arab states and apparently the Palestinians, before re-emerging after 2010 in a different guise as Israel confronted not hostile Arab states but various strains of militant Islamism. \u201cToday if you want to define a hostile ring, it\u2019s more amorphous: first and foremost non-state actors, Hezbollah, Hamas; and now potentially Daesh [Islamic State] and Jabhat al-Nusra [the Syrian militant group allied to al-Qaeda],\u201d Alpher said. \u201cThere is a fluid, revolutionary situation all around us that requires us to be on our toes, to look at the area as a mosaic and be ready to jump from one square to another to exploit out interests. Further afield we find Iran and Turkey \u2013 Iran definitely as a supporter of Hezbollah, while Turkey is more difficult to define as part of a hostile ring ... [as despite diplomatic strains its] trade [with Israel] is booming. \u201d So who does Israel regard as the bigger threat? The axis of Iran, Hezbollah and the Syrian regime of president Bashar al-Assad? Or the militant Sunni Muslim groups, including the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra? \u201cThey\u2019re both as bad,\u201d said Alpher. \u201cIn fact if you have to attach urgency to the task of dealing with one or the other, the more urgent task would be Hezbollah and Iran - Assad has almost become a passive player here. They continue to proclaim that we\u2019re their immediate enemy, whereas Daesh doesn\u2019t talk about us. Undoubtedly as Islamic fanatics they want to get rid of us but they have a long hit-list ahead of us.\u201d Facing the hostile ring, Israel has built links with Azerbaijan, Rumania, Greece and Cyprus, and has expanded trade with Russia, China and India. This reflects Israel\u2019s strength compared to the 1950s when the periphery doctrine evolved, said Alpher: \u201cWe have more options, we no longer have our backs to the wall.\u201d There is also the matter of Israel\u2019s relationship with the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, which are as \u2018secret\u2019 as the Shah\u2019s oil exports to Israel. \u201cBibi [Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister] got up in the UN a year and half ago and proclaimed it [Isreal\u2019s links with the Gulf Arab states],\u201d said Alpher. \u201cHe said it very openly. How much substance there is to this relationship is another question, but at least there\u2019s something to it. And yet it\u2019s ambivalent because they [the Gulf Arab states] have a hand in cresting these organisations [Isis and Jabhat al-Nusra], and they still do if you take a look at what\u2019s going on in Idlib [the province in north-west Syria mainly held by Jabhat al-Nusra] and so forth.\u201d There is also trade between Turkey and the Gulf Arab states going through Israel because it can no longer go safely through Iraq and Syria. \u201cTurkish lorries drive from Haifa [the Israel port] to the Beit She\u2019an valley into Jordan, to bring Turkish exports to the Arabian peninsular. The Turkish licence plates are on their trucks, they arrive by ferry and they keep going. It\u2019s been happening for several years and there is a huge commercial interest in some sort of status quo.\u201d Alpher is downbeat about Iran. His book has a chapter on what he calls \u201cperiphery nostalgia\u201d, the belief in Israel that better relations could return either by the authorities in Tehran changing or being removed. This has faded since the 1980s when Israel sent arms during the war with Iraq, although Alpher detects an \u201cequivalent\u201d today within the Obama administration. \u201cThey\u2019re saying do this nuclear deal with [president Hassan] Rouhani and [foreign minister Mohammad Javad] Zarif and it will empower them to moderate Iranian political life to the benefit of everyone, Iranians and non-Iranians,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they succeed. I don\u2019t object to having ten years without having to worry about an Iranian nuclear weapon, but what bothers me is that they tend to translate this into a tolerance on the ground for Iran\u2019s drive for regional hegemony, in Iraq, in Syria and perhaps in Yemen.\u201d Perhaps it could all have been different. Shafrir, Mossad\u2019s former man in Tehran, and Alpher live today near each other in Tel Aviv. \u201cWe meet at the swimming pool,\u201d said Alpher. \u201cAnd, yes, we chat.\u201d This article was amended on 6 June 2015 to reflect that Shafrir was not the official who replied to Bakhtiar\u2019s request.

Others at the Under-21 finals have looked like future stars but have gone on to be nothing of the sort \u2013 Middlesbrough fans might have rather mixed views of Morata\u2019s 2002 equivalent, Massimo Maccarone. But what has happened to England\u2019s Next Big Things over the years? 2000   Related: European Under-21 Championship: the teams and players to look out for    England were the Uefa Under-21 champions in 1982 and 1984 (and reached four other semi-finals between 1978 and 1988) in the days when the tournament was still a knockout affair but between 1990 and 1998 they failed to qualify for the final stages. In 2000 the tournament was revamped into a championship with two groups for the first time and Howard Wilkinson\u2019s in-form side were there. They lost to Italy in their opening game (only their third defeat in four years) but then hammered Turkey 6-0 to give themselves a chance of progressing, with the winners of the four-team groups progressing straight to the final rather than going through any knockout rounds. But a disappointing defeat against the hosts, Slovakia, meant they went home. In defence this was something of a vintage group \u2013 Ledley King, Jamie Carragher, Danny Mills and Luke Young went on to full England honours, Paul Robinson was Nicky Weaver\u2019s deputy in goal and the side was captained by a young West Ham midfielder by the name of Frank Lampard. Up front, though, there were fewer success stories with Carl Cort, Matt Jansen, Francis Jeffers and Middlesbrough\u2019s Andy Campbell, for a variety of reasons, struggling to build on early promise. With a Spain side featuring Xavi and Carles Puyol missing out on top spot in their group to the Czech Republic, the tournament was won by Italy thanks to two goals in the final from the player of the tournament \u2013 a certain Andrea Pirlo. 2002 Wilkinson\u2019s successor, David Platt, was without six eligible players who were in Sven-Goran Eriksson\u2019s senior squad for the World Cup (Ashley Cole, Michael Owen, Wes Brown, Wayne Bridge, Owen Hargreaves and Joe Cole) and three others \u2013 Manchester City\u2019s Shaun Wright-Phillips and the Liverpool duo of Stephen Wright and Chris Kirkland \u2013 were injured. But the coach was confident: \u201cI think this is the best squad ever to play for England\u2019s Under-21s and we can go on and win the tournament. Getting to the semi-final is irrelevant. Getting to the final is irrelevant. You\u2019ve got to win it, and I\u2019m happy to put my head on the line and say we will.\u201d They didn\u2019t. Victory over their Swiss hosts in their opening game \u2013 with goals from the future England front two Jermain Defoe and Peter Crouch \u2013 raised hopes but defeats against Italy (thanks to two goals from Maccarone, who was linked to Chelsea at the time) and Portugal meant they finished bottom of the group. The tournament was won by the Czech Republic, who beat France in the final on penalties with Petr Cech the hero and Jean-Alain Boumsong the third and final French player to miss from the spot. Despite the disappointment, 12 of the England squad went on to play for the senior side \u2013 more than in any other English Euro Under-21 squad. 2007 Platt lost his job after missing out on the 2004 tournament but his replacement, Peter Taylor, who coupled the role with his job as the manager of Crystal Palace, couldn\u2019t get the side to the 2006 edition either. Stuart Pearce took charge in February 2007 and took them into their first tournament for five years. Again there were key absences \u2013 Micah Richards and Theo Walcott were injured, Gabriel Agbonlahor was left out after missing a pre-tournament training camp and David Bentley withdrew on the eve of the tournament citing fatigue \u2013 but the squad was still talented, with Leighton Baines, Gary Cahill, Ashley Young, Joe Hart and James Milner featuring. They progressed from the group stages for the first time and were 1-0 up against the hosts, Holland, going into the final few minutes of the semi-final. But Maceo Rigters equalised and the team lost an incredible penalty shootout 13-12. Nigel Reo-Coker and Matt Derbyshire had spot-kicks to win it in sudden death and both goalkeepers scored their efforts, before Anton Ferdinand missed the decisive 16th penalty. There were high hopes for the Holland side that won the tournament but the impact of their class of 2007 has been limited, with Tim Krul and Ron Vlaar the only alumni to feature in the country\u2019s run to the World Cup semi-finals last year. The player of the 2007 tournament, Royston Drenthe, joined Kayseri Erciyesspor from Reading this January. In contrast, 21 of the 23-man Belgium squad who went out in the group stages have since won full senior caps. 2009 The recent high-water mark of England\u2019s Under-21 campaigns. A team containing nine future full internationals \u2013 Hart, Milner, Agbonlahor, Adam Johnson, Walcott, Jack Rodwell, Richards, Kieran Gibbs, Fraizer Campbell \u2013 went through the group stage unbeaten after victories over Finland and Spain and a draw against Germany, then threw away a 3-0 lead against the hosts, Sweden, in the semi-final before triumphing on penalties. The final, though, was a huge letdown. Germany ran out 4-0 winners but history has been kind on England\u2019s 2009 vintage. Of the Germany XI, Manuel Neuer, Benedikt H\u00f6wedes, Mats Hummels, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng and Mesut \u00d6zil started in the World Cup final last year and Sami Khedira would have done but for injury in the warm-up in the Maracan\u00e3. That, by anyone\u2019s standard, is the backbone of a World Cup-winning team. Almost all of the 23-man England squad have gone on to enjoy careers in the Premier League, although Andrew Driver is currently without a club having been released by Aberdeen. Sweden\u2019s Marcus Berg was named player of the tournament after top-scoring with seven goals in four matches. 2011   Related: England Under-21s hoping to make history at the European Championships | John Ashdown    This was a return to the group stage exit. With Pearce still in charge in Denmark and the buildup dominated by a row between the manager and Arsenal over Jack Wilshere\u2019s participation (in the end the midfielder pulled out a month before the tournament), England drew with the exceptionally talented Spain side in their opening game, were held 0-0 by Ukraine and were 1-0 up going into the 89th minute of a winner-takes-all affair against the Czech Republic. Two Czech goals at the death then dumped them out. It was a particularly young England squad and one that has produced plenty of graduates for the senior side. Ryan Bertrand, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Jordan Henderson, Danny Welbeck, Daniel Sturridge, Gibbs, Kyle Walker, Tom Cleverley and Jack Rodwell played in the finals and have won senior caps. The three goalkeepers \u2013 Frank Fielding, Alex McCarthy and Jason Steele \u2013 have at times struggled to find first-team football but have time on their side. The victorious Spain team was something of a vintage one \u2013 David de Gea, Javi Mart\u00ednez, Juan Mata, Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara, and Ander Herrera featured, with Mata named player of the tournament. 2013 A disaster. Stuart Pearce\u2019s side were deprived of several of their best players because of injury and a spate of withdrawals \u2013 Pearce claimed to be without 17 players for their opening game \u2013 but results were still a huge disappointment. Having lost narrowly 1-0 to Italy in their opening game in Tel Aviv, they were then comprehensively beaten by Norway 3-1 \u2013 a defeat that knocked them out of the tournament \u2013 and ended up a demoralised bunch losing to the hosts Israel (who had been beaten 4-0 by Italy). Nathan Redmond \u2013 part of that squad and back for a second attempt this year \u2013 described the tournament as \u201calmost embarrassing\u201d last week and along with fellow veterans of 2013, Jack Butland and Nathaniel Chalobah, has been keen to help spread the lessons learned in that debacle to his current team-mates. Things might have been different for Pearce had Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Rodwell, Jones and Welbeck been available to him, but he lost his job as a result. One player from the squad \u2013 Henderson \u2013 has gone on to establish himself as a regular in Roy Hodgson\u2019s senior side, though Nathaniel Clyne is beginning to push for a place, and of the 23, 12 played Championship football in 2014-15. Spain, on the other hand, again thrived, with De Gea and Alc\u00e2ntara (who scored a hat-trick against Italy in the final) being joined by Alberto Moreno, I\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez, Dani Carvajal, Marc Bartra, Mart\u00edn Montoya, Asier Illarramendi, Isco, Koke, Iker Muniain and Morata.

Proud to be flying the rainbow flag for Pride over the Cabinet Office today pic.twitter.com/Hno8UMjE4M&mdash; Matt Hancock (@MattHancockMP) June 22, 2015    Hancock, the MP for West Suffolk, said in a statement that civil servants across the country would be joining in the celebrations this week and that \u201cflying the flag shows that pride in our LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] community is shared at the most senior levels of Whitehall\u201d. The announcement comes a week after Hammond was widely criticised for refusing to fly the flag over the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and forbidding British embassies abroad from flying the flag, saying it was a \u201clongstanding policy\u201d to fly only the union jack, national flags and the flags of overseas territories. \u201cThe union flag always takes priority and is flown from the FCO\u2019s main flag pole at all times,\u201d said a spokesperson for the FCO. \u201cIt is never substituted for another flag.\u201d The FCO said on Monday that the Cabinet Office\u2019s decision would not affect their own. Hammond\u2019s position was a departure from that of the former foreign secretary William Hague, who agreed to the fly the flag during last year\u2019s gay pride celebrations \u2013 which take place every year to campaign for the freedoms of LGBT people.  British embassies in Paris, Oslo, Tel Aviv and Santiago are among those to have previously flown the rainbow flag to mark their local gay pride celebrations. Hammond is one of four cabinet ministers not to have voted in favour of equal marriage, arguing that there was no demand for it and that there was \u201ca real sense of anger among many people who are married that any government thinks it has the ability to change the definition of an institution like marriage\u201d. Oliver Letwin, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said of the Cabinet Office\u2019s decision: \u201cWe are delighted to join with the LGBT community in celebrating Pride this weekend, and will be flying our flag at the heart of Whitehall. We have committed to governing one nation, bringing people together and flying the flag this week shows our pride in and solidarity with the LGBT community.\u201d The rainbow flag symbolises lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride. Its red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet horizontal stripes represent the diversity of the LGBT community. Thousands of people are expected to congregate in central London on Saturday for the capital\u2019s annual gay rights parade, Pride in London. Hancock\u2019s announcement on Twitter prompted a swift reaction from a number of Labour figures. Shadow culture secretary Chris Bryant responded by asking why Hammond had forbidden embassies from raising the flag. Wes Streeting, the new MP for Ilford North and a rising star in the Labour party, said: \u201cIt would be peculiar enough for different departments to take a different approach to flying a rainbow flag, but what\u2019s bizarre about this decision is that it reverses the position adopted by William Hague.\u201d  Streeting, who used to be head of education at Stonewall, a leading gay rights organisation, said the inconsistency of approach sent \u201ca worrying message to those who worried that a majority Tory government would turn the clock back on equality\u201d. A Stonewall spokesperson welcomed the Cabinet Office\u2019s decision to show \u201cits support for Pride in London and the LGBT community\u201d. \u201cFlying the rainbow flag is really important for people to see \u2013 especially young people,\u201d they said. \u201cMore than 75,000 young LGBT people will be bullied this year just for being who they are, so having such prominent displays of support for the LGBT community is important and very welcome.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-06-22T18:01:57Z", "title": "Cabinet Office and FCO divided over flying rainbow flag", "sentences": ["British embassies in Paris, Oslo, Tel Aviv and Santiago are among those to have previously flown the rainbow flag to mark their local gay pride celebrations."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/22/cabinet-office-fco-flag-lgbt-pride-london"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Barack Obama", "World news", "US news", "Middle East and North Africa", "US foreign policy"], "article": "It\u2019s a peculiar feature of American relations with Israel that more than a few senior diplomats posted from Jerusalem to Washington were once US citizens. The present Israeli ambassador, Ron Dermer, was born in Miami Beach and carried an American passport until he renounced it in 2005 in order to serve as the Jewish state\u2019s economic envoy in DC. When Dermer lived in the US, before moving to Israel two decades ago, he was a Republican party operative. There is a view in the White House that he remains one as ambassador after Dermer colluded with Republican leaders to embarrass Barack Obama, most notably by engineering an extraordinary foreign intervention in American politics with the Israeli prime minister\u2019s controversial speech to Congress to denounce the president\u2019s Iran policy. Dermer\u2019s predecessor as envoy in Washington, Michael Oren, has now created his own diplomatic uproar with a remarkable attack on Obama that appears at least partly rooted in his disillusionment with the president as leader of the land of Oren\u2019s birth.   Related: Barack Obama fights back against Israeli critics of Iran nuclear deal    Oren, a New Yorker and US citizen until 2009 when he became ambassador, has stirred outrage by suggesting that the president is not a loyal American. He has also drawn accusations of \u201cpsychobabble\u201d for arguing that Obama\u2019s alleged hostility to Israel is because abandonment by his Muslim father has driven a craving to be accepted by his father\u2019s \u201cco-religionists\u201d. In extracts from a book to be published on Tuesday, Ally: My Journey Across the American-Israeli Divide, Oren accuses the president of policies that \u201cimperilled Israel\u201d not least over Iran. He told an audience in New York on Sunday that the book is intended to mobilise American opinion ahead of the deadline next week for an \u201cemphatically bad\u201d US nuclear deal with Iran reached over the objections of Israel. Oren wrote in the book of how disturbed he was that Israel\u2019s \u201cclosest ally had entreated with our deadliest enemy on an existential issue without so much as informing us\u201d. Oren, who is now a member of Israel\u2019s parliament, writes that Obama is soft on terrorism, a claim open to challenge from those on the end of US drone attacks. He also paints the president\u2019s advisers as infected with \u201cneo-Marxist ideas\u201d from studies at American universities. Oren, who was ambassador to the US until 2013, has promoted the book with a blitz of opinion pieces and interviews, including one in the Wall Street Journal under the headline, How Obama Abandoned Israel. He describes relations between the US and Israel as \u201cin tatters\u201d in part after the president dared to demand Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu halt the inexorable expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories which has done so much to undermine the prospects of peace and a Palestinian state. Tellingly, Oren says in an interview about the book with the Times of Israel that the creation of a Palestinian state is \u201cunrealistic\u201d but that Israel should keep up the diplomatic pretence of supporting one. That is widely considered to be the true position of Netanyahu who promised voters before this year\u2019s Israeli election that he would not permit the creation of a Palestinian state but, under US criticism, claimed to have altered his position after he was re-elected. Oren writes that he has tried to understand why the president acts as he does and came to the conclusion that it is because Obama does not believe in American exceptionalism. That leads the former Israeli ambassador to perhaps his most incendiary charge, that the president is somehow disloyal to the US. \u201cMore alarming for me still were Obama\u2019s attitudes towards America. Vainly, I scoured Dreams from My Father (Obama\u2019s first book) for some expression of reverence, even respect, for the country its author would someday lead. Instead, the book criticizes Americans for their capitalism and consumer culture, for despoiling their environment and maintaining antiquated power structures. Traveling abroad, they exhibited \u2018ignorance and arrogance\u2019\u2013 the very shortcomings the president\u2019s critics assigned to him,\u201d writes Oren, according to an excerpt released to the rightwing Breitbart.     President Barack Obama\u2019s relationship with the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has been frosty. Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images    Oren drew more fire over an article in Foreign Policy on Friday which said that Obama has been hard on Israel and more sympathetic to the Arab world in part because his father and stepfather were Muslim. \u201cI could imagine how a child raised by a Christian mother might see himself as a natural bridge between her two Muslim husbands. I could also speculate how that child\u2019s abandonment by those men could lead him, many years later, to seek acceptance by their co-religionists,\u201d he wrote. Yair Lapid, former finance minister and leader of the Yesh Atid party, told Israel radio that Oren\u2019s claim of Muslim influence on the US president was \u201cutter nonsense\u201d and \u201cpseudo-psychological analysis not based on anything\u201d. The head of the strongly pro-Israel Anti Defamation League, Abe Foxman, accused Oren of veering \u201cinto the realm of conspiracy theories\u201d. \u201cWith an element of amateur psychoanalysis he links US policies in the Middle East to the president\u2019s personal history of having a Muslim father. Then, taking it a step further by suggesting this \u201cworldview\u201d of Muslims and Islam has driven the president to embrace the Muslim world at the expense of both Israel and US national security interests. This results in borderline stereotyping and insensitivity,\u201d said Foxman. Oren offers an insight into how deep the tensions between Obama and Netanyahu were, and also how powerless the White House was to influence the Israeli leader. The former ambassador reveals an incident in which the then US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, threatened to withdraw Washington\u2019s unswerving support for Israel in the security council unless Netanyahu stopped the relentless construction of Jewish settlements which is a major factor in preventing a peace agreement. \u201cIf you don\u2019t appreciate the fact that we defend you night and day, tell us,\u201d admonished Rice. The Israeli government has sought to distance itself from Oren even though there is little doubt that his book reflects the betrayal some of its leaders feel toward Obama. It has said that the former ambassador largely played a \u201cpublic diplomacy\u201d role in Washington and was out of the loop on many of the more important negotiations with the US. The deputy foreign minister, Tzipi Hotovely, said that Oren only represents himself, not the government. \u201cThe United States is a true friend of Israel and every attempt to harm the relationship between the two countries by resorting to personal attacks will not succeed,\u201d she told the Israeli website Walla News. Haaretz reported that the US ambassador in Tel Aviv, Dan Shapiro, took him to task over the book and subsequent articles. The newspaper said Shapiro appealed to Netanyahu to issue a public statement repudiating Oren\u2019s claims but that the Israeli prime minister refused.  Oren defended the book to the Times of Israel as \u201ca cri de coeur \u2026 for an alliance that should be in a much better place than it is\u201d. Perhaps hoping to avoid giving more publicity to Oren\u2019s book, the White House has so far declined to comment.", "publicationDate": "2015-06-22T20:34:09Z", "title": "Former ambassador's bizarre attack on Obama lays bare strains in US-Israeli ties", "sentences": ["Haaretz reported that the US ambassador in Tel Aviv, Dan Shapiro, took him to task over the book and subsequent articles."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/22/former-ambassador-book-obama-us-israeli-relationship"}, {"tags": ["Opera", "Classical music", "Music", "Books", "Culture", "Placido Domingo"], "article": "It\u2019s not just The X Factor and The Voice: singing competitions have been around for centuries, from the medieval contest in Wartburg in 1207 that inspired Wagner\u2019s opera Tannh\u00e4user, to the guild of the Mastersingers a few centuries later that prompted another Wagner opera, Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. And just as the populist pageants of song fronted by Simon Cowell or Tom Jones thrive on the lyrics of love and the creation of a sense of community through a shared repertoire, so the hero of Meistersinger, Walther von Stolzing, is an emblem of a society that recognises itself through the prize song of a lovelorn young tenor. At the end of the opera, Walther is at last admitted to the mythical guild of the Mastersingers, a victory that Hans Sachs, the cobbler-philosopher-mastersinger at the centre of the story, hymns as heralding the future of art, culture and German values. Which, to be fair, is rather more than you can say for the latest winner of Pop Goes the Voice Factor on Ice, which offers instead as its prize a turn on the hamster-wheel of fame, infamy and a possible slot on I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 when your career has hit the rocks for the umpteenth time. So if you\u2019re not a wannabe pop minstrel in search of a few minutes of micro-celebrity \u2013 or for that matter, a medieval troubadour seeking love and social acceptance \u2013 and instead you\u2019re a serious young opera singer with intentions to pursue a credible career, you need a different kind of singing competition. There is the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World, which takes place every two years and has just been won by the Belarusian coloratura soprano Nadine Koutcher, and every four years, there is the Tchaikovsky competition, now underway in Moscow and St Petersburg. But if you\u2019re looking for an annual competition that is not just going to give you a prizewinning evening of garlands and glitz but generates successful careers on stage, then you really want to be part of Pl\u00e1cido Domingo\u2019s Operalia.     Domingo presents Aida Garifullina with 1st prize at the 2013 Operalia at the Teatro Filarmonico in Verona. Photograph: FotoENNEVI    Since 1993, Domingo has cast himself as opera\u2019s benevolent Svengali, hosting a competition that goes around the world to a different city each year, and which promises an experience that allows for more than the preparation of a mere handful of prize songs. Domingo doesn\u2019t judge the 40 singers who are chosen from the hundreds who apply every year, but he is the driving force behind the competition, conducting the final gala for the chosen few, coaching, tutoring and mentoring them, and making sure that their performances are seen and heard by the great and good of the operatic world. As a result, there is a direct route from being seen in Operalia to being booked by the world\u2019s best opera houses. Next month Operalia comes to Covent Garden, visiting London for the first time. That means a lot to Domingo. \u201cThe Royal Opera House is one of my favourite theatres,\u201d he told me. \u201cI have been singing there for so many continuous seasons\u201d \u2013 he made his debut in 1971 in Puccini\u2019s Tosca \u2013 \u201cthat to me it\u2019s a great honour and pleasure to have the competition there.\u201d Looking at the list of previous winners of the top prizes tells you all you need to know about Domingo and Operalia\u2019s ability to find the finest talent: arguably the world\u2019s finest Wagnerian soprano, Nina Stemme, was a winner in the first competition in 1993, and tenor Jos\u00e9 Cura was a star the following year; the world\u2019s mezzo of the moment Joyce DiDonato owes her career to her success at Operalia in 1998, despite coming second that year to another of today\u2019s biggest draws, the baritone Erwin Schrott. The Mexican tenor Rolando Villaz\u00f3n won the audience prize in 1999, and Latvian soprano Maija Kovalevska came out on top in 2006; more recently, revealing some competition crossover with Cardiff, the Mongolian baritone Amartuvshin Enkhbat shared the top prize at Operalia 2012 and he has just won the audience prize in Wales. The soprano Angel Blue, one of the BBC\u2019s presenters this year, was an Operalia winner in 2009. At 74, Domingo is still an invaluable presence on stage (it was only illness in his family that prevented him from singing the baritone role of Germont in Covent Garden\u2019s production of Verdi\u2019s La Traviata earlier this year) and on the conductor\u2019s podium (he is general manager of the Los Angeles Opera and was in charge of Washington National Opera from 2003-11). You might think that he has taken on more than enough work in his lifetime \u2013 without becoming a singing-competition impresario. Yet Domingo has always wanted to nurture young talent. \u201cWhen I was very young we moved from Mexico to the opera company of Israel in Tel Aviv,\u201d says Domingo, who was 21 and had just married his second wife, the soprano Marta Ornelas. \u201cIt was not a well-known place in the opera world, but we worked so much. It was as if we were in a school with the public watching us.\u201d That immersion in the professional world of opera, of learning the repertoire by doing it \u2013 Domingo sang 19 performances a month in Israel \u2013 was crucial to his early development. \u201cI thought, even back then, how much I would like to help young singers to have a similar chance, and now, as well as the competition, we have three groups of young singers who we are helping in Washington, Los Angeles and Valencia. It\u2019s important to me to pass something on to the younger generations, to transfer what I have learned from all my experiences in my long career.\u201d Domingo is proud of the \u201cmany, many great names\u201d who have come through the ranks of Operalia over time, but he insists that it is about more than producing prizewinners. \u201cFor me, the great moments are working with them \u2013 all of them. There are so many extraordinary singers who don\u2019t make the final, and many of them go on to have great careers. I treasure individual moments from the competitions, of course, but it\u2019s just as amazing to see them mature afterwards. That makes me tremendously happy.\u201d I ask how the latest generation of young singers compares to those of past eras. \u201cI think they come better prepared now. It\u2019s not necessarily about the quality of individual artists \u2013 there are great singers in every generation, so I don\u2019t mean they are better than earlier singers. But musically, and in terms of stagecraft, they prepare themselves much better today. Perhaps it\u2019s because they face so much competition now.\u201d     The \u2018Operalia hymn\u2019 is sung by the finalists each year. Photograph: Wang Xiaojing    It remains to be seen what kind of future awaits the singers who triumph in London\u2019s Operalia, and how they will be equipped for the challenges of today\u2019s operatic world \u2013 not just artistically, but financially, at a time when opera houses around the world are desperately seeking new audiences as well as new sources of cash. Domingo says that the future of opera in the US looks perilous, even for larger opera houses such as Los Angeles, owing to their dependence on private money, but he is confident that smaller ones such as San Diego, which was teetering on the brink of collapse last year, will recover. And while he is a fan of opera companies streaming their shows to cinemas and big screens \u2013 \u201cwe were doing things in the plaza in Covent Garden 20 years ago, and it was fabulous\u201d \u2013 he says there is no substitute for the live experience of opera in the flesh and stage-blood of a theatre. Which is where Domingo will be during Operalia week, when he conducts the last-ever performance of John Copley\u2019s beloved 41-year-old staging of Puccini\u2019s La Boh\u00e8me, a \u201cbeautiful production\u201d that Domingo knows inside-out, having sung Rodolfo in its first run, in 1974. It\u2019s a sign of how his career continues to be all-encompassing. The obvious prize for the Operalia winners is immediate recognition and, hopefully, some bookings from the big opera houses. Yet all 40 hopefuls will also have won the opportunity to learn from Domingo himself. For all the fame that Operalia might bring, that could prove to be the most durable prize that any young opera singer could hope for.  Operalia is at the Royal Opera House, London WC2E, from 13-19 July. Box office 020-7304 4000.

On 4 July, , the young French-Israeli conductor Gad Kadosh makes\u00a0his UK opera debut with the Longborough festival production of Rigoletto. But when Kadosh was a piano student at an arts high school in Tel Aviv in the early 2000s, he had no idea how to develop his interest in conducting. \u201cSo I just started asking people who were conducting us in orchestras or choirs,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI\u2019d ask, \u2018How do you do that?\u2019 How do you become a conductor?\u2019 It sounds like a stupid question, but it\u00a0is not wrong. I even asked Daniel Barenboim when he visited us. I was about 16 or 17 and was terrified. But I thought I was quite advanced in having this ambition and\u00a0so wondered at what age he had started conducting. He said \u2018I was nine\u2019. So maybe I wasn\u2019t so advanced after all.\u201d The route Kadosh eventually found to the podium was via the German kapellmeister system, in which young\u00a0musicians train as assistant conductors in concerts, opera, theatre and dance in one of Germany\u2019s numerous musical theatres, moving from small to larger venues as their career progresses, and entering competitions. But his invitation to Longborough, and to conduct the London Philharmonic Orchestra later\u00a0this year, came after he had distinguished himself in a Bernard Haitink masterclass at the 2012 Lucerne festival. Kadosh conducted for Haitink the whole of Beethoven\u2019s Eroica Symphony as well as pieces by Schumann, Ravel and Bruckner. \u201cIt was a wonderful experience. Haitink understood that each conductor is different and so it was never a question of him just saying do this or that. One time he worked with me on just the left\u00a0hand, and far from making me feel\u00a0insecure it showed me what I was\u00a0able\u00a0to do.\u201d Haitink also noticed that\u00a0Kadosh had a tendency towards adopting slower tempi. \u201cWhich is OK, but can be dangerous. He didn\u2019t make me do anything new, but he did encourage me to always question whether I was going down a dangerous route. You don\u2019t want to have a tempo that you are the only one who enjoys. That\u2019s not the idea at all.\u201d     \u2018He encouraged me to always question whether I was going down a dangerous route\u2019 \u2026 Kadosh takes tips from Haitink    Kadosh was born in Tel Aviv in 1984, and although there were music lovers in his family, he was the first to take it seriously as a career. He studied piano at a prestigious arts high school, but even at the age of 18 was still thinking of becoming a scientist or a pilot \u2013 \u201cI still dream of flying\u201d. The crunch came when he was about to be conscripted into the military and realised that if he stopped music for any length of time he would not be able to catch up. So he applied for, and won, a rare place on an Education Corps music programme; in parallel with his military service, he studied piano at the University of Tel Aviv, which also offered formal conducting courses. After national service, Kadosh initially thought he would study in the\u00a0US, but eventually plumped for Germany and moved to Berlin. While his Israeli tuition encouraged him to follow his instincts, in Germany it was\u00a0\u201cmade clear this was not enough. There are specific things you have to know if you are intending to pull an orchestra together. And the learning process continues well into a professional career.\u201d On entering the kapellmeister system, following in the footsteps of\u00a0many of the great musicians from history, Kadosh found himself working on a daily basis with experienced musicians and singers as well as with\u00a0stage directors and other theatre professionals. \u201cI started out as a pianist playing for stage rehearsals, and then worked with singers. You learn a lot. If you are playing a piece for the first time, but they are singing it for the 120th time, then you can save a lot of time by\u00a0listening to what they say and do.\u201d A\u00a0junior conductor working as a pianist for a production may be given one performance to conduct. \u201cAnd then you just jump in with the orchestra without rehearsal and they play. Although it sounds stupid now, this was the first time I had really worked in a pit, and, for the first hour or so, I\u00a0couldn\u2019t get over how dark it was. There are bound to be things that don\u2019t work, but you learn so much about what conducting is. You can\u2019t stop and say \u2018This isn\u2019t my tempo\u2019, as there is an audience there. If you haven\u2019t made yourself clear to the orchestra it\u2019s your fault and you have to carry on.\u201d Kadosh\u2019s early productions were operettas such as Oscar Straus\u2019s Ein Walzertraum \u2013 \u201cthey are actually very\u00a0tricky to do, technically as well as\u00a0musically\u201d \u2013 and he has gone on to\u00a0conduct a varied repertoire from Mozart and Donizetti to Schoenberg and Mark-Anthony Turnage. He is currently second kapellmeister in Heidelberg, where he is working on some of his own productions as well as\u00a0coaching singers. Early in his career he was told conducting is \u201ca job that is basically about solving problems. It is a\u00a0very simplistic way of putting it, but as I gain more experience I see that this is often the case. A score is a book full of musical questions. As much as the composer tries to give us all the answers, there are always questions left open. What\u2019s really interesting is that different people can find different solutions.\u201d But how does he deal with the fact that so many great conductors of the past have already answered these questions? \u201cIt can be daunting. But if you listen to any two recordings by great conductors you quickly learn that\u00a0they have come up with different answers and that it won\u2019t work just to copy a version if you don\u2019t understand why they have made those decisions. You\u2019re working in a different context. I\u2019m not alone when I search for solutions: I have to convince a whole orchestra in front of me. Every one of them has an expert understanding of their instrument, far greater than mine will ever be, and so if my answers don\u2019t fit with them it is pointless to just try to\u00a0impose my view.\u201d His immediate career plan is to work his way up within the German system. \u201cThe main point is to gain experience of all aspects of a conductor\u2019s life and to build repertoire.

I\u2019ve been privileged to witness an extraordinary expansion in our bilateral cooperation, and I\u2019ve also had many conversations about Israel and the prospects for peace. One troubling and recurrent theme has been that the main thing Britain can do to promote peace in the Middle East is to exert pressure on Israel. On hearing this, I am reminded of the fable of the north wind and the sun. In their competition, the north wind fails to blow the cloak off a passing traveller no matter how hard it blows; yet the sun succeeds, by warming the traveller\u2019s surroundings, and encouraging him to take off the cloak himself. Recent years have yielded no shortage of wind. Resolutions and boycott campaigns have all attempted to force Israel\u2019s hand. Yet the response by Israel\u2019s people has been emphatic: twice re-electing the government these efforts have sought to censure.   Related: Blaming Israel for Gaza\u2019s reconstruction delays is wilful ignorance | Daniel Taub    Standard-bearers for the pressure camp routinely claim that a conciliatory approach only reinforces the status quo. But in fact, the Israeli people\u2019s boldest steps towards peace have taken place when the international community has been most receptive to their concerns. Israel\u2019s historic peace treaty with Egypt was made possible by US guarantees on security and continued oil supply. Israel\u2019s withdrawal from southern Lebanon was premised on the UN\u2019s commitment to deploy peacekeeping forces in the area and prevent terrorist aggression against Israel by Hezbollah. Its disengagement from Gaza followed international assurances that Hamas and other terror groups would be prevented from gaining access to arms via the Sinai. If progress towards peace has stalled, it is not because the Israeli people have lost the will to make bold decisions. Polls consistently show a majority want a lasting peace with the Palestinians. Yet those same polls show Israelis are also sceptical about the possibility of realising such a peace. In part this scepticism relates to the ability of the international community to live up to its assurances. UN peacekeepers have not prevented the rearming of Hezbollah and its attacks on northern Israel. Nor has the international community been able to stop the smuggling of weapons to Hamas in Gaza, or, as Israeli intelligence services recently disclosed, its support for Islamic State terrorists in Sinai. Even with regard to reconstruction in Gaza, while Israel has transferred over a million tons of building supplies to date, reconstruction remains hindered by the failure of international donors to meet their aid pledges, and by the internal Palestinian Fatah-Hamas power struggle.    Away from our region, debate on the peace process continues as if Israelis and Palestinians exist in a vacuum    As much as Israelis want peace, when they look at the fate of international assurances in Gaza, Lebanon and elsewhere in the region, they cannot help but ask what is to stop an evacuated West Bank turning into yet another launch pad for attacks against Israel, but this time only miles from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. In a region undergoing such tectonic changes, with ungoverned spaces increasingly dominated by brutal jihadist extremists and Iranian proxies, Israelis are perplexed that the song sung by international voices in relation to their corner of the region remains the same. Israelis have come to recognise that new regional realities must mean new thinking, including embracing opportunities to cooperate with states with which we have never worked before. Yet away from our region, debate on the peace process continues as if Israelis and Palestinians exist in a vacuum.

With few Israeli analysts demonstrating any confidence that Israel could muster the two-thirds support in Congress needed to overcome a presidential veto, a chorus of voices warned against persisting with a strategy they fear has left Israel increasingly marginalised. Netanyahu\u2019s approach has already been described as \u201ccoarse\u201d by the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and \u201cway over the top\u201d by John Kerry, the US secretary of state. Barack Obama is bullishly confident that opponents in Congress will not be able to overturn the deal.           The Israeli prime minister on Tuesday condemned the Iran nuclear deal as a \u2018stunning historic mistake\u2019    On Tuesday, the British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, also weighed in, saying that Israel did not want a deal with Iran but instead preferred a permanent standoff. \u201cThe question you have to ask yourself is what kind of a deal would have been welcomed in Tel Aviv. The answer of course is that Israel doesn\u2019t want any deal with Iran,\u201d Hammond said in response to an opposition legislator, who had objected to the agreement and cited dismay in Tel Aviv. \u201cIsrael wants a permanent state of standoff and I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s in the interests of the region. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s in our interest,\u201d Hammond said.  Pessimistic number-crunching by Israeli analysts echoes Obama\u2019s view. They point out that Congressional opponents of the deal would require 44 out of 188 Democrats in the House of Representatives to oppose the president, in the midst of a presidential election cycle and following the endorsement of the deal by Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic candidate.   Related: Netanyahu denounces Iran nuclear deal but faces criticism from within Israel    The day after the Vienna deal, Netanyahu\u2019s reaction to the Iran talks dominated the Israeli media as much as the deal itself, with even usually sympathetic rightwing commentators cautioning against continuing a battle with the Obama White House they believe the Israeli prime minister cannot win. The conclusion of the deal \u2013 against Israel\u2019s bitter complaints \u2013 continued to be presented by some political opponents as a historic failure on Netanyahu\u2019s part. Returning to the attack in the aftermath of the deal, Yair Lapid, leader of the liberal centrist Yesh Atid party, compared the deal to the aftermath of the 1973 war \u2013 an event that shocked Israel\u2019s confidence for a generation. \u201cToday we are witnessing the greatest failure in foreign policy of any Israeli prime minister since the state\u2019s establishment. Netanyahu is not Churchill of pre-world war two,\u201d railed Lapid, a former minister in Netanyahu\u2019s last government.  \u201cHe is Golda [Meir] after the Yom Kippur War \u2026 As of yesterday, the world learned that the United States is no longer willing to listen to the prime minister of Israel. He left Israel-US relations in ruins.\u201d Lacking a foreign minister in his new government and with a controversial ambassador in Washington, Ron Dermer \u2013 regarded as being close to the Republican party and unwelcome at the White House \u2013 Netanyahu is identified as being the exclusive architect of the failed policy he has so closely associated himself with. Although the opposition Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog, who also opposes the deal, has offered to help Netanyahu with the diplomacy in the US, many analysts have argued that the agreement is in effect a done deal. However, comments by Herzog suggested that the best Israel could now hope for was additional security assistance and guarantees from the US. \u201cI spoke to our good friends at [the pro-Israel lobby group] Aipac and other organisations in the United States, and I plan to go there soon to hold meetings in order to clarify the substance of the dangers in this agreement, for Israel and the region, and to demand that Israel receive a security umbrella in light of the difficult situation that we now face,\u201d said Herzog.  Predicting the damage likely to be done to Israeli interests, the columnist Nahum Barnea was among many predicting a largely pointless battle. \u201cIn the coming two months, the Senate will be the arena of a violent struggle between Netanyahu and the Obama administration. Based on the initial reactions to the agreement, all the Republican senators will vote against it.  \u201cObama will cast a veto. To break the veto, Netanyahu needs 13 Democratic senators. He will get some of them \u2013 mainly those who depend on Jewish voters and Jewish funding. His chances of reaching 13 are not high.\u201d His view was echoed by Shimon Shiffer, another commentator. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that Netanyahu will now even further intensify the clash with the White House and try to enlist Congress to his side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be said with fair certainty that these steps are doomed to fail.\u201d Perhaps most surprising was the view of Ben-Dror Yemini, a usually reliably rightwing columnist, who argued that a continuing effort in Congress would only damage Israel. \u201cThe agreement is a fact. There was a point in waging the battle against the agreement as long as something could have been changed. But this is a lost battle. \u201cNetanyahu chose a path that led to a direct confrontation with the [Obama] administration. If only this had helped. But the opposite happened. The damage was double. Both a crisis with the administration and a dangerous agreement.

What need a modern reader know of Franz Kafka\u2019s Metamorphosis (Die Verwandlung) \u2013 arguably the most famous, also greatest, short story in the history of literary fiction? 2. Of its stature, for example, Elias Canetti wrote that the story was something Kafka \u201ccould never surpass, because there is nothing which Metamorphosis could be surpassed by\u201d. As endorsements go, the bar could not be set higher. 3. Kafka\u2019s place in the literary pantheon has been assured for some time, most pleasingly expressed by George Steiner\u2019s suggestion that he is the only author of whom it may be said that he made his own a letter of the alphabet \u2013 K. 4. Here, though, is a little novelty: in 2015, Metamorphosis is 100 years old. At least, 1915 is when the story was published, which is to say \u201cfinished\u201d; and Kafka, famously, didn\u2019t finish very much. 5. Kafka worked on Metamorphosis through the autumn of 1912 and completed a version on 7 December that year. But negotiations with publishers were complicated, and circumstances \u2013 the first world war, among other things \u2013 intervened. 6. Finally Metamorphosis was set before readers in October 1915, in the avant-garde monthly Die Weissen Bl\u00e4tter, then put between covers that December. 7. A century on, why does Metamorphosis still attract readers? One reason is that it\u2019s a horror story of sorts. Its premise \u2013 a man awakens in the body of an insect \u2013 exerts a ghastly fascination beyond anything in even the consummate short works of Chekhov or Joyce or Alice Munro. 8. Another is that it is, amid its pathos, awfully funny. Gregor Samsa wakes to discover he has six legs and a shell, yet for some pages he thinks that what ails him might just be the kind of throat complaint that is \u201cthe occupational malady of travellers\u201d. What can you do but laugh? 9. And there\u2019s more. As Gregor struggles to crawl off his bed, a clerk from his company calls at the Samsa apartment. As Vladimir Nabokov commented: \u201cThis grim speed in checking a remiss employee has all the qualities of a bad dream.\u201d But it is also farce: a personal embarrassment raised to a debacle by multiple easily shocked persons arriving on the scene to witness it. 10. Metamorphosis exemplifies the world Kafka invented on paper \u2013 recognisable but not quite real, precisely detailed and yet dreamlike.   Metamorphosis at the 2013 Edinburgh international festival.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" />  Wu Hsing-kuo in Contemporary Legend theatre\u2019s production of Metamorphosis at the 2013 Edinburgh international festival. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/Guardian    11. We call this world \u201cKafkaesque\u201d, of course, while keeping mindful of Italo Calvino\u2019s lament that one hears that term \u201cevery quarter of an hour, applied indiscriminately\u201d. 12. I\u2019ll venture we mean \u201cKafkaesque\u201d to denote a sense of suddenly inhabiting a world in which one\u2019s customary habits of thought and behaviour are confounded and made hopeless. 13. To dig a little deeper, the term evokes an individual\u2019s sense of finding himself victimised by large impersonal forces, feeling after a while that he can\u2019t but take it personally \u2013 and feeling haunted, too, by the sense that maybe, after all, he deserves it. 14. If you grant the preceding, then Metamorphosis is perhaps the quintessential Kafka story. 15. Given how well the story has aged, it is telling that Kafka at first didn\u2019t wholly delight in his handiwork. Even as he inspected the proofs he was unpersuaded. (\u201cUnreadable ending. Imperfect almost to its very marrow.\u201d)   Related: Kafka's Metamorphosis and its mutations in translation    16. But the very fact that Metamorphosis was read, chuckled over and frowned on while Kafka was alive may bear repeating; for the myth rather persists that Kafka was unknown and unpublished in his lifetime. 17. Though his great fame was posthumous, he did have a reputation to speak of while he was alive. If a minor figure, he nonetheless had a better class of admirer (eg, Robert Musil). 18. In 1915 the dramatist Carl Sternheim, winner of the prestigious Theodor Fontane prize, bestowed his prize money on Kafka as a mark of writer-to-writer respect. 19. (Can you imagine the Man Booker prizewinner of 2015 declaring from the dais that s/he plans to hand over the \u00a350,000 to a rival novelist whose stuff s/he considers so much better?) 20. Legendarily, though, Kafka had no bigger fan than his university friend Max Brod, who decided early on that Kafka was a genius, and duly ended up saving his works from incineration.     Max Brod, c1940. Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images    21. Kafka\u2019s famous literary death wish, delivered to Brod, was: \u201cDearest Max, my final request: Everything I leave behind in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters, from others and my own, sketches, and so forth, to be burned completely and unread \u2026 \u201d 22. Brod disobeyed Kafka, claiming that his friend had intimated his wish some years earlier, whereupon Brod had made it clear he would do no such thing. In other words, we may infer that Kafka was playing hard to get. 23. Kafka did, however, stipulate that a few works were to be spared: \u201cThe Judgment, The Stoker, Metamorphosis, Penal Colony, Country Doctor, and the short story \u201cA Hunger Artist\u201d \u2026 since they do exist, I do not wish to hinder anyone who may want to, from keeping them.\u201d Certainly these are stories one would call keepers. 24. Let\u2019s look again, then, at the setup of Metamorphosis: Gregor Samsa is a travelling salesman in cloth, who works to support his family \u2013 mother, father, younger sister \u2013 and lives with them in a flat in an apartment house, though frequent business trips mean he is rarely there. 25. Why does Gregor work so hard? Five years ago his father lost a lot of money and Gregor took a job with one of the creditors. His sister Grete was too young to work, his mother too poorly with asthma, his father rather a broken man. Gregor, then, is the man of the house: his wages keep the family. As the story begins he has, for a change, slept overnight in the flat. And then he awakens. 26. Horror, humour, the trappings of the workaday, the surrealism of dreams \u2013 all are present from the first sentence, which in German goes like this: \u201cAls Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen Tr\u00e4umen erwachte, fand er sich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheuren Ungeziefer verwandelt.\u201d    Kafka's great writings may be seen as a sort of imaginative rehearsal for the end of all things    27. No English translation disputes that Gregor wakes from troubled dreams to find himself transformed in his bed. But into what, precisely? 28. The adjective ungeheuren means \u201chuge\u201d, the noun Ungeziefer some form of \u201ccreepy-crawly\u201d but also \u201cvermin\u201d \u2013 obviously more suggestive of rodents than insects, yet applicable to both, the shared characteristic being pestilent, repugnant qualities. 29. \u201cSome kind of monstrous vermin\u201d is how it was rendered by the story\u2019s first English translator, AL Lloyd. \u201cA gigantic insect\u201d was the reading of Edwin and Willa Muir. \u201cA monstrous cockroach\u201d is how Michael Hofmann phrased it more recently. 30. Nabokov, who taught Kafka\u2019s work with great ardour at Cornell University, was a passionate lepidopterist and put some care into classifying Kafka\u2019s Ungeziefer, noting its \u201cnumerous little legs\u201d, brown colouring and convexity of belly and back.   Metamorphosis at the Royal Alexandra theatre, Toronto, January 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" />  A dress rehearsal for staging of Metamorphosis at the Royal Alexandra theatre, Toronto, January 2014. Photograph: Rick Madonik/ Getty Images    31. In a deduction worthy of Sherlock Holmes, Nabokov also observed that the creature\u2019s use of \u201cstrong mandibles\u201d for the purpose of turning a key in a lock while on its hind legs \u201cgives us the length of his body, which is about three feet\u201d. But this is mere dressing on Nabokov\u2019s conclusion: namely that Gregor becomes \u201ca big beetle\u201d. 32. Both Kafka and Brod when discussing the story spoke freely of the \u201cbug\u201d (wanze). But Kafka wished for readers to approach his creation with rather more tact. In his 1915 correspondence with Kurt Wolff he expressed alarm (\u201cNot that, please not that!\u201d) at the thought that the book\u2019s cover might bear a drawing of an insect. 33. It\u2019s not a great stretch to propose that in his concern for how Ungeziefer Gregor was perceived, Kafka was revealing an identification with his protagonist \u2013 quite a thing, when you think about it. 34. Metamorphosis is a story in which a man suffers a terrible and inexplicable misfortune, is reduced to an abject and alien state, then is made to suffer doubly by the attitude of his ostensible loved ones, who make clear they would be better off without him \u2013 a verdict that he, with a passivity that seems culpable, accepts.   Related: The enduring truth of Kafka\u2019s Metamorphosis | Letters    35. Not for nothing did Saul Friedl\u00e4nder entitle his 2013 study Kafka: Poet of Shame and Guilt. 36. Neurotic misery informed Kafka\u2019s work just as it is the making of many a writer, but in his case the degree to which the pain appears willed \u2013 that he felt it could be no other way and probably ought to be so \u2013 makes for a significant variation. 37. There\u2019s something a little chilling in the way he could step aside from himself, perceive his own plight, then twist it with finesse into fictional shapes that had the force of parables. 38. To live the writing life, Kafka decided early on, was to be in \u201cthe service of the Devil\u201d. He struck this Faustian pact, knowing it was not in his favour (it never is), but that it would suffice. Writing was everything, though it couldn\u2019t be enough, and in consequence he would cut himself off from real intimacy with any other person. 39. Certainly Kafka had what we nowadays call commitment issues with women. The degree to which he was interested in them as sexual partners is the riddle of the sphinx, one we must leave to his biographers, who don\u2019t entirely agree. 40. It\u2019s noteworthy, then, that Metamorphosis has a kinship with other titles in that elite group saved from the flames, Kafka having composed them during an inspired period of months in 1912 when, undoubtedly, a woman was involved.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton/Guardian    41. By day, Kafka was an insurance man specialising in workers\u2019 injury claims. If he saw this job as a writer\u2019s wage slavery, nonetheless he did it for years, conscientiously. 42. By 1911 he was working \u2013 unfruitfully, he felt \u2013 on a novel with an American theme entitled The Man Who Disappeared / Der Verschollene. (It became Amerika.) 43. Worse, during 1911 he was much beset by having agreed to help his father with an interest in an asbestos factory \u2013 an investment Kafka had encouraged him to make, resulting in hassles and unhappiness. 44. But in August 1912, at Brod\u2019s place in Prague, Kafka met Felice Bauer. Felice was 24, a cousin of Brod\u2019s brother-in-law, and visiting from Berlin where she worked as a secretary for a firm making Dictaphones. Kafka was instantly drawn to her and began to woo her with a daily torrent of letters. 45. There is, of course, an obvious distancing effect in epistolary courtship, and Kafka could be promiscuous even with those disembodied affections. 46. Hanif Kureishi has observed wryly that Kafka \u201cbecame very good at maddening, denying and provoking women. He also went to enormous trouble to ensure that none of the women engaged with him was ever happy or satisfied.\u201d 47. Kafka saw Felice as \u201ca happy, healthy, self-confident girl\u201d. She was perhaps cheerier than our now standard image of aKafka fan. In fact, she wasn\u2019t madly keen on his writing. But she did seem to have an invigorating effect on his productivity. 48. During the early months of their romance he wrote The Judgment and Metamorphosis. The former was dedicated to Felice. 49. On 17 November 1912 he wrote to Felice, confiding that he had been bedridden with misery over the fitful progess of Der Verschollene when suddenly another story idea occurred to him (\u201cand oppressed me with inmost intensity\u201d). 50. Work soon gathered pace. On 23 November he advised Felice with a strange but typical air of tease that his new story was \u201ca little bit dreadful\u201d.     Felice Bauer and Franz Kafka, c1900. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis    51. The following day, a Sunday, he read the first part of his Die Verwandlung aloud to his friends and they laughed keenly. He must have known then that he had something. 52. Though Kafka further told Felice the piece was \u201cextremely repulsive\u201d and \u201cnauseating\u201d, he professed himself \u201cnot unhappy with it\u201d. He even assured her his creative process was a boon to their relationship \u2013 \u201cperhaps as much as I write and free myself, purer and worthier of you I will become.\u201d 53. Reviewing this correspondence, it seems that some part of Kafka desired to make a show of his stigmata; and not \u2013 whatever his protestations \u2013 because that effort was so very self-abnegating but, rather, because he took an artist\u2019s pride in the distinguished originality of his wounds. 54. Kafka\u2019s friend Franz Werfel recommended Die Verwandlung to Wolff in March 1913. Wolff recommended it in turn to Franz Blei, literary editor of Die Weissen Bl\u00e4tter. Musil wanted to see it for his magazine Die Neue Rundschau but that came to naught. 55. The year 1913 was nonetheless a good one for Kafka\u2019s output: The Judgment and The Stoker (the first chapter of what had become Amerika) were published. 56. Kafka became engaged to Felice in April 1914, but broke it off in July. The bonds of marriage appealed to him only in theory. 57. Then came the war. Kafka was spared military service as an \u201cindispensable worker\u201d. But his brother-in-law fought, and what he told Kafka of trench warfare possibly inspired In the Penal Colony, which got Kafka back into a productive groove. The Trial, too, was drafted largely in 1914-15. 58. From this promising point in his authorial career, did Kafka power forward? He did not. By 1916 the writing had gone adrift. He took leave from his insurance job, to no great avail. He and Felice reconciled and were engaged again in July 1917. 59. At 4am on 11 August 1917 Kafka woke abruptly and started coughing blood. On 4 September doctors diagnosed tuberculosis. 60. Kafka observed his predicament carefully and to a friend he declared it to be fate: \u201c\u2026 it is a just blow, which, incidentally, I do not feel at all as a blow, but as something quite sweet in comparison with the average course of the past years \u2026 \u201d   The Trial, June 2015.\" width=\"460\" height=\"301\" class=\"gu-image\" />  The Young Vic production of Kafka\u2019s The Trial, June 2015. Photograph: Tristram Kenton/Guardian    61. The diagnosis was by no means the end of Kafka\u2019s writing, yet from this moment until the end he carried a burden, like a hard shell on his back. Tuberculosis was a project to which he was condemned, and this confinement he experienced as being, somehow, set free. 62. In December 1917 he broke with Felice for the second and decisive time. She got over it, and married another man a year later. 63. Sickness and solitude could easily break a writer, but then Kafka didn\u2019t write for common-coin reasons: not to delight himself, or to make a living, or impress the opposite sex. 64. Why did he write? In the famous \u201cLetter to his Father\u201d \u2013 gouged out of himself during a supposed vacation in the mountain village of Schelesen in November 1919, but never sent \u2013 he dedicated his entire oeuvre to the man who sired him: \u201cMy writing was about you; in it, I merely lamented what I was unable to lament at your breast.\u201d    Horror, humour, the trappings of the workaday, the surrealism of dreams \u2013 all are present from the first sentence    65. Hermann Kafka, ex-serviceman and purveyor of fancy goods, was the strapping son of a butcher. Hermann and his wife Julie conceived five further children after Franz was born in 1883, though two died young, leaving Franz as the sole boy with three sisters. Hermann did no obvious wrong to anyone, and yet literary history holds a strong image of him as the great oppressor in Franz\u2019s life. 66. As Alan Bennett, author of the play Kafka\u2019s Dick, notes: \u201cHermann Kafka has had such a consistently bad press that it\u2019s hard not to feel a sneaking sympathy for him as for all the Parents of Art. They never get it right.\u201d 67. Kureishi, meanwhile, has ranked the \u201ccharacter\u201d of Hermann as \u201cprobably one of [Kafka\u2019s] best literary creations or fictions\u201d. 68. The \u201cLetter\u201d is a flabbergasting list of grievances regarding the many and various \u201corbits of influence\u201d Franz believed Hermann to have exerted against him, and his own \u201cstruggle\u201d to resist. 69. And yet the \u201cLetter\u201d is also replete with notes of trapped, thwarted regard. Franz professes to have felt himself \u201ca miserable specimen\u201d next to his dad \u2013 \u201cnot only in your eyes but in the eyes of the whole world, for you were for me the measure of all things\u201d. 70. The harder recriminatory strain, though, leads to invective: \u201cYou have put it into your head to live entirely off me. And there is the combat of vermin, which not only sting but, on top of it, suck your blood in order to sustain their own life. That\u2019s what the real professional soldier is; and that\u2019s what you are. You are unfit for life \u2026 \u201d   Kafka\u2019s Dick at the Theatre Royal, York in 2001, with Matthew Kelly as Hermann Kafka and Matthew Rixon as Franz.\" width=\"460\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" />  Alan Bennett\u2019s play Kafka\u2019s Dick at the Theatre Royal, York in 2001, with Matthew Kelly as Hermann Kafka and Matthew Rixon as Franz. Photograph: Simon Warner/Theatre Royal York    71. With the charge of parasitical behaviour, and the wince-making evocation of \u201cvermin\u201d, we are carried back into the world of Metamorphosis. 72. In the story, Gregor, having gradually accepted his insect state as irreversible, then attempts to adapt the good efforts he customarily makes on behalf of his family, and \u2013 while he succumbs to a degree of self-pity \u2013 is rather ashamed of himself. 73. How do the Samsa family members adapt themselves to Gregor? The film-maker David Cronenberg, in his introduction to Susan Bernofsky\u2019s 2012 translation, puts it eloquently: \u201cIt never occurs to them that, for example, a giant beetle has eaten Gregor; they don\u2019t have the imagination.\u201d Rather, in a thoroughly bourgeois manner, the Samsas see Gregor\u2019s plight as \u201can unfortunate natural family occurrence with which one must reluctantly contend\u201d. 74. A great and terrible moment comes when Gregor\u2019s sister argues vehemently that the \u201cmonster\u201d in Gregor\u2019s room cannot possibly be Gregor \u2013 that its pestilent presence in the Samsa home is proof of its inhumanity. Gregor remains sufficiently human to hear those words and to feel them, and his response provides the story\u2019s climax. 75. Some of the most distinguished writers to have written on Kafka have taken the view that Gregor is a suffering saint, and his family a collection of monsters. 76. \u201cGregor\u201d, Nabokov told his students with maximum moral punch, \u201cis a human being in an insect\u2019s disguise; his family are insects disguised as people\u201d. 77. In the essay on Kafka in his Illuminations, Walter Benjamin observes how \u201cthe fathers in Kafka\u2019s strange families batten on their sons, lying on top of them like giant parasites\u201d. 78. During the Marxist analysis of the \u201cNotes on Kafka\u201d in Prisms, Theodor Adorno comments feelingly on how often in this writer\u2019s work \u201cthe parasitic moment is displaced. Gregor Samsa, not his father, becomes the bug\u201d. 79. What Adorno doesn\u2019t address is the degree to which Kafka was displacing through fiction a sense of parasitism that he saw in his own reflection, the \u201cmiserable specimen\u201d in the mirror. 80. The dating of the never-sent \u201cLetter to his Father\u201d is noteworthy, too \u2013 ie not long after Kafka had conducted another of his hopeless courtships, with a dressmaker from Prague named Julie Wohryzek. Kafka proposed to her in the summer of 1919. Hermann thought the match ill-advised, half-baked, beneath his son\u2019s station. Unsurprisingly, the marriage didn\u2019t happen, ostensibly because the couple couldn\u2019t find a place to live.     Statue of Franz Kafka in Prague. Photograph: Alamy    81. But the reason Kafka gives to Hermann is that he is \u201cmentally incapable of marrying\u201d, marriage being \u201cyour [Hermann\u2019s] very own domain\u201d. In other words, Kafka felt Hermann had already deformed him irreparably in the sexual-romantic department. 82. There were two further notable romances in Kafka\u2019s life: a largely epistolary affair with the gifted translator Milena Jesensk\u00e1-Pollak, who was unhappily married and therefore unattainable \u2013 unless, that is, both she and Kafka had been prepared to do something about it. 83. Then came Dora Diamant, 19 years old when Kafka met her at the seaside resort of M\u00fcritz in 1923. Within a few weeks the two were planning a future, contemplating a fresh start in Berlin, or Tel Aviv. In fact, the unassuming Dora became Kafka\u2019s companion unto death. 84. Philip Roth, who taught Kafka\u2019s works at the University of Pennsylvania (and who published The Breast in homage to Metamorphosis) once wrote a part-essay/part-imagining called \u201c\u2018I Always Wanted You to Admire My Fasting\u2019, or, Looking at Kafka\u201d \u2013 in which a pretend-Kafka survives TB and moves to settle in Newark as a Hebrew schoolteacher (where he instructs a young \u201cPhilip Roth\u201d.) But if that was Roth\u2019s dream, it doesn\u2019t approximate to anything Kafka appeared to fancy for himself. 85. In a letter of July 1922, Kafka told Brod that he feared death in part because he had never lived, but that there was both an upside to that and a down: \u201cWhat I have toyed with is really going to happen. I have not bought myself off by my writing. I died my whole life long and now I will really die. My life was sweeter than other people\u2019s and my death will be all the more terrible.\u201d 86. Kafka \u201ctoyed\u201d with death to the extent that his great writings may be seen as a sort of highly imaginative rehearsal for the end of all things: little suicides, if you like. Metamorphosis is the most vivid \u2013 the saddest, most ghastly and unforgettable \u2013 of them all. 87. By the middle of 1924 his health was so poor he had to move back in with Hermann and Julie. He was suffering from agonising tubercular lesions, and the pain of swallowing left him ever more parched and starved. At noon on 3 June 1924, he died. He was 40. 88. The Scottish poet-translator Edwin Muir and his wife Willa gave English readers the Kafka they knew and loved for decades. Metamorphosis, though, was first rendered in English by Eugene Jolas across three issues of the journal Transitions from 1936 to 1938. 89. However, the first single-volume English translation dates from 1937 and was by AL Lloyd, the folk musicologist, singer, arranger and author. 90. Lately, through newer translations, English readers have got to know Kafka over again. It is widely felt that the Muirs were over-fussy, distorting what Stanley Corngold has called the \u201cluminous plainness in Kafka\u2019s prose\u201d. 91. Great books are, of course, often translated into dramas, even though a literary masterpiece has, by definition, already found its perfect form. Steven Berkoff\u2019s movement-centred staging of Metamorphosis allowed a succession of gifted performers to contort their bodies into the mutated shape of Gregor Samsa: first, Berkoff himself in 1969, later, Brad Davis (1982), Tim Roth (1986), Roman Polanski (1988), and, on Broadway in 1989, Mikhail Baryshnikov.   Metamorphosis at London\u2019s Roundhouse, in 1969.\" width=\"460\" height=\"312\" class=\"gu-image\" />  Steven Berkoff in his adaptation of Metamorphosis at London\u2019s Roundhouse, in 1969. Photograph: Bryn Campbell    92. One might wonder how Cronenberg would adapt Metamorphosis for cinema, except that his The Fly (1986) gives a decent idea. That film\u2019s protagonist does not wake to find himself an insect but, rather, mutates into a hybrid form over a period of weeks, during which \u2013 just as Nabokov says of Gregor \u2013 \u201chis human impressions still mingle with his new insect instincts\u201d. 93. Kafka composed a notable number of stories from the perspective of creatures: \u201cInvestigations of a Dog\u201d, \u201cA Report to an Academy\u201d, \u201cJosephine the Singer\u201d, \u201cThe Burrow\u201d. It\u2019s as if he were saying: \u201cYou\u2019re in the body you\u2019re in, it makes the problems it makes, the soul cries out regardless.\u201d 94. My First Kafka: Runaways, Rodents and Giant Bugs (2013) is a book for children in which Matthue Roth retells Metamorphosis, with drawings by Rohan Daniel Eason. It\u2019s a fine idea, playing to the seemingly irreducible anthropomorphic bent of literature aimed at kids. 95. But that\u2019s not to say Kafka\u2019s original can\u2019t work for younger readers. Last summer I had my old Penguin Kafka with me by the pool during a shared family holiday, and at one point a nine-year-old friend of my daughter picked up the book and began to question me about it. The next time I looked, the book was gone.    Kafka \u2018went to enormous trouble to\u00a0ensure that none of the women engaged with him was ever happy or satisfied\u2019  Hanif Kureishi     96. Could there ever be another Kafka? If he were living today in our age of instant publishing, neglected book mountains and 24-hour multimedia (self-)promotion, do you suppose he could get a start in the writing game? 97. One would hope so, but it\u2019s not a business for overly retiring types, not ideal for one who reviewed his life\u2019s work and concluded that the bulk of it ought to be consumed by fire. 98. On the one hand, it\u2019s hard to imagine Kafka on Twitter, yet undeniably he had a gift for aphorism. \u201cIn the struggle between yourself and the world, back the world\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s 62 characters right there. 99. Social media could have fitted Kafka like a glove, or a skin, or a hard shell. His reticence and enigma might have made him, counterintuitively, a deeply marketable author. 100. Can we imagine, then, in 2015, that the greatest fabulist of our times might be a resolutely single if not \u201cundateable\u201d solitary, glumly tied to the parental home, trapped doing unglamorous office work, and tapping away after dark at literary efforts that he cannot ever quite complete or sign off? It doesn\u2019t seem quite plausible, or desirable, perhaps. But that, more or less, is the story of Kafka, and why we are able to treasure what is indeed the most famous, also greatest, short story in the history of literary fiction. \u2022 This is an edited version of Richard T Kelly\u2019s preface to the 2015 edition of Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (translated by AL Lloyd), published by Faber Finds.", "publicationDate": "2015-07-18T07:34:38Z", "title": "Kafka\u2019s Metamorphosis: 100 thoughts for 100 years", "sentences": ["Within a few weeks the two were planning a future, contemplating a fresh start in Berlin, or Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/franz-kafka-metamorphosis-100-thoughts-100-years"}, {"tags": ["Science and nature", "Books", "Culture", "Psychology", "Science"], "article": "Daniel Kahneman is the\u00a0very definition of unassuming: a small, softly spoken man in his 80s, his face and manners mild, his demeanour that of a\u00a0cautious observer rather than someone who calls the shots. We meet in a quiet spot off the lobby of a London hotel. Even then I\u00a0have trouble catching every word; his\u00a0accent hovers between French and Israeli and his delivery is quiet, imbued with a slightly strained patience, helpful but cautious. And yet this is a man whose experimental findings have shifted our understanding of thought on its axis \u2013 someone described by Steven Pinker as \u201cthe world\u2019s most influential living psychologist\u201d. With his long-time collaborator Amos Tversky, who died in 1996, he delineated the biases that warp our judgment, from figuring out if we can trust a prospective babysitter to\u00a0buying and selling shares. In 2002 he\u00a0was awarded the Nobel prize in economics, a testament to the boundary-busting nature of his research. His 2011 book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, a primer on a career\u2019s worth of psychological inquiry, won the US National Academy of Sciences book award, and the enthusiastic approval of his peers. It tells the story of \u201ctwo systems\u201d of thought, one automatic and intuitive, the realm of systematic biases, the other conscious and deliberative. It is a challenging work, clearly written but stuffed even so with difficult problems and counter-intuitive explanations. Despite that, it has sold millions of copies around the world. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, professor of risk engineering and author of The Black Swan, places it \u201cin the same league as The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith and The Interpretation of Dreams by Sigmund Freud\u201d. What\u2019s fascinating is that Kahneman\u2019s work explicitly swims against the current of human thought. Not even he believes that the various flaws that bedevil decision-making can be successfully corrected. The most damaging of these is overconfidence: the kind of optimism that leads governments to believe that wars are quickly winnable and capital projects will come in on budget despite statistics predicting exactly the opposite. It is the bias he says he would most like to eliminate if he had a magic wand. But it \u201cis built so deeply into the\u00a0structure of the mind that you couldn\u2019t change it without changing many other things\u201d. The same applies to our habit of predicting stereotypical outcomes at the expense of what\u2019s known about the world. When told of a student, Tom, who has a\u00a0preference for neat and tidy systems and a penchant for sci-fi, most of us guess that he\u2019s studying computer sciences and not a humanities subject. This is despite the fact that the group studying the latter is far larger. \u201cThink of it this way. A form of stereotyping is involved in understanding the world. So I have a stereotype of a table, I have a stereotype of chairs. Now when you start having stereotypes of social groups, it\u2019s the human mind at work. It\u2019s not a different mind. It\u2019s what you need to get around in the\u00a0world.\u201d You can slow down and become aware of this, Kahneman believes, but the underlying mechanism isn\u2019t going to change. That tendency to stereotype social groups has affected Kahneman\u2019s own life, in dramatic fashion. Born in Tel Aviv, to Lithuanian Jewish parents, he spent his early years in France. They lived there comfortably until the German invasion. His father, who worked for a company owned by L\u2019Oreal, was arrested during an antisemitic roundup and taken to\u00a0the\u00a0internment camp at Drancy. \u201cI\u00a0remember visiting,\u201d Kahneman tells me. \u201cI was seven. You\u00a0couldn\u2019t get in of\u00a0course, but there were lots of people at the windows \u2013 men and lots of women and children. And there was a\u00a0French policeman and I still have that\u00a0image of\u00a0him telling us that they\u2019re hungry in\u00a0there, they\u2019re eating vegetable peelings.\u201d Thankfully, his father was so popular with his employers that after six weeks they arranged for him to return home, the occasion for another vivid memory. \u201cMy mother knew that her husband would be released and she and I \u2013 we were living in Neuilly, just outside the main part of Paris \u2013 went out shopping. We came back, and my father was there, wearing his best suit. He weighed 45 kilos. He was just skin and bones, but he hadn\u2019t eaten: he\u00a0was waiting for us. There was considerable dignity in that.\u201d As the occupation wore on the family\u00a0was nevertheless forced to\u00a0flee\u00a0to Juan-les-Pins on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur. But after the allies landed in north Africa the Germans took over the south, initiating a \u201cvery dark period\u201d. Kahneman began to pray for his life. \u201cI\u00a0knew that God was extremely busy, so I wasn\u2019t going to demand too much. But I was asking for one day at a time. That\u2019s what it felt like. It felt like being hunted. We had the mentality of rabbits.\u201d Moving from one village to another, making their way to the centre of France, they ended up living in a converted chicken coop. It was there that Kahneman\u2019s father, who was diabetic, suffered a\u00a0stroke and died, just six weeks before\u00a0D-day. Another image sticks in\u00a0his mind. \u201cIt was very, very cold in\u00a0winter, and I remember my mother in full mourning with a\u00a0veil\u00a0and with an axe\u00a0in her hand, breaking wood.\u201d Still,\u00a0he denies that the experience was traumatic. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing compared with other Jewish stories. I was never really hungry, I\u00a0never saw real violence. There was a\u00a0lot of resilience.\u201d Soon afterwards, his life changed completely. France was liberated, and\u00a0then, in 1946, the family moved to\u00a0Palestine. Kahneman had been an intellectual child and he thrived in his new home, ending up some years later with a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology, conducting personality tests for prospective army officers. As an Israeli, there at the very birth of the nation, Kahneman has had a front-row seat in one of the most vivid theatres of human misunderstanding. His work has much to say about prejudice, the inability to fully recognise alternative points of view and our strong aversion to losses, which considerably outweighs the satisfaction we get from gains. Can he explain why, in\u00a0this area, it\u2019s been so hard to achieve a meeting of minds? \u201cI\u2019m far on the left of the spectrum in Israeli politics and always have been,\u201d he says. \u201cI hated the notion of occupation since the very beginning. My first memories from after the 67 war are travelling with my children in the occupied territories. There were awnings over groceries stores with Hebrew lettering advertising Osem noodles. I\u00a0couldn\u2019t bear it. I thought that\u00a0was dreadful because I remembered German lettering in France. I have very strong feelings about Israel as an occupier.\u201d Despite this, Kahneman has found it impossible to envisage a settlement that will satisfy both sides. \u201cI\u00a0don\u2019t believe in the power of rational argument in this context,\u201d he says, with an\u00a0air of resignation. He mentions one\u00a0occasion when he was visited at his university by a Palestinian academic after 67. They were getting on famously. But\u00a0then \u201cwe tried to\u00a0negotiate peace, and we failed, essentially on the right of\u00a0return, which although obviously a\u00a0legitimate demand among the Palestinians, means the destruction of Israel. So people who don\u2019t want Israel destroyed cannot accept the right of return, even though they might understand that it has legitimacy behind it.\u201d In general, Kahneman is downbeat about the capacity of his brand of psychology to effect change in the world. I imagine he would simply argue he\u2019s a realist about human nature. And, indeed, studies showing that \u201cskilled\u201d analysts are hopeless at predicting the price of shares have yet to translate into mass sackings or even reduced bonuses on Wall Street or in the City. The same goes for evidence that the influence of a high-quality CEO on the performance of a company is barely greater than chance. But there are more modest ways his insights can help us avoid making mistakes. He advises, for example, that\u00a0meetings start with participants writing down their ideas about the issue at hand before anyone speaks. That way, the halo effect \u2013 whereby the concerns raised first and most assertively dominate the discussion \u2013 can be mitigated, and a range of views considered. Then there is the concept of adversarial collaboration, an attempt to do away with pointless academic feuding. Though he doesn\u2019t like to think in terms of leaving a legacy, it\u2019s\u00a0one thing he says he hopes to be remembered for. In the early 2000s Kahneman sought out a leading opponent of his view that so-called expert judgments were frequently flawed. Gary Klein\u2019s research focused on the ability of professionals such as firefighters to make intuitive but highly skilled judgments in difficult circumstances. \u201cWe spent five or six years trying to figure out the boundary, where he\u2019s right, where I am right. And that was a very\u00a0satisfying experience. We wrote a\u00a0paper entitled \u2018A Failure to Disagree\u2019\u201d. Kahneman\u2019s finely tuned ability to\u00a0detect the biases in the thinking of others hasn\u2019t, of course, released him from the cage of his own nature. He is a\u00a0pessimist, \u201ca worrier\u201d, \u201cnot a jolly person\u201d. But, despite this, he says, \u201cI\u2019m\u00a0quite capable of great enjoyment, and I\u2019ve had a great life.\u201d His friendships \u2013 notably with Tversky, his academic soulmate, and behavioural economist Richard Thaler, have been long and fruitful. He has been married since 1978 to the perceptual psychologist Anne Treisman, and has two children. When I ask about them, he explains, matter of factly, that his son is schizophrenic. \u201cHe would have been a very brilliant economist.\u201d His daughter\u00a0is now \u201csuccessful in\u00a0hi-tech\u201d. Despite his sadness over his son, and\u00a0all the other inevitable trials of life,\u00a0it\u2019s possible to regard Kahneman as a\u00a0living, breathing counterargument to\u00a0his theory of pervasive overconfidence. Who, after all, would have looked at the Jewish boy in the chicken\u00a0coop in\u00a0occupied France and\u00a0predicted his\u00a0survival, let alone his\u00a0many accomplishments? Or the transition from respected academic to\u00a0intellectual superstar? Yet popular recognition, which has come late in his\u00a0career, was\u00a0never his primary aim. \u201cI\u00a0had limited ambitions, I didn\u2019t aspire to great success. I was very hardworking, but\u00a0I\u00a0didn\u2019t expect to\u00a0be a\u00a0famous psychologist.\u201d The next problem on his list is \u201cnoise\u201d, or random variability: the fact\u00a0that different people in the same situation make very different judgments. Random error is\u00a0a very different phenomenon from the systematic biases he\u2019s been studying for several decades. It\u2019s the kind of error you can\u2019t reliably predict. Noise, he says, applies to people approving loans, to underwriters, to radiologists. One worker might be more optimistic than another, say, and it becomes difficult to ensure uniformity. \u201cMood is noxious. Noise is\u00a0costly to organisations, which are essentially factories for making decisions. If another underwriter had\u00a0seen that case\u00a0he would put a different premium on it \u2026\u201d It\u2019s even worse, presumably, in the case of a radiologist examining a scan for signs of cancer. Kahneman is interested in looking at how to increase the consistency of operations \u2013 not the\u00a0same, he\u00a0explains, as controlling biases. It\u00a0sounds like a\u00a0new and fascinating chapter. And when he decides to\u00a0write it, one thing is now certain \u2013 he\u00a0can count on millions of\u00a0readers.", "publicationDate": "2015-07-18T08:00:06Z", "title": "Daniel Kahneman: \u2018What would I eliminate if I had a\u00a0magic wand?

His new collection makes a similar virtue of brevity, but in this case the form is the personal essay. The Seven Good Years begins with an account of the birth of his son, and ends with him sitting shiva after the death of his Holocaust-survivor father. In between, there is daily life in Israel, singular and frequently surreal. True, he sometimes writes from abroad, where he travels to teach, attend festivals and, more bizarrely, to spend the night in a 133cm wide house in Warsaw, the city where his mother was born (a Polish architect, for reasons not entirely clear, built this house with Keret in mind, its proportions intended to reflect those of his stories). But it\u2019s in Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan and Beersheba that Keret\u2019s writing is at its most alive. You want him to return home quickly, the better that he\u2019ll tell you more about his yoga lessons (physically inept, he has to join a class of pregnant women) or go berserk at another taxi driver. In Europe, he\u2019s funny. In Israel, he\u2019s hilarious.     \u2018Happily uses the situation in Iran\u2026 to get out of doing household chores\u2019: Etgar Keret. Photograph: Richard Saker/Observer New Review    Keret\u2019s son Lev is born during a terrorist attack, which at first takes the shine off proceedings: \u201cProbably even the baby feels this whole getting-born thing isn\u2019t that urgent any more,\u201d he thinks, glum on his bench outside the maternity ward. Recognised by a reporter, he has to admit that Hamas has nothing to do with his own appearance at the hospital. The reporter is disappointed. Victims, he complains, always say the same thing. It\u2019s really boring. How much better if he had been able to record the thoughts of Israel\u2019s most shoplifted author.? Keret leaps to his compatriots\u2019 defence. Every attack, after all, is the same: explosions and more senseless deaths. How can anyone say anything original in these circumstances? \u201cBeats me,\u201d says the reporter. \u201cYou\u2019re the writer.\u201d And so it goes on. Life is lived, in spite of what is happening \u2013 and sometimes because of it. Keret happily uses the situation in Iran \u2013 his friend, Uzi, has told him that he has it on good authority that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is certainly prepared to destroy Israel once his nuclear bomb arrives \u2013 to get out of doing household chores. What\u2019s the point of calling the plumber to check on that damp spot on the ceiling if, in six months, the ceiling in question is unlikely to exist? Another acquaintance, Kobi, with whom Keret is unexpectedly reunited during a Qassam strike in Beersheba, thinks that the increasing range of these missiles opens up exciting new real estate possibilities. Land values will drop; the state will hand out more building permits. What\u2019s not to like? Keret loves sending up this kind of pragmatism; even as he loathes it, he sort of likes it. But he\u2019s attentive, too, to the deeper shifts that can and do take place in Israeli families when violence, or the threat of violence, is all about. The future smacks him rather forcefully on the nose when, with Lev still a baby, he and his wife argue furiously about whether the boy will ever serve in the Israeli army. She\u2019s against; Keret, guilt ridden as ever, thinks he should step up like everyone else. Keret\u2019s brother, a political activist, now lives in Thailand, having been found guilty of \u201cbehaviour unbecoming to an IDF soldier\u201d during the Lebanon war. His sister, meanwhile, lives in Bnei Brak, Jerusalem\u2019s most orthodox neighbourhood. Keret\u2019s account of how she \u201cbecame religious\u201d just after the Lebanon war \u2013 he refers to her wedding day repeatedly as the day she \u201cdied\u201d \u2013 comprises the most fascinating and for me the most plangent essay in the book. Here is Israeli society in microcosm: a writer who doesn\u2019t keep kosher struggling to understand a mother of 11 whose rabbi will not permit her to read his books. Keret once said in an interview with the Paris Review that he believes a good deal of the richness of his prose is lost in translation. Hebrew is an anarchic beast: a 2,000-year-old written language that was, as he has put it, \u201cdefrosted\u201d into a spoken tongue at an arbitrary historical point, it has had to be unusually open to imported and invented words, and it\u2019s in the tension between its Biblical roots and this instant modernity that much of its peculiar and possibly untranslatable energy lies. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something in this, and in the case of The Seven Good Years, it was all the harder to be confident: here, a shuttlecock is a \u201cfeathered ball\u201d. But in the end, such anxieties only make its achievement seem the more amazing. Keret is a master: bracing, compassionate, so absolutely himself.

The four hijackers shepherded approximately 248 passengers into the old terminal building at Entebbe airport and announced they would blow up their hostages if 53 pro-Palestinian prisoners were not released within 48 hours. As forty of these prisoners were imprisoned in Israel, and half of the plane\u2019s passengers held Israeli passports, it was down to the government in Tel Aviv to respond. The cabinet was split, however, with the prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, ready to negotiate, while his rival, the defence minister, Shimon Peres, preferring a military solution. On 2 July the situation changed. Amin, enjoying his moment in the spotlight, announced the deadline would be extended by three days while he chaired a meeting of the Organisation of African Unity in Mauritius, and that he had arranged for the non-Israeli hostages to be freed. This group provided Israeli intelligence with information that Amin was colluding with the hijackers and that the terminal was not wired up with explosives. The extra time allowed the Israeli Defence Force to come up with an airlift relief mission: a force of 190 commandos and 10 vehicles, carried by four Hercules transporters, would land at Entebbe. Just after midnight on 4 July, the first Hercules landed, undetected, at Entebbe. Then came disaster. Instead of heading straight to the old terminal, the assault force\u2019s commander, Lieutenant Colonel Yonatan Netanyahu, insisted on taking out two Ugandan sentries and lost the element of surprise on which the operation was based. The premature burst of firing gave the captors the chance to start killing the hostages. Fortunately they chose not to.The hijackers were shot dead, along with numerous Ugandans, and Netanyahu was fatally wounded by a Ugandan sniper while standing outside the terminal building. The force returned home to grateful cheers from Israel, Britain and the US and the condemnation of most African and Asian countries. Already the subject of umpteen books, three feature films and several documentaries, the Entebbe story is now retold in a meticulously researched, skilfully constructed, carefully balanced and absorbing book by the military historian, Saul David. Combining the copious literature with interviews with participants, David tells the tale in a novelistic way, almost hour by hour, cutting from the hostages in the sweltering old terminal building in Entebbe to the government offices and military training grounds in Israel. The tension builds steadily. The hostages are much more than Airplane stereotypes; two of the hijackers, the Germans Brigitta Kuhlmann and Wilfried B\u00f6se, are sympathetically drawn; and the loathing between Rabin, the cautious professional soldier, and Peres, the gung-ho armchair warrior, adds edge to the political arguments in Israel. This slow buildup is vital because the climax of the story \u2013 the raid and the liberation of the hostages \u2013 lasted only 51 minutes and, apart from Netanyahu\u2019s aberration, went smoothly with few of the glitches scriptwriters use to ramp up tension. Why did the highly experienced Netanyahu commit such an error of judgment? Max Hastings has argued that he was too experienced: a burnt-out case who had crammed too many raids and ambushes into his 30 years. David points more gently to the same conclusion. There is, though, one odd omission. The French were important players in this drama, yet David tells us little about their activities, other than the French government was worried about harming relations with francophone Africa and the Arab world. Entebbe was a great feat of arms but how important was it? David makes no attempt to place the event in a wider context and simply quotes Hastings\u2019s view that the day the hostages returned was the high-water mark of Israel\u2019s standing in the world. Yet, if anything, the triumph at Entebbe contributed to a glorification of military might and a downgrading of political compromise in Israeli public life, while the posthumous canonisation of Yonatan Netanyahu kickstarted the political career of his younger brother, Benjamin.

As a character actor in film, the thickset Austrian-born Jew was called upon to play a vast range of foreigners, many of them in uniform. But if truth were told, Bikel, who had a fine baritone speaking and singing voice, was given little chance to shine (or sing) in his 50-film career. More satisfying was his finely toned performance as Tevye the milkman in Fiddler on the Roof, whom he played more than 2,000 times all over the US. Although Zero Mostel originally created the part on Broadway in 1962, and Topol played it in Norman Jewison\u2019s 1971 film, for US theatregoers Bikel became identified as much with the role as Yul Brynner was with The King and I. Bikel, who criticised Mostel for his \u201cimprovised shtick\u201d, based Tevye on his grandfather, who had \u201ca similar lively relationship with God\u201d. Nevertheless, Bikel considered the musical, based on stories by the Yiddish writer Sholem Aleichem, \u201ca charming show, but shtetl lite\u201d. Thus there was more sense of tragedy in his one-man show Sholem Aleichem: Laughter Through Tears (2008), in which he sang in English and Yiddish, and in the documentary Theodore Bikel: In the Shoes of Sholem Aleichem (2014).         Theodore Bikel singing Edelweiss, from The Sound of Music    Apart from Fiddler on the Roof, the other Broadway musical with which Bikel was associated was The Sound of Music (1959-63), in which he created the role of Captain von Trapp (played in the film by the more handsome Christopher Plummer). During the out-of-town tryouts for the hit musical, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein felt that the captain should have a song that bids farewell to the Austria he loved. Using Bikel\u2019s guitar-playing and folk-singing talents, they wrote Edelweiss. The simple, patriotic song in waltz time ends with the line: \u201cBless my homeland for ever.\u201d However, Bikel had little cause to bless his homeland. Born in Vienna, he fled with his family to Palestine after the Nazi invasion in 1938. His father, an insurance salesman and ardent Zionist, named his son after Theodor Herzl, one of the founders of Zionism. Bikel, who began acting in his teens, providentially made his professional stage debut as a Tsarist village clerk in Tevye the Milkman (1943), based on Aleichem, at the Habimah theatre in Tel Aviv, after which Bikel co-founded the city\u2019s Cameri theatre a few years later. In 1946, Bikel went to London to study at Rada (Royal Academy of Dramatic Art) before getting small roles on the West End stage. One of them happened to catch the attention of Michael Redgrave, who recommended him to Laurence Olivier, at the time directing the first UK production of Tennessee Williams\u2019 A Streetcar Named Desire (1949). Bikel was praised in the difficult role of Mitch, the sensitive mother\u2019s boy, who awkwardly courts Blanche Dubois (Vivien Leigh). His other London stage success was as the Russian colonel in Peter Ustinov\u2019s satire The Love of Four Colonels (1951). At the same time, Bikel\u2019s film career began with John Huston\u2019s The African Queen (1951) where, at the climax on board ship, he is the unflinching German naval officer prepared to hang Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn for spying. Huston cast him again in Moulin Rouge (1952), in which Bikel has a short scene as King Milo IV of Serbia (miswritten Milan IV on his calling card), one of the first people to buy a painting by Toulouse-Lautrec (Jos\u00e9 Ferrer). Bikel then cropped up briefly in British war films as a Dutch prisoner in The Colditz Story (1955), and a German officer in Above Us the Waves (1955).     Theodore Bikel, right, with Curt Jurgens and Kurt Kreuger in the 1957 film The Enemy Below.  Photograph: Ronald Grant    He continued in much the same way, but in bigger parts, when he went to Hollywood after appearing on Broadway in Tonight in Samarkand (1955) as a French police inspector opposite Louis Jourdan. In The Enemy Below (1957), Bikel is the sympathetic second-in-command on a U-boat in the second world war, being hunted by the American captain (Robert Mitchum) on a destroyer. For Stanley Kramer, Bikel played a sadistic French general ordering the execution of rebel Spaniards (including Frank Sinatra) during the Napoleonic wars in the absurd, overblown epic The Pride and the Passion (1957) and an American at last in The Defiant Ones (1958). Bikel was delighted to be given the role of the sheriff in pursuit of two escaped convicts chained together (Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier), for which he had an impeccable southern accent. Of his Oscar-nominated performance, the New York Times noted: \u201cIn the ranks of the pursuers, Theodore Bikel is most impressive as a sheriff with a streak of mercy and justice, which he has to fight to maintain against a brutish state policeman.\u201d Back to foreigners, Bikel was effectively slimy as a Greek fifth-columnist pitted against foreign correspondent Mitchum in 1941 before and after the German invasion of Greece in Robert Aldrich\u2019s The Angry Hills (1959). However, perhaps his best remembered film role, albeit a very short one, was as the phonetics expert Zoltan Kapathy, who hopes to expose Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) as a fraud in My Fair Lady (1964), but finally declares her not only Hungarian but of royal blood. Kapathy is later described by Professor Higgins (Rex Harrison) as that \u201chairy hound from Budapest. Never leaving us alone. I\u2019ve never known a ruder pest!\u201d Bikel won the role of the Russian captain of a submarine that accidentally runs aground on the New England coast in The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming! (1966), because he was able to play a convincing Russian speaker. Off the beaten track, Bikel found himself in 200 Motels (1971), a surrealistic vision of life on the road for Frank Zappa and his band Mothers of Invention. As government agent Rance Muhammitz, Bikel is a satanic figure who wanders around dispensing hamburgers from a fuming briefcase.         Theodore Bikel singing If I Were a Rich Man, from Fiddler on the Roof    Meanwhile, Bikel had a parallel career on television, appearing mainly as eastern Europeans in series such as Ironside, Charlie\u2019s Angels, Falcon Crest and Star Trek: The Next Generation. Another side to his life arguably brought him more fame than acting. From 1955, Bikel recorded many albums including Jewish and Russian folk songs backed by him on acoustic guitar. In 1959, he co-founded the Newport Folk festival, where he often teamed up with Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, Peter, Paul and Mary and Joan Baez. In the 1960s, Bikel became increasingly involved with civil rights causes \u2013 he was arrested protesting against the Vietnam war \u2013 and was an activist for the Democratic party. His offstage activities included his hands-on presidency of Actors\u2019 Equity (1973-82), and of the Associated Actors and Artistes of America from 1988. Among his other interests were keeping the Yiddish language alive and his love of Israel, though not an uncritical one. Bikel is survived by his fourth wife, Aimee Ginsburg, whom he married in 2013, and two sons, Robert and Daniel, from his second marriage, to Rita Weinberg Call. That and his first marriage, to Ofra Ichilov, ended in divorce. His third wife, the conductor and pianist Tamara Brooks, died in 2012. \u2022 Theodore Meir Bikel, actor, singer and political activist, born 2 May 1924; died 20 July 2015", "publicationDate": "2015-07-22T17:15:39Z", "title": "Theodore Bikel obituary", "sentences": ["Bikel, who began acting in his teens, providentially made his professional stage debut as a Tsarist village clerk in Tevye the Milkman (1943), based on Aleichem, at the Habimah theatre in Tel Aviv, after which Bikel co-founded the city\u2019s Cameri theatre a few years later."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jul/22/theodore-bikel"}, {"tags": ["Ryanair", "Airline industry", "Business", "Travel & leisure", "Travel", "Michael O'Leary", "Money", "World news", "Consumer affairs"], "article": "Ryanair is seeking to crush flight price comparison websites such as Expedia and Opodo, claiming they \u201cmake no sense\u201d and \u201cshouldn\u2019t exist\u201d.

The airline predicted that airfares will fall by 4-8% in the second half of 2015, as cheap fuel prompts a price war among European airlines.

In typically combative mode, O\u2019Leary said the airline would continue to grow strongly in Copenhagen \u2013 despite a bruising battle with unions in Denmark.   \u201cTwo weeks ago we decided, in the best interests of our customers and people, to close our two Danish bases in Copenhagen and Billund. This followed threats by the Danish Unions who admitted that they had no members among our Copenhagen pilots or cabin crew to get their members (competitor airline employees) to blockade/disrupt our flights.   \u201cBy moving the aircraft from Copenhagen and Billund to airports outside Denmark the unions have no legal basis for imposing these threatened disruptions, which allows us to continue to grow strongly in Copenhagen without union interference.\u201d  He added that the airline continues to be \u201cinundated\u201d with invitations from airports around Europe to become Ryanair destinations.   Ryanair\u2019s expansion in 2016 will be focused on Germany, where it opens in Berlin, its sixth base in the country, in September. From November, Israel will become the  31st country to be served by Ryanair, although flights will be to the beach resort of Eilat, not Tel Aviv.   Earlier this month, Ryanair accepted an offer from International Airlines Group (IAG) for its 29.8% stake in Aer Lingus.  However, Ryanair denounced the \u201cbaseless\u201d divestment forced on it by UK regulators.   \u201cWe will continue to oppose the UK CMA\u2019s baseless 2013 divestment ruling, (and their recent rejection of Ryanair\u2019s request to review that decision), which was based on the invented theory that no other airline would bid for Aer Lingus while Ryanair was a minority shareholder. This has been hopelessly exposed by IAG\u2019s current offer for Aer Lingus, even while Ryanair was its largest single shareholder.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-07-27T12:59:08Z", "title": "Ryanair takes aim at price comparison websites", "sentences": ["From November, Israel will become the  31st country to be served by Ryanair, although flights will be to the beach resort of Eilat, not Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/27/ryanair-takes-aim-at-price-comparison-websites"}, {"tags": ["Europa League", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "When Slovan Liberec host Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona on Thursday in the third qualifying round of the Europa League, a small slice of history will be made. For the first time a non-Arab Israeli football club will be led by an Arab manager. Salah Hasarma will take charge of Kiryat Shmona, the Israeli league runners-up, and his remarkable story as a groundbreaking Arab footballer in Israel will reach another high point. When Hasarma, 41, ended his long playing career two years ago he was asked about his future plans. \u201cI took a coaching course and I hope I\u2019ll be the first Arab manager to get a real chance to coach a Jewish Israeli team,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m realistic and there is more chance I will turn to business.\u201d As it turns out, his prediction was pessimistic. He was appointed immediately as the youth coach at Kiryat Shmona and, after two successful seasons, has been promoted to the first team. During a career as a centre-back spanning 25 years, Hasarma featured in almost all the landmark moments of Arab-Israeli football. He was in the Hapoel Tayibe team that became the first Arab side to play in the Israeli top division, in 1996. They received a hostile reception at many grounds and were relegated after one season but Hasarma moved to Bnei Sakhnin and was part of that club\u2019s rise to the top flight. His next move was more controversial, when Bnei Yehuda, a small club from a rough suburb of Tel Aviv, signed him despite vocal opposition from their fans. Hasarma became the first Arab to play for them. \u201cBefore the first training session at Bnei Yehuda I received threats and was told not to go to the ground because I was going to get hurt or killed,\u201d he said in an interview with the Israeli newspaper Maariv. \u201cThe owner and Eli Ohana, the manager, told me not to be afraid and built up my confidence. People said that I should not join the team and that an Arab would not set foot at Bnei Yehuda. My parents were worried and my mother said that maybe I shouldn\u2019t go there but I told her that it would be all right. At the first training session there were few shouts against me but after two games the fans gave me flowers and apologised. They said that they do not judge a person by his race. They saw my love and commitment to the team and after a month they started chanting my name. From then on I felt at home and even now I\u2019m welcomed there and have a warm spot for them.\u201d At his next stop he was part of the most significant night of Arab-Israeli football when Bnei Sakhnin won the Israeli Cup in 2004, although he was on the losing side with Hapoel Haifa. Sakhnin have since risen to the top division and become a symbol for the Arab community in Israel with a squad of mainly Arab-Israeli players, but even they have not had an Arab manager during their time in the premier division. Hasarma also played for seven years at Kiryat Shmona and was a member of the championship-winning side of 2012, the most surprising in Israel\u2019s history.

While the country is sinking into hate and discrimination, its football \u2013 for all its faults and many weaknesses \u2013 has become an oasis, a haven of inclusiveness and meritocracy. All the top league teams, apart from the overtly racist Beitar Jerusalem, have Arab players in their squads and last season 19.8% of the Israeli players in the league were from non-Jewish minorities, a reflection of their 20.3% presence in the population. Arab players have been part of the national team for four decades and Israel Under-21s are finely balanced between Jewish and non-Jewish players. \u201cThe starting point for an Arab player is harder,\u201d Hasarma told the website Walla. \u201cIn most cases he comes from a place without infrastructure and enjoys them much later. An Arab player had to work much harder than his Jewish friend just to make an impression.\u201d As a manager, Hasarma will attract attention and questions about his identity but he seems to be prepared. \u201cI\u2019m an Israeli Palestinian or an Arab Israeli who lives here and I feel attached to the state in the same way as other people,\u201d he said. \u201cI do pray five times a day but I stay clear from fanaticism. There are lots of fanatics around the world, on all sides, who interpret the Torah or the Qur\u2019an in a wrong way. The situation here is complicated. The Arabs are loyal citizens but they have lots of relatives who live in the West Bank or the Gaza Strip. The Arab states also look at the Arab Israelis as a strange community which lives with the Jews.\u201d Even before Hasarma\u2019s first official game, he faced a problem when pro-Palestinian groups called for the cancellation of a pre-season game between Kiryat Shmona and Cardiff City in the Netherlands. To Beitar fans he is an Arab, to others he is an Israeli, a duality reflected in his statement about what should be done with racist fans in Israel. \u201cIt is unacceptable and we need to deal with it seriously. The police should have people in the stands and arrest anybody who shouts racist remarks, and then it will finish. When we play abroad we see people against us, so how come it happens among us in the country? We need to uproot it.\u201d The neglected, purpose-built town of Kiryat Shmona (population of 23,000) in the north-eastern tip of Israel, less than two miles from the Lebanese border, is looking forward to next season and the European campaign. For all its natural beauty it was known for the many missile attacks it suffered over the years and chronic unemployment. Thanks to Izzy Sheratzky, the owner who finances the club, there is a successful team there. Sheratzky has a reputation as a capricious owner known to interfere with his manager\u2019s work and fell out with the previous three.

According to eyewitnesses, the attacker \u2013 named by a police spokesman as Yishai Schlissel \u2013 had hidden himself in a supermarket and waited for the march to arrive. They described seeing Schlissel, an ultra-Orthodox Jew who had been released from prison three weeks earlier after serving a sentence for stabbing several people at a gay pride parade in 2005, run screaming through the crowd in a central Jerusalem street, stabbing people at random before being overpowered by police. An Associated Press photographer pictured Schlissel, heavily bearded and dressed in religious clothes, shortly before he began his attack, walking through the crowd with his hand inside his jacket apparently hiding a knife from view. Another image, taken seconds later, showed him running through the crowd pursued closely by police, holding the weapon aloft. A paramedic named Hanoch Zelinger, who treated the wounded at the scene, said the woman had been seriously injured, with stab wounds to the back, chest and neck.           Yishai Schlissel is detained by police shortly after the attack.    The march, which attracts thousands of participants, has long been a focus of tension between Israel\u2019s predominantly secular majority and the ultra-Orthodox Jewish minority, who object to homosexuality. While the event takes place annually without incident in the more gay-friendly business hub of Tel Aviv, in Jerusalem, where the religious population is more dominant, violence has erupted in the past.  Zoe Shoshei, aged 18, told the Guardian she was knocked over as the attacker stabbed a man she was talking to in the back. I saw him stab one man who was wearing heels and shorty shorts and the man I was talking to who was wearing ordinary clothes. He knocked me over. I saw he had a very big knife. He stabbed the man next to me in the back so hard it was, like, \u2018I hate you!\u2019\u201d Noah Singer, 17, added: \u201cHe did it so hard. He was running and stabbing.\u201d Another eyewitness, Ayala Baker, 20, said: \u201cWe were walking and singing. Then I heard a girl screaming really loudly. I turned and saw people running. I saw a guy running and the cops chasing him. I was really scared. There were people hurt. I saw his eyes. They were just filled with hate.\u201d Images in the Israeli media showed the moment that Schlissel, held down by several police, was arrested. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, condemned the attack \u201cas a most serious incident\u201d. \u201cIn the state of Israel, the individual\u2019s freedom of choice is one of basic values. We must ensure that in Israel, every man and woman lives in security in any way they choose. That\u2019s how we acted in the past and how we\u2019ll continue to act. I wish the wounded a speedy recovery,\u201d he said in a statement. Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, also quickly condemned the attack. \u201cWe came together today for a festive event, but the joy was shattered when a terrible hate crime occurred here in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel. People celebrating their freedom and expressing their identity were viciously stabbed.  \u201cWe must not be deluded: a lack of tolerance will lead us to disaster. We cannot allow such crimes, and we must condemn those who commit and support them. I wish the injured a full and speedy recovery.\u201d Schlissel, who lives in Modiin Ilit, a settlement in the West Bank, stabbed three participants in the 2005 gay pride march and was recently released from prison after serving 10 years of a 12-year sentence for attempted murder. According to Israeli media, after his release he had distributed handwritten pamphlets calling on \u201call Jews faithful to God\u201d to risk \u201cbeatings and imprisonment\u201d for the sake of preventing the parade. On Thursday, a Jerusalem police spokesman, Asi Ahroni, said there was a \u201cmassive presence\u201d of police securing the parade but \u201cunfortunately the man managed to pull out a knife and attack\u201d. The parade continued after the wounded were taken to a hospital, with protesters chanting, \u201cEnd the violence.\u201d Oded Fried, the head of a leading gay rights group, said the attack would not deter the movement. \u201cOur struggle for equality only intensifies in the face of such events,\u201d he said.

A smashed window, a flaming molotov cocktail, a whoosh of fire and piercing screams followed. Within minutes, the parents had crawled from the house with life-threatening third degree burns covering most of their bodies. Inside, four-year-old Ahmad was shrieking in fear and pain; his infant brother, Ali, just 18 months old, was dead or dying, his body burned beyond recognition.   Related: Palestinian child dead in suspected Jewish extremist arson attack on home    Within hours, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, condemned the attack \u2013 quickly attributed to extremist Israeli settlers \u2013 as an \u201cact of terrorism\u201d, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, denounced it as a \u201cwar crime\u201d, and the European Union and United Nations had demanded swift action to bring the perpetrators to justice. Thousands of Palestinians attended Ali\u2019s funeral and other protests in the West Bank, their anger fuelled by a litany of settler violence and intimidation. The family\u2019s home in Duma, near the Palestinian city of Nablus, was left blackened with soot and coated in ash, although graffiti left by the arsonists was still visible: \u201crevenge\u201d, \u201cprice tag\u201d and \u201clong live the Messiah\u201d were scrawled in Hebrew letters. According to witnesses, two men wearing black balaclavas firebombed the house just after 2am. Neighbour Ibrahim Dawabsheh, 23, a Palestinian construction worker in the nearby Jewish settlement Shilo, was talking to his fiancee on the phone on an upstairs balcony when he heard his neighbours\u2019 screams. \u201cI heard Saad [the husband] shouting: \u2018Help, they have slaughtered me.\u2019 I dropped the phone and rushed to their house,\u201d he told the Guardian.

I could hear him but I couldn\u2019t see him. I eventually pulled him out.\u201d  The four-year-old\u2019s legs were badly burned but he was alive. Ali was still inside the house. \u201cI put a cloth over my nose so that I could try to breathe, but the entire room was engulfed in flames and I couldn\u2019t go in to rescue him,\u201d recalled Ibrahim, in tears. Reham and Saad were carried into a neighbour\u2019s courtyard, with bedding fabric melted into their flesh. \u201cReham was naked, apart from the bed cover stuck to her back, my father ripped the cover off her and threw it outside,\u201d said Haneen Dawabsheh, 30, a cousin.   Related: Israeli government's talk is cheap on 'price tag' violence    Reham\u2019s lower legs had been pierced with glass after the fluorescent lights on the ceiling exploded. Trails of blood were still visible across the courtyard and inside their kitchen. \u201cI was holding her hand. The ambulance driver told me to keep talking to her so she didn\u2019t lose consciousness,\u201d said Haneen. \u201cI asked Reham what had happened and she said someone threw a burning bottle through the window.\u201d The couple were taken from Duma, travelling in a hatchback car with the glass smashed out of the boot to allow them to lie flat, to nearby Zatara junction where an ambulance took them to hospital in Nablus. According to Haneen, Reham did not know Ali had burned to death as she and her husband lay on the ground outside. \u201cI had to lie to her and tell her both her sons Ali and Ahmad were with us. I wanted to raise her spirits so she didn\u2019t give up. Then she asked me about her face and hair which were badly burned. I told her it wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d Meanwhile, the Palestinian fire brigade retrieved Ali\u2019s body, which they said was burned beyond recognition. Reham, Saad and Ahmad were transferred by the Israeli military to a hospital near Tel Aviv. Both adults had third degree burns over 80-90% of their bodies while Ahmad had burns over 60% of his. In a statement, Netanyahu said: \u201cI am shocked over this reprehensible and horrific act. This is an act of terrorism in every respect. The state of Israel takes a strong line against terrorism regardless of who the perpetrators are.\u201d He later visited the Dawabsheh family in hospital. \u201cWhen you stand next to the bed of this small child, and his infant brother had been so brutally murdered, we\u2019re shocked, we\u2019re outraged ... There is zero tolerance for terrorism wherever it comes from, whatever side of the fence it comes from, we have to fight it and fight it together,\u201d he said, adding that he had spoken with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. Abbas described the attack as a \u201cwar crime\u201d and said it would form part of the Palestinians\u2019 case against Israel at the International Criminal Court.

We must not permit such acts to allow hate and violence to bring more personal tragedies and to bury any prospect of peace. This reinforces the need for an immediate resolution of the conflict and an end to the occupation.\u201d           The White House condemned in the strongest possible terms on Friday the \u2018vicious\u2019 arson attack that killed an 18-month Palestinian baby    A spokesperson for the EU condemned the \u201ccold-blooded killing\u201d of the Palestinian infant and called for \u201czero tolerance for settler violence\u201d.  The Israeli army said it was searching for the perpetrators of the attack. \u201cThis attack against civilians is nothing short of a barbaric act of terrorism,\u201d said IDF spokesman Peter Lerner. By dusk, protests in Nablus were intensifying with Palestinians clashing with Israeli security forces. Earlier, around 2,000 people demonstrated in Hebron and about 1,000 took to the streets in neighbouring Jordan. Israeli police forbade men under the age of 50 from entering Jerusalem\u2019s Old City to pray at the Al-Aqsa mosque. Hamas called for a \u201cday of rage\u201d.  In the northern Gaza Strip one Palestinian man was killed and another wounded by Israeli gunfire after they approaced the border with Israel. Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said Mohammad Al-Masri died of his wounds after being shot near the border fence west of the Beit Lahiya area. Another man was in a moderate condition following the incident, Qudra said.  The arson attack was thought to be a \u201cprice tag\u201d revenge action in response to an Israeli move earlier this week to demolish two buildings in the West Bank settlement of Beit El. In recent years, extremist settlers have carried out numerous \u201cprice tag\u201d attacks on Palestinians and their property. The Israeli human rights group B\u2019tselem said extremist settlers were rarely brought to justice for such attacks, creating a climate of \u201cimpunity for hate crimes\u201d.", "publicationDate": "2015-07-31T16:51:30Z", "title": "Death of 18-month-old in arson attack heightens tensions in West Bank", "sentences": ["Reham, Saad and Ahmad were transferred by the Israeli military to a hospital near Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/31/death-18-month-old-in-arson-attack-heightens-tensions-west-bank-israel"}, {"tags": ["Essays", "Autobiography and memoir", "Fiction", "Short stories", "Books", "Culture", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "The title of the Israeli writer Etgar Keret\u2019s new collection of essays, The\u00a0Seven Good Years, comes from the biblical story of the Pharaoh\u2019s dream. One night, the Pharaoh has a\u00a0vision of\u00a0seven fat-fleshed cows and seven lean and ugly cows standing by a\u00a0river. Joseph, who is called on for an\u00a0interpretation, explains that seven years of\u00a0abundance are coming to Egypt, followed by seven years of famine. \u201cThe seven good years were the years in which I was able to be both son to\u00a0my father and father to my son,\u201d explains Keret. \u201cIt was a time at which I could look back and see my past, and look forward and see my future. That may be something trivial for most people, but for my parents, coming from this black hole of the Holocaust, that sense of continuation was a desire or fantasy, and I\u00a0guess that was projected on to me.\u201d The man whose zany, inventive short stories once earned him a reputation as\u00a0the enfant terrible of Israeli fiction is\u00a0now 47, and has the lightly grizzled look of middle age. He is also more serious than one might expect from his\u00a0writing. But then, The Seven Good Years feels very much like the work of a\u00a0writer coming to maturity. It begins with the birth of his son Lev in a hospital outside Tel Aviv \u2013 his wife\u2019s contractions slow down when all the nurses are called away to deal with the aftermath of a terrorist attack \u2013 and ends just after the death of his father from cancer. Is he\u00a0counting on seven bad years now? \u201cNot\u00a0bad, I hope, but slightly more difficult ones. Not last summer\u2019s war, but the war before that was the first one I went through being a parent and not having my father around, and it felt like a different experience. It was as if I\u2019d been moved to the frontline \u2013 the bodyguard who had always cushioned everything was not there any more.\u201d War has been the backdrop to Keret\u2019s life, just as it was for his parents, both of whom survived the Holocaust, his father by living for almost 600 days in a \u201chole in the ground\u201d outside a village in Poland. How did their experiences affect his childhood? \u201cMy childhood was not standard. Many things my parents did, I do not implement with my own child. They were always happy if I didn\u2019t go to school, for instance, because it was safer to be at home than in a public place.\u201d Having had to focus on survival themselves, they wanted their children to aim for richer lives, spiritually rather than materially. \u201cMy\u00a0father said to me, if in 30 years\u2019 time you are living in a big house, with a\u00a0beautiful wife, and that\u2019s all, I will be very disappointed.\u201d He needn\u2019t have worried: Keret and his brother and sister, to whom he devotes an essay each in the collection, are all idealists, albeit in very different ways. His brother is an anarchist activist who campaigns against biometric IDs from his adopted home in Thailand; his sister is an ultra-Orthodox mother of 11, who at one point lived in a settlement. Despite their contrasting life choices, the three siblings apparently remain close (though one senses that the words in the essay \u201cMy Lamented Sister\u201d are chosen particularly carefully). Keret himself wrote his first short story while serving in the Israeli military, and the comic, self-deprecating style of The Seven Good Years is infused with the melancholy knowledge that conflict is likely to be a constant for Lev, too. War in these essays isn\u2019t dramatic or heroic, but something akin to rain in the British summertime, just a\u00a0miserable backdrop against which the rest of\u00a0life is played out. Conversations with other parents at the playground veer from potty training to whether or not their toddlers will serve in the army; Keret persuades Lev to lie down during a rocket attack by inventing a game called \u201cpastrami sandwich\u201d. He and his wife respond to the seemingly imminent threat of an Iranian nuclear attack by taking out a loan to buy a flat-screen TV and putting off calling the plumber. While Keret\u2019s short-story collections The Nimrod Flip-Out and Missing Kissinger were compulsory reading for a\u00a0generation of Israeli backpackers, this\u00a0book is aimed squarely at overseas readers. There are no plans to publish it in Hebrew, or in Israel. This is partly because of the personal nature of the essays. \u201cI\u2019m very comfortable with fiction, because no matter how honest you are, you don\u2019t feel exposed. These essays felt like stories that you feel comfortable telling a stranger on\u00a0a train, but you wouldn\u2019t want to tell your friends and neighbours.\u201d Keret relates his move into non-fiction to becoming a parent. \u201cI wrote my first non-fiction piece on the day my son was born, and at first I\u00a0couldn\u2019t work out why this was\u00a0happening. I realised that if fiction is an exercise in ultimate freedom, non-fiction is about reflecting on my life and the way I act. Becoming a parent you go into a\u00a0different mode: you realise that your actions have consequences and that you should be held accountable for the things you do.\u201d   Related: Hillary Clinton condemns anti-Israel boycotts as 'counter-productive'    But there is another reason why The Seven Good Years will not be published in his home country: through the deceptively casual, light-hearted writing runs an urgent desire to communicate the Israeli reality to an outside world that insists on seeing everything about the nation and its people through the prism of ideology. \u201cI feel fortunate to spend a\u00a0lot of time overseas, to get perspectives on the situation that I live in, and to see that it\u2019s not that normal,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I talk about going to a maternity ward with my wife and all the medics are with people from a bombing, for an Israeli person that is so normal that it hardly merits any attention.\u201d Keret is clearly infuriated with the\u00a0position he finds himself in as a prominent liberal leftwing Israeli \u2013 he regularly writes opinion pieces on the conflict for both the Israeli and the international press \u2013 who is increasingly damned both by his nation, and by its international critics. \u201cI find myself being caught between a rock and a very hard place. During last summer\u2019s war I\u00a0was in Israel, writing against the government, writing against the Gaza war, receiving death threats for me and my wife and my child, and whenever I\u00a0would travel overseas I would go to places where people would say I\u2019m a\u00a0baby killer, I have blood on my hands. In Israel people would boycott me saying I\u2019m a traitor, and overseas people would boycott me because I\u2019m\u00a0Israeli.\u201d Keret says people tend to equate individual Israelis with their state, without pausing to find out what their views might be. \u201cWhen people say to me, we wouldn\u2019t want to do an event with you because you are Israeli, I say, \u2018you say that as a\u00a0British person whose nation bombed Iraq, a country you have no border with.\u2019\u201d He has come to\u00a0the conclusion that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has \u201csymbolic power\u201d, representing something more than the sum of its parts: outsiders find\u00a0something reassuring in\u00a0seeing it as a Star Wars scenario with clear-cut goodies and baddies, and resist the idea that the reality might be more complex. \u201cAlthough I sympathise with the Palestinians\u2019 fight, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m pro-Palestinian. I\u2019m not pro-Hamas, pro-gay persecution, pro-terrorist attack. The moment you [come down unequivocally as pro-Palestinian] you patronise them \u2013 it\u2019s like saying they don\u2019t deserve the ambiguity that we extend to other people.\u201d     Tel Aviv, where Keret is based. Photograph: Baz Ratner/Reuters    The ultimate expression of this mistaken attitude, for Keret, is the drive towards an intellectual or cultural boycott of Israel, such as the one signed up to by writers including Kamila Shamsie and Mike Leigh earlier this year. He argues passionately that a\u00a0boycott plays straight into the hands of the Israeli right wing. \u201cThe rightwing narrative constantly says that the outside world all hate us, they don\u2019t want any dialogue with us, because they are all closet antisemites. If you ask any Israeli rightwinger, they are all for an intellectual boycott.\u201d He believes that artists and writers will do most to bring about change by continuing to engage. \u201cI\u00a0think that, deep inside, the thing that attracts people to boycotts is that they are very easy. It is much more difficult to go and demonstrate every day in front of an embassy, in the rain, when barely any media comes to cover you. It\u2019s much easier to\u00a0stay at home and avoid dialogue.\u201d While some mildly political remarks from Bono at\u00a0a\u00a0concert in Tel Aviv received wide media coverage, Heret says: \u201cWhen people don\u2019t come to perform in Israel, nobody gives a\u00a0fuck. If you think that Netanyahu and\u00a0his religious fundamentalist government are going to end occupation because Elvis Costello doesn\u2019t come to perform then you have to be really naive.\u201d   Related: Suddenly, a Knock on the Door by Etgar Keret \u2013 review    Keret\u2019s own determination to make the case for compromise and negotiation has come at considerable personal cost. He describes Lev coming home from school one day, aged eight, and asking him to stop speaking publicly about his views. \u201cI said to him, why? And he said because we learned at school that everyone who wanted peace in this region got killed, Rabin, Sadat, even John Lennon got shot. He said, I\u00a0want peace too but more than that I\u00a0want to have parents.\u201d Explaining the situation to a child growing up in Israel is a constant challenge. In order to show Lev why the Palestinians object to checkpoints, Keret and his wife set one up in their living room. \u201cEvery time he passed he would have to answer a question. Why do you need to pass? He\u2019d say I need to pee, so I\u2019d say do you really need to pee? When was the last time you peed? And after two hours he said I know why Palestinians are fighting, I\u2019d fight too.\u201d In a similar way, The Seven Good Years brings the central conflict of our times \u2013 which can seem comfortingly remote \u2013 right into the living room. At some point, all parents have to have difficult conversations with their children about why the world is as it is; at some point we all put off calling the plumber. This is a vision of life in a war zone that readers everywhere can relate to. \u201cWhen you\u2019re living in other parts of\u00a0the world I don\u2019t think that raising a\u00a0child or answering the questions is any easier, but perhaps it\u2019s easier to push those big questions aside. We\u2019re all listening to the same music, but maybe in Israel \u2026 the volume is slightly louder.\u201d \u2022 Etgar Keret\u2019s The Seven Good Years is published by\u00a0Granta.", "publicationDate": "2015-08-01T06:30:03Z", "title": "Etgar Keret: \u2018Israelis boycott me as a traitor, and foreigners because I\u2019m Israeli\u2019", "sentences": ["It begins with the birth of his son Lev in a hospital outside Tel Aviv \u2013 his wife\u2019s contractions slow down when all the nurses are called away to deal with the aftermath of a terrorist attack \u2013 and ends just after the death of his father from cancer.", "The moment you [come down unequivocally as pro-Palestinian] you patronise them \u2013 it\u2019s like saying they don\u2019t deserve the ambiguity that we extend to other people.\u201d     Tel Aviv, where Keret is based.", "It\u2019s much easier to\u00a0stay at home and avoid dialogue.\u201d While some mildly political remarks from Bono at\u00a0a\u00a0concert in Tel Aviv received wide media coverage, Heret says: \u201cWhen people don\u2019t come to perform in Israel, nobody gives a\u00a0fuck."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/01/etgar-keret-books-interview-israel-the-seven-good-years"}, {"tags": ["Palestinian territories", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Gaza"], "article": "The three family members of a toddler burned alive in a West Bank arson attack on Friday are still in a critical condition with life-threatening injuries in a hospital near Tel Aviv. The fatal arson attack that left 18-month-old Ali Dawabsheh dead, believed to be carried out by Jewish settler extremists on Friday morning, has been called \u201cterror\u201d by both Israeli and Palestinian officials. The boy\u2019s mother Reham, 27, is in a critical condition after sustaining third-degree burns over up to 90% of her body in the fire that ravaged the family\u2019s four-bedroom home in Duma south-east of Nablus on the West Bank. Her husband Saad, 30, is also on life support at Soroka medical centre in Be\u2019er Sheva after suffering third degree burns on up to 80% of his body. Lee Gat, a spokeswoman for Sheba medical centre, the intensive care unit of Tel Hashomer Hospital, told the Guardian the three Dawabsheh family members were still alive but remained in a critical condition facing life-threatening wounds. Reham is facing the most serious wounds and is on life support. The least injured of the three family members is their four-year-old son Ahmad who suffered second-degree burns of his body and is at the same hospital as his mother. While the incident has been roundly condemned internationally it has generated widespread protest and violence across the West Bank and east Jerusalem. South of Nablus in nearby Duma, where the Dawabsheh infant died, settlers from the outpost of Esh Kodesh clashed with Palestinians. There were no reported injuries but according to reports Israeli forces arrived at the scene, cordoning it off and labelling it a \u201cclosed military zone\u201d.   Related: Israel\u2019s hawks can't dodge blame for this day of violence | Jonathan Freedland    Two Palestinians have been killed in the past 24 hours after the fatal arson attack. On Saturday morning a Palestinian youth was killed by Israeli forces in Ramallah in the wake of violent West Bank clashes that erupted after 18-month-old Dawabsheh was killed in an arson attack. According to Palestinian medical officials, Laith Fadel al-Khaladi, 17, from Jifna near Ramallah, died early on Saturday after he was shot by Israeli sniper fire during clashes at Atara checkpoint near Bir Zeit. The teenager was taken to a hospital in Ramallah where he died overnight. Earlier on Friday Mohammed al-Masri, also 17, from Gaza was killed by Israeli army fire as he reportedly approached the border fence during a youth protest against the arson attack. According to the Israeli Defence Force, soldiers fired twice at Palestinians approaching the border fence with Israel in the northern Gaza strip. The army said at first Palestinians approached the fence and were 30 metres away. Israeli soldiers tried to stop them getting closer by shooting into the air. The IDF said they then fired at two men who did not leave the area near the fence, claiming they aimed below their waistlines. The men then moved away from the fenced area separating Gaza and Israel. Israel forces fired a second round of ammunition after they said five Palestinians threw stones at the border fence. The IDF said they fired at the legs of the protesters. Mohammed al-Masri was killed during the second round of fire. Dozens of other Palestinians were injured in clashes across the West Bank on Friday. Another Palestinian youth in Hebron was shot in the leg during violent protests and another four were injured when the IDF fired tear gas and rubber bullets at stone-throwers near Halhul in the West Bank. Clashes broke out overnight in East Jerusalem. In Shuaafat refugee camp another Palestinian was seriously injured with a rubber-coated steel bullet allegedly fired at his head and another 11 were injured during clashes. In Beit Hanina fire bombs were thrown at Pisgat Ze\u2019ev, a Jewish settlement with over 50,000 residents.

Thousands of Israeli people took to the streets over the weekend to warn against a radicalised and violent fringe growing within the country, following the arson attack on a Palestinian family home in the West Bank by extremists and the stabbing of six people at a Jerusalem Gay Pride march by a suspect identified as an ultra-Orthodox Jew. One of those stabbed in Jerusalem, Shira Banki, 16, died as a result of her wounds on Sunday. She had been in critical condition since being stabbed in the back by a suspect, Yishai Shlissel, who carried out the attack just weeks after being released from a 10-year prison sentence for stabbing participants in the 2005 march. Signs held at the weekend protests read: \u201cHate kills\u201d and \u201cHomophobia and racism are the same violence\u201d. The Israeli defence minister, Moshe Ya\u2019alon, said on Sunday he had instructed the Shin Bet security service, police and military to apply \u201cadministrative detention\u201d on rightwing Jewish citizens suspected of involvement in terror attacks against Palestinians as a direct response to the firebombing in the West Bank village of Duma that left 18-month-old Ali Dawabsheh dead and critically injured his brother and parents.   Related: Death of 18-month-old in arson attack heightens tensions in West Bank    Israel currently applies administrative detention solely to Palestinians and its extension to Israelis reflects the government\u2019s frustration at the failure to track down the assailants. No suspects have been arrested in connection with Friday\u2019s arson attack and no group has claimed responsibility. A senior security official told Israeli Radio on Sunday: \u201cThere is no choice but to treat suspects of hate crimes against Palestinians the same way as Palestinian suspects of terror.\u201d Administrative detention allows for arrests without charges and enables the incarceration of suspects for undefined periods of time without sufficient evidence to try them. It theoretically allows investigators to gather evidence while preventing further attacks, but Israel has been accused of abusing the procedure to keep militants behind bars without trial. According to the Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem, 391 Palestinians were in detention without trial as of May. If enforced, the move will give Israeli officials far more leeway to arrest Jewish citizens suspected of being involved in the attack in Duma and potentially other \u201cprice tag\u201d attacks \u2013 where graffiti is left at the site of the attack \u2013 and other hate crimes against Palestinians.  \u201cAs always, each case of administrative detention will have to be approved by the courts, but by invoking this the minister is taking action consistent with his effort to exact the full measure of the law against these people,\u201d a spokesman for Ya\u2019alon told Reuters.   The separate attacks have put a spotlight on Jewish extremists, while the firebombing further inflamed tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, with clashes breaking out in various cities. Netanyahu condemned both attacks and called the firebombing \u201cterrorism\u201d \u2013 a word usually used by Israelis to refer to violence by Palestinians. On Sunday, he spoke of \u201czero tolerance\u201d for such acts. \u201cWe are determined to vigorously fight manifestations of hate, fanaticism and terrorism from whatever side,\u201d he said at the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday morning. But many have accused his government of failing to address the problem of Jewish extremism and of going dangerously far in its support for rightwing settler groups. Ali\u2019s uncle, Nasser Dawabsheh, called on the Israeli government to protect the Palestinian population in the West Bank in an address to a rally in Tel Aviv\u2019s Rabin Square on Saturday night. \u201cThey burned a family that was sleeping quietly, a family that does not believe in violence,\u201d he said.  \u201cNetanyahu expressed his condolences but we ask for protection for Duma and for other Palestinian villages. Why was Ali killed? He was 18 months old, what did he do? What did he do to the settlers? We ask that this [incident] mark the end of the suffering of our people.\u201d  Ali\u2019s grandfather Hussein, whose daughter Reham is still in a critical condition in Tel Hashomer hospital after sustaining third-degree burns over 90% of her body, told Israel Radio on Sunday morning that he did not want \u201cto enter another cycle of violence\u201d. He said four-year-old Ahmad\u2019s condition had improved and he had regained consciousness. In recent years there have been hundreds of cases of \u201cprice tag\u201d attacks and other incidents of settler violence, with almost no indictments filed \u2013 17 churches and mosques have been set ablaze by Jewish extremists in the past four years, yet not a single person has been arrested. Netanyahu last year rejected a proposal to deem perpetrators of \u201cprice tag\u201d attacks as members of a terrorist organisation and to allow for their administrative detention, but they were deemed to be \u201cillegal organisations\u201d, which gives security officials more authority to monitor suspects.  He implied at the time such measures were out of the question since it would mean Jewish terrorists were somehow comparable to terror groups such as Hamas or Islamic Jihad. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 August 2015 to correct the number of Palestinians believed by the Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem to be held in detention without trial", "publicationDate": "2015-08-02T15:29:34Z", "title": "Israel to detain Jewish terror suspects without trial", "sentences": ["Ali\u2019s uncle, Nasser Dawabsheh, called on the Israeli government to protect the Palestinian population in the West Bank in an address to a rally in Tel Aviv\u2019s Rabin Square on Saturday night."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/02/israel-to-detain-west-bank-arson-attackers-without-trial"}, {"tags": ["Basketball", "US sports", "Sport", "NBA", "Palestinian territories", "World news"], "article": "Outside of a gym on the edge of the glowing city, the Palestine\u2019s first professional basketball player is talking about about a dream. \u201cI am trying to prove to people in my country that I am trying to build something from nothing,\u201d Sani Sakakini says. That Sakakini has come from Ramallah on the West Bank to play basketball for a living is remarkable. That he\u2019s been able to do it for three seasons in China or fund a trip to the United States to impress European and hopefully NBA scouts is almost unfathomable. He is 26 and really has made this life from nothing.  His homeland is a place torn by decades of conflict. Much of the western world does not recognize Palestine as a state. Hope is a rare commodity. Few children dare to imagine lives in sports. There are few decent gyms or places to train and little support. Those players who do show skill see little future as an athlete. They have no reason to try.  Sakakini could have left, as other local sports stars have, accepting citizenship elsewhere in exchange for an easier path to a professional career. He chose to stay, returning to his family in the four-story home in which he grew up. He kept his citizenship because he wants to show others they can have their dreams too. He wants to do this not just through his own career but with the Palestinian territories\u2019 basketball team which he has helped to rebuild, recruiting players, pushing for improvements and begging for change. In three years, Palestine have gone from losing by 40 points to neighboring Middle Eastern countries to qualifying for next month\u2019s Asian Championship for the first time in their history.  \u201cHe is interested in doing what is the best for everyone,\u201d Palestine\u2019s basketball coach Jerry Steele, a former American college coach will later say. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t run off and left his people. He knows where he\u2019s from. He\u2019s been trying to help the people of Palestine and teach them the game. He\u2019s trying to change a culture.\u201d Sakakini is excited about the Asian Championship. The qualification, which included victories over Syria and Iraq and a narrow loss to regional power Lebanon, is a sign his desire is making an impact on others. At 6ft 9in and 220lbs, he\u2019s a center trapped in a forward\u2019s body, but he has stretched his game to achieve his goals of pulling Palestine into basketball prominence, transforming himself into a shooter, a rebounder, a ball-handler \u2013 anything in order to win. \u201cI love my country,\u201d he says.  He stretches in a chair outside the gymnasium. The gym is located at a high school and is the site of the Korean Basketball League\u2019s tryout and draft. He is at the tryout only because he was invited based on his performance in China where he was the league\u2019s third-leading rebounder two years ago. Since he was already in Las Vegas to take part in camps for European scouts he came to the Korean tryouts, figuring the games would provide good competition and increase his exposure (he played professionally in Lebanon this past season). But he will not stay for the draft. He has a flight home, he wants to prepare for the Asian Championship.   Related: What happens in Vegas ... the strange world of the Korean Basketball League draft    \u201cIt\u2019s all been self-made with him,\u201d former University of Minnesota guard Jamal Abu-Shamala, a player Sakakini talked into playing on the Palestine team, will say. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s had someone saying to him: \u2018This is what you are to do.\u2019 He\u2019s very charismatic. When he talks the players listen. I think they see how he\u2019s become.\u201d ****  Sakakini lights up when talking about his basketball life. He describes his transformation from a post player to someone who can drive the lane and dunk. He loves to tell the story of how he hired a trainer last summer in Los Angeles and that trainer put him together with Pau Gasol for a workout. He says he played well against Gasol that day even as the Bulls center towered over him at 7ft. \u201cHe is soooooo tall,\u201d Sakakini says. But Sakakini is more reticent when it comes to his world away from basketball. He doesn\u2019t talk a great deal about his family or childhood other than to say his father was a basketball coach and that he fell in love with the game while watching the NBA on television, promising to himself that someday he was going to be one of those players on the screen. He played in the Palestinian territories\u2019 club conference, considered by outsiders to be as sophisticated as a YMCA league and got a break as a teenager when a chance came to go to Applied Science University in Jordan and play professionally for Riyadi Aramex in the country\u2019s top division. Attempts to ask about what it was like growing up surrounded by conflict do not draw a detailed response. Answers to such questions are brief and usually don\u2019t go into more detail beyond: \u201cIt was hard.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure his work-ethic is from what he dealt with growing up, but he doesn\u2019t say much about it,\u201d Abu-Shamala says. \u201cIt struck me that Sani has found an opportunity in basketball and run with it.\u201d As Sakakini sits outside the gym in Las Vegas, he chuckles at the irony of living in a part of the West Bank just 30 minutes from Israel\u2019s legendary basketball power, Maccabi Tel Aviv. He would be one of the best players on that team, maybe in the whole Israeli professional league, but neither Maccabi nor any other team in Israel will sign a Palestinian. Geographically, he lives on the borders of Tel Aviv. In reality, he lives in another world. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d he says. Then he shrugs. He does not sound angry. His voice is flat and emotionless. It\u2019s simply recognition of how things are. Had he been born 20 miles away with the same basketball dream he would have had access to good coaches and trainers. He might have played at an American college and maybe been seen by the NBA, instead he was born on the wrong side of the line for opportunity. The endless conflict rages on. Walls keep going up. Basketball can\u2019t break them down. \u201cI can\u2019t talk for everyone, I can only talk for me, I want to live in peace,\u201d Sakakini says, his one political thought in a half-hour conversation. \u201cThis conflict, this fight it\u2019s not for us. I mean if we keep like this we are going to all die. No one\u2019s going to live in 1,000 years, so if you are going to live 60, 70, 80, 90 years just live in peace and go wherever you want and enjoy the life. I\u2019m a peace guy. I\u2019m peaceful, I want everybody to be happy, I want everybody to be OK.\u201d If only it could be so simple. A few months ago, he says, a sports writer in Israel wrote a column about him. The writer expressed dismay that a player so good was on the West Bank and not in Israel where he could play for the Israeli national team.  \u201cI mean our situation is tough, it\u2019s really tough,\u201d Sakakini says. \u201cI hope we have an open country where we can go and people can come to us. That would make it easier for me \u2013 make it easier for everyone. Because sports not only [just] sports. Sports is bigger. People come to watch, people they come and spend money on the players. It\u2019s like a big thing, it\u2019s a business now.\u201d ****     Two teams face off during a basketball match in Bethlehem \u2013 the sport is growing in the Palestinian territories.  Photograph: Mahmoud illean/Demotix/Corbis    Jerry Steele never meant to coach Palestine. Based in Phoenix, he uses sports to help children in urban neighborhoods through his Christian ministry Make A Difference. A few years ago, he was asked to run clinics in Palestine. While there, a sports official wondered if he would coach Palestine in an upcoming tournament. Steele asked when the tournament started. The man said \u201cnext week\u201d. Steele tried to explain that he couldn\u2019t possibly walk cold onto a team of players he had never met and coach against teams he had never seen. The official didn\u2019t understand. Steele was a basketball coach wasn\u2019t he? They had a team and they needed a coach. Steele refused. The next year, the Palestinian officials asked again. Realizing the team had no leadership and would accomplish nothing if he didn\u2019t accept, Steele said yes.  In many ways, the job was thankless. The team was a mess, with no structure, no organization, ant not even an understanding among most of the players that they needed to practice before they played games. Among the first things Steele demanded upon taking the job was a gym for workouts. After much pleading, he was promised a government gymnasium and given times it would be available for the team\u2019s use. When Steele and the players arrived at the prescribed time, the gym was locked and no one was there. The Palestinian territories\u2019 basketball program had been stifled by an \u201cEastern honor-shame\u201d mentality, Steele says. Rather than try and fail, people feel it is better to simply not try. The one player he inherited who rebelled against such thinking was the bearded center who wanted desperately to win. Together they set out to create a real basketball team with Sakakini absorbing the first real coaching he had in his country and Steele leaning on his best player to bring in more talent. Salakini came hard at Abu-Shamala whose father had been born in Gaza. Having grown up in Minnesota, Abu-Shamala didn\u2019t even know the Palestinian territories had a national team until he played against them during a brief stint with the Jordan team. All he remembered from that game was winning by 50 points. \u201cSani said: \u2018We will have me and you and we can go from there,\u2019\u201d says Abu-Shamala. A few more players with Palestinian heritage were found in Canada and slowly Steele has been able to build a team. But change is slow. Facilities are a mess. The local league, where Sakakini has to play point guard, does not challenge good players. Few young people believe basketball can make a difference when they have so little to look forward to. \u201cIt\u2019s not much different than we see with urban kids [in the US],\u201d Steele says. \u201cSomething that is taught to kids [in American cities] is that they are victims and since they are victims they are limited in what they are able to achieve. And because they are victims and are limited in what they can achieve they are entitled to have someone help them because they are victimized. \u201cThe Palestinians see themselves as victims, they point the finger at Israel.\u201d Steele describes himself as \u201capolitical\u201d. He said he coaches youth football in Israel along with basketball in the Palestinian territories, meaning he is the rare outsider who works on both sides of the wall. He says he wants the Palestinian players to understand they don\u2019t need to feel downtrodden, that they can make something great from the rubble.  \u201cWhen I got there I said: \u2018Let\u2019s not focus on who we hate, what are we going to do with what we have?\u2019\u201d  They did this in May\u2019s Asian Championship qualifier. Before the tournament Steele asked his center to focus on rebounding. Sakakini scored 34 points and had 17 rebounds against Syria and then 35 and 21 in the win over Iraq. \u201cHe carried us,\u201d Abu-Shamala says. And yet even with this success, with a star player finally drawing international attention, Steele finds change so hard. He has been trying for weeks to convince the sports federation officials to meet for a series of practices before the Asian Championships. The tournament starts on 23 September. So far the officials don\u2019t understand why Palestine needs to practice before a huge competition where the winner gets an Olympic bid.  \u201cI\u2019m telling you this is what Sani is up against,\u201d Steele says. \u201cHe\u2019s banging his head against the wall.\u201d **** Given what existed in the West Bank as Sakakini was growing up \u2013 the dysfunction and the lack of a sports ambition \u2013 he is an anomaly. How did he do this? How did he turn himself into a professional basketball player, travelling the world, working to make Palestine\u2019s national team respectable? How did he even know what to do?  \u201cI say: [it\u2019s] just pure determination and enough intelligence to know that it wasn\u2019t going to happen if he stayed in Palestine,\u201d Steele says.  As a child, Sakakini used to tell people he was going to become a basketball player. He remembers the response was always the same. Smirks and eye-rolls. \u201cEveryone was like: \u2018Oh yeah, OK,\u2019 because no one played professional basketball in our country so they don\u2019t get too excited about that,\u201d Sakakini says. \u201cI just put it in my mind [to] just keep pushing hard from when I was young.\u201d He still hopes for the NBA even as his age and the fact he is what Steele and other basketball people call \u201ca tweener\u201d (too short to be a center, too slow to be a forward) make the NBA seem unlikely. His plan is to keep building his basketball credibility in the Asian Championship and whatever professional league he plays in this winter, then return here to Las Vegas next July and play in the NBA\u2019s summer league. He is sure that if he gets into the summer league someone in the NBA will want him.

She has\u00a0dual identity as a\u00a0thoroughly anglicised woman who is\u00a0also a staunch Palestinian nationalist, adept at presenting the Palestinian case to a\u00a0western audience. Karmi\u2019s academic books on the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict do not add significantly to the voluminous literature on the subject. Her autobiographical works, however, provide a unique perspective on the Palestinian predicament. She is at her very best when she writes about herself. In Search of Fatima was a beautifully written and moving narrative of her displacement from Jerusalem in 1948 set against the backdrop of the major political events that shaped the course of modern Palestinian history. Return is both a sequel and a standalone memoir. On display is the same fluent writing style, the psychological insight and the outstanding skill for mixing the personal with the political. In 2005, Karmi returned to her homeland not as a tourist but as a\u00a0consultant to the ministry of media and communications of the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah. She wanted to\u00a0be at the heart of things, to be part of\u00a0the community, to make her contribution to state-building. But the actual experience she records in this memoir is one of pretty comprehensive disappointment and disillusion. The reader is invited to see through her eyes\u00a0this angst-filled, rollercoaster journey. Working for the PA turned out to be at once exhilarating and exhausting. It\u00a0behaved as if it were the government of a state, with departments of finance, transport, education, health, etc; but, in reality, everything in the Palestinian occupied territories was controlled by Israel. By being on the inside, Karmi became aware of the\u00a0profound and pervasive impact of\u00a0Israeli power. She\u00a0places both Israel and the PA under\u00a0an\u00a0harsh lens. The PA, she argues, assumed the trappings of a\u00a0sovereignty over its lands while in reality it was subservient to the occupying power in\u00a0every sense and at every level. With practically no\u00a0sources of income of its\u00a0own, it is heavily dependent on foreign aid from a variety of places. To\u00a0Karmi\u2019s way of\u00a0thinking, the PA\u2019s only honourable path is to abandon its\u00a0empty, posturing display of power and to assume its proper role as the leadership of a people under colonial occupation. The picture painted by her of the inner workings of her ministry is unflattering in the extreme, verging on\u00a0the surreal. The ministry existed in a\u00a0bubble of its own, paralysed by internal rivalries and petty bureaucratic infighting. Most of her colleagues saw her as a bossy and arrogant outsider and thwarted her at every turn. She looked with horror on the many Palestinian opportunists and time-servers who betrayed the ideals of the revolution although they brandished them whenever it was expedient. So the return to\u00a0Palestine produced not a\u00a0sense of solidarity in the struggle for\u00a0the common cause but rather bitterness and alienation. Wherever the well-intentioned doctor went, she was out of place: too Palestinian in Britain and too British in\u00a0Palestine.     \u2018Most of her colleagues saw her as a bossy and arrogant outsider and thwarted her at every turn\u2019 \u2026 Ghada Karmi. Photograph: Marco Secchi/Getty Images    Karmi\u2019s entire life had centred on the fundamental facts of the catastrophe of 1948, from which all else was derivative. By her own estimation, she is one of the custodians of Palestinian history. So\u00a0it came as a bit of a shock to\u00a0discover that for the\u00a0Palestinians in\u00a0the occupied territories, people like her are irrelevant, far\u00a0removed from the immediate reality of\u00a0the extraordinarily harsh conditions imposed on them by the Israelis, their army and\u00a0their settlements. It was not that the past was another country. But the\u00a0locals were more preoccupied with the daily struggle for survival against a\u00a0brutal oppressor than with the grand Palestinian narrative of the past. In her travels through the occupied territories, Karmi saw nothing to lift her spirits. The worst blot on the landscape was the so-called \u201csecurity barrier\u201d that the Israelis are building on\u00a0the West Bank in flagrant violation of international law. Israel\u2019s transgressions against the Palestinians were nothing new to her. She had been campaigning against them since 1971. Surely, she thought, the wall was but another addition to a long, unsavoury \u00a0 symbol of something indefinably cruel; a naked expression of Israeli entitlement. Its\u00a0brazen message to the world was: \u201cThis country was Israel\u2019s and Israel\u2019s alone, to settle, loot, divide, carve up, refashion, rename, and do with whatever it pleased.\u201d In the Gaza Strip, Karmi saw nothing but a spectrum of despair. The dire situation in Gaza was of Israel\u2019s making, created out of deliberate impoverishment and violence. It was a cruel social experiment in isolating almost half the\u00a0population of Palestine, with far-reaching consequences for the society as a whole. Extremism, escapism, fanaticism and conspiracy theories thrive in such environments, and Gaza is prey to all of these. At one end of the\u00a0scale of despair, Karmi saw suspicious, inward-looking people, averse to\u00a0strangers; at\u00a0the other end, she saw\u00a0people enveloped in their cosy vision of a triumphant Islam that would vanquish their enemies. The wonder for Karmi was not that Gaza was caving in to narrow-mindedness and extreme religiosity but that, despite its depredations, it was still on\u00a0its feet and fighting to stay alive. Karmi\u2019s core belief throughout her adult life had been that the crime committed by Israel against the Palestinians in 1948 would somehow have to\u00a0be redressed, that the dispossessed Palestinian nation must one day return to its country. Despite the defeatism of\u00a0the Palestinian official stance and the indifference of many of the Palestinians around her, Karmi never doubted the rightness of her position. But following her return to Palestine, her core belief in that certainty began to falter. Her time there taught her that two fundamentals she had always believed in had been transformed out of all recognition: there was no national cause any more and no unified national struggle for return. She looked back on her whole assignment in \u201cPalestine\u201d and realised that she had achieved none of her aims because that would never have been possible in the Palestine that she found. She had travelled to the land of her birth with a sense of return, but it was a\u00a0return to the past, to the Palestine of\u00a0a distant memory, not to the dismal present place. Karmi\u2019s journey filled her with bitterness and grief. She remembers looking down on a night-time Tel Aviv from the windows of a plane that took her back to London and thinking to herself: \u201cFlotsam and jetsam, that\u2019s what we have become, scattered and divided. There\u2019s no room for us or our memories here. And it won\u2019t ever be reversed.\u201d This is a depressing conclusion to a profoundly depressing book. One puts it down with sympathy for the conflicted chronicler and a better appreciation of the formidable obstacles that remain on the road to Palestinian independence and statehood. \u2022 Avi Shlaim\u2019s The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World is published by Penguin.

It\u2019s not as if that team exists any more.   Watford   It is traditional for a promoted club, however impressive they looked in securing their Premier League spot, to do a fair amount of business before their season in the spotlight. They will ordinarily add a bit of top-flight experience \u2013 most commonly by picking the pockets of one of the freshly relegated trio \u2013 then look abroad for perhaps one retirement-approaching heavily garlanded international mercenary, and seal a season-long loan deal for a promising member of Chelsea\u2019s reserve side. The core of the team who kick off the season in the top flight, however, will also have been there when the final whistle blew on the previous campaign. In last season\u2019s Premier League, players who had also been involved in the club\u2019s promotion made 66.75% of all league starts at QPR, 71.77% at Leicester, and 80.86% at Burnley. For a manager, meanwhile, promotion may not secure long-term job security but it can normally be assumed the achievement will give him at the very least a chance to establish the team and his reputation in their new surroundings. Under the ownership of Gino Pozzo, whose family have previously led Udinese in Italy and Granada in Spain to promotion and successful consolidation, Watford have not only ripped up this rule book, they have made origami monkeys with it, then set fire to them and eaten the ashes with fava beans and a nice Chianti. First they looked at the squad who secured second place in the Championship last season \u2013 missing out on the title only because of a last-minute Sheffield Wednesday equaliser on the final day. It included three strikers who between them had scored 57 goals in the league alone, as well as a defence with the fifth-best record in the division. In all 27 players contributed to the promotion campaign and remained on the club\u2019s books at its conclusion, and the owners made a list of those they considered good enough to be first-choice picks in the new-look, top-flight side. When they had finished, the list had two names on it. Then they had to deal with the manager. Slavisa Jokanovic had arrived in November, famously the fourth permanent manager of the season, and had galvanised a team who had frequently underwhelmed into co-victors in the most closely fought promotion campaign of recent years. Although his contract expired at the end of last season, the intention was for Jokanovic to be in charge at least for the start of the new campaign \u2013 but first they had to thrash out a deal. They offered him a considerable increase on his basic salary, with a seven-figure bonus if the club\u2019s top-flight status were secured for a second season; he demanded the proposed salary be doubled. The club called his bluff, and he now manages Maccabi Tel Aviv. What has followed is not so much a facelift as major reconstructive surgery. So overwhelmingly different does the side now appear, if they pull this off it will make Ronald Koeman\u2019s achievements with a thoroughly remodelled Southampton side last season appear humiliatingly ho-hum.     Heurelho Gomes is one of the few players in the Watford squad that won promotion considered by the club to be unequivocally ready for the top flight. Photograph: Jason Brown/JMP/Rex Shutterstock    At the helm now is Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, who took Valencia to the Champions League quarter-final in 2007, when they lost to Chelsea, and won the Europa League with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2010, when they beat Fulham in the final. He has had a peripatetic career, most recently managing Al Ahli and Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates, and spending six weeks at Getafe earlier this year but his pedigree is hard to question. He will need all of his nous to fashion a group of players unfamiliar not just to him but to each other into a cohesive whole \u2013 though of course the same was said of Gianfranco Zola when he arrived with a coachload of recruits in the summer of 2012, and he immediately guided the team to third in the Championship, missing out on automatic promotion in bizarre circumstances on the final day of the season. The existing squad have not exactly been cast aside \u2013 several have signed new contracts and the striker Matej Vydra, previously a loanee, has made his move permanent. A few \u2013 most notably the midfielders Almen Abdi and Ben Watson, centre-backs Gabriele Angella and Craig Cathcart, the Scotland winger Ikechi Anya and strikers Odion Ighalo and Vydra \u2013 are likely to make fairly regular appearances this season. But the only ones considered unequivocally top flight ready are the goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes, who despite occasional heart-in-the-mouth moments was unrecognisable last season from the calamitous carnival of blunders Tottenham fans will no doubt remember, and the striker and captain Troy Deeney. And so the other positions \u2013 with the team likely to start the season in a 4-2-3-1 formation \u2013 were gradually filled. The Greece left-back Jos\u00e9 Holebas arrived from Roma for \u00a31.8m, the centre-backs Sebastian Pr\u00f6dl, a free-transfer from Werder Bremen, and Miguel Britos, whose transfer was part of the deal that took the Udinese midfielder Allan to his previous club, Napoli, followed, with the Cameroon right-back Allan Nyom joining from Udinese (though he never played for them, and spent the past six seasons on loan at Granada). The defensive midfield slots were filled by Valon Behrami, once of West Ham, and \u00c9tienne Capoue, a club-record \u00a36m arrival from Tottenham. Jos\u00e9 Jurado, who flourished under S\u00e1nchez Flores at Atl\u00e9tico, has been reunited with his former manager after signing from Spartak Moscow, and will play off the striker, while the left-footed AZ winger Steven Berghuis turned down PSV in favour of Hertfordshire. (His father Frank, a former PSV winger, memorably said of the deal: \u201cWhen it comes to Watford you don\u2019t immediately say \u2018wow\u2019. However, you do say \u2018wow\u2019 when it comes to the money.\u201d) There remains space for one more wide player \u2013 the club are yet to abandon their pursuit of Genoa\u2019s Diego Perotti, even though the Argentinian rejected their advances when a fee was agreed in June. They would also like to sign another striker, going so far as to agree personal terms with Blackburn\u2019s Rudy Gestede earlier this summer. In the end Watford decided to complete the deal only if they could sell one of the four forwards they already employ, ideally Fernando Forestieri (though Ighalo\u2019s 23 goals in his last 24 appearances have not been enough to guarantee him a future at Watford either), and Gestede joined Aston Villa instead.     Valon Behrami, right, is among the many players signed by Watford this summer. Photograph: Alex Morton/Reuters    What this all adds up to is a giant swamp of uncertainty but for all that there is no lack of optimism. Promotion was no fluke: Watford had a fearsome squad in the Championship, one who, unlike Norwich and Bournemouth, flourished not because of one inspirational manager but despite a succession of fairly average ones, and they have since been massively strengthened. Given the quality of some of the teams who avoided relegation from last season\u2019s Premier League, and of Watford\u2019s\u2019 fellow promotees, it seems puzzling bookmakers and journalists (including ourselves, to be fair) appear united in forecasting unmitigated failure. Still, this pessimism is yet to spread to the home support, the Pozzo family\u2019s achievements at Udinese and Granada \u2013 and in the past three years at Watford \u2013 having led fans to accept that they probably know what they are doing. One interesting curiosity: when Watford were first promoted to the top flight, in 1982, their first five fixtures were \u2013 in alphabetical order \u2013 against Everton, Manchester City, Southampton, Swansea and West Bromwich Albion. On their return this season, their first five fixtures will be \u2013 in alphabetical order (and you can tell where this is heading) \u2013 against Everton, Manchester City, Southampton, Swansea and West Bromwich Albion. If that run somehow ends as it did the last time they went through it \u2013 with four wins, 12 points and the club top of the league \u2013 everyone else may as well burn their rule books too.", "publicationDate": "2015-08-06T12:00:06Z", "title": "Premier League 2015-16 preview No18: Watford", "sentences": ["The club called his bluff, and he now manages Maccabi Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/aug/06/premier-league-preview-watford"}, {"tags": ["Champions League", "Manchester United", "Celtic", "Club Brugge", "Monaco", "CSKA Moscow", "Rapid Vienna", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Club Brugge  2014-15: Belgian League runners-up; Europa League quarter-finals Michel Preud\u2019homme\u2019s team fell short in their domestic championship play-offs last season as the burden of competing on three fronts took its toll CSKA Moscow   2014-15: Russian League runners-up; Champions League group stage CSKA have won their first three domestic league games and their spirits will be high after coming from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at Sparta Prague in the last round   Related: Champions League qualifiers: Ajax knocked out by Rapid Vienna in thriller    Lazio   2014-15: Italian League third place Lazio reached the Coppa Italia final last term as well as sealing a top-three league position.

In the 2000s, the city was often ridiculed for its flashy but cheap look with lots of bling. Today the youthful city is finally embracing diversity.

The comedians started with rather unambitious gatherings in Vilnius, but they soon got the attention of Lithuania\u2019s TV producers. In addition to touring Lithuanian towns and main emigre destinations (notably the UK and Norway), the comedians also organise visits of their favourite stand-up comedy stars to Lithuania.

But when I heard, I went back to my room.\u201d Aldridge stayed there for the night, reassuring panicked friends and family back home that he was OK. \u201cIf there are more attacks in the next year then it might affect tourism,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I passed the scene on the way here.\u201d No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Hindu shrine, a popular attraction for Thais and other Asian visitors. The shrine is dedicated to the Hindu god Brahma but is also popular among Thailand\u2019s Buddhists and Chinese tourists.           Tourists and visitors react to the blast on Monday night     The prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, said the attack was \u201cthe worst incident that has ever happened in Thailand\u201d, adding that those responsible \u201cwant to destroy our economy, our tourism\u201d. He added: \u201cThey want to destroy our economy, our tourism.\u201d It is unclear if that will happen. Many tourists only stay overnight in the capital before heading out to the islands. But the stakes are high, with tourism accounting for 10% of GDP. Chan Jin Lai, an Asia analyst at BMI Research, said the explosions at a tourism hotspot in the heart of Bangkok could undermine the recovery in tourism, deepening the country\u2019s economic woes.  \u201cThe Thai economy is rather fragile and is still recovering from the impact of the political turmoil that ended following a military coup that was staged in May 2014,\u201d Chan said. \u201cThe acceleration in government spending and the recovery in the tourism sector are among the few bright spots supporting the economy.\u201d    Tourists speak to media at the Bangkok bomb site pic.twitter.com/WDCpChNvL9&mdash; Oliver Holmes (@olireports) August 18, 2015    At the scene of the blast on Tuesday, the streets were mostly empty except for police and journalists. A few tourists looked on from the above-ground walkway of the metro. Opposite, the Central World mall was open and security officials were checking bags. Inside, the luxury clothing shops were open but there were few customers. A few hundred metres up the road, however, the Siam Paragon mall was fairly busy. Thais and tourists were using its cafes and Sea Life Bangkok Ocean World was accepting customers. Marik Foudijs, a 24-year-old backpacker from Holland, was searching for some breakfast on the last day of his six-week tour. He heard about the bomb when his brother texted to ask if he was OK. \u201cIt won\u2019t affect the backpackers but maybe families with small children will decide not to come,\u201d he said.  Staying on the Khaosan Road, the epicentre of the country\u2019s backpacking trade, Foudijs said he was surprised the bars and restaurants stayed open all night. \u201cIt was kind of scary. The military were there, army vehicles. But locals just said it was safe.\u201d Zahi, 37, from Tel Aviv, walked through the mall pushing his son in a pram, a Sea Life bag hanging from the handle. He said his family walked directly into the blast site on Monday evening by mistake. \u201cAs Israelis, we are used to bomb attacks. But the Thais are not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not exactly clear what was going on. We were trying to get to the shopping mall but if we had known there had just been a bomb attack, we would have gone away.\u201d He saw wounded people in the street and said people in the nearby mall appeared oblivious. Thailand has experienced increased violence in recent years. The military junta took over last year in a coup that followed months of bloody protests. Thousands have been killed in the south during a separatist insurgency. However, Monday\u2019s indiscriminate attack in the centre of the capital, with its high death toll of foreigners, is unprecedented in recent memory. \u201cIf the attacks continue a second and third time, then the tourism industry will be affected,\u201d said Zahi. \u201cOtherwise, it won\u2019t impact it.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-08-18T13:34:29Z", "title": "Tourists return to Bangkok blast area amid fears for vital industry", "sentences": ["But locals just said it was safe.\u201d Zahi, 37, from Tel Aviv, walked through the mall pushing his son in a pram, a Sea Life bag hanging from the handle."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/18/tourists-return-to-bangkok-blast-area-amid-fears-for-vital-industry"}, {"tags": ["Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Bashar al-Assad", "United Nations", "Russia", "Europe", "Iran", "Human rights", "Law", "Iraq war inquiry", "Military"], "article": "We, as concerned academics, legal, humanitarian and media professionals, condemn the Syrian government\u2019s grotesque massacre in its aerial bombardment of a well-known and busy market in the Damascus suburb of Douma on Sunday 16 August 2015. As we write the killing continues. We call on the UK government to condemn this act and to demand, as per UN resolutions, that the Syrian government immediately and unconditionally stop bombing its civilian population. The death toll has reached over 100 \u2013 among them women and children \u2013 with at least 200 injured and maimed by the bombings. The UN\u2019s own humanitarian chief, Stephen O\u2019Brien, was in Damascus pushing for more humanitarian access with the Syrian government just before these indiscriminate bombings took place. Such utter contempt for international conventions by a so-called state actor reaffirms, if any further evidence were needed, that the Syrian government long ago relinquished any claim to legitimacy or sovereign power and should be expelled from the UN altogether. The UN must urgently consider carrying out its chronically underfunded humanitarian work in Syria without having to pander to Bashar al-Assad\u2019s security forces via the ministry of the interior.   Related: Western bombs will not stop Isis in Syria | Letters    Assad\u2019s killing machine has become the norm \u2013 and our silence makes us complicit in his crimes. The media has focused on the vile crimes of Isis, yet the overwhelming majority of Syrians continue to be killed and maimed by the Syrian government, which drops crude barrel bombs on the towns and cities that bravely rose up against tyranny and dared to demand their political rights in 2011. As the Palestinian liberation struggle shows us, it is never acceptable, and is illegal under international law, to bomb civilian areas or to collectively punish populations. No government should be allowed to pursue their political opponents by indiscriminate bombing. We also urge all involved governments to desist from the pointless bombing of civilians in so-called Isis territory, which results in more misery, and instead to intensify all avenues of diplomatic pressure on Iran and Russia to stop propping up the Syrian government and providing it with manpower, loans, weapons and military hardware. Besieged Syrians in rebel-controlled Douma have continued to maintain their dignity, while the Syrian government wilfully ignored the unanimous UN Resolution 2139 (2014) adopted by the security council (and reaffirmed in the UNSC meeting on 18 August 2015) calling for unfettered humanitarian access to allow food and medical supplies to flow. Once again Syrians are reduced to picking up the mangled body parts of their children from the rubble.

This is their revolution. The Assad regime was responsible for starting this devastating war by a brutal military response to peaceful demonstrations by the people of Homs who were asking for reforms following the arrest and torture of schoolchildren in Daraa for spraying anti-government graffiti on a school wall. The armed struggle that followed was led by young and middle-aged men in Homs who accepted/bought guns from anyone/anywhere in order to defend themselves and their city. Many arms came from army deserters who brought their guns with them, or were stolen from military compounds. Under siege they asked for help from the west because Russia and Iran were supplying Assad with everything he asked for. Nothing that was sent to the revolutionaries was effective against regime\u2019s tanks and fighter jets. This revolution has been taken away from the Syrian people not only by western interference, but also by Russia and Iran. To not even mention this is puzzling. It does nothing to help the millions of Syrian civilians still suffering both outside and inside Syria, after almost five years of war with no end in sight. The Assad regime has imploded and is now run by Iran. Yes, western interference has \u201cplayed a crucial role in Syria\u2019s destruction\u201d, but there are millions of Syrians who need our support, not dismissive political one-liners.

The latest figures compiled from various sources, including Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, place the pro-government casualties at 139,525 versus anti-government loss of 135,000.Mohammad Abdul QaviLondon \u2022 I find the inability to publish the findings of the Chilcot inquiry forthwith reprehensible. With the second anniversary of the gas attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta this Friday, which killed upwards of 1,000 innocent civilians, many politicians used the disaster of the 2003 invasion of Iraq as a reason for inertia after this massacre. As one who served in both Gulf wars and tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and having been into Syria a number of times in the last two years, I can say that Syria is nothing like Iraq in 1990 or 2003. The inaction by the international community post-Ghouta has put us in a position where upwards of 300,000 are dead, over 5 million refugees, including 1.5 million seeking shelter in the UK and Europe, Assad still in power and the so-called Islamic State controlling vast tracts of Iraq and Syria. Military action after Ghouta, as requested by President Obama would, in my opinion, have put us in a much better place today. Parliament, we are told, will vote on extending action to defeat Isis in Syria shortly, and this \u201cfight of our generation\u201d, which we can\u2019t afford to lose, cannot be corrupted by so-called mistakes of 2003. If there are statesmen, politicians and civil servants who are criticised by Chilcot, so be it. We live in a democracy and they should not be able to hide behind legalese to prevent their misjudgments and failings being public. We owe this to my comrades we left on the battlefields of Iraq, whose families now rightly seek closure, and to this nation, to ensure we are not fighting Isis on the streets of Britain for the next 10 years.Hamish de Bretton-Gordon (Col Retd)Shaftesbury, Dorset", "publicationDate": "2015-08-19T19:22:13Z", "title": "The world must act to stop Syria\u2019s suffering | Letters", "sentences": ["The international community has lost its moral compass and as a matter of principle for our humanity, not only for the Syrians who have been abandoned in this conflict, we must act to find it.Dr Miriyam Aouragh Leverhulme fellow, Communication Media Research Institute, University of WestminsterDr Sune Haugbolle Associate professor, global studies and sociology, Roskilde UniversityDr Rupert Read Reader, School of Politics, Philosophy, Language and Communication Studies, University of East AngliaDr Joschka Ivanka Wessels Postdoctoral researcher, Copenhagen UniversityDr Phil Hutchinson Senior lecturer, philosophy, Manchester Metropolitan UniversityDr Sara Ababneh Researcher, AmmanDr Anat Matar Philosophy department, Tel Aviv UniversityDr Mandy Turner Director, Kenyon Institute, Jerusalem, and visiting fellow, Middle East Centre, London School of EconomicsBissane El-Sheikh Al-Hayat newspaper, BeirutLaila Alodaat Crisis response programme manager, Women\u2019s International League for Peace and Freedom, GenevaMalath Al-zoubi Media specialist, LondonMaia Malas Television producer, LondonAmr Salahi Syrian exile, LondonSafaa Jousif Syria NGO worker, LondonIbrahim Fakhry Syrian activist, OxfordClara Connolly Human rights lawyer, LondonNora Ababneh Project director, InternewsSai Englert Postgraduate representative, national executive council, National Union of StudentsReem Shafiq Doctoral counselling psychology trainee, researcher, LondonNick Evans PhD candidate, Wadham College, Oxford UniversityJuliette Harkin PhD candidate, School of Politics, Philosophy, Language and Communication Studies, University of East AngliaSonny Dubabuse LiverpoolDavid Phillips Brighton \u2022 Re Seumas Milne\u2019s article \u201cIt\u2019s not migrants who are the marauders and plunderers\u201d (13 August), most people (I think) would agree that western interference has caused acute misery for the people of the Middle East, but to include Syria with Iraq and Libya is unfair to the Syrian people."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/19/the-world-must-act-to-stop-syrias-suffering"}, {"tags": ["Champions League", "Valencia", "Monaco", "Rapid Vienna", "Shakhtar Donetsk", "Dinamo Zagreb", "Basel", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Valencia\u2019s Sofiane Feghouli struck late to provide his team with a two-goal advantage in their Champions League play-off against Monaco.

At another point during the evening, an Israeli defence forces source \u2013 quoted in Haaretz \u2013 blamed the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, saying: \u201cThe army sees Syria as responsible for the fire, and it will pay the price for it.\u201d In response, Israel announced it had hit eight Syrian military posts. Syrian opposition figures later reported that Israeli artillery and air strikes had targeted an area under the control of the Syrian army and pro-government forces \u2013 including Hezbollah \u2013 near Quneitra, suggesting that was the source of the projectiles. All of the rockets exploded without causing injury. The incidents follows a visit earlier this week to Israel\u2019s northern border by the Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu and defence minister Moshe Ya\u2019alon and anonymous briefings to Israeli military correspondents that appeared to suggest Israel might be preparing a contingency plan to strike back in Syria in the event of an escalation. Despite the claim that the attack was under the auspices of the Iranian organisation, the Israeli defence forces source insisted Israel would not be drawn into to a deeper conflict in the Syrian civil war. Israel has been keen to play up the military threat posed to it by Iran since world powers signed a deal with the country over its nuclear programme, a deal Tel Aviv is lobbying hard to have overturned by the US Congress. The military said it was the first time since the 1973 war that rockets from Syrian territory have hit Israel, although projectiles including mortars and artillery from Syria \u2013 fired as part of the fighting in that country\u2019s civil war \u2013 have periodically exploded over the border. A total of four rockets exploded in an open field in the northern Galilee, where sirens warned residents of the incoming projectiles. The rockets caused small fires. A Syrian activist, who goes by the name of Abu Omar al-Golani, said the shells hit near the Syrian town of Baath and the village of Khan Arnabeh. Other claims suggested the source of the fire was Khader, a village under Syrian government control. Syria\u2019s state-run news agency Sana later said that an Israeli helicopter fired several missiles inside Syria, targeting the governorate building in Quneitra, but that the strikes caused only material damage. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 August 2015.

Related: Manchester United cruise past Club Brugge with Wayne Rooney hat-trick    The governing body has scrapped the previous policy, under which the top eight teams were determined by recent performances in the competition and would so comprise pot one in the draw and avoid each other in the group stage. Instead, top-seeded status is now only granted to the Champions League holders and the winners of the domestic leagues in Spain, England, Germany, Italy, Portugal, France and Russia.

Spain are the first nation to boast five clubs in the group stage after Valencia eliminated Monaco in the play-offs on Tuesday. For City who, as relative newcomers to this competition have been dogged by difficult draws at this stage in recent years, the prospect remains of a group that might include Bar\u00e7a, Roma and Wolfsburg. They and Arsenal might hope instead to be placed alongside PSV, Olympiakos and Malmo \u2013 who overcame Celtic in Sweden on Tuesday \u2013 with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger hoping to steer his side into the knockout phase for the 16th year in succession.

For City, it has become the norm. This is the fifth season they have appeared in the Champions League and in every year but one they have ended up with the closest there is to a Group of Death, with the serious potential for rigor mortis to set in. They should be used to it by now but Manuel Pellegrini, just like Roberto Mancini before him, might also be entitled to cast an envious glance at the way everything has fallen for the other English clubs \u2013 Manchester United in particular \u2013 bearing in mind his own team must take on Juventus, last season\u2019s runners-up, as well as the Europa League champions, Sevilla, and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, who finished third in the Bundesliga.   Related: Champions League draw: Man City handed Juventus and Sevilla in tough group    Even in 2013, when the group draw was a fraction kinder than normal, City were lumbered with Bayern Munich. The season before that, it was Borussia Dortmund, Ajax and Real Madrid or, to put another way, the champions of Germany, Holland and Spain. Last season there was Bayern, Roma and CSKA Moscow. One of the City directors, starting to feel like a jinx, deliberately stayed away this year. It made no difference and the latest draw is reminiscent of City\u2019s first season in the competition, 2011-12, when they were also pitted against teams from Serie A, La Liga and the Bundesliga. Indeed, in all five seasons City have drawn German opposition. A lot of it is due to the perplexing format employed by Uefa that means Benfica, PSV Eindhoven and Zenit St Petersburg are currently among the highest eight seeds whereas the next pot down includes City \u2013 first, second, first and second in the Premier League over the past four seasons - and even more incredibly Real Madrid, winners of la Decima 16 months ago. City have never done enough to warrant a higher grade but, however much it is dressed up, it is barely plausible that a team with Madrid\u2019s traditions and history, featuring Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale et al, are not among the top group. As such, City are always vulnerable to these kind of misfortunes, although it will not make them feel any better that United were also in the second pot and have been dealt a much kinder hand. Louis van Gaal\u2019s team have been given a relatively gentle introduction back into the competition, in the form of PSV, CSKA Moscow and a Wolfsburg side who look like being significantly weakened by the impending transfer of Kevin De Bruyne. City, negotiating a transfer possibly in excess of \u00a350m, could never have imagined it would be doing their neighbours such a favour. On a more positive note, City did show last season they can negotiate a way through these tricky opening stages, and that if there was once a mental block it is no longer quite so debilitating. Sevilla have shown they are a fine knockout team but they were only fifth in La Liga last season while M\u00f6nchengladbach finished 13 points off the top in Germany and, despite their history in European competitions(including knocking City out of the 1979 Uefa Cup quarter-final), do not inspire anything like the same trepidation as Bayern, one of Arsenal\u2019s opponents in Group F. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s team are experts at qualifying for the knockout rounds but, behind City, they have the toughest draw of the four English clubs. Arsenal have gone out to Bayern in two of the past three seasons. Their other opponents, Olympiakos and Dynamo Zagreb, both play in front of partisan crowds and Arsenal\u2019s record against the Greek team since 2009 is mixed \u2013 three wins at home, three defeats away. Otherwise it was a draw of reunions. There is a return for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to Porto where, less pleasingly, he will come up against Iker Casillas, the goalkeeper he came to regard as a sworn enemy when he was managing Madrid.

Of course Arsenal could have landed an easier champion than Bayern Munich, their last-16 conquerors in 2014, but Olympiakos and the Croatian champions should not present a barrier to a top-two finish.

Nellie was living in Putney, south London, at the time. But her former life could not have been more different, and Dina would eagerly listen to the many stories about her family in prewar Germany, and the luxury lifestyle enjoyed by the Wolffs. Dina\u2019s mother, Aviva, however \u2013 who had also enjoyed this rich life until she was 11 \u2013 brushed aside many of Nellie\u2019s stories. The biggest fantasy, said Aviva, was Nellie\u2019s talk of the Wolff family owning a building in the centre of Berlin, Krausenstrasse 17/18. It had been the headquarters of the family fur business but was taken by the Nazis and then swallowed up by the East German regime after the war.     The Wolff family building, which was forcibly sold under the Nazis and reclaimed by Dina Gold. Photograph: Heinrich Hermes    \u201cDina,\u201d enthused Nellie, \u201cwhen the wall comes down and we get back our building in Berlin, we\u2019ll be rich.\u201d \u201cShe might as well have been telling me about Jack and the beanstalk or castles in Spain,\u201d says Dina today. But sometimes life is stranger than fiction. Nellie died in 1977, long before the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, but she had been right about ownership of the building. Dina, who had subsequently become a BBC investigative journalist, began a mammoth research task after the wall fell, resulting in a claim for Krausenstrasse 17/18. But Nellie had left no documents or photographs, not even an address, for the building she had so often reminisced about. Even so, after a six-year struggle, the German government finally paid \u00a38m in restitution to Aviva and the other heirs to the Wolff building. It is an extraordinary story, now told for the first time in a book \u2013 and the more remarkable because Dina had had only Nellie\u2019s coffee-time memories when she began her quest. Krausenstrasse is in the centre of Berlin and the building that had belonged to the Wolffs ended up on the eastern side of the wall, very close to Checkpoint Charlie, the crossing point between the city\u2019s eastern and western halves. No 17/18 encompasses an enormous property, six floors high and stretching back an entire block. It is unsurprising that such a building, owned and occupied by Jews, should have attracted the greedy eyes of the Nazis. Before the war, the Nazis expropriated thousands of Jewish-owned properties, commercial and private. Forced sales were the rule, rather than the exception. After the war, if the owners had survived, restitution was mired in legal arguments if the properties were in the west. If the buildings were on the eastern side of the Berlin Wall, or elsewhere in East Germany, they were often re-expropriated by the communist regime.     Dina Gold (right), with her mother, Aviva    In either case, documentation and fierce determination were the keys to restoring rightful ownership. Dina Gold had none of the first, but plenty of the latter. But even she might not have been prepared for the long fight for justice that ensued after her first visit to Krausenstrasse 17/18. On 4 December 1990, a bitterly cold day, Dina, in a red duffle coat and woolly hat, walked into the building, which had become the HQ of East German Railways. \u201cI\u2019ve come to claim my family\u2019s building,\u201d she said. Her only proof at that stage was a 1920 business directory in which there was a listing for H Wolff. \u201cH\u201d was Dina\u2019s great-great-grandfather Heimann Wolff, who had started the fur company in 1850 on which the family fortunes were founded. As a child, Dina\u2019s mother, Aviva, had come to visit her father, Herbert, and grandfather Victor in Krausenstrasse, and remembered being allowed to play on piles of furs. \u201cYou can jump on the rabbit furs, but don\u2019t you go jumping on the mink and sable,\u201d Herbert warned. Dina was fortunate that the manager of the building, Herr M\u00fcnch, did not dismiss her out of hand. Instead, he went to make a phone call and returned to tell her that \u201chead office\u201d had been waiting for this to happen. \u201cHead office has just informed me that they knew this building was once owned by Jews, but the person who I spoke to didn\u2019t know if anyone had survived,\u201d he told her. So Dina sat with M\u00fcnch and began to tell him what she then knew of her family\u2019s story. Her grandfather, Herbert, had uprooted his family from Berlin not long after Hitler came to power. Herbert, Nellie, and their three children, Aviva, Heini and Marion, went to live in Mandate Palestine. Herbert\u2019s brother Fritz was an idealistic communist who had refused to flee the\u00a0Nazis. The Wolffs were like so many of their friends: well-off assimilated Jews who thought of themselves as Germans. By 1933, Aviva suddenly found herself isolated at school and the target of antisemitic attacks in the wake of Hitler\u2019s rise to power. For the first time, the 11-year-old girl asked her parents to take her to synagogue, arguing: \u201cThey say I\u2019m a Jew, so I want to know more about being Jewish. I want to go to the\u00a0synagogue.\u201d In early 1933, Fritz Wolff was arrested and sent to Spandau prison. Though he was released in May that year, his brother Herbert, Dina Gold\u2019s grandfather, read the signs of the gathering storm facing Germany\u2019s Jews. He recognised that it was not going to matter to the Nazis if you were a good Jew, an assimilated Jew, or even a communist Jew. It was time to leave.     Fritz Wolff, Dina Gold\u2019s great uncle, who was murdered in Auschwitz, and left with $400 after the forced sale of the family business building.    But Fritz stayed in Berlin. Herbert wrote from Palestine in August 1934, giving Fritz power of attorney over his affairs in Germany. The increasing anti-Jewish laws soon resulted in the forced sale of Krausenstasse 17/18: it became the property of the Reichsbahn (Hitler\u2019s railways) on 26 May 1937. Poor Fritz, after all the legal deductions, was left with just under $400. He was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1938; and in March 1943 was \u201cevacuated\u201d by the Gestapo to Auschwitz, where he was murdered. Nevertheless, during the fight to win back the building, the family was asked for Fritz Wolff\u2019s death certificate. \u201cHe was killed in Auschwitz, where they most certainly didn\u2019t issue death certificates. We thought that reeked of repellent officialdom,\u201d says Dina. By now, Dina was determined to try to get the building back for her mother, who had retired, and to honour the memory of her great uncle Fritz. M\u00fcnch, Dina recalls, was kind and reassuring. And, crucially, he told her that it was possible to prove entitlement to the building. \u201cThe documents exist. You have to find them, but they exist,\u201d he said. It was the longest of shots that Dina even had the 1920 business listing. Earlier in 1990, she had spent time in Israel when her husband, Simon, was on a two-month fellowship at Tel Aviv University. There she got to know her cousin, Leor Wolff, then a journalist on one of the biggest Israeli newspapers, Yediot Ahronot. Kibbutz-raised Leor had a suitcase full of photos and old papers to show Dina. \u201cLeor and I hunted for any scrap of information that might lead us to an address for the building. Finally, we found a singed, ripped, yellowed letterhead: H. Wolff, Berlin W8. Krausenstrasse 17/18.\u201d Dina was amazed by what she discovered. \u201cBut my mother was more astounded than I was, she didn\u2019t expect Nellie\u2019s stories to be true. She was ruthlessly straightforward, always looking at the here and now, rather than the might-have-been. \u201c[Initially] she was extremely concerned about the potential cost [of making a claim], while I wanted to see if Nellie\u2019s claims stood up. \u201cWhat really made her mind up was an advertisement in the newsletter of the Association of Jewish Refugees inviting people to contact a law firm if they thought they had potential claims. We went to see [lawyer] Hans Marcus for a chat, though at that point [my mother] was still balking at the potential cost. But she was persuaded to register her claim. Then the rules changed and lawyers were allowed to act on a contingency basis. \u201cI really knew that it was going to happen when our lawyers wrote the statement of claim, which meant that we had managed to convince them that we had a strong case.\u201d When the case was settled, Aviva was relieved. She had thought that because of the wording of her father\u2019s will, she might not have been entitled to inherit. Dina says: \u201cWhen she was finally vindicated as a true heir, I would say she was quietly gratified. \u201cFor myself, I was never going to give up and I wasn\u2019t going to let my mother give up. We had to see this through to the bitter end.\u201d The settlement made Aviva\u2019s life much more comfortable. Dina says: \u201cMy mother\u2019s greatest fear was having to go into a nursing home in her old age. Instead, she was able to pay for a live-in carer. She helped me and my brother financially and was generous with funding her grandchildren\u2019s education.\u201d Aviva Gold died in January this year. But, says Dina, her mother\u2019s fingerprints are all over the book. \u201cMy mother helped me hugely, from reminiscences to translations of documents. As I uncovered more details about what had happened to her uncle Fritz during his last days in Berlin, my mother would tell me that she couldn\u2019t sleep at night for thinking of him and what he had gone through. She left Germany aged 11 and remembered her father saying, \u2018I can get him [Fritz] out, why won\u2019t he come?\u2019\u201d As for her grandmother: \u201cNellie was extremely glamorous, but she was a dreamer and always lived in the past. If she had still been alive to see the settlement, she would have definitely said, \u2018I told you so.\u2019\u201d \u2022 Stolen Legacy: Nazi Theft and the Quest for Justice at Krausenstrasse 17/18, Berlin by Dina Gold, is published by Ankerwycke", "publicationDate": "2015-08-29T05:45:06Z", "title": "Gran was right all along: our family once owned a building seized by the Nazis", "sentences": ["Earlier in 1990, she had spent time in Israel when her husband, Simon, was on a two-month fellowship at Tel Aviv University."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/29/dina-gold-family-property-nazi-berlin-stolen-legacy-krausenstrasse"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Human rights", "Law"], "article": "Israel\u2019s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has ordered his security officials to examine changing the rules governing when soldiers can shoot young Palestinian stone-throwers. A statement issued by his office on Wednesday revealed Netanyahu was considering giving security forces a freer hand to open fire with live ammunition after meeting with his cabinet to discuss a recent increase in the number of incidents involving firebombs and stone-throwing in Jerusalem and on the West Bank. Despite rules of engagement that in theory permit potentially lethal live fire to be used only in life-threatening situations, a number of recent incidents have led to young Palestinians being killed by Israeli soldiers \u2013 including a brigade commander \u2013 while fleeing and posing no immediate threat. The re-examination of open-fire regulations comes as the Israeli parliament is due to consider sweeping anti-terrorism legislation, which some have criticised for what they say are draconian new provisions.   Related: Palestinian teenager 'shot in back by senior Israeli soldier while fleeing'    It was unclear from the statement, however, what the new rules might look like or the implications of any new open-fire regulations would be. The proposed changes to the open-fire regulations came after a meeting with several cabinet ministers and security chiefs to discuss an increase in stone-throwing in Jerusalem and on a highway in the occupied West Bank.  \u201cSince the justice system finds it difficult to deal with minors who throw rocks, changes to orders on opening fire towards stone- and petrol bomb-throwers will be examined,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s office said in a statement.  Netanyahu was quoted as saying at the session that his government\u2019s policy was one of \u201czero tolerance towards stone-throwing and zero tolerance towards terror\u201d.  In the same meeting Netanyahu ordered reinforcements along a key road where there have been incidents of stone-throwing \u2013 route 443 \u2013 be reinforced and the deployment of 400 Israeli police in Jerusalem. Route 443, which runs through the West Bank, is the main road linking Jerusalem and the West Bank settlements with the town of Modi\u2019in, which is also on disputed territory, and the Tel Aviv area in central Israel. Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation\u2019s executive committee, criticised the potential new policy.  \u201cThis rightist Israeli fanatic government is pursuing its criminal policy to kill Palestinians. The new regulations would mean more escalation, killings and crimes against our people.\u201d  Sarit Michaeli, of the Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem, told the Guardian that while it was hard to comment until new orders had been issued, it seemed to make for a \u201cgrim read\u201d.  \u201cIt seems from the wording to suggest that because the justice system can\u2019t deal with stone-throwers, shoot them. Currently, it is prohibited to fire on anyone who is not posing a mortal danger.\u201d In reality there have been a number of high-profile incidents in recent years \u2013exposed by media and human rights groups \u2013 in which Israeli security forces have shot and killed Palestinians even as they were fleeing or walking away from the scene of stone-throwing. In the most recent incident, a Palestinian teenager, Mohammed Kasbeh, was shot and killed by an Israeli brigade commander after the officer\u2019s car was hit by a stone. Medical and witness testimony suggested he had been shot in the back while fleeing. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been frozen since 2014 and while violence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem has not approached the levels of past Palestinian uprisings, there has been a surge of stone-throwing, long a symbol of resistance to Israeli occupation.  While tougher action against stone-throwers would probably prompt international concern, Netanyahu\u2019s government and the military have been facing calls from Israeli settler leaders in the West Bank for a security crackdown.  Those demands mounted after a video last week that showed a masked Israeli soldier being hit and bitten by relatives of a Palestinian boy \u2013 a suspected rock-thrower whom he had placed in a headlock. Many Israelis asked on social media why the infantryman had not fought back or even used his assault rifle.   Related: Nabi Saleh images illustrate changing asymmetry of Israeli-Palestinian conflict    In July, Israel\u2019s parliament imposed tougher penalties of up to 20 years in prison for people throwing stones at vehicles, after a wave of Palestinian protests in occupied East Jerusalem.  But no such punishments have been reported since the new legislation was approved, and the measure does not apply to the occupied West Bank, where Israeli military law is in effect and stone-throwing. B\u2019Tselem lists 12 Palestinian minors who were shot and killed by Israeli forces during protests and clashes in the West Bank in 2014. In at least four of those incidents, Israel said the youngsters had been throwing stones or petrol bombs, according to B\u2019Tselem.

International Refugee Rights Initiative (IRRI) interviewed 24 asylum seekers who were sent to Uganda and Rwanda between February 2014 and May 2015 as part of the voluntary deportation scheme announced by Israel in March.  Although Israel has never named the \u201cthird countries\u201d, they are widely understood to be Rwanda and Uganda, the report says.  \u201cContrary to the Israeli authorities\u2019 rhetoric, departures from Israel are neither voluntary, nor do they ensure the safety of those leaving the country. While Israel presents Rwanda and Uganda as safe destinations, in reality they are often the starting point for a dangerous journey that not all asylum seekers survive,\u201d the report says.  In March, Israel\u2019s immigration authorities said they would begin deporting asylum seekers from Eritrea and Sudan to countries in Africa, even if against their will.  At the time, interior minister Gilad Erdan said the move would \u201cencourage infiltrators to leave the borders of the state of Israel in an honourable and safe way, and serve as an effective tool for fulfilling our obligations towards Israeli citizens and restoring the fabric of life to the residents of south Tel Aviv\u201d. An estimated 41,000 Eritrean and Sudanese nationals currently reside in Israel, of whom about 2,000 were being held in the Holot detention camp in the Negev desert, until the release of 1,178 in August.  The IRRI report said Israel had failed to live up to its promises to monitor and support the Eritreans and Sudanese in their new countries \u2013 echoing criticism also made by an Israeli rights group in April. \u201cThese asylum seekers are sent to Uganda and Rwanda with a promise from the Israeli authorities that they will be provided with the necessary papers to enable them to stay legally in the receiving country. However, our findings show that, in reality, they do not receive any legal status. They are left with no valid legal documents upon arrival and are either encouraged to leave these countries, live below the radar and without legal status, and/or hide the fact that they came from Israel,\u201d IRRI said. It said its research showed that most of the asylum seekers who were sent to Rwanda were subsequently smuggled out of the country to Kampala, the capital of neighbouring Uganda. \u201cFrom Kampala, the majority travel north to South Sudan, Sudan and Libya with many ultimately risking crossing the Mediterranean or falling into the hands of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS),\u201d the report added.  It said that some people sent directly to Uganda were given no information about their legal status and had their travel documents taken from them when they arrived. Eritreans and Sudanese are entitled to collective protection under the 1951 UN refugee convention, to which Israel is a signatory, because their lives would be in danger if they were sent back to their countries of origin. The embassy of Israel in London said the country strictly applies the convention, including the basic idea that no person is to be returned to a country where he/she faces serious threats to life or freedom.  \u201cThe safe relocation policy is based on the following criteria: that no wars or general disturbances are taking place in the third countries; that there exists no UNHCR (UN refugee agency) recommendations against return to the third countries; that life and freedom would not be at risk in the third countries based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social or political group; that relocated individuals in the third countries will have access to the asylum procedure or enjoy temporary protection; that the third countries are obligated to allow the relocated individuals means of dignified living (at least a possibility to stay and to work for a living),\u201d the embassy said in an email response.  The IRRI report quoted one Sudanese man who left Israel for Uganda describing his arrival at Entebbe airport in Kampala: \u201cWe got here, and this woman waited for us in the airport. It seemed like something [was] not entirely right. As if they are doing some kind of a shady business. She took all our documents and put [them] in a plastic bag, and then she called a taxi. We left and she said, \u2018Goodbye\u2019. I asked if I could have a telephone number, just in case. She said, \u2018No\u2019.\u201d Lucy Hovil, a senior researcher with IRRI, said Israel had said it would set up a monitoring system from May this year to follow the asylum seekers after their move. But none of those interviewed had heard of the system, and its findings are confidential, she said.  In late August, Human Rights Watch condemned Israel\u2019s decision to ban Eritrean and Sudanese nationals recently released from the Holot detention facility in the Negev from living and working in Tel Aviv and Eilat, saying the move violated their freedom of movement. The ban was announced on 23 August, three days before the Israeli high court\u2019s deadline for the release of anyone held at Holot for more than one year. The authorities\u2019 release of 1,178 Eritreans and Sudanese from Holot took place on 25-26 August.  IRRI called on the Israeli government to stop detaining Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers, close the Holot facility, and not detain those who do not agree to leave for third countries. It also called on Uganda to urge Israel to stop sending Eritreans and Sudanese to the country, and asked Rwanda to only accept asylum seekers if an official and public agreement with Israel was in place.", "publicationDate": "2015-09-11T13:24:02Z", "title": "Israel's voluntary deportation scheme puts asylum seekers at risk, report says", "sentences": ["At the time, interior minister Gilad Erdan said the move would \u201cencourage infiltrators to leave the borders of the state of Israel in an honourable and safe way, and serve as an effective tool for fulfilling our obligations towards Israeli citizens and restoring the fabric of life to the residents of south Tel Aviv\u201d.", "In late August, Human Rights Watch condemned Israel\u2019s decision to ban Eritrean and Sudanese nationals recently released from the Holot detention facility in the Negev from living and working in Tel Aviv and Eilat, saying the move violated their freedom of movement."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/sep/11/israel-voluntary-deportation-scheme-puts-asylum-seekers-at-risk-report-says"}, {"tags": ["Champions League", "Manchester City", "Manchester United", "Chelsea", "Arsenal", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "It is a measure of the way the balance of power is shifting in Manchester that, when the Champions League gets under way this week, more attention will be paid to City\u2019s first game than Louis van Gaal returning to Holland with United. Partly that is because City have a more glamorous tie against Juventus, last season\u2019s runners-up, but partly it is because the lavishly-funded Etihad exercise in trying to conquer Europe has become as engrossing a narrative as United\u2019s of 20 years ago when the dominant team in England kept finding themselves coming up short against the best Italy, Germany and Spain could offer. That all changed in 1999 when United outfought Juventus in Turin en route to a famous victory over Bayern Munich in the final, though it took the best part of a decade for Sir Alex Ferguson and his players to relearn the European ropes, and there were unexpected setbacks against Galatasaray, Gothenburg, Borussia Dortmund and Monaco along the way. City\u2019s story has been rather different. Since gaining admission to the Champions League, four years ago, they have been pitted against Bayern Munich and Barcelona on a regular basis, and despite some determined performances have generally been found out at the highest level.   Related: Champions League draw: group-by-group breakdown | Andy Hunter    This time, with a cool \u00a3150m invested over the summer in players such as Raheem Sterling, Kevin De Bruyne and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, City have made an impressive start to the domestic season and are in a position to regard a difficult Champions League group that includes Sevilla, M\u00f6nchengladbach and Juventus as negotiable. The Italian champions represent the first real test of this theory, though Juve at the moment are not quite looking at the same level as the side that ended last season so strongly, winning a fourth successive Serie A title and dumping Real Madrid out of the Champions League at the semi-final stage. Carlos Tevez has returned home to Argentina for a start, so the only Mancunian homecomings will be those of players with United connections. Patrice Evra, sent off in the recent defeat by Roma, and Paul Pogba, on United\u2019s books for three years before leaving for Italy, most likely to end up in Barcelona once the Catalans are free to buy players again. Even with Pogba in their ranks Juventus have just completed their worst-ever start to a Serie A season, losing their first two games to Udinese and Roma. \u00c1lvaro Morata and Sami Khedira missed both those matches through injury, which could not have helped, though Juventus are restructuring at the moment, attempting to lower the age of the squad and bed in new players around the experienced core of Gianluigi Buffon, Giorgio Chiellini and Claudio Marchisio. Marcelo Lippi, their former coach, does not believe the blip in form will be permanent, though he has warned that Juventus can expect a tough test at the Etihad. Most Italian observers are particularly impressed with Sterling and the pace and penetration he offers. The former Liverpool player might be struggling for his best form with England, but City know how to use him to either get behind defences or create space for Sergio Ag\u00fcero to do so. With De Bruyne now available, City boast a formidable forward line that revolves around David Silva\u2019s influence in the centre, and just about the only worry for Manuel Pellegrini \u2013 after spending the international break sitting on top of the Premier League table with a flawless record \u2013 is how soon to name his strongest lineup. That consideration applies to defence as well as attack. One can only suppose Otamendi was brought in at a cost of \u00a328m because central defence was a problem area last season, though initially at least Vincent Kompany and Eliaquim Mangala have managed to form a solid partnership this time. Elsewhere, Manchester United\u2019s opponents should not be underestimated as Memphis Depay makes a quick return to his former club. PSV Eindhoven may not boast as many household names as they once did but they won the Eredivisie under Phillip Cocu last season and were thus seeded above Van Gaal\u2019s team. With Wolfsburg also ending up in Group B after CSKA Moscow had been drawn third, United may have found a trickier route to the knockout stages than their neighbours. City have some big opponents lined up but United face the sort of sides capable of springing an ambush.

Arsenal have a potentially awkward visit to Zagreb on the same night, and when Arsenal are in Europe nothing can ever be taken for granted, though it would be a major surprise were anyone other than Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s team and Bayern Munich to make it out of Group F. After last season, when no English team made it into the last eight, it is what happens after the group stages that will be most interesting, though the immediate challenge for all four contenders is to improve on last year and stay in the competition until the New Year. The focus may be on Manchester at the moment, though that is where the upsets might happen too.

An estimated 1.4-3.0% of children in western countries are allergic to them, putting the kibosh on the consumption of a host of comestibles. But if a small startup has its way, that could all change. University of Toronto graduates Chloe Gui and Terry Huang are hoping to create peanuts that are free from specific proteins that trigger potentially life-threatening reactions in humans. It\u2019s a fledgling enterprise \u2013 after creating their company, Aranex Biotech, in April, Gui and Huang moved to Ireland to take part in Indie.bio\u2019s three-month synthetic biology accelerator programme hosted at University College, Cork. Their plan \u2013 to use a genome editing technique called Crispr-Cas9 to essentially \u201cturn off\u201d the genes that code for main peanut allergens. It\u2019s a technology that grabbed the headlines this year when the Crispr-Cas9 system was used by scientists to edit the genomes of human embryos.     Peanuts could be modified to reduce their allergenic proteins. Photograph: Patrick Sison/AP    So far Gui and Huang have taken cells from the leaves of peanut plants, removed the cell walls using an enzyme and then inserted the Crispr-Cas9 system by chemical means. Their results, says Gui, are promising \u2013 but there is a long way to go - to create whole plant the team must use a different method of inserting Crispr-Cas9 into plant cells and are currently planning to utilise a soil bacterium. \u201cWe are at the stage where we know Crispr works in peanut plants, now we want to regenerate a full plant,\u201d says Gui, adding that the duo are now looking to establish themselves in Norwich, a hub for plant science.   Related: Peanut allergy researchers say they may have found key to a cure    It\u2019s not the first attempt to find a solution to the issue of peanut allergies. Scientists have explored several GM techniques, including interfering with cellular processes that generate the problem proteins, while non-GM approaches include soaking peanuts in enzymes that break down the allergens. But using Crispr-Cas9, Gui believes, could be an effective alternative. Others agree \u201cScientifically, yes it is feasible,\u201d says Professor Peggy Ozias-Akins from the University of Georgia, who has conducted previous work on hypoallergenic peanuts. But, she adds, that there could be other complications. \u201cAs far as how a peanut deficient in these proteins would actually be utilised by industry is less well defined at this point.\u201d According to Gui, heavyweight confectioners have already pricked up their ears, keen to see the work develop. But she says there will be hurdles to overcome, not least that it is unlikely to be possible to turn off all the genes for all known peanut allergens. \u201cYou have to balance how many genes you can knock out while maintaining the viability of the plant,\u201d she says. And even if the team manages to produce hypoallergenic peanuts, the problem of perception remains \u2014 Gui and Huang are keen to avoid the GM label, meaning they are simultaneously looking to explore a range of routes to their proof of concept plant. It\u2019s a project that will take time, but Gui is enthusiastic. \u201cIt\u2019s never been a better time to do this sort of thing,\u201d she says.ND LAB-GROWN MEAT Overcome with the ills of animal production, Shir Friedman has a vision.

Except they would be for human consumption. In January it gave a grant to a Tel Aviv University biomedical engineer for a feasibility study of the proposition. Results expected at the end of this year will be used to plan the organisation\u2019s next steps. If successful, it would be the most ambitious project yet on the new food frontier of cultured animal products, where animal cells will eventually be grown in vats to make meat. \u201cProduction will look like a brewery,\u201d says Sarah Sclarsic, business director at Modern Meadow, a US startup working to make meat products from cultured cow muscle cells.

Mark Post, a researcher at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, unveiled the world\u2019s first cultured beef burger made from cow stem cells in 2013. It cost \u00a3200,000 to make, but even if it were scaled up it would still be \u00a315 per kilo for hamburger meat. There may also be regulatory hurdles. \u201cWe are hoping the process would be fairly straightforward but that remains to seen,\u201d says Sclarsic.    Related: Laboratory-grown beef: meat without the murder, but would you eat it?    Meanwhile, technology is also rising to the challenge of producing realistic meat analogues from plants.

D\u2019haeseleer is a key figure in the Real Vegan Cheese project, established in early 2014 with the aim of making cheese without cows. The project is a crowd-funded, not-for-profit, volunteer effort run out of two biohacking spaces in the San Francisco Bay area.      A scientist at work in the Real Vegan Cheese lab. Photograph: PR    Real Vegan Cheese isn\u2019t the only one with big ambitions. Startups Muufri and Clara Foods, also both in the Bay area, are aiming to make milk and egg whites respectively without the use of animals. The technology behind all of them relies on genetically modifying cells of baker\u2019s yeast to become microscopic factories that produce milk \u2013 or egg \u2013 protein. Those proteins, called caseins and albumins respectively, give milk and egg whites many of their physical properties.  It is unclear, however, exactly when these new synthetic dairy products might debut. Speaking at an event on the future of food the end of May in San Francisco, Muufri co-founder Ryan Pandya said he was hoping to have a proof-of-concept product ready by the end of this year or early next, but don\u2019t expect to see it at a grocery store any time soon.   Related: Vegan mozzarella: is the holy grail of pizza toppings finally here?    \u201cAccording to our preliminary estimates this is going to be a several hundred dollar glass of milk,\u201d he said. Clara Foods co-founder Arturo Elizondo added his company was aiming to have batches of egg whites ready by early next year for corporate partners to test.  At the Real Vegan Cheese project, the milk- and cheese-like prototypes made so far have been tests of what can be done with caseins, fat and sugar, but they use animal-derived casein powder. Genetically engineering yeast to spit out caseins synthetically has proved difficult. \u201cIt should definitely be do-able,\u201d says Benjamin Rupert, another of the project\u2019s leaders. \u201cThe yeast cell is complicated and people usually have to try a few times.\u201d Technical challenges aside, the products \u2013 despite the environmental benefits of less animal farming \u2013 are already raising the hackles of environmental groups. \u201cNobody I know wants to eat synthetically produced dairy made from genetically modified yeast in a lab,\u201d says Dana Perls, a food and technology policy campaigner at Friends of the Earth. Both Muufri and Clara Foods still seem to be deciding how to frame where their products come from, and to what extent they will revel in them being derived from genetically modified organisms. \u201cIf it means coming up with a new sort of language to speak to the public then we have to do that,\u201d said Pandya. ZC FERMENTED COFFEE Camille Delebecque is founder and CEO of Afineur, a Franco-American startup, who raised more than $50,000 on Kickstarter to produce a coffee with a unique flavour created through controlled fermentation.     Camille Delebecque, CEO of Afineur. Photograph: PR    Coffee\u2019s already quite popular \u2013 how are you improving it?  We\u2019re not rewriting coffee, we\u2019re shining a new light on it. People are starting to look for coffee that\u2019s not just bringing the morning buzz, but interesting in terms of flavour. At the moment, the coffee industry only has two tools to control the flavour: choosing the beans, and roasting. So fermentation is a really powerful third tool.   How does it work?  We do our fermentations directly on the processed green beans. We slightly humidify them, and sprinkle them with the bacterial strain, either as a fluid or a powder. After fermentation we do a roasting right away, which sterilises everything and removes the microbes, but the chemical changes remain.  How do the bacteria affect the flavour?  It\u2019s not the bacteria themselves that confer the flavour; the bacteria produce enzymes that induce specific chemical reactions within the beans. We\u2019re focusing on lowering bitterness and astringency, and we know specifically which molecules are responsible for which flavours. Trigonelline, for instance, causes bitterness.  But isn\u2019t coffee supposed to be bitter?  If you look at market surveys, bitterness is the number one taste that people dislike the most in coffee. Also, bitterness tends to overpower the more subtle flavours, so by removing it you allow the more floral and fruity notes to shine.    Related: Civet cat coffee: can world's most expensive brew be made sustainably?    Did you get the idea from kopi luwak (the expensive and controversial Indonesian coffee made from cherries which have passed through the bowels of a civet)?  Kopi luwak made me realise the potential of fermentation in coffee, but I thought there must be a better way to do it. We use a very controlled process, and we\u2019re not just reducing bitterness, we\u2019re bringing out new flavours, and removing some of the irritant chemicals as well. Caffeine, actually, is one of the irritants \u2013 we\u2019re lowering the caffeine by about 15%.  What\u2019s next?  With increased understanding of biology we can do things with microbes that we couldn\u2019t before, so we\u2019re looking at foods beyond just coffee. Fermentation could replace a lot of the artificial flavouring, a lot of the chemicals that have been used in the food industry for the last 40 years, and we can do it naturally and in a better way.

Use your timbale ring/cup to make slices of roasted red peppers, mango slices, avocado slices, courgettes, roasted sweet potato and pineapple. Arrange them all into little towers, alternating between the different ingredients. Top with a sprig of coriander.

Similar frustrations over transfer policy are simmering after a window where Chelsea opted against reinvigorating their title winners, other than to secure Pedro Rodr\u00edguez (oddly, their main addition eight years ago was another winger, Florent Malouda), and merely replaced those permitted to depart. Manchester City and Manchester United were lavish spenders as they attempted to bridge last season\u2019s gap. If Mourinho had craved a Paul Pogba or Antoine Griezmann, a John Stones or a Raphael Varane, just to keep his current squad on their toes then his ambitions were thwarted. And, where he had bemoaned the absence of the injured Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard, Ricardo Carvalho and Michael Ballack in 2007 \u2013 \u201cThe problem is not having five injured, but which players they are and the importance to the team\u201d \u2013 these days he can point to the loss of form of a similar number of key personnel, none of whom are maintaining previous standards. Chelsea\u2019s title winners have been unrecognisable over the club\u2019s worst start to a top-flight campaign since 1986. The likes of Branislav Ivanovic, John Terry, Cesc F\u00e0bregas and even Nemanja Matic have laboured \u2013 the Serb was marginally more impressive in the latest loss, at Everton on Saturday \u2013 with a hugely experienced but hardly quick rearguard lacking an effective shield to protect them and struggling to adjust to the high defensive line employed at times by the management. Their back-line, now deprived of Thibaut Courtois with a knee injury, has permitted 33 shots in the five games to date while, at the other end, flashes of attacking quality have been sporadic. It is as if the slog their title-winning season became, a grind when injuries and suspensions gripped over the run-in, has become the norm and all the attacking pizzazz which illuminated their approach a year ago has been forgotten. Eden Hazard, the player of the year, has been peripheral and ineffective. Pedro, quiet since his debut, is still adjusting to a new league. F\u00e0bregas, such a creative hub a year ago, has yet to muster an assist and seems muddled as to whether he is better suited to playing as a No8 or a No10, while Diego Costa\u2019s snarl is born of frustration rather than gamesmanship at present. Morale is low. The manager has cut a rather perplexed figure throughout, baffled that so many of those players upon whom he had relied so heavily have suddenly been rendered fragile, even diminished, by shoddy collective form. That has surfaced as exasperation. It must be acknowledged he is going through his own personal trauma at present with his father, Jos\u00e9 Sr, having been seriously ill back in Lisbon for some time, though he has not lacked focus at the training ground. The session at Cobham on Monday morning was apparently as energetic and committed as ever, the determination to recover shared by all. Yet Mourinho has long since conceded an error in pre-season planning which saw his squad return in mid-July, a week after almost all other Premier League rivals, and immediately depart for a base in Montreal, Canada. They have been leggy and lethargic from the off, a grogginess suggestive of a hangover from last season\u2019s exertions. If Mourinho had craved a free fortnight to work on fitness issues over the recent international break, he found himself left with seven players at Cobham while the rest globe-trotted with their national sides. There has been no time to take stock and recover. The furore surrounding his decision to banish the medical staff, Eva Carneiro and Jon Fearn, from the first-team picture has merely added to the dismal mood, with Chelsea braced for the former to launch legal action and depart in the wake of her demotion. But if those are the problems currently undermining the champions\u2019 defence, where are the solutions? Shoring up what is currently the most porous rearguard in the Premier League will be the manager\u2019s priority and, as unthinkable as it would have been even six months ago, dropping Ivanovic seems increasingly inevitable. If the manager had admitted he had erred in not withdrawing the Serb against Crystal Palace just before the international break, then it was surprising that he retained his place at Goodison Park. The 31-year-old needs a breather, and Maccabi\u2019s visit should be the ideal opportunity to hand Baba Rahman, a \u00a317.2m arrival from Augsburg, a debut at left-back with C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta moving across to the opposite flank. Oscar\u2019s anticipated availability after a knee injury might also allow Mourinho to rest F\u00e0bregas while Kenedy and Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my \u2013 a player Chelsea fought to retain over the summer, but whose involvement has been limited to 45 minutes in the Community Shield \u2013 may offer some pace and urgency. The London club\u2019s approach has been too stodgy to date, after all. This was always going to be an occasion for the manager to tamper with his starting lineup, with Arsenal due at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, yet it has become an opportunity for those on the fringes to demand inclusion this weekend. This team already languish 11 points behind City in the Premier League. Defeat to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s side, with the psychological wound it would inflict, does not bear contemplation. This squad, and its key personnel, desperately need to remind themselves of their qualities and must summon a display against Maccabi. Eight years ago, when Chelsea were actually fifth in the table and only two points off the summit, Mourinho\u2019s team conjured 20 scoring chances against Rosenborg but could only score once and failed to prevail. Club and manager have been quick to dismiss all similarities with that era, but they know mood music will not change unless the Israelis are dismissed and the recovery proper is kick-started on Saturday.", "publicationDate": "2015-09-14T14:09:18Z", "title": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Chelsea face ghosts of 2007 when Maccabi Tel Aviv visit | Dominic Fifield", "sentences": ["But, while the Portuguese has already laboured the point that this is not history being played out again, some parallels still feel unnerving before the visit of Maccabi Tel Aviv on Wednesday."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/sep/14/jose-mourinho-chelsea-maccabi-tel-aviv-rosenborg-champions-league"}, {"tags": ["Champions League", "European club football", "Football", "Sport", "Lionel Messi", "Cristiano Ronaldo"], "article": "Paolo Bandini Who will win it? Winning the Champions League requires a certain degree of good timing \u2013 just the fact of having key players healthy and in form at the business end of the tournament often plays a bigger role than I think some people realise. But since that stuff is nigh impossible to predict, I\u2019ll go with what looks like the best squad \u2013 which for me is still Barcelona. How will the Italian clubs do and why? I must admit, I fear the worst. Juventus have a tough group at a time when they can least afford it as they adjust to life without Carlos Tevez, Andrea Pirlo and Arturo Vidal. Add Fernando Llorente into that mix and you have 10 of the team\u2019s 17 Champions League goals last season. Facing City away first, before they have had time to integrate new players and systems properly, is especially poor timing and could put them on the back foot right away. Meanwhile, Roma face Barcelona first and need to show they have learned from last year\u2019s 7-1 mauling by Bayern Munich. I could imagine a scenario where only one Italian side makes the knock-out stage and, as group runner-up, does not go much further.   Related: Champions League 2015-16: group-by-group guide    Which club will be the surprise of the tournament? I don\u2019t know if you can talk about the Premier League leaders being a surprise package, but I do think this will be the year Manchester City finally break through and go far. Reversing the point above about Juventus, I think beating last year\u2019s finalists in their opening game could give City a big confidence boost and momentum going forwards. Which player will have his breakthrough? If you\u2019d asked a week ago, I would have said Nabil Fekir at Lyon, but the cruciate ligament injury he suffered while playing with France puts paid to that idea. Instead I\u2019ll say Vincent Aboubakar at Porto \u2013 who has been banging them in in Portugal\u2019s Liga Nos and hit three in four Champions League games last season. Who will score more goals, Cristiano Ronaldo, or Lionel Messi, or will someone else claim the Golden Boot? Well last year they both got the same (as did Neymar \u2026) but I\u2019ll take Ronaldo to sneak back ahead this time around. Who or which team may flop? Unfortunately, I do think it could be Juventus \u2013 for all the reasons outlined above. Least excited about? A Real Madrid-Malmo mismatch. Most excited about? Watching Malmo prove me wrong by overturning Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u. Dominic Fifield Who will win it and why? It is hard to look beyond the usual suspects, and maybe Bayern Munich and Pep Guardiola will edge beyond the Spanish powerhouses this year. How will the English clubs do and why? They should all emerge from their groups, though extending their involvement to the quarterfinals may be the limit of realistic ambitions. Certainly it is time for Manchester City to show their qualities at this level, while Chelsea will relish some escapism from their early season Premier League toils. Which club will be the surprise of the tournament? Lyon\u2019s would have been an intriguing return to the Champions League had Fekir retained his fitness, but thriving without their young playmaker may be tricky. Regardless, they are a talented squad. The French teams will all be awkward opponents, as too will the less heralded Spanish of Sevilla and Valencia. Which player will have his breakthrough? Alexandre Lacazette at Lyon must carry the team\u2019s attacking threat while Julian Draxler, now with Wolfsburg, might benefit from a change of scenery.     Julian Draxler, formerly of Schalke, was signed by Wolfsburg to replace Kevin De Bruyne, who left for Manchester City. Photograph: Joachim Sielski/Bongarts/Getty Images    Who will score more goals, Cristiano Ronaldo, or Lionel Messi, or will someone else claim the Golden Boot? Ronaldo may run amok in the group stage, though Thomas M\u00fcller may quietly accumulate a bigger season\u2019s haul with Bayern. Who or which team may flop? Juventus have started poorly in Italy and may suffer just as badly at this level after their summer overhaul. Least excited about? The inquests into why English clubs are not claiming the trophy, with the inevitable accompanying calls for a winter break. Most excited about? The new seeding system may add some intrigue to the group stage. Raphael Honigstein Who will win it? Take your pick from Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern. It will largely depend on who of those three will be in the best shape going into April and May, as the last three seasons have shown. The Spanish have more quality in the final third, Bayern a slightly better squad \u2013 but only if all key players are available. How will the German clubs do and why? Bayern are among the favourites to win the competition but for Wolfsburg, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen it\u2019s about acquitting themselves as well as possible. Wolfsburg have a decent chance to make it into the last 16 even if they\u2019re not the same force without Kevin De Bruyne. Gladbach have had a terrible start \u2013 four defeats in four games in the Bundesliga \u2013 the worst possible draw and will be without their key defender Martin Stranzl. The best they can realistically hope for is third place. Leverkusen, however, might well surprise a few people with their all-action approach and pacy attackers. They were unlucky not to knock out Atl\u00e9tico in the last 16 last year but look much improved this season. With a bit of luck, they\u2019ll make it into the quarter-finals. Which club will be the surprise of the tournament? Leverkusen (see above) look a good bet to be this season\u2019s dark horses. A good draw for Valencia and Atl\u00e9tico will help the Spanish contingent to trouble one or two bigger sides, and Manchester United could well be an unlikely success story. Their possession football lends itself to European competitions. Which player will have his breakthrough? Leverkusen\u2019s Brazilian left-back Wendell is a superstar in the making who will gain international recognition this season. I also like Marlos of Shakhtar, Bayern\u2019s Douglas Costa and Paulo Dybala of Juventus.     Douglas Costa, right, departed Shakhtar for Bayern for \u00a321.3m in the summer but the Ukrainian club have another attacking gem in Marlos.  Photograph: Martin Rose/Bongarts/Getty Images    Who will score more goals, Cristiano Ronaldo, or Lionel Messi, or will someone else claim the Golden Boot? Bayern\u2019s relatively easy group stage should allow both Robert Lewandowski and M\u00fcller to run up some goals \u2013 they might provide better value. Who or which team may flop? Juventus look poised for a disappointing season but if Sergio Ag\u00fcero is injured, Manchester City might not be quite as daunting opposition in their group. Roma will get knocked out by Leverkusen, I believe, and I\u2019m not sure Porto will manage to be competitive without Jackson Mart\u00ednez. Least excited about? Stories about teams having a tough time travelling to Astana in Kazakhstan and Bate in Belarus. Most excited about? Seeing Gladbach back on the Champions League/European Cup stage for the first time in 37 years and PSG taking on Real Madrid in the group stage. David Hytner Who will win it and why? It\u2019s very hard to look beyond Barcelona, not only because of the flair of their strikers but because of their decisiveness. How will the English clubs do and why? Arsenal\u2019s last-16 exit feels even more certain, given that they will probably finish as runners-up to Bayern Munich in the draw. I don\u2019t see Manchester United or Chelsea going much further but this could be the year when City finally reach a quarter-final \u2013 or more. Which club will be the surprise of the tournament (all countries) and why? Wolfsburg came out of pot four but I can see them advancing. Does that count? Which player will have his breakthrough? Victor Andrade, Benfica\u2019s 19-year-old attacking midfielder from Brazil, has a big reputation at youth level and he can be expected to showcase his skills with no fear.     19-year-old Brazilian Victor Andrade had a trial with Benfica aged 11 but only signed for the club last year from Santos. Photograph: Gualter Fatia/Getty Images    Who will score more goals, Cristiano Ronaldo, or Lionel Messi, or will someone else claim the Golden Boot? Messi to shade Ronaldo and, therefore, win the Golden Boot. Who or which team may flop? Juventus. Last season\u2019s beaten finalists have lost key players and have a devilishly difficult group. They may not escape it. Least excited about? Surprisingly, I\u2019m fairly positive about all of it! Especially now that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger doesn\u2019t have the press on the Arsenal team flight, so we are spared the dreaded bolt back to the airport after away ties when there is, essentially, no time to file. Most excited about? As usual, the theatre and sheer sense of grandeur about the knockout ties, when there is the feeling that cities come grinding to a halt while they are played out. Jamie Jackson Who will win it? Barcelona. No club has ever retained the competition in the Champions League format. Bar\u00e7a can do so because their rivals remain below their stellar level and because the hunger of Luis Su\u00e1rez will continue to drive the club forward. How will the English clubs do? Manchester United and Manchester City may be surprise semi-finalists. Louis van Gaal knows how to win the European Cup and City\u2019s Manuel Pellegrini now has a squad equipped to go deep into the competition. Chelsea and Arsenal may fall in the last-16 for similar reasons: being inferior teams that have doubts over who will score the goals. Which club will be the surprise of the tournament? Paris Saint-Germain. Despite the cash injected into the club, if Laurent Blanc\u2019s team reach the final it would still be a major achievement and would announce PSG as a new continental heavyweight. Which player will have his breakthrough? Memphis Depay has been billed as United\u2019s next big thing but Anthony Martial may just catch fire and terrorise defences under the European lights with his penchant for a dribble and ability to glide into the danger area. Who will score more goals, Cristiano Ronaldo, or Lionel Messi, or will someone else claim the Golden Boot? Lionel Messi. Playing alongside Su\u00e1rez and Neymar means the Argentinian genius should be able to feed on a buffet of chances in each and every match.     Luis Su\u00e1rez created the winner for Lionel Messi in Barcelona\u2019s 2-1 win at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on Saturday. Don\u2019t expect that to be the Uruguayan\u2019s last assist this season. Photograph: Ruben Albarran/Rex Shutterstock    Who or which team may flop? Juventus. Last year\u2019s finalists have lost Carlos Tevez, among others, and may struggle to emerge from a Group D containing City, Sevilla and M\u00f6nchengladbach. Least excited about? The moans about the group stage being a phoney war. Most excited about? The group stage. The last 16. The quarter-finals. The semi-finals. The final. Julien Laurens  Who will win it? I think Barcelona will retain the trophy and be the first team in the history of the Champions League to do so. They were impressive last season and will be even stronger from January when their summer signings, Aleix Vidal and Arda Turan, will be eligible to play. I cannot see anyone being able to stop their incredible front three and their collective strength. How will the French clubs do? Last season was very good for the French clubs with PSG and Monaco reaching the quarter-finals and it will be very hard to reproduce that this time around. I don\u2019t think Lyon have enough to get that far, especially without Nabil Fekir, who is out injured until March. On the other hand, PSG are aiming for a semi-final spot and have a chance of being successful. They will need a bit of luck in the draw but knocking out Chelsea in the last 16 last season was a big psychological boost. And \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda could make a huge difference too.   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Chelsea face ghosts of 2007 when Maccabi Tel Aviv visit | Dominic Fifield    Which club will be the surprise of the tournament? Valencia get my vote. They fought hard to knock out Monaco in the play-offs. Their group with Lyon, Gent and Zenit St Petersburg will enable them to get stronger and stronger in the competition and finish top of it. Aymen Abdennour is a perfect replacement for Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi at the back and they have options up front too. I really rate their manager Nuno as well. Which player will have his breakthrough? I would pick Anthony Martial as revelation of the season in the competition and I would have picked him even if he had not scored a beauty against Liverpool at the weekend. He is a special player and he will express all his potential in this Manchester United team as they will play on his qualities. Plus, Van Gaal is the perfect coach to guide him to a new level. Who will score more goals, Cristiano Ronaldo, or Lionel Messi, or will someone else claim the Golden Boot? Ronaldo will finish top scorer in this season\u2019s edition. I think Real Madrid\u2019s group, with Malmo and Shakhtar as well as PSG, will offer him opportunities to score a lot of goals. And Madrid will go far too. Last season, Neymar and Messi shared the Golden Boot with him but I feel the trophy is all his this season. Who or which team may flop? Porto. I am still not convinced by Julen Lopetegui, their manager and although they did very well last season to reach the quarter-finals and cause problems to Bayern Munich, I don\u2019t think they will do well this season. They lost key players such as Jackson Mart\u00ednez, Alex Sandro and Danilo this summer and, apart from Iker Casillas, I am not so sure about the new arrivals at the club. Least excited about? Having the final in Milan! I have no problems with Milan, a lovely city, but San Siro is an old stadium and with all the brand new, modern and exciting arenas in Europe, surely Uefa could have picked a much nicer venue for this year\u2019s final. Most excited about? Seeing how Europe\u2019s most promising young players will do in the competition this season: Julian Draxler with Wolfsburg, \u00c1ngel Correa and \u00d3liver Torres with Atl\u00e9tico, Corentin Tolisso with Lyon, Rafinha with Barcelona, Jonathan Tah with Leverkusen, Joshua Kimmich with Bayern, Anthony Martial with Manchester United, Danilo with Real Madrid, Jos\u00e9 Luis Gay\u00e0 with Valencia and all the other wonderkids taking part in the Champions League this season.     Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s Jonathan Tah gets to grips with Bayern Munich\u2019s Thomas M\u00fcller.  Photograph: Matthias Schrader/AP    Amy Lawrence Who will win it? Argh it\u2019s so crazily early for these crystal ball questions \u2026 If pushed I will go for Barcelona, because of the Messi-Su\u00e1rez-Neymar axis, and because it\u2019s about time somebody retained the Champions League. How will the English clubs do and why? All four should qualify from their groups, but even if one of them gets their act together in the knockouts, they will still need a load of luck to get past the obvious favourites. Which club will be the surprise of the tournament? Manchester City, if they can keep their most important players fit. Ready to go far this time. Which player will have his breakthrough? Although not new to the competition, there are a few players who can make a fine impact a new clubs. Looking forward in particular to seeing what Douglas Costa and Kingsley Coman can do in Bayern colours. Who will score more goals, Cristiano Ronaldo, or Lionel Messi, or will someone else claim the Golden Boot? Has to be hat-eating time if it is anyone else, despite Maccabi Tel Aviv\u2019s Eran Zahavi having a seven-goal head start from qualification. Who or which team may flop? Juventus don\u2019t look capable of repeating last season\u2019s heroics. Least excited about? Gazprom adverts. Most excited about? The excitement of the knockout rounds. And before that, Zlatan doing something only Zlatan would do when he returns to Malmo.     Zlatan Ibrahimovic, seen here in 2000 wearing Malmo\u2019s kit on his bed, will face his old club on Tuesday when they visit PSG in their Group A opener. Photograph: IBL/Rex    Sid Lowe Who will win it and why? Real Madrid. They have Rafa, remember. And Ronaldo (although maybe Bayern Munich will get it right this time). How will the Spanish clubs do and why? On the evidence of European competition over recent years, better than anyone else. Which club will be the surprise of the tournament? I don\u2019t know. It would be a surprise if I did. Sevilla might have been (if they even count as a surprise) but their group \u2013 with Man City, Juventus and Gladbach \u2013 means that it\u2019s hard to imagine. Mind you, maybe that just makes them even more of a surprise. Which player will have his breakthrough? Easy answer is Anthony Martial after this weekend. Would James Rodr\u00edguez count as a breakthrough after the 2014 World Cup? Probably not, but he was looking superb until his recent injury. What about Kevin De Bruyne? Do these guys even count as breakthrough? Possibly not. Who will score more goals, Cristiano Ronaldo, or Lionel Messi, or will someone else claim the Golden Boot? Ronaldo more of a striker than Messi, so it is tempting to say him but that hasn\u2019t always been a guarantee of anything. Who or which team may flop? Spain\u2019s \u2018other\u2019 team has not done well in the last two years, which was a real pity. Maybe the pattern continues with Sevilla or Valencia. Hope not. Least excited about? First-round games with nothing much riding on them \u2026 knockout ties where you already know who is going through. Most excited about? Apart from the obvious: Messi, Ronaldo, there\u2019s something about Lewandowski that I always really enjoy watching and I would love to see Antoine Griezmann make a real impact on the competition. David Silva and Juan Mata too. Barney Ronay Who will win it? Bayern Munich. Douglas Costa, Arturo Vidal, Arjen Robben and David Alaba can add the drive, muscle and high-class funky full-back stylings missing last year. And Guardiola will work himself into a state of tearful exhaustion going after it. How will the English clubs do? Manchester City will have their best year yet. Manchester United will look more at home than they do playing teams outside the Premier League top six. Arsenal will be Arsenal. Chelsea, who knows, but they\u2019re not going to be scaring anyone right now. Which club will be the surprise of the tournament? The entire dynamic of the competition is geared towards minimising surprises. Maybe Nottingham Forest will win it this year. Or Steaua Bucharest. Or, er, Barcelona. Dinamo Kiev might benefit from strife elsewhere in their group. Which player will have his breakthrough? Raheem Sterling, who, 20 minutes in Manaus aside, has never done anything outside the Premier League but looks to have found a good role in an improved team.     Manuel Pellegrini will hope summer signings Raheem Sterling and Kevin De Bruyne can lift Manchester City into the latter stages of this year\u2019s competition. Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA    Who will score more goals, Cristiano Ronaldo, or Lionel Messi, or will someone else claim the Golden Boot? Robert Lewandowski could have a good one. Ronaldo certainly looks lean, motivated and slick. Or at least, he does in his new perfume adverts. Who or which team may flop? Juventus had better get a move on. A lot of new players to bed in, but they have a good team-building manager. Otherwise: PSG.   Related: Manchester City captain: We can have no more Champions League excuses    Least excited about? None of it. Despite the same teams hogging it year after year, all the dead rubbers, this is still a brilliant competition. Most excited about?  Quite looking forward to seeing how this Louis van Gaal United does in a competition where Van Gaal-ism has been so prevalent down the years. Would also love to see one of the really big teams ambushed early on. Malmo. Bate Borisov. You know what to do. Daniel Taylor Who will win it and why? Barcelona, because they take football to its highest level. Hopefully, in the process, the strangely maligned Luis Enrique will receive more credit than he managed last season. How will the English clubs do and why? All will get through the group stages; none will make it to the final. For the first time, maybe Manchester City will be England\u2019s last team standing. Which club will be the surprise of the tournament? Sorry to be a wet blanket, but I can\u2019t see one. It will still be the usual suspects \u2013 \u201cthe European sharks\u201d, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho calls them \u2013 in the final stages of the competition. Which player will have his breakthrough? Douglas Costa of Bayern Munich. A lot of Premier League clubs looked closely at the Brazilian but for some reason none followed up their initial interest. His early form in Munich shows that might have been an error. Who will score more goals, Cristiano Ronaldo, or Lionel Messi, or will someone else claim the Golden Boot? Messi, but it really is a toss of the coin between these two. We are lucky to have them playing at the same time. Who or which team may flop? Sevilla won the Europa League last season but have not managed a single victory in la Liga so far. Least excited about? Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s press conferences, when he seems to forget that this is a way for communicating with supporters. Vincent Kompany, to give him his due, spoke with great thought and eloquence before the Juventus game. Most excited about? 28 May 2016, San Siro. The final is always one of those occasions when we football writers should be reminded how privileged we are to be there. Also: watching the warm-up routines between Dani Alves and Lionel Messi. Twenty-yard volleys played as keepie-ups. It\u2019s hypnotic. Jonathan Wilson Who will win it? Barcelona. They still have the best balanced side with a ridiculous attacking trident and they seem to have been re-energised by Luis Enrique. How will the English clubs do? Collectively, they\u2019ll surely do better than last season, although none perhaps is quite good enough to win it without a significant streak of fortune. City may at last have lucked out with a group that probably isn\u2019t as hard as it initially appeared, and they probably now have a squad that could carry them to the final with a fair wind, so long as the interface between the back of midfield and the back four is better than last season. United may actually have a better chance of winning the Champions League than the league \u2013 it looks as though their problem this season will be drawing games they ought to have won; in knockout ties that\u2019s less of an issue than over a 38-game season \u2013 but at the moment they\u2019re nowhere near cohesive enough. Arsenal are Arsenal so will probably go out bravely in the last 16 or quarter-final having played much better in the second leg than the first. And Chelsea may have the benefit that the league will be out of reach by February and so it won\u2019t be a priority \u2013 assuming their form improves sufficiently to get them to the knockouts. Which club will be the surprise of the tournament? Dynamo Kyiv look a more coherent side than they have for years, something that was evident in the Europa League last season. Serhiy Rebrov is a coach who seems to have the background and mentality to modernise the philosophy instilled by Valeriy Lobanovskyi, the legacy that made Dynamo what they are but has perhaps of late held them back. Their group isn\u2019t the hardest either.     Serhiy Rebrov, a former Tottenham player, oversaw Dynamo Kyiv\u2019s domestic double last season, in which they finished 10 points ahead of Shakhtar in Ukraine\u2019s top flight. Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images    Which player will have his breakthrough? I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019d call it a breakthrough, but a player who I\u2019m amazed is still at the club and who will almost certainly be moving if he enhances his reputation this season is Grzegorz Krychowiak, Sevilla\u2019s Polish holding midfielder who was superb in their Europa League triumph last season. Who will score more goals, Cristiano Ronaldo, or Lionel Messi, or will someone else claim the Golden Boot? Messi, if only because Barcelona will probably get further in the competition. Who or which team may flop? Juventus. Even before their dismal start to Serie A, it was hard to see them matching last season\u2019s feat of reaching the final.

The Egyptian businessman landed, shortly after 1.30pm on 27 June 2007, in the private rose garden at number 24 Carlton House Terrace, a street whose former occupants include three prime ministers (Palmerston, Earl Grey and Gladstone) and which lies a few hundred metres from Piccadilly Circus. Overhead, the lunchtime sky was obnoxious with helicopters, swarming above Tony Blair\u2019s Teflon-plated convoy as it carried the prime minister to Buckingham Palace, where he would hand in his resignation. A woman screamed. Someone called the police. The paramedics arrived too late. Marwan died from a ruptured aorta. The details of the final minutes of Marwan\u2019s life are much more opaque. Not that there weren\u2019t witnesses: on the morning of his death, four men were meeting on the third floor of an adjacent building, 116 Pall Mall, in a room with a clear view of Marwan\u2019s balcony. In a curious twist, these men \u2013 J\u00f3zsef R\u00e9p\u00e1si, Essam Shawki, Michael Parkhurst and John Roberts \u2013 worked for one of Marwan\u2019s companies, Ubichem PLC; they were waiting for their boss to join them. He was late. When they called around midday to find out why, he assured the group that he would be with them shortly.   Related: Who killed the 20th century\u2019s greatest spy? - Podcast    R\u00e9p\u00e1si, who was sitting with the window to his left, recalled that he was startled by one of his colleagues crying out, \u201cLook what Dr Marwan is doing!\u201d Two of the other witnesses claimed at the time that they saw Marwan leap from the balcony. By the time R\u00e9p\u00e1si had moved to see out of the window he saw \u201cDr Marwan falling\u201d. Shawki, who was then the director of Ubichem, ran downstairs to help. The other three men remained in the room, shocked and bewildered. After a moment, R\u00e9p\u00e1si looked out of the window again, straining to see the spot where Marwan had landed. \u201cI saw two Middle Eastern-looking persons looking down from the balcony of one of the apartments,\u201d he told me via email \u2013 although neither he nor his colleagues knew whether or not the men were standing on the balcony of apartment number 10, Marwan\u2019s address. Did Marwan jump or was he pushed? The postmortem examination found traces of antidepressants in Dr Marwan\u2019s blood. A report from his doctor said that he had been \u201cunder considerable stress of late\u201d, and had lost 10kg in two months. But there are reasons to believe suicide was unlikely. There was no note. Marwan was due to fly to the US that evening for a meeting with his lawyer. He had just been accepted into the Reform Club, whose members include Prince Charles and former MI5 boss Dame Stella Rimington. A few days earlier he had bought his grandson a PlayStation 3 for his birthday. Marwan and his wife, Mona Nasser, the daughter of the former Egyptian president, were due to take their five grandchildren on holiday. Marwan had plans. He had appointments. He had reasons to live. \u201cThere is no evidence of mental or psychiatric disorder,\u201d the coroner William Dolman said, after a 2010 inquest into Marwan\u2019s death, which did not reach a verdict. There was \u201cno evidence of any intention to commit suicide\u201d, Dolman concluded. But paradoxically, he also declared there was \u201cabsolutely no evidence\u201d to support claims that Marwan was murdered. But while Marwan may not have intended to take his life, he certainly feared for it. The last time he was alone in his apartment with his wife, he told her that he \u201cmight be killed\u201d. He added, portentously: \u201cI have a lot of different enemies.\u201d In the months leading up to his death, Nasser recalled that her husband checked the door and locks every night before bed, a new habit unseen during their 38 previous years of marriage. According to Marwan\u2019s family, there was another clue at the scene \u2013 or, more precisely, the absence of a clue. The only known copy of his memoirs, which he was close to completing, allegedly disappeared from his bookshelves on the day of his death. The three volumes, each around 200 pages, as well as the tapes on which Marwan had dictated the text, have never been recovered.   Related: Mossad agents murdered my husband, says widow of billionaire arms dealer    According to one scholar, Marwan had worked, over the years, for Egyptian, Israeli, Italian, American and British intelligence; was he preparing to spill secrets that could embarrass kings and nations? Who took the documents, if indeed they existed? And was his death part of a pattern? Marwan was the third Egyptian living in London to die in similar circumstances. (June 2001: the actor Soad Hosny fell from the balcony of Stuart Tower, a block of flats in Maida Vale, after she approached a publisher offering to write her memoirs. August 1973: El-Leithy Nassif, former head of the late Egyptian president Anwar Sadat\u2019s presidential guard, fell from a balcony in the very same tower. He too was writing his memoirs.) All three victims had links to the Egyptian security services. The inquest into Marwan\u2019s death failed to provide many answers. \u201cWe simply don\u2019t know the facts, despite careful investigation,\u201d Dolman, the coroner, told the court in 2010. Indeed, after three years of examination by two separate murder squads, including Scotland Yard\u2019s elite Specialist Crime Directorate, there remain, as Dolman put it, \u201cmany unanswered questions\u201d. The story is alluring because its mysteries jar with the circumstances of the day \u2013 a death at lunchtime, in central London, with witnesses. The scene is littered with clues, but there is apparently no evidence to settle the story. And yet Marwan\u2019s tale continues to itch at the curious. The doorman at 24 Carlton House Terrace told me that journalists drop by at a rate of \u201caround one a year\u201d, seeking answers about what happened that day. File a freedom of information request on the subject of Ashraf Marwan and you\u2019ll receive an exhaustive list that outlines the many exemptions protecting the British intelligence agencies\u2019 files on the matter. Both Marwan\u2019s life and death remain opaque, composed of fuzzy details that sent obituary writers glumly reaching for the ifs and maybes. * * * At the precise moment that Ashraf Marwan tumbled from his balcony, Ahron Bregman was sitting in his office in the war studies department at King\u2019s College London, waiting for a call from the spy that never came. After a few hours, Bregman left to return to Wimbledon, where he took his family to lunch at Nando\u2019s. As he left the restaurant, his mobile phone rang. It was his sister, calling from Israel: Marwan was dead. The news disoriented Bregman, but, in the context of their missed appointment, it was not entirely unexpected. Marwan had also left him a string of stricken answerphone messages in the preceding days. Bregman knew that his friend feared his life was in danger. Moreover, Bregman knew that he was partly responsible for this state of affairs. Bregman\u2019s relationship with Marwan was complicated. They had met only once before in person, four years earlier, at the InterContinental hotel in London. (\u201cI approached carefully through small streets to ensure I was not followed,\u201d Bregman said. \u201cI was late. He was already there. Tall. Wearing a red scarf.\u201d) Nevertheless, their lives had become entwined. Before Bregman entered Marwan\u2019s life, the Egyptian was known, if he was known at all, as a wealthy businessman and an avid Chelsea fan (he owned a 3.2% stake in the club and, at one point, one of his property companies took over both Chelsea and Fulham\u2019s football grounds, before selling them at a vast profit). All that changed when Bregman came along. Marwan was born in Egypt in 1944. His father was a military officer who served in the presidential guard brigade. At the age of 21, Marwan graduated with a first-class honours degree in chemical engineering from Cairo University, and was conscripted into the army. In 1965, Marwan was playing a game of tennis in Heliopolis, a suburb of Egypt\u2019s capital, when he spied an attractive young girl, Mona Nasser, the president\u2019s third and favourite daughter, who was 17 at the time. Love flowered, and the pair married the following year, drawing Marwan into the circles of the elite. The young man continued his military service for two more years, before moving to London to begin studying for an MA in chemistry.

Photograph: Anonymous/AP    There, some sources claim that Marwan became dissatisfied with the family allowance he had been given. (Marwan was financially ambitious throughout his life; his eventual fortune exceeded \u00a3400m. Cabra Investments, the name given to Marwan\u2019s property umbrella company, means \u201cto grow large\u201d in Arabic.) To supplement his student income \u2013 according to one historian \u2013 he charmed the wife of a Kuwaiti sheikh, who provided him with additional financial support. When President Nasser learned of the arrangement from the Egyptian embassy in London a few months later, he ordered his son-in-law to return to Cairo and summarily demanded that Marwan divorce his daughter. The pair refused and over time Nasser cooled. He ordered instead that Marwan remain in Cairo, flying to London only to submit his course papers and sit his exams. In the spring of 1969, while the Beatles\u2019 White Album was still clinging to the charts, Marwan visited London, ostensibly to consult a Harley Street doctor about a stomach ailment. According to the rather theatrical account presented by the historian Howard Blum in his 2003 book The Eve of Destruction, a history of the Yom Kippur war, Marwan handed the doctor his x-rays along with a file fat with official Egyptian state documents. He demanded that they be delivered to the Israeli embassy in London. Three days later, an agent from Mossad, the Israeli equivalent of MI6, contacted Marwan as he strolled through Harrods, the London department store (with whose future owner, Mohamed al-Fayed, he would later feud). Not so, say senior Mossad agents \u2013 who narrated their own equally vivid version of the story to the former IDF intelligence analyst Uri Bar-Joseph for his 2010 book, Hamalach (The Angel). Marwan, they claim, called in on the Israeli embassy and requested to speak to a member of the security team. He was turned away \u2013 at least twice \u2013 before he was finally permitted to leave a message. Marwan identified himself by name and stated that he wished to work for Israeli intelligence. He chose not to leave a phone number but, as he was due to return to Egypt the next day, said that he would call again later that afternoon. When he did there was no response. This time Marwan left the phone number of his hotel. Shmuel Goren, the European head of Mossad, was in London at the time. Goren picked up Marwan\u2019s message and immediately recognised the name. Thanks to Marwan\u2019s proximity to Egypt\u2019s leaders, Mossad had already opened a file on him as a potential recruit. They even had a photograph of Marwan to hand, one taken on his wedding day four years earlier. Goren called the number that Marwan had left and, knowing that time was short, told him to remain in his hotel room. The phone rang again. Marwan was to go to a cafe close to the hotel. Inside the cafe, a man sat at one of the tables reading a newspaper. He glanced down at the photograph next to his coffee cup and compared it to the rakish man who had just walked through the front door. Then he looked out of the window and nodded to a second figure waiting outside, who entered the cafe, strode up to Marwan and said: \u201cMr Marwan? I\u2019m pleased to meet you. My name is Misha.\u201d Marwan rose to shake his hand. The man with the newspaper, Shmuel Goren himself, left the building, unnoticed. As they talked, Marwan told Misha (whose real first name was Dubi) about his connections and what he might offer the Israelis. Marwan pushed an envelope across the table. \u201cHere\u2019s a sample of what I can give you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for anything now, but I expect to be compensated at our next meeting.\u201d His fee? $100,000. Mossad doubted Marwan\u2019s intentions. Was he planning to become a double agent in order to feed Israel incorrect information, or to pass secrets back to his father-in-law? Marwan had an answer for this. He was, he told Misha, dismayed with the fact that Egypt had been defeated in the six-day war in 1967. He simply wanted to be on the winning side. After the meeting, Misha reconvened with Goren in a taxi. The pair went over Marwan\u2019s documents as they rode to the embassy. The papers seemed to be genuine. \u201cMaterial like this from a source like this is something that happens once in a thousand years,\u201d Goren said that day, according to the Jerusalem Post. According to Blum, another Mossad agent described the situation \u201cas if we had someone sleeping in Nasser\u2019s bed\u201d. Marwan\u2019s nickname within Mossad shows the near-celestial regard with which he would come to be regarded: Angel. Marwan continued to gain trust in Egypt. Following his father-in-law\u2019s death in September 1970, he supposedly passed secret Israeli documents to Nasser\u2019s successor, Anwar Sadat, and as a result gained more influence. Any doubts that Mossad might still have harboured about Marwan were complicated three years later when, in April 1973, he sent a message to the Israelis warning of an imminent Egyptian attack. Israel sent tens of thousands of reservists and several brigades to the Sinai. No attack came. The state of alert reportedly cost Israel around $35m. On 4 October 1973, the spy again warned Israel of a looming Egyptian assault (Marwan called his case officer from Paris, where he was on a visit with an Egyptian delegation. He said that he wanted to discuss \u201clots of chemicals\u201d \u2013 the agreed-upon code phrase to warn of impending war). At 8am the next morning the Israeli cabinet met in an emergency session. They decided to act upon Marwan\u2019s information and began to mobilise their tanks. This time the information was correct, albeit four hours out: Marwan warned that the Egyptians would strike at sunset. The invasion began four hours earlier, at 2pm.   Related: Nostalgia for Egypt's Nasser | Amira Nowaira    Why did Marwan enter the London cafe that afternoon? He certainly knew that his services would be in demand. At the time, Israel\u2019s population numbered less than three million. The country\u2019s military relied upon reservists, and the government needed informants to help them know when to mobilise those reservists. Marwan\u2019s motivation almost certainly holds the key to decoding his true loyalties, as well as, perhaps, the identity of his eventual killers. Did he, cash-strapped and fuming at his father-in-law, decide to sell his services to Israel in order to become rich? (One source claims that over the course of his career, he received more than $3m from the Israelis.) Or did he, as an impeccable patriot, simply hope to provide Mossad with ruinous information in the role of a double agent? That Marwan worked with the Israelis is not contested. His wife, Mona, has said that, in the early 2000s, she confronted her husband. At first he denied passing information to the Israelis. Later, he admitted he passed information, but claimed that it had been false. What is the truth? Bregman believes he knows the answer. But he is tortured by another question: was he responsible for the spy\u2019s death? * * * \u201cIt\u2019s a big mistake to expose living spies,\u201d Bregman told me, with professorial gravitas. \u201cNever do it. Don\u2019t do it. Even if you get the chance.\u201d Then, to sugar the counsel with flattery: \u201cI can see you are clever. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d We met on a grey February afternoon at his office in King\u2019s College London, an old university full of warren-like corridors and fussy masonry. It was here that Bregman sat on 27 June 2007, awaiting a call from the spy to tell him where the pair could meet later that day. The call never came. Bregman was not unduly concerned. During their five-year relationship, he had grown used to Marwan\u2019s capriciousness \u2013 a spy\u2019s habit born of paranoia and precaution. Clean-shaven, dimpled, with a smiling, half-whisper of a voice that caused me to lean in conspiratorially, Bregman was fidgety and excitable, eager to tell the story and his role in it. (Bregman\u2019s meticulously kept papers on the affair, including transcripts of his conversations with Marwan, are held in the college\u2019s archives; the author of A History of Israel seems keen to have his own place in some future edition.) Bregman is one of the leading historians of Israel\u2019s 20th-century wars (he has written more than 10 books on the subject, and acted as an adviser to the BBC on two related documentaries). But he described himself to me as an \u201cacademic with the soul of a journalist\u201d. His talent for investigative work is clear in the story of how he came to identify Marwan as the renowned agent \u201cAngel\u201d \u2013 the details of which he has never revealed before. \u201cI believed that it was possible to take all of the literature on the Yom Kippur war and triangulate their identity,\u201d he says. As he pored over the documents and memoirs, Bregman\u2019s suspicions grew. Marwan became his white whale. \u201cI needed some kind of confirmation,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just accuse someone of being a spy. Marwan was a very rich man; he could have taken me to court.\u201d     \u2018It\u2019s a big mistake to expose living spies. Never do it, even if you get the chance\u2019 \u2026 historian Ahron Bregman. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian    From 1999, Bregman began to send Marwan his articles, hoping to bait the spy into an admission. None came. Finally, the academic devised a plan. He would travel to Israel and meet the book editor who had published the memoirs of General Eli Zeira, the former director of Israel\u2019s military intelligence, a few years earlier. Zeira, who was fired for acting on the spy\u2019s incorrect information in April 1973, made numerous references in the book to Angel. \u201cMy assumption was that, even if Zeira would never confirm the name, his editor might.\u201d The pair met in a Tel Aviv cafe in 2000. \u201cI planned my meeting very carefully,\u201d says Bregman. The academic sat down and made small talk. \u201cTen minutes into the conversation, when he was warm to me but not tired of me, I asked the question.\u201d Bregman could not have been more direct: \u201cIs Marwan the spy?\u201d The editor looked away and smiled. \u201cThis was my confirmation,\u201d says Bregman. \u201cMarwan was Angel.\u201d In London and in print, Bregman remained cautious. In his first book on the subject, Israel\u2019s Wars, published later in 2000, he referred to Angel elliptically as \u201cNasser\u2019s right-hand man\u201d. He sent Marwan a copy. No response. Emboldened by the snub, Bregman went further in his second book, History of Israel, which was published in September 2002. \u201cI wrote that Angel was one of Nasser\u2019s relatives,\u201d Bregman said. \u201cAnd I claimed that he was sometimes code-named the \u2018son-in-law\u2019.\u201d It was a lie, designed to provoke Marwan and tip off other journalists. Again, Bregman sent Marwan a copy of his book, this time bearing the inscription: \u201cTo Ashraf Marwan, hero of Egypt.\u201d Still nothing. Nevertheless, the plan worked. In Egypt, another journalist arranged an interview with Marwan and asked him directly what he thought of Bregman\u2019s claim. \u201cBregman\u2019s book is a stupid detective story,\u201d Marwan replied. \u201cI was hurt,\u201d Bregman recalled. \u201cI worked on that book for four years. How dare he?\u201d Not only that, Bregman believed that Marwan had \u201cblinked\u201d. By dismissing the book as fiction, rather than threatening to take its author to court for libel, Marwan had, Bregman believed, given him further confirmation. \u201cThe journalist in me knew that I had a scoop. To not expose \u2026 it made no sense.\u201d With a mixture of indignation and triumph, the following week Bregman gave an interview to the Egyptian weekly magazine Al-Ahram Al-Arabi. He met the paper\u2019s journalist in a Starbucks in Wimbledon (close to the Nando\u2019s where, years later, he would hear of Marwan\u2019s death) and, during the course of the conversation, explicitly named Marwan as the spy. In the interview he said: \u201cI have to defend my good name as a historian.\u201d On 29 December 2002, seven days after Bregman\u2019s interview was published in Israel, he was in his garden, sweeping the winter leaves, when his wife called him into the house. There was a phone call. Bregman picked up the receiver. A voice on the other end of the line said, through a thick Arabic accent: \u201cI\u2019m the man that you have written about.\u201d Bregman replied: \u201cHow can I be sure?\u201d The voice said, simply: \u201cYou sent me the book with the dedication \u2026 \u201d The two began a stuttering relationship. Bregman would call Marwan\u2019s secretary in Cairo whenever he wanted to talk. \u201cI would have to send her a fax to verify my identity. She would then pass that on to Marwan, in London, who would call me two minutes later.\u201d Often Marwan would call, say nothing, hang up and call again minutes later \u2013 \u201cspy stuff\u201d, Bregman said. He\u2019d identify himself only as \u201cthe subject of your book\u201d. He warned Bregman that all of his calls were recorded by both the Egyptian and British intelligence services. Contrary to Bregman\u2019s expectations, Marwan was not angry. \u201cI had confused him, I think,\u201d he says. \u201cAn academic, out of the blue, saying things \u2026 He was logical. He understood that his secret was out. He was clever. He turned me. He was charming, but also someone who could be very cruel. You could see. He used his charm. He turned me into his defender. All of a sudden I saw not the elusive spy, but the person with heart problems. The person with stress and all of the rest.\u201d Bregman recalls that many of the calls were long. \u201cHe had nobody to talk to about all of this. You can\u2019t discuss [espionage] with your wife or kids.\u201d Eventually Bregman asked whether he could write Marwan\u2019s biography. Marwan declined. \u201cHe wanted the story to die. No biography.\u201d This is puzzling in the light of the alleged missing memoir. Why would Marwan begin to write his autobiography if he wanted the story to go away? \u201cThe billion-dollar question,\u201d Bregman told me. \u201cDid he actually ever work on the book? Perhaps it was his way to stop me from writing mine.\u201d As the months passed and Marwan asked Bregman\u2019s advice on the writing process \u2013 he even asked Bregman to edit the book when he was finished with it \u2013 the academic became increasingly suspicious. \u201cI\u2019d ask him from time to time: what\u2019s the name of the book? When will it be ready? Is it in English or Arabic? He told me it was in English because Arabs don\u2019t read books.\u201d After Marwan\u2019s death, finding proof of the memoir\u2019s existence became an obsession for Bregman. He contacted every archive in the UK and the US to see if Marwan had left any copies. Only one respondent got back to him: Mary Curry, a librarian from the national archives in Washington. In a long email, Curry confirmed that Marwan had visited the archives twice, in January and March 2007, both times unannounced. Curry helped Marwan to search for his name on a database of declassified US government documents. It turned up in a transcript of a conversation between Henry Kissinger and Ismail Fahmi, the Egyptian foreign minister, from the mid-1970s, in which the three men discussed an arms deal. Marwan walked with a cane. He never mentioned a memoir. After he left the second time, Marwan sent Curry two boxes of Godiva chocolates. He never returned. Bregman told the police that he believed there was a book, but now he is unconvinced. Despite repeated requests, he never saw a word. The pair met only once in person, in October 2003. Marwan initially invited Bregman to meet at the Dorchester hotel. \u201cFor Israelis like me, the Dorchester is a nightmare,\u201d said Bregman. (It was at the Dorchester, in June 1982, that members of a Palestinian splinter group shot the Israeli ambassador to the UK, triggering the Lebanon war, in which Bregman fought as an artillery officer.) Bregman asked that the men meet, instead, at the InterContinental in Park Lane. Marwan was already fearful for his life. He told Bregman that Howard Blum\u2019s 2003 book on the Yom Kippur war, which explicitly named him as Angel and outlined in detail how the spy began working for the Israelis, was \u201can invitation to assassinate me\u201d. Their relationship was remote but persistent; Bregman believes Marwan wanted him to tell the version of the story that the spy wanted out there. Nevertheless, their friendship had strands of affection. Marwan was also lonely, Bregman said. Then, in 2007, the relationship became, as Bregman puts it, \u201cmuch more dramatic\u201d, with the panicked answerphone messages. While Bregman had placed Marwan in some danger by exposing him as Angel, this was still only the word of a historian. No higher power had offered confirmation of the fact. This was to come soon enough. In Israel, Marwan had become the subject of a high-profile court case between two senior Israeli officers, General Zeira (whose book editor had tipped off Bregman to Marwan\u2019s identity) and Zvi Zamir, the former head of Mossad. Zamir accused Zeira of leaking Marwan\u2019s identity to the press. Zeira sued Zamir for libel. The case dragged on until, finally, the judge, Theodore Or (\u201ca very tough guy\u201d, according to Bregman), ruled on 25 March 2007 that Zeira had leaked the identity of Angel to unauthorised persons. The verdict became public three months later, on 14 June. Within 13 days, Marwan was dead. When Bregman saw the reports of the verdict, in which a judge officially named Marwan as \u201cAngel\u201d for the first time, he immediately wrote to Marwan, to warn him that his life might be in danger. By mistake, Bregman, who had been warned by Marwan not to call any more, sent the letter to the spy\u2019s old address. \u201cUsually he would get back to me within 48 hours,\u201d he says. \u201cI heard nothing for a week.\u201d When Marwan eventually received the letter, he left a trio of panicked messages on Bregman\u2019s answerphone, all within the space of an hour. \u201cIt was unheard-of,\u201d Bregman says. \u201cThe first time this had happened in five years.\u201d This was how Ahron Bregman came to be waiting in his office for a call from Ashraf Marwan on the day of the spy\u2019s death. And this is how Bregman came to feel tremendous guilt. \u201cI was a big hero when I exposed him,\u201d Bregman later wrote. \u201cBut a very small one after he died.\u201d \u201cLook,\u201d Bregman said, quietly now. \u201cWith journalists, we are sometimes so determined to crack the nut that we forget that there are things around us. Your family. His family. We are human beings. And then you hear a voice. You hear him breathing. You hear him tell you about his heart problems. And this person that you\u2019ve seen all this time as a superhero spy, someone made of gold and all the rest? That is not true. He is a human being.\u201d Did Marwan jump or was he pushed? \u201cKilling him didn\u2019t have to be a physical push,\u201d Bregman told me. \u201cYou can say to a person: you have two sons. If you want us to leave them alone, you should jump \u2026 Maybe something like that. But the inquest couldn\u2019t decide.\u201d As to which nation or organisation might have been behind the push, be it physical or psychological? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cThe British, maybe they know something. It\u2019s here somewhere.\u201d * * * If the British do know something, then they have not blinked. The police identified the two men who were standing on Marwan\u2019s balcony when he fell to his death, but have never made their names public. All information pertaining to Marwan\u2019s life or death is, as of 30 July 2015, subject to no fewer than six freedom of information exemptions, including:  Section 23(5) \u2013 Information relating to Security Bodies Section 24(2) \u2013 National SecuritySection 27(4) \u2013 International Relations  Hosni Mubarak, the president of Egypt at the time of Marwan\u2019s death, is the only national leader to have publicly suggested a culprit (curveball: Libyans). If Egypt was behind Marwan\u2019s murder, they certainly made it look otherwise. The spy\u2019s funeral in Cairo was stately: the Egyptian flag and Marwan\u2019s military decorations adorned the coffin. Mubarak\u2019s son, Gamal, was in attendance, and the president even issued a statement saying: \u201cI do not doubt his loyalty.\u201d But neither does Zvi Zamir, the former head of Mossad. Marwan spied loyally for the Israelis for reasons of \u201cmoney and ego\u201d, Zamir told me, in an interview from his apartment in Tel Aviv arranged by Uri Bar-Joseph. Now 90, Zamir is also haunted by his former agent\u2019s death. \u201cNot a single day passes without my torturing myself over the question of whether I could have protected him better,\u201d he wrote, in his own memoir, With Open Eyes.     Ashraf Marwan\u2019s funeral in Cairo on 1 Jul 2007.  Photograph: Nasser Nuri/Reuters/Corbis    At the time of the inquest, Marwan\u2019s wife, Mona, said that she believed Mossad agents murdered her husband. But this seems unlikely. For one thing, killing a former agent after his name is revealed would seem to be a major disincentive for new recruits. Even if Israel believed that Marwan was a double agent, working for the Egyptians, better to do nothing and, through their silence, imply he was faithful to their cause. And in all this talk of whom Marwan worked for, the question of who Marwan was has been lost. In late June, six months after my first attempt at making contact with Marwan\u2019s family, a reply arrived from Ahmed, the late spy\u2019s younger son. (The family\u2019s British lawyer, John Harding, was copied in.) Ahmed agreed to meet me during a visit to London from his home in Cairo in early July. Just after midnight one Sunday morning I received an email, telling me to be in a hotel lobby in Green Park the following day. I arrived on time; 15 minutes later, Ahmed entered through the sliding doors, and beckoned me outside. Charming and stubbled, handsome at 44, with the resonant voice of a chain smoker (he drags, with Gallic commitment, on a Philip Morris cigarette between each equally deliberate sentence). We sat outside, in a neighbouring cafe. I pulled my phone out of my pocket to record our conversation, concerned that we wouldn\u2019t be heard over the ambient timpani of pneumatic drills and car horns. \u201cI guess we\u2019re both going to record this,\u201d Ahmed replied, placing his identical phone next to mine. He remembers his father in superlatives. Marwan was \u201cthe kindest man\u201d, \u201cthe most human individual\u201d, \u201cfull of life\u201d, \u201cvery funny\u201d. He \u201chardly ever lost his temper\u201d and was \u201ca very deliberate\u201d individual. Ahmed moved with his father to London at the age of nine, the year before President Sadat\u2019s assassination (contrary to many reports). All he remembers of his father in those early years was that he travelled and read a great deal. Ahmed and his father were close. They spoke most days, sometimes more than once. They\u2019d talk about football. \u201cHe was a wise individual,\u201d he says. \u201cI enjoyed talking to him.\u201d Ahmed was in a meeting in Cairo when his father died. His secretary rang to ask if he was OK, not realising that he didn\u2019t know yet. Ahmed told her that he was in a meeting and put the phone down. Eventually, the message came through from Ahmed\u2019s older brother, Gamal: \u201cPappy is in the hands of God.\u201d He arrived in London the following day at 6am. I asked him about his mental state in all of the confusion. Did he want to know what happened? \u201cWe know what happened,\u201d he said, quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear what happened.\u201d It\u2019s a strange response in a case that remains notorious for its lack of clarity. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt is imperative that I am very careful and choosy of my words,\u201d he said, after a moment. \u201cThere was an inquest. And in the inquest a lot of evidence was presented. And the judge said he rejects the possibility that my late father took his own life. There is no evidence to support that whatsoever. So it\u2019s clear what did not happen. \u201cNow, to talk in terms of what did happen, you need certain amounts of evidence. The way things developed meant there was no single individual that a finger could be pointed towards. But it\u2019s very clear what did not happen. It was important to get that settled. For my faith. For our family. For history.\u201d Surely, the knowledge that his father did not commit suicide only opens up fresh questions, I said. Those questions niggle at me. Has he made his peace with the mystery? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m at peace,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I accept what happened. I accept \u2026 \u201d A long and difficult pause. \u201cI accept that my father is no longer here. It\u2019s a fact. Do I miss him? Yes. Do I wish we spent more time together? Yes. He was young. Very young. It\u2019s what happened. What else can you do? We\u2019re never going to find a name to say who did this. Sometimes one has to accept the limitations of what one can do.\u201d     Mona Marwan (centre) and Ahmed Marwan (centre right), widow and son of Ashraf Marwan, leaving court in London after the 2010 inquest into his death returned no verdict.  Photograph: Carl Court/AFP/Getty    \u201cWhy do you think he was killed?\u201d I asked. \u201cI have to be very choosy \u2026 \u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause we are talking about \u2026 I am a father.\u201d \u201cAre you worried there would be repercussions, even now?\u201d \u201cThere are always consequences for what people say and do. However, things are settled in court. Things are settled internally. Things are settled in society. History just unfolds. That\u2019s why I choose to be careful.\u201d \u201cWho killed your father?\u201d Another pause. \u201cSomeone saw it in their interest,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had a reason to do it. It\u2019s very easy to look at: who was this individual? What did he do? Then you can start seeing a bunch of possibilities. \u201cAs the saying goes,\u201d he continued, \u201cif you don\u2019t see the sun at noon, it\u2019s because you don\u2019t want to see it. It\u2019s right there.\u201d * * * Midway through our conversation, the phone rings: it\u2019s Mona. The incoming call paused Ahmed\u2019s recording, and he frantically sent his mother to answerphone. Soon, she called again; apologising, Ahmed answered in Arabic, and stood and walked to the end of the street, out of earshot. I sat wondering why Ahmed had met with me, a foreign journalist; I imagined that Mona, who surely knew of our meeting, was checking in to see how things were going, to make sure he hadn\u2019t said anything that might put them in danger. And then I remembered something Bregman had told me months earlier, about the sense of peace he felt after his secret was out. \u201cYou are only in danger when you have the information inside you,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as it\u2019s released, you\u2019re not important any more.\u201d Perhaps. When Ahmed returned to the table, I asked him whether all of this had spoiled London. Until recently, he said, wherever he walked, he would see his father: the tailors in which they bought their suits, the shop where they bought chocolate bars, the pizza place where he would always order the same thing, decade in, decade out. Then, as sudden as it was gradual, Ahmed said that he felt settled when he visited the city. \u201cLondon is London and the memories are there,\u201d he said. \u201cI can be sad that he is not here with me any more. I can also be full of joy and fondness remembering all these times together. Eight years \u2026 is enough time for wounds to start healing.\u201d I asked Ahmed what he had learned from his father. \u201cHe once told me: \u2018Ahmed. Everything you want to know in the world is public. You just have to look at it and research it and put the dots together. Anything and everything you want to know is there for us to see.\u2019\u201d A few weeks after I met Marwan\u2019s youngest son, I contacted Bregman again. I asked him why he thinks Ahmed was so careful with his words. \u201cBecause he believes it is a murder,\u201d he replied. \u201cBetter to shut up. It\u2019s too dangerous otherwise. This world is extremely murky.\u201d I recall that Bregman dedicated his book to Marwan, a \u201chero of Egypt\u201d. And yet, after spending so much time considering the case, it was hard not to conclude that Egypt had the most to gain through Marwan\u2019s death, just as they had the most to lose from a formal admission in a memoir that Marwan had double-crossed them. Then there are those other Egyptian bodies, thrown from high-rise London buildings. Marwan\u2019s murder is another stitch in a pattern that\u2019s difficult to ignore. I asked Bregman bluntly what he would say to refute my impression that the Egyptians had a hand in Marwan\u2019s death. He answered, plainly: \u201cI would not.\u201d Bregman patiently answered my final questions while he was supposed to be relaxing on a holiday in Wyoming. The symbolism is clear; this is a story that won\u2019t leave the historian alone. Eight years on, and still he cannot flee the questions. And yet he chooses to reply, even when he has no answers \u2013 no doubt because they are the same questions he continues to ask of himself. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether Marwan died because of me,\u201d Bregman said, \u201cbut what I do know is that it was not a good idea to unmask a living spy. It was a big mistake.\u201d \u201cI have never put the matter to rest,\u201d he tells me, before we finally say goodbye. \u201cIt is just too big.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.", "publicationDate": "2015-09-15T07:44:49Z", "title": "Who killed the 20th century\u2019s greatest spy? | Simon Parkin", "sentences": ["\u201cMy assumption was that, even if Zeira would never confirm the name, his editor might.\u201d The pair met in a Tel Aviv cafe in 2000.", "Marwan spied loyally for the Israelis for reasons of \u201cmoney and ego\u201d, Zamir told me, in an interview from his apartment in Tel Aviv arranged by Uri Bar-Joseph."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/15/who-killed-20th-centurys-greatest-spy-ashraf-marwan"}, {"tags": ["Champions League", "Maccabi Tel Aviv", "Chelsea", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Had things turned out differently, Slavisa Jokanovic would have had to wait another three months for his return to Stamford Bridge. He would have sat down in the visiting dugout on Boxing Day, glancing to his left at the contingent of away supporters with whom he had shared emotional celebrations eight months previously. But Jokanovic and Watford were not to last the course and instead he returns ahead of schedule on Wednesday, with another yellow-clad team and on a yet more rarified level. \u201cWe\u2019re not coming to London to go shopping,\u201d says Jokanovic of a talented Maccabi Tel Aviv side that has flourished under his short tenure. The Serb\u2019s departure from Watford, where he made sense of chaos to win promotion to the Premier League after joining them two months into last season, was surprising on certain levels, but any points he needed to prove have been well made since. Jokanovic took the Israeli champions past Hibernians, Viktoria Plzen and Basel in the qualifying stages \u2013 the latter an especially notable scalp \u2013 within weeks of his arrival and they will now contest a Champions League group stage campaign for the first time in 11 years.   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Chelsea face ghosts of 2007 when Maccabi Tel Aviv visit | Dominic Fifield    \u201cIt was not a hard decision to come here,\u201d says Jokanovic of an appointment that was made a little under three weeks after he left Vicarage Road. \u201cI had several offers but wanted a club with a clear plan. Jordi Cruyff [Maccabi\u2019s director of football since 2012] explained to me that the Maccabi has made big steps in Israel and now its desire is to achieve something in Europe. He said that the Europa League could be our big target, and the Champions League our big dream. \u201cActually, we surprised everybody. We beat some good teams with experience of the group stage and now we\u2019re going to try and surprise people again, starting on Wednesday.\u201d Chelsea and Jokanovic have both changed since, in October 2000, he became one of Claudio Ranieri\u2019s first signings at Stamford Bridge. His two seasons at the club saw consecutive sixth-placed league finishes and, it turns out, an unhappy experience exiting the Uefa Cup to Maccabi\u2019s city rivals Hapoel. An intelligent defensive midfielder who had spent the previous nine years in Spain, Jokanovic was 32 when he came to London and struggled to make a significant impact during a period when Chelsea were experiencing growing pains. \u201cI was very happy in London but it was probably not the best period in my football career,\u201d he says. \u201cI had some problems adapting to English football, but generally I enjoyed playing for such a big club and the experience certainly helped my coaching career \u2013 especially last season in the Championship. \u201cBut it is a different time now. I played for a big Chelsea but it is even bigger now, with a totally different team. It\u2019s a great opportunity for us to go there and we arrive at an important for Chelsea, so we will try to find our chance and give a great performance.\u201d It does not seem a bad time to revisit his old stomping ground in search of a shock, with Chelsea sitting an improbable 17th in the Premier League after five games and lacking in both zip and resilience. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of an embarrassing start for them, but they\u2019re going to be 100% motivated to try to fix their problems,\u201d he says. \u201cThere could be some nerves in the stadium at the beginning of the game, but I\u2019m sure they will find a solution soon. We need to arrive there, respect our supporters and respect ourselves \u2013 fully concentrated and following our plan to try and hurt them.\u201d Jokanovic is evidently consumed by his new environment but is candid when explaining that he had not banked on leaving Watford. There had been reports that his high wage demands \u2013 he had been on a short-term contract until the end of the season \u2013 put paid to a new deal and led to the club\u2019s pursuit to Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores. But he says discussions with the Pozzo family never got that far. \u201cI believed I was going to stay at Watford,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt a little surprised [when I left] because I thought things were going to be different. It wasn\u2019t a question about contracts. Many people have been talking about money but it\u2019s not true. We did not have any serious negotiations; they hadn\u2019t shown interest in my signing a contract and I interpreted that they had other plans. They decided to sign a new coach and start on a slightly different project, and that\u2019s it. \u201cBut it\u2019s part of the business and I accept it. I\u2019m not frustrated or angry with Watford. They gave me a great chance to work in England, and it\u2019s not easy for foreign coaches to arrive and get that kind of opportunity. I believe I did a good job there and was very happy with the team, the club and the fans, but in life many different things happen. I\u2019m in a different place now so where\u2019s the problem? Watford wanted to change the situation and what they did was completely legal.\u201d Jokanovic is proud of what he created at Vicarage Road, where he inherited a side that had already had three managers in 2014-15, and believes the club is ready to establish itself at the top level. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of what we made of the season,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a great achievement. There were problems at first, because we started well when I arrived but had a very bad period in November and December. We all kept believing and eventually made history for the club. \u201cWatford wants to improve and keep getting bigger, and now it has the chance to reach different targets. I\u2019m sure the coach, staff and supporters will be successful in reaching them.\u201d Israel is the sixth country in which Jokanovic, 47, has worked, and he says he is comfortable with the peripatetic life of a coach. He holds out hope that the sum of his experiences will eventually be a return to England, where you sense that \u2013 despite his equanimity \u2013 there remains unfinished business for varying reasons after his experiences at Chelsea and Watford. For now, he is enjoying the high-speed ride on which he and Maccabi are travelling. \u201cI am still a young guy and in the future you never know, I will hopefully find a chance to come back to England and work in the most important league in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI am a sportsman \u2013 I\u2019ve won and lost many battles, and in front of me there are many more to come. I\u2019m very happy where I am now, in a wonderful club and city, and I am enjoying my moment.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-09-15T10:00:14Z", "title": "Slavisa Jokanovic\u2019s return to Chelsea arrives three months early", "sentences": ["\u201cWe\u2019re not coming to London to go shopping,\u201d says Jokanovic of a talented Maccabi Tel Aviv side that has flourished under his short tenure.", "Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Chelsea face ghosts of 2007 when Maccabi Tel Aviv visit | Dominic Fifield    \u201cIt was not a hard decision to come here,\u201d says Jokanovic of an appointment that was made a little under three weeks after he left Vicarage Road."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/15/slavisa-jokanovics-return-to-chelsea-arrives-three-months-early"}, {"tags": ["Jos\u00e9 Mourinho", "Chelsea", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho will make changes to his Chelsea lineup for their opening Champions League group game against Maccabi Tel Aviv on Wednesday as he seeks to revive his side after their worst start to a top-flight campaign in 29 years, though he bristled at suggestions that on past form his third season was when everything generally went wrong.

Mourinho trained with a 23-man squad at Cobham on Tuesday which included Oscar and Baba Rahman with only Radamel Falcao, who is nursing a slight tendon injury, absent. His side have won only once to date this season and languish just above the relegation zone in the Premier League, already 11 points from Manchester City at the top, with European competition potentially offering some respite from domestic toils. \u201cWe are not all smiles, laughing and joking,\u201d said Mourinho, who has seen players such as Branislav Ivanovic and Nemanja Matic labour to date this season. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic answer. When people are not getting their success that you work for, and I promise you we work a lot for that, people are frustrated and not happy. That\u2019s basic. \u201cI have a squad. I trust the squad and I don\u2019t have to play with the same XI. I can make changes. I know the consequences of that because, if I make a couple of changes in my team, instead of you saying \u2018he has a squad, he has more options, he is looking for a new dynamic, he wants to give a couple of chances to people who have been working hard\u2019, I know what you will say. If I leave out Azpilicueta it\u2019s \u2018because I have a problem with him\u2019. The same with Terry, the same with F\u00e0bregas. I know the consequences. \u201cBut I cannot be worried about that. I have to be just worried about my team and players. Yes I will make a couple of changes because I have to try and different dynamic, I have to try and couple of different faces, and to give chances to people who have not been playing but have been working hard. I promise you we are working. When we say business as usual, it\u2019s true. Business as usual, with one difference. We are not happy.\u201d Mourinho, who was backed publicly by his goalkeeper Asmir Begovic, insisted he was not under pressure despite the team\u2019s slack start as \u201cthey have beaten only West Bromwich Albion to date this term\u201d and intimated he was afforded different treatment to other managers. \u201cThe only real problem we have is we don\u2019t have good results,\u201d he added.

The former Scotland manager Craig Levein may not have been the greatest tactician in the world, but the man had a mighty fine beard. His face fungus was blessed with magic properties. Depending on Scotland\u2019s fortunes, his bellwether bristles would vary in length from a trim-and-tidy Noel Edmonds to the rather more outr\u00e9 Alfresco Competitively Priced Cider Consumer, providing fans nationwide with an easy-to-read metaphor for the state of their team. As if the scorelines weren\u2019t enough. Chelsea boss Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has been known to try this trick too, albeit with the hair on top of his head rather than the stuff growing from his constantly moving chin. Sometime during his first stint at Stamford Bridge, you may remember Mourinho shaving his lustrous coiffure to a severe close crop. This was read as a signal that he was pathetically seeking attention, but also that he was ready to get down to serious business. Now, with Chelsea having suffered their worst start to a league season since the days of Bobby Campbell, and so tactically befuddled one could be forgiven for thinking Brendan Rodgers was still on staff, it appears to have been time for yet another symbolic shave. Mourinho unveiled his new short style in a press conference before Wednesday\u2019s Big Cup humiliation against Maccabi Tel Aviv, and was immediately asked about its significance. \u201cI am fine, I promise you,\u201d he sighed. \u201cMy haircut isn\u2019t as radical as it has been.\u201d And to be fair to the Chelsea boss, it was clear he needed a trim before Steven Naismith did his thing at Goodison last weekend, his usually debonair George Clooney quiff veering dangerously close to Douglas Hurd territory. So it could just be a coincidence. But just as Jos\u00e9 was \u201cready to go to war\u201d when sporting his suedehead all those years ago, so he appears in equally combative mood this time round too. At the mere mention of his much-discussed third-season syndrome \u2013 after 24 months at a club, Mourinho famously either swans off or sits around with a face on \u2013 he quite literally bristled. \u201cAt Porto I didn\u2019t have a third season. My third season at Inter I didn\u2019t have. My third season at Chelsea in first time I won FA Cup and [Milk] Cup and I played [Big Cup] semi. Third season in Madrid I won Super Cup, lost the Cup final, and I went to [Big Cup] semi. These are my third seasons so click Google instead of stupid questions.\u201d None of which quite answered the concerns over his long-term commitment to the Chelsea project, but The Fiver wasn\u2019t going to chance any follow-up questions, going through life as we do abiding by the safety-first principle of no hair, no argument.

Director David Farr, one of six British-based film-makers on the panel, said that the UK still had a \u201ckind of madness\u201d around the subject. A number of the directors agreed that the perception of British film-making as either period drama or gritty social realism was limiting the industry. \u201cThe films that really drive me mad are the posh films about posh people made by posh people,\u201d said Farr, whose feature debut, The Ones Below - about a middle-class couples\u2019 psychological battle with their downstairs neighbours - premieres in Toronto today. \u201cMost of them are set in about 1930 and there\u2019s always a king. They\u2019re the ones that create the problem and we all shuffle around underneath this dreadful, awful thing. And that\u2019s the bit [of the industry] you need to blow up\u201d. Tom Geens, a Belgium-born film-maker who moved to London 20 years ago, said there were not enough films about the middle-classes being made. He championed film-makers like Andrew Haigh and Joanna Hogg for exploring that area of British life. \u201cI want to see more stories about the gentrified people and go into uncompromising stories about them,\u201d he said. \u201cUncomfortable stories about the middle classes, which you rarely see in the UK. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of the ignored class in a way, because it\u2019s a lot of middle class people making films about [the] working class or gangs or drug dealers or council estates\u201d. Michael Caton-Jones directed Urban Hymn, a low-budget drama about a disturbed teenager (newcomer Letitia Wright) learning to channel her energy into singing with the help of her social worker (Shirley Henderson). He said that the middle-classes had had quite enough say in the film industry already. \u201cFilming is essentially a bourgeois sport,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most loathsome kind of film is this heritage Britain: basically shilling for tourists to get people to come and visit the place. And it\u2019s a kind of cultural dead end. \u201cUnfortunately the middle class have this cultural chokehold on what we get to make. If I sound bitter, it\u2019s because I am,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost been ghettoised. Like the country. You can make an expensive picture with a Redmayne or a Cumberbatch, or you can go down the estates and hug some hoodies. That\u2019s basically your choice\u201d.     Director Michael Caton-Jones Photograph: Fred Thornhill/Reuters    Another issue blocking artists is financiers reluctance to take a risk on anything that might prove confusing to an American audience, said director Elaine Constantine. Constantine, from Lancashire, brings her film Northern Soul, about the popular UK music scene, to Toronto. \u201cWe\u2019re playing poor relative to the US market,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything that\u2019s produced has to be appealing to the American audience because of our language. I\u2019ve been in so many meetings where people have said \u2018You can\u2019t do a film about the north and have people going \u2018Eeeee \u2026 bloody hell\u2019 because the Americans won\u2019t understand\u2019.\u201d Finally, the panel addressed London\u2019s property crisis. Farr described the gap between rich and poor as \u201camazingly wide\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re at a real crux moment for the city,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the last 20 years there\u2019s been this unbelievable creative explosion. But I feel right now the city is at a sort of breaking point: there were the huge social issues that lead to the riots, the massive issue around land. \u201cLike all cities where art explodes what happens is that money follows very, very fast. In some areas of London now, what used to be real proper artist areas \u2026 you can\u2019t live there. It\u2019s simply not possible\u201d. Caton-Jones said the best thing about London was that it\u2019s a mosaic, with many areas where rich and poor live side-by-side. He said the film industry needs to make a greater effort to show that reality on screen. \u201cI don\u2019t see films that reflect that too often,\u201d he said.  The City to City strand is a part of the festival programme designed to highlight work from a city \u201cundergoing a disturbance or transformation\u201d, said festival director and CEO Piers Handling, who chaired the talk. In previous years the strand has put the spotlight on films from cities as varied as Seoul, Tel Aviv and Buenos Aires.

The Premier League champions are enduring their worst opening to a top-flight season in 29 years, having won only once in five games to date to trail Manchester City by 11 points, and confront Arsenal at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Mourinho trained with 23 players at Cobham on Tuesday and intends to utilise his squad against the Israelis with Baba Rahman expected to debut at left-back, Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my to a make a first appearance since the Community Shield, and Oscar returning after injury in attacking midfield. Mourinho is without Radamel Falcao, who is nursing a slight tendon injury, while Pedro Rodr\u00edguez has a minor thigh problem. Yet, while the Israelis will hope to emulate Basel and Schalke over the last two seasons by emerging with reward from an opening-round visit to Stamford Bridge, the Portuguese will take the opportunity to grant some of his experienced players some respite \u2013 Ivanovic principal among them \u2013 as he seeks to kick-start a recovery.           Jos\u00e9 Mourinho tells reporters: Google instead of asking stupid questions.    \u201cI have a squad, I trust the squad and I don\u2019t have to play with the same XI,\u201d he said. \u201cI can make changes. I know the consequences of that because, if I make a couple of changes in my team, instead of you saying, \u2018He has a squad, he has more options, he is looking for a new dynamic, he wants to give a couple of chances to people who have been working hard,\u2019 I know what you will say. If I leave out Azpilicueta it\u2019s \u2018because I have a problem with him\u2019. The same with Terry, the same with F\u00e0bregas. So I know the consequences. \u201cBut I cannot be worried about that. I have to be just worried about my team and players. Yes I will make a couple of changes because I have to try and [create a] different dynamic, I have to try a couple of different faces, and to give chances to people who have not been playing but have been working hard. I promise you we are all working. When we say business as usual, it\u2019s true. Business as usual, with one difference: we are not happy.\u201d Loftus-Cheek, the 19-year-old midfielder who made his first-team debut in the Champions League against Sporting Lisbon, started twice in the Premier League towards the end of last season but has found his opportunities limited to 17 minutes in the defeat to Crystal Palace to date this term. He will most likely replace the rested Nemanja Matic and operate alongside F\u00e0bregas, whose own form has been fitful, as Chelsea pursue a victory to boost ailing morale. Mourinho was backed publicly by his goalkeeper Asmir Begovic, who will make his debut in this competition in the absence of the injured Thibaut Courtois, but bristled at suggestions he has struggled to maintain his previous teams\u2019 progress into a third season at his former clubs. \u201cMy third season in Porto? I didn\u2019t have a third season,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Inter, I didn\u2019t have a third season. My third season at Chelsea the first time, I won the FA Cup and the Carling Cup, and I played the Champions League semi-finals. \u201cThe third season in Real Madrid I won the SuperCup, lost the cup final, and I went to the Champions League semi-finals. These are my third seasons. So click Google instead of asking stupid questions. You spoke about the third season, and I\u2019m telling you the question is stupid.\u201d Asked whether he is enjoying working towards building a new dynasty at Chelsea, he added: \u201cAsking about building dynasties is a different question. I haven\u2019t done that before. This will be the first time I\u2019m trying to do that, so I don\u2019t have previous experience from the past. \u201cThe only real problem we have is we don\u2019t have good results. Our lives are about getting good results but, you know, at other clubs you have to go back two, three, five, six, 10 years to remember good results. In our case you have to go back three months. Three months we were the best team in the country, the best manager, the players. Why are some managers not in difficult situations five, six, 10 years [without winning trophies], and I am the current champion of England? So why should I be in trouble? Why? \u201cWe\u2019re not happy, but we know what we are. It\u2019s the same music the fans sing every game: we know what we are, champions of England. Our start has been so, so bad, but nobody can steal our trophies, our history. Nobody can do that. You can try, but you can\u2019t do that. We know what we are.

That\u2019s when Mourinho isn\u2019t plotting to strengthen his defence with the acquisition of Valencia left-back Jos\u00e9 Luis Gay\u00e0, over whom he might be set for an arm wrestle with Manchester City and Real Madrid. The 20-year-old has played for Spain at all youth levels and established himself at the Mestalla last season. When Mourinho isn\u2019t agonising over the threat posed by Maccabi Tel Aviv, he\u2019s also pondering the most plausible way of prising holding player R\u00faben Neves, just 18, from his old club Porto. \u201cOffer them a large amount of money\u201d is probably the best advice here. Slightly less money could be offered to Under-21 league aficionado V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s, who could be deployed to join Asmir Begovic in deputising unsteadily for Thibaut Courtois. Swansea don\u2019t want a defender or a defensive midfielder \u2013 they have designs further forward and, having been linked with Ahmed Elmohamady on Tuesday, there\u2019s now a suggestion that they would like Leeds\u2019 versatile wide man Sam Byram, one of an very exciting crop of young players currently developing at Elland Road. Bournemouth haven\u2019t had a lot of luck with the fitness of their bigger-money signings, Tyrone Mings and Max Gradel both succumbing to long-term injury within weeks of arriving on the south coast. Perhaps the freebie market will bring them better luck, and they\u2019re said to be closing in on the ex-Inter Milan midfielder Alessandro Cannataro, who has also piqued the interest of Leicester. Everybody loves a serialised autobiography because it means you don\u2019t actually have to buy it. In the latest offering from Steven Gerrard\u2019s memoir, he waxes lyrical about Philippe Coutinho and says it won\u2019t be too long before he\u2019s snapped up by Real Madrid or Barcelona. Yes, we know, but it\u2019s mid-September and it\u2019s the night after another Champions League out-tacticking so we take what gruel is available. Is Saido Berahino staying at West Brom? Never judge a boy on rash social media postings, they said \u2013 but his latest offering is a picture of him participating in the Baggies\u2019 team photo and, for that matter, not getting completely Ashley Coled. And finally, another player who might be going absolutely nowhere \u2013 or not to another club, anyway. Remember the buccaneering season enjoyed by Michu in 2012-13 \u2013 the same Michu who was believed to be among the No1 picks of the Premier League\u2019s top club after scoring 22 goals for Swansea, whom he had joined for a relative pittance. Well, Michu is apparently pondering retirement at the age of just 29, having reached an impasse with the Swans over the paying-off of the final year of his contract. It\u2019s either that, or join Celtic.

The indomitable forward, whose form has been dazzling enough to ignite debate about where he stands in the pantheon of footballers to come out of Israel, has already helped himself to seven goals in five Champions League games, which were instrumental in carrying Maccabi Tel Aviv through the qualification process all the way to Europe\u2019s grandest stage. Zahavi is Maccabi\u2019s talisman. Their captain, top scorer and figurehead has a habit of scoring pivotal goals. His knack for late strikes is finely tuned. He carries himself on the pitch with the kind of self-belief that ensures he will arrive at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday eager to take on a Chelsea defence feeling the heat. Zahavi was billed for a long time as an attacking midfielder rather than a striker, but prolific statistics underline how potent and clinical he has become. Since signing for Maccabi in January 2013 he has scored 80 times in 107 appearances. His game is marked by a drive to score again and again, and he has the tools to deliver in a variety of ways \u2013 left foot, right foot, strong in the air, with close predatory instincts and long-range ambition. He moves quickly and carefully off the ball, always looking for spaces to exploit and errors to punish.   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Chelsea face ghosts of 2007 when Maccabi Tel Aviv visit | Dominic Fifield    At the age of 28, there is the feel of a slow burn about Zahavi\u2019s productivity. His club are simply delighted to have him. There was talk of a move to a more challenging league not long ago, with rumours that Tottenham and Borussia Dortmund were among the interested parties, but a new contract has made him the best-paid player in the country. He earns \u20ac1m (\u00a3740,000) per season, but he\u2019s all but paid that entire contract back with his heroics in qualifying Maccabi to this season\u2019s Champions League group stage. In the play-off match against Basel he was outstanding in both the technical and psychological elements of a close tie. Two classy goals away from home, and the decisive strike at home as his side went through on away goals after a 3-3 aggregate draw, added to the local legend. In Tel Aviv, attitudes towards Zahavi very much depend on club loyalty. He has played for two city rivals, first as a young player at Hapoel before his current reign at Maccabi. In between the two he spent a brief period in Serie A with Palermo. Not the most stable of clubs, it was a tough period for Zahavi. He suffered under the pressure demanded of him to replace Javier Pastore, who had left for Paris Saint-Germain. It was hard to hold down a regular position, find a rhythm, settle into a team that was not designed to get the best from him. Zahavi is a player who cherishes feeling the coach\u2019s confidence, and he enjoys the responsibility of being a central hub for his team. That has come at Maccabi. The decision to join them when he returned from Italy, rather than return to Hapoel, remains deeply controversial. There were whispers that he was offered more money to go to Maccabi and was willing to earn less to go back to Hapoel. A blame game ensued. Why did he go to Maccabi in that case? As is common where local enmity is involved, everybody puts the blame in the direction that suits them. It\u2019s history now \u2013 albeit a passionate history. His trademark celebration, shooting imaginary pistols, began in a Maccabi-Hapoel game. In a Tel Aviv derby last November, Zahavi scored an equalising penalty and was then confronted by a bare-chested pitch invader. He retaliated, kicking out as the fan aimed a foot at him. It prompted a brawl amongst the players and more pitch invasions. Zahavi, in the eye of the storm, was sent off. The game was eventually abandoned.              If it is possible to look at Zahavi\u2019s impact as a flagbearer for Israeli football without emotional investment, he is such an important reference point as the player capable of dragging two Tel Aviv clubs into the Champions League. His goals took Hapoel through 2010, and he went on to score against Benfica and Lyon in the group stage. Naturally it hurts Hapoel to see Zahavi shine in the enemy colours because he was once revered by them. Amongst Zahavi\u2019s achievements for Hapoel, he scored the goal that won the title in stoppage time of the final game of the season. That knack for important goals was seldom so dramatic. Maccabi\u2019s coach, Slavisa Jokanovic, describes Zahavi as \u201cthe best Israeli player to date\u201d. Jordi Cruyff, the club\u2019s sporting director, adds that he is one of the most important signings in Maccabi\u2019s history. He cost a mere \u20ac250,000. \u201cHe\u2019s the one that gets the final touch to win a game,\u201d says Cruyff. \u201cHe is a leader and unlike other players the fact he got a new and improved contract only got him to play better.\u201d The feeling may be that the contract has already been paid back, but Zahavi is relishing the chance to prove his worth all over again at Stamford Bridge.", "publicationDate": "2015-09-16T10:00:00Z", "title": "Maccabi\u2019s Eran Zahavi ready to challenge Chelsea in Champions League", "sentences": ["The indomitable forward, whose form has been dazzling enough to ignite debate about where he stands in the pantheon of footballers to come out of Israel, has already helped himself to seven goals in five Champions League games, which were instrumental in carrying Maccabi Tel Aviv through the qualification process all the way to Europe\u2019s grandest stage.", "Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Chelsea face ghosts of 2007 when Maccabi Tel Aviv visit | Dominic Fifield    At the age of 28, there is the feel of a slow burn about Zahavi\u2019s productivity.", "In Tel Aviv, attitudes towards Zahavi very much depend on club loyalty.", "In a Tel Aviv derby last November, Zahavi scored an equalising penalty and was then confronted by a bare-chested pitch invader.", "If it is possible to look at Zahavi\u2019s impact as a flagbearer for Israeli football without emotional investment, he is such an important reference point as the player capable of dragging two Tel Aviv clubs into the Champions League."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/16/maccabi-tel-aviv-eran-zahavi-chelsea-champions-league"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "TONIGHT\u2019S TV AND RADIO Seventy-eight years ago to the day, Arsenal took part in the first ever live televised football match. It was a glorified training session against their own second string, barely of interest even to the few hundred homes in north London capable of receiving a signal from the bent coat-hanger gaffer-taped to the top of the BBC\u2019s pile at Ally Pally. But it was a groundbreaking event nonetheless. It\u2019s apt, then, that Arsenal celebrate this anniversary tonight by making another appearance on a channel nobody\u2019s watching, BT Sport, as they disappear behind the digital curtain to face Dinamo Zagreb in Big Cup. Oh ITV! We hardly knew ye! Whether this game matches Arsenal v Arsenal Reserves as an exercise in armchair-bound futility is a moot point. On the one hand, it could prove quite a test for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s side, who will be without Danny Welbeck (knee), Per Mertesacker (minor road traffic accident) and Jack Wilshere (SNIP! - Fiver lawyer), because Zagreb haven\u2019t lost a match in 11 months, a streak that stretches back 41 games. On the other, Arsenal somehow always qualify from the groups of Big Cup, only to crash out in the first knockout stage \u2013 the Round of Arsenal \u2013 with metronomic frequency. So whatever happens tonight is likely to make little or no difference to how the whole affair pans out. Tune in, folks! That\u2019s not stopping Wenger, perhaps taking pity on BT Sport, trying his hardest to talk up tonight\u2019s programme. \u201cWe have to play at our best as our last visit was a very tough game,\u201d he brazenly insisted, with reference to a lovely 3-0 win back in 2006. \u201cWe needed to be patient against a very strong side,\u201d he added, a statement of pragmatic intent which perhaps undid some of the earlier work he\u2019d put into the big sell. Not that Wenger will fret too much over tonight\u2019s result, never mind the viewing figures, because if the tenuous parallels drawn by The Fiver are anything to go by, the best is yet to come.

Israel: Ami Shavit \u2013 Alpha 1 Ami Shavit was a reclusive Israeli artist and professor with a fascination for technology, psychology, philosophy and sound. He assembled a private collection of synthesisers in 1972 after a trip to the US and started work on his Alpha Mood album, which was designed to combine his love for Tangerine Dream and Philip Glass with the newly emergent techniques of biofeedback, in creating a new style of music that would induce a meditative state. He lost his enthusiasm for this project after being conscripted into the Israeli army in 1973; he was left profoundly disturbed by his work evacuating battlefield casualties during the short-lived but bloody Yom Kippur war. Until, that is, he realised that this music was the very thing that offered him a chance for recuperation from the severity of what he had just experienced. The LP was originally pressed up as a very small run of 500 copies by Tel Aviv record store Mango, but after it closed up shop, the project faded into obscurity. The fine upstanding folk at Finders Keepers have just given it a typically lovely reissue, however, and now you can modify your own brainwaves with synths in the comfort of your own home.

For the first time this season, the odd sprightly period of the occasional game aside, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho witnessed his side impose themselves on a contest, dominate for lengthy periods, and revel in clear superiority. Maccabi Tel Aviv had been cowed from the off in the face of the home side\u2019s greater energy and quality. What might have been awkward ended up as a thrashing.   Related: Arsenal\u2019s 10 men fall at the first hurdle against Dinamo Zagreb    This win, even against such feeble opponents, was celebrated, with the locals chorusing their manager\u2019s name amid a wave of relief given so much of the team\u2019s domestic campaign to date has been dismal. There is optimism again ahead of the visit of Arsenal on Saturday for a fixture which tends to have Mourinho\u2019s juices flowing. In truth, it felt like the imposition of the natural order, the Portuguese having urged his charges to remind the world why they had been crowned Premier League champions back in May. Their response, with a revamped team littered with players with points to prove, was emphatic. Both Basel and Schalke have prospered at Stamford Bridge in recent seasons in the first group game of the Champions League, but Maccabi were never permitted to thrive. Mourinho said his team had demonstrated \u201ca different state of mind\u201d, rejecting Steven Gerrard\u2019s suggestions in his capacity as a pundit on TV that there was friction in the ranks, particularly between the manager and his rested captain, John Terry. \u201cI admire Steven very much, and have good relations with him, but he is wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no problems at all. As for the crowd, I\u2019m happy when they sing for Chelsea and that they know what we are, champions of England. \u201cI\u2019m not there waiting for personal support, but it\u2019s obviously welcome. I prefer that to them saying \u2018Mourinho out\u2019. That shows they don\u2019t have short memories. For a Chelsea fan, there\u2019s an easy way to think: \u2018We won four Premier Leagues, three with him, and one with his team. So this guy is not bad. Let\u2019s support the guy. We have a chance to win a fifth.\u2019\u201d Everything about this match, even with Terry on the bench, seemed like a tonic. Those offered a rare opportunity took their chance with relish. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, with only 17 minutes of first-team football behind him previously this season, was cautioned for a high challenge on Nikola Mitrovic after only 56 seconds but, unperturbed, was soon stretching again into tackles and surging impressively up-field in support of his attack. The whole setup had been crying out for the energy the youngster supplied and his display may now demand inclusion against Arsenal, potentially alongside Nemanja Matic. But the teenager\u2019s was not the only performance to be celebrated. Oscar\u2019s return after a knee injury was impressive, the Brazilian sliding home his team\u2019s second penalty of the night in first-half stoppage time after Diego Costa had wriggled away from Mitrovic\u2019s tug only to be floored by Tal Ben Haim\u2019s lunge. More significantly, Oscar\u2019s presence seemed to reassure Cesc F\u00e0bregas. The Spaniard has endured his own sluggish start to the campaign but this match provided a first assist and goal of term. His was a beautifully clipped diagonal pass into the penalty area just before the hour mark which Costa, on for the injured Willian, thumped gloriously on the volley and in off the underside of the crossbar.   Related: Chelsea\u2019s Cesc F\u00e0bregas back in the mood to help Mourinho\u2019s changes pay off    Fabregas\u2019s first soon followed, a tap-in after Eden Hazard had countered at pace and Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my\u2019s shot had been pushed out by a jittery Predrag Rajkovic. \u201cF\u00e0bregas and Ruben gave speed to the team,\u201d said Mourinho, who will be without the injured Willian and Pedro on Saturday. \u201cRuben is potentially a very good player, but you have to feed these youngsters and choose the right moment. His evolution is important. But I know, with all respect that Maccabi deserves, what you are thinking: we didn\u2019t beat Barcelona, Real Madrid or Bayern Munich. But we beat a team who deserved to be here. It was not too difficult because we played very well.\u201d There was greater balance to this team, with Baba Rahman a threat down the flank on debut at left-back and C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta assured on a rare foray in his favoured position on the opposite side. Gary Cahill, captaining the team for the first time, was a powerful presence and if Kurt Zouma and Rahman were both prone to overplaying, the home side were rarely tested until Nosakhare Igiebor missed an open goal as full time approached. \u201cWelcome to the Champions League,\u201d offered Slavisa Jokanovic. He did not try to deny his side had been overwhelmed. Even so, the perfectionist in Mourinho will have pinpointed the areas that still need work before Arsenal\u2019s arrival at Stamford Bridge. Hazard, in particular, could have done with a goal as he seeks to kick-start his own form this time round. He had been gifted his opportunity early on when Tal Ben Haim misplaced a pass, the slippery R\u00e9my reacted smartly to intercept and slide Willian into the penalty area. Rajkovic\u2019s forward dart invited trouble and the Brazilian duly tumbled to get the penalty. Yet anxiety gripped as Hazard prepared to convert. There was tension in his stride to the ball, eyes fixed on Rajkovic\u2019s net, and the spot-kick was skied dismally into the upper tier of the Shed. The recovery thereafter demonstrated strength of character. Willian made amends for his team-mate\u2019s profligacy soon enough. Yuval Shpungin fouled Hazard midway inside the Maccabi half and, with Rajkovic unnerved by the crowd wrestling their way towards the spot, Willian\u2019s inswinging free-kick skipped into the corner of the net. Hazard was slaloming into the Maccabi area like his old self before the end. Arsenal, licking their wounds from an untimely defeat in Zagreb, will confront a team who have finally found some rhythm.", "publicationDate": "2015-09-16T20:47:18Z", "title": "Chelsea make light of Eden Hazard penalty miss to thump Maccabi Tel Aviv", "sentences": ["Maccabi Tel Aviv had been cowed from the off in the face of the home side\u2019s greater energy and quality."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/16/chelsea-maccabi-tel-aviv-champions-league-match-report"}, {"tags": ["Chelsea", "Maccabi Tel Aviv", "Cesc F\u00e0bregas", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Given the commotion that has followed Chelsea around these past few turbulent weeks, what Jos\u00e9 Mourinho needed was some sanctuary. He found it at Stamford Bridge even before his team began to reboot their season. As the teams lined up just before kick-off, the Matthew Harding Stand started up a defiant, supportive chant of their manager\u2019s name. Three goals later the whole of Stamford Bridge stood up \u201cfor the Special One\u201d. He raised an appreciative hand. A five-game wobble should not, in Mourinho\u2019s humble opinion, be a valid reason to criticise, despite it being the worst start to a season he has ever experienced. But all the same you could not help feeling that Mourinho needed that shot in the arm. A bit of love, even.   Related: Chelsea make light Of Eden Hazard penalty miss to thump Maccabi Tel Aviv    This complex time, which Mourinho depicted as a sort of business as usual with one difference (that difference being the small matter of happiness), seems to have been played out to the tune of Murphy\u2019s Law. More or less everything that could go wrong has been dreadful. It felt like more of the same as Eden Hazard stood over the game\u2019s first clean chance: a penalty. It was breathtakingly bad. It defied logic from a player who exhibited such coolness in similar situations last season. The ball hit the upper tier of the Shed, straight at the Maccabi Tel Aviv fans who could barely believe their luck. Mourinho\u2019s immediate reaction was to applaud, the kind of encouraging gesture to send the signal to his player that everything was OK. Fortunately for Hazard, for Mourinho, for Chelsea, the difficulty passed quickly. Maccabi Tel Aviv\u2019s defence made an art form of the reckless. Their goalkeeper, Predrag Rajkovic, made a spectacle of the hapless. Such limited opposition gave Chelsea the perfect platform to rediscover some zest and self confidence. The changes that Mourinho rang helped in that regard. He has made a big deal of stressing that his team were champions recently. \u201cMany of this squad are the same players who won the Premier League last season,\u201d he wrote in his programme notes. \u201cNow we have to respond like champions.\u201d On the one hand six alterations mean it is difficult to over-analyse the composition of Chelsea in terms of the broader Premier League picture. But what the incoming players did bring was a different feel to the team. Freshened up, Chelsea gave themselves a reminder of what they do well. They found an urgent energy that had been so sorely missing. One of the keys to Chelsea\u2019s renewed positivity was Oscar. The Brazilian, who had been absent since the opening day of the season, introduced guile and sharpness of thought, spreading play smartly and moving the ball with intent. The added effect was that his work in the central creative area takes some pressure of Cesc F\u00e0bregas. The Brazilian certainly played himself into contention for Saturday lunchtime\u2019s match against Arsenal, when Chelsea will be eager to make a positive showing against their London rivals. F\u00e0bregas has been underwhelming and still gave the impression of coasting a little against the Israeli side, but he did at least find moments to make a difference again. The excellent performance of his partner in deep midfield, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, also gives Mourinho food for thought. Despite being booked in the opening minute, he scampered boldly around midfield. He was unlucky not to earn a penalty shortly before half-time with one driving run into the box. The changes were as much about opportunities as the chance to give a few more experienced campaigners a breather. Loftus-Cheek was a perfect example of that. As Mourinho said on the subject of his team selection: \u201cI told the players I don\u2019t want to think about Everton or Arsenal. I am not trying to punish anyone, I try to give people an opportunity which is what they are working hard to have. Loftus-Cheek is a player with great potential. This is a process with us, he has been in it since the middle of last season.\u201d Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my offered plenty of elusive movement, initially as the centre-forward and then, after Willian\u2019s injury, out wide. Again, something else for Mourinho to ponder as he tries to rebalance his team domestically. But if Chelsea needed one sign that they are closer to getting over their blues, it arrived with the sight of F\u00e0bregas floating an assist towards Diego Costa for the striker to finish with a glorious swivelling volley. Willian\u2019s opener, which benefited from some atrocious defending, and Oscar\u2019s drilled penalty were all well and good but that was a hallmark goal. F\u00e0bregas got on the scoresheet, too \u2013 so that\u2019s one goal and one assist to give his damaged early-season statistics an improved look.

The undisputed best is Messi-Neymar-Suarez, unless you\u2019re a member of Ronaldo-Benzema-Bale. But this week brought a first look at another one that could wreak havoc this season: Cavani-Ibrahimovic-Di Maria. Laurent Blanc was able to start all three for the first time on Tuesday and, admittedly against weak opposition, they whet the appetite for feasts to come. \u00c1ngel Di Maria seems to have made a difference already. The French champions dominated Malmo from beginning to end despite an uncharacteristically subdued display from the usually fabulous Blaise Matuidi and would have won by far more than 2-0 if not for the defiance of goalkeeper Johan Wiland. And Di Maria did far more than score a fine opening goal: he brought a new dimension and vitality to PSG. The crowd acclaimed the Argentinian when he was substituted towards the end and his team-mates acknowledged how important he already seems to their hopes of going further than ever before in the Champions League. \u201cHe does a lot of good to the team, lots of things seem easier with him,\u201d said Thiago Silva. \u201cWith him we play more directly and get into the opposing box very quickly,\u201d added David Luiz. Ibrahimovic\u2019s touch and finishing were unusually ropey during the match \u2013 he seemed over-eager to impress against his formative club, would you believe \u2013 but his intentions and movement were admirable and he seemed to relish playing with Di Maria.  As did Cavani, who netted the second goal. There are signs of a beautiful relationship forming. \u201cDi Maria plays very directly when he has the ball,\u201d said an approving Ibrahimovic afterwards. \u201cHe offers a lot and creates a lot of space for us. He still has to gel with the team bit it\u2019s very easy to play with him.\u201d Of course, Di Maria made a promising start at Manchester United too and then faded, but he says life in Paris suits him better, both on and off the pitch. It looks like he has moved on to better things. PD Astana may have given us a glimpse of the future     Astana went down 2-0 to Benfica but raised hopes that they can compete strongly in the rest of their Champions League campaign. Photograph: Ana Rita Noura Silva/Demotix/Corbis    Those curious to see how FC Astana, the first side from Kazakhstan to participate in the group stage, got on in their debut against Benfica might have feared the worst during Tuesday afternoon. The Portuguese side\u2019s Under-19s defeated their rivals 8-0 in the corresponding Uefa Youth League fixture and if this was a harbinger for what the eight-hour flight would do to their senior team, events in the Estadio da Luz would have made grisly watching. But Stanimir Stoilov\u2019s team, whose presence is probably the competition\u2019s biggest novelty this year and is one symptom of the rapid development taking place in Kazakh football, did not fold similarly and could even have caused an almighty shock. After holding out fairly comfortably in the first half and providing the odd sortie into home territory themselves, their big chance came a minute after the restart when substitute Aleksei Schetkin found himself in front of goal six yards out and jabbed a shot against the post. The excellent Nico Gaitan\u2019s deadlock breaker five minutes later was thoroughly predictable, then, and Benfica\u2019s energy intensified to the extent that former Fulham misfit Kostas Mitroglou added a second afterwards. Astana were always going to tire \u2013 their domestic league is getting stronger but can\u2019t hold a candle to this kind of tempo \u2013 but Benfica were made to work hard for the points and you sense that nobody will have it easy journeying in the other direction to Kazakhstan\u2019s newly-built, otherworldly capital in the middle of the steppe. It would stretch the imagination to envisage them finishing higher than fourth in the group but this was a promising first foray and, considering the atrophy afflicting so many old behemoths from the former Eastern Bloc, it was hard not to wonder whether this was the first glimpse of what one day will be a familiar sight. NA Home comforts scarce despite Wolfsburg\u2019s win     Wolfsburg and CSKA\u2019s players line up for the Champions League anthem ... but one man isn\u2019t listening. Photograph: Boris Streubel - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images    A return to the Champions League after five seasons away should have been something to relish for Wolfsburg, one of Europe\u2019s best-run and most upwardly-mobile clubs, but instead the Bundesliga runners-up were left wondering why nobody seemed that excited after all. The attendance for their 1-0 win over CSKA Moscow \u2013 achieved in comfort despite the narrow scoreline \u2013 fell 6,000 short of the Volkswagen Arena\u2019s capacity for European games, weighing in at a modest 20,126. The sight of so many empty seats made Klaus Allofs, the Wolfsburg CEO, pull a kind of Jeremy Corbyn on proceedings. \u201cI didn\u2019t listen to the Champions League anthem before the match, I needed to see where all the spectators were,\u201d said Allofs. \u201cIt is disappointing and the team does not deserve it \u2013 we will tackle it.\u201d If disillusionment at the sale of Kevin de Bruyne was behind any of the supporters\u2019 reasons for staying away, those present will be quick to remind them that it was Julian Draxler, De Bruyne\u2019s \u00a325.5m replacement, whose goal downed the Russians. If Wolfsburg kick on and surprise \u2013 well, it wouldn\u2019t really be a surprise \u2013 Manchester United at Old Trafford in a fortnight then you would certainly expect PSV Eindhoven\u2019s visit in October to drum up a modicum more local enthusiasm for a team that is a dark horse to progress far.

Many others reasons have been offered for persistent English failure in Europe, ranging from the really scornful (general decadence caused by too much money and too few brains and guts) to the more acceptable (the strength of the Premier League is simultaneously a weakness, as being more severely tested domestically leaves English clubs more fragile). On top of any broad factors such as those or the lack of a winter break and so on, each club has its own reasons.  But if City, Manchester United and Arsenal do not recover from their opening day losses, Chelsea do not improve more \u2013 as they will need to beat opponents better than Maccabi Tel Aviv \u2013 and Liverpool and Spurs stink out the Europa League as badly as West Ham and Southampton did, then the Premier League could soon find itself with just three spots in the Champions League.  At the start of last season it was ranked as the second best league in Europe, now it has fallen behind the Bundesliga and Serie A is lurking ominously. Leverkusen preventing Lazio from reaching the Champions League group stages was good news for English clubs but they are going to have to do more to help themselves if they are to avoid being demoted in the coefficient rankings for next season or the one after.

With his side a goal down to a close range Luis Su\u00e1rez header, Florenzi picked up the ball inside his own half and sprinted along the right touchline. A few metres inside the Barcelona half, he spotted goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen off his line and from a position still out wide on the touchline, let fly with a looping effort that completely bamboozled ter Stegen by sailing over his head and into the net off a post. It was a sensational strike and one for the showreel even if it had been scored against The Dog &amp; Duck, but considering the quality of opposition, the 24-year-old midfielder could have been forgiven for announcing his retirement on the spot. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that happens every day,\u201d said Florenzi of his goal after the match. \u201cLooking at the video now is making me emotional.

His new film, Rabin, the Last Day, minces no words and charges him as morally culpable for the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin. Not that Netanyahu personally called Rabin a Nazi or carried a coffin in effigy (others did that), but he and his wave of rightwing politics fanned the flames of sedition after the Oslo Accords. A movie with a charge this extreme, and the courtroom scenes that convincingly connect the dots, ought to make for a major international discussion. But that discussion is unlikely to happen, because this isn\u2019t the work of Michael Moore or Oliver Stone. This is Amos Gitai: an iconoclast at times, but an artist first. \nGitai has chosen stylistic cinema over propaganda, and he is a director who regularly gets bogged down a bit in form. Rabin, the Last Day is no different. It dispenses with a traditional three-act structure or main characters. It opens with a lengthy new interview with Shimon Peres, then blends news footage from 1995 and legal scenes that are almost stage-read with slow, contemplative imagined sequences. It\u2019s essentially a pastiche, a sketch study for a grand painting that never arrives. Some moments are chilling, others are deliberately dull; part of an effort, I believe, to intentionally lull the audience into a somnambulant state for some larger metatextual reason. The end result is frustrating; however, Gitai is so committed to his own process this might even be the goal. \nThe engaging scenes, it will come as no surprise, involve the moments just after shots are fired as the prime minister left a Tel Aviv peace rally. Bodyguards racing to get Rabin to the hospital are intercut with police processing his killer, the rightwing zealot Yigal Amir. Amir \u2013 who, one could cynically argue, perpetrated one of the most effective single acts of violence in recent world politics \u2013 is revealed to be proud of his actions. An older interrogator, rich in 20th-century Jewish history, tries to understand his reasoning, but comes up blank in the face of warped religious extremism. \nGitai then weaves in imagined (though likely) scenes from the illegal West Bank settlements; religious colonies where children fondle guns and lecturers work their brethren into a lather. Rabin, who served in the Israel Defence Forces from its inception and led operations during the six-day war before daring to pursue peace with the Palestinians, is accused as a traitor to Zionism, a comrade of Hitler, a cohort of Satan. It is their duty to protect their persecuted race by removing him from power. Gitai dissolves back to actual footage of anti-Rabin rallies, and while it\u2019s the crowd, not the speaker, chanting \u201cDeath to Rabin\u201d, the figure with the megaphone is none other than the current prime minister, Netanyahu. \nIt\u2019s a gut punch to those of us who haven\u2019t given up on peace between Israel and Palestine. What\u2019s unfortunate is Gitai\u2019s refusal to ride this momentum. Each sequence fades to and from black and we\u2019re never sure if the next chapter will be more news footage, a peek at Amir still percolating prior to his crime or the judicial investigation after the fact. The moments from later in the timeline may be of most interest to the policy wonks, but they lack punch on the screen. Much of the time, it\u2019s just people reading depositions from a page. The roaming, lengthy scenes in the settlement and the heartfelt source footage are choices that resonate far better. \nPerhaps Gitai was going for a \u201cpeople of the book\u201d concept, with legal essays replacing Torah passages? If that were the case, maybe my tuning out was just a reflex from my tortuous, force-fed Hebrew school sessions. Nevertheless, there\u2019s enough in this film to interest cinephiles and those drawn to Middle East politics. Anything to get Rabin\u2019s name back on peoples\u2019 lips is good.

William Hill has already lengthened its odds on English success following what the bookmaker described as a miserable start for Premier League clubs. It is beginning to look that last season, when no English sides reached the last eight in Europe, might not have been a blip after all. It is beginning to look as if Manchester City have made no tangible improvement in the most testing arena despite all their summer spending and impeccable start to the Premier League season. More than ever, one has the impression that the frothy Premier League bubble of big-money deals and last-minute recruitment of overpriced players is destined to burst harmlessly and soundlessly the instant it makes contact with the sharper reality of football as played overseas.   Related: Champions League review: an Angel at PSG's top table and Astana impress in defeat    Let us not forget either that the biggest foreign leagues have not even come into play yet. It would be one thing for English clubs to be taught a lesson by the might of the German or Spanish juggernauts, but PSV Eindhoven and Dinamo Zagreb are hardly the biggest names in Europe at the moment. Even Juventus have made a poor start to their domestic season, yet watching the contest at the Etihad one would have been hard pressed to work out which side had won all five of their opening league games without conceding a goal and which had picked up a single point from their first three matches. Thank goodness for Chelsea, or perhaps that should read thank goodness for Maccabi Tel Aviv. Had all four English teams subsided to 2-1 defeats in the Champions League first round, the Premier League and BT Sports might now face some sort of trading standards inquiry for selling shoddy goods at inflated prices. And yet. Perhaps the real time for wailing and gnashing of teeth will be in a couple of weeks, should the second set of Champions League results reflect the same depressing trend. Looking on the bright side, no English club is out of contention yet and two of this week\u2019s defeats were inflicted away from home. Fair enough, both Arsenal and Manchester United should both have been savvy enough to secure at least a point in Croatia and Holland respectively, yet Sir Alex Ferguson always maintained that home form is key in the Champions League group stages and there is still time for both sides to make amends. Even after the first set of results it is still hard to believe that either Zagreb or Olympiakos are going to make it out of Group F ahead of Bayern Munich and Arsenal. The London side have plenty of experience, even if they remain prone to the odd surprise result. Experience tends to be what counts in Europe, and both Manchester sides presently lack it. Perhaps it did not help that neither Wayne Rooney nor Sergio Ag\u00fcero featured in the starting lineups for United and City, depriving both teams of their main attacking spearhead and their coolest head for important occasions. Ag\u00fcero might well have stuck away the chances that Raheem Sterling fluffed; Rooney would have been a less dashing though more sensible choice of centre-forward than Anthony Martial.     Chelsea, here celebrating Diego Costa\u2019s goal in a 4-0 victory over Maccabi Tel Aviv, were the only English team to win in the Champions League this week. Photograph: Craig Mercer/ActionPlus/Corbis    City have gained quite a lot of European experience in a relatively short space of time, some of it memorable, some of it painful, though what the defeat against Juventus boiled down to was inexperience. Wilfried Bony is as much of a Champions League novice as Sterling; Kevin De Bruyne and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi were conspicuously off the pace when making their first European appearances on City colours off the bench; and against a side of Juventus\u2019s class and pedigree it showed. City rarely come up against such organised, intelligent defending in the Premier League and both Italian goals were exquisite finishes by top-level players. With Ag\u00fcero off the pitch it was hard to imagine anyone in a City shirt performing anything as well-executed, and by the time the Argentinian came on it was too late. United are a different story again. There is experience within their ranks but collectively they lack cohesion, otherwise they might have been able to hang on to their 1-0 lead or even improve on it. United are still not a settled team under Louis van Gaal \u2013 they have made many changes and have yet to work out their most effective way of playing \u2013 and for Rooney\u2019s unavailability to leave the manager with a choice between Martial or Marouane Fellaini as main striker strikes many as a lack of preparedness that was bound to be found out sooner or later. United\u2019s home game against Wolfsburg now takes on a much greater significance. They simply have to win, as per their former manager\u2019s dictum, and their margin for error has just been cut away. Yet at Old Trafford United probably can win against Wolfsburg, just as Arsenal should be able to put their Champions League show back on the road at home to Olympiakos. Given Chelsea\u2019s poor form in the Premier League a trip to Porto is more testing, though if anyone should know how to come through such a challenge, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho should. In another fortnight English prospects in Europe might be looking a little healthier, in other words, though there remains a worrying question mark over City. In a difficult group to begin with, they made another lacklustre start. Now they face a trip to Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach that on paper looks negotiable but could be fraught with all sorts of hidden difficulty. Then they have back-to-back games with Sevilla, already top of the table, before Juventus in Turin. A tall order for a team who seem to shrink, if not stall, whenever the Champions League anthem is played. City have come from behind in these situations before to make progress, though what they have seldom done is completely convinced. Now would be the time to put that right, if the strongest team in England is not to be the first by the wayside in Europe.", "publicationDate": "2015-09-17T13:38:53Z", "title": "Let\u2019s not rush to judgment over English clubs\u2019 Champions League hopes | Paul Wilson", "sentences": ["Thank goodness for Chelsea, or perhaps that should read thank goodness for Maccabi Tel Aviv.", "Chelsea, here celebrating Diego Costa\u2019s goal in a 4-0 victory over Maccabi Tel Aviv, were the only English team to win in the Champions League this week."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/sep/17/english-clubs-champions-league-arsenal-manchester-city-united-chelsea"}, {"tags": ["Chelsea", "Arsenal", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Gary Cahill believes Chelsea\u2019s convincing 4-0 Champions League victory over Maccabi Tel Aviv has given the team the morale boost they desperately needed before they face Arsenal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge.

But in Mountain, a quiet, melancholy family drama set almost entirely at the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, the location really is a character. There appears to be no trick photography and, considering how touchy folks can be about holy places (and considering what goes on in this film), one has to wonder if first-time director Yaelle Kayam lied on her permit applications. \nTzvia (Shani Klein) is an Orthodox Jewish mother of four. While she adheres to a strict religious code and boasts about being able to see the Temple Mount from her kitchen window, she is neither wide-eyed zealot nor unkind settler. She is a caring woman, slowly realising that her husband Reuven (Avshalom Pollak) is drifting away. He takes no interest in her sexually and is working longer hours. He is negligent of their children and has virtually no reaction when informed that he has bought the jam Tzvia specifically told him not to buy. In short, he\u2019s a jerk. \n \n  Related: Rabin, the Last Day review \u2013 form and structure hamper Israeli PM murder story  \n \nTzvia doesn\u2019t have many shoulders to cry on. While the specifics of how and why are a little vague, the family live in solitude in a cold, cave-like house adjacent to the Mount of Olives cemetery. They aren\u2019t caretakers (there is a chatty Arab who is), but they are there because a \u201cJewish presence\u201d is preferred. A customary wire separates their house from the acres of stone steps and above-ground tombs. From their vantage point, they can see the Old City of Jerusalem and mixed in with Reuven\u2019s morning Jewish prayers are church bells and Muslim muezzin calls. \nAs the increasingly lonely Tzvia begins taking late-night strolls around the mountain, she sees a couple having sex against a grave. Later, she sees that there is a group that gathers there each night. About six or so men drinking, maybe selling drugs. The women are probably prostitutes, though we don\u2019t actually get that close to business operations. But Tzvia returns time and again to watch. Not so much out of prurience, but just because there\u2019s some life out there with more happening than her own. \nAfter bringing pots of stewed chicken, the sketchy folk start letting her hang around like a puppy, despite one of the women accusing her of trying to convert them. She later condemns Tzvia for her looks, saying it\u2019s no wonder her husband doesn\u2019t touch her. \nDon\u2019t worry, Mountain isn\u2019t leading to an affirming, wacky makeover. Nor is it an excuse for miserablism. There is, instead, a patient anthropological game happening here. There are some missteps, such as the enormous \u201cChekhov\u2019s Container of Rat Poison\u201d that gets a closeup early on, but this is a double-whammy for voyeurs who want to see members of a community in unusual places. \nHowever, even to other Orthodox Jews, Tzvia feels like an outsider. With visiting mourners her only peers, she is shocked to learn about a group of \u201cher kind\u201d in ultra-modern Tel Aviv. Without saying anything, we know she\u2019d move there in a heartbeat. \nShani Klein, who was marvellous as the tough army sergeant in Zero Motivation, is achingly sympathetic. Her character\u2019s physical softness is the visual counterpoint to the sharp, often chipped stones lining the walk to her isolated home. It is an altogether striking character, though the unhurried pace does begin to wear you down. Overlooking Jerusalem from a city of the dead, however, there is more than enough time to take things slowly.

The European tonic was extremely timely in light of Chelsea\u2019s return of four points from five Premier League matches and with Arsenal visiting Stamford Bridge on Saturday lunchtime. Mourinho noted the tendency to look for dramatic explanations for a club\u2019s poor form, and he did so in characteristically extravagant fashion, saying people wanted to believe John Terry and Diego Costa, for example, were setting up Wild West style duels in Cobham. The reality, he said, was that the players had been caught in a downward spiral, where the results had affected confidence and fear had become the greatest enemy. The victory over Maccabi, Mourinho added, was particularly heartening because it had come after the psychological blow of Eden Hazard\u2019s missed penalty in the fifth minute. \u201cIn everything you do in life, you need confidence to be better,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cIn football, when you lose matches, you are affected. You can say you\u2019re not but you are. Normally, when bad things in football happen, the first thing is to find a dramatic story. \u201cSomebody punched someone in the dressing room. The manager doesn\u2019t want to speak with this guy. Diego Costa fought with John Terry and before they start the fight, they brought a translator for them to understand each other because Diego cannot speak English and John cannot speak Spanish. \u201cThey organise it like the Wild West duels. We are going to fight at this time, bring a translator to help us. Or, Mourinho doesn\u2019t want to give new contracts to Terry and [Branislav] Ivanovic. Mourinho instructs the scouts to find a new right-back urgently. \u201cThe real direction is that you lose matches, and you are affected. You lose confidence, you don\u2019t want the ball. You are afraid of the ball. You fear the worst. The ball goes to your box and you think the worst. You are in front of the opponents\u2019 goalkeeper and you are afraid to shoot. You are affected. \u201cThe good thing against Maccabi was that, after speaking about a strong start, we missed a penalty after five minutes but there was a fantastic reaction. We kept going, we kept playing. I don\u2019t say the victory was what we need now to win 15 matches in a row. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s important for people to be a bit more relaxed, a bit more confident. To taste victory again is important.\u201d Mourinho said that Willian was out with the muscle injury he suffered against Maccabi while Pedro, Oscar and Radamel Falcao were doubts. Oscar is expected to be fit, while Terry, Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic and Costa should return to the line-up. Mourinho\u2019s feud with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, invariably provides the sideshow to these matches but Mourinho tried not to fan the flames. \u201cI don\u2019t go in that direction,\u201d he said. \u201cJust the match. I want to isolate the match from every context. Doesn\u2019t matter our fantastic record against Arsenal, doesn\u2019t matter they beat us in the Community Shield \u2013 it\u2019s a match I want to isolate from every possible context.

Conversation has drifted away from defeats and doubts, briefly slipping into something a little more comfortable, into what it is that makes the man they still call Dave so appreciated, the player they would clone if they could. Yet Chelsea\u2019s worst league start in three decades never goes away entirely, even here \u2013 and even though he is convinced it will soon. The Pamplona-born defender has just been reminded of the time Jos\u00e9 Mourinho claimed that a team of Azpilicuetas would win the Champions League and the question is inevitable: would it? The punchline \u2013 \u201cMaybe on penalties\u201d \u2013 is delivered swiftly, bashfully. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t score many goals,\u201d he says. The obvious response is to remind him that he scored barely a month ago and it was a winner, too. But while he grins and says: \u201cGetting better,\u201d there it is again: a reminder of what has gone wrong as much as what has gone right. Goals are not really what Azpilicueta does \u2013 his career total is five in 340 games, two in 137 for Chelsea \u2013 and they are not really what he aspires to either. When he scored the winner in the 3-2 victory against West Brom at The Hawthorns, it was reason to celebrate but Chelsea\u2019s first victory, three games into the season, was also cause for concern. Not least for Azpilicueta himself. \u201cI\u2019m a defender and my first job is to make the team secure at the back; that\u2019s my primary responsibility,\u201d he says. \u201cI get huge satisfaction if we win and don\u2019t concede. That makes me happy; it means we\u2019ve done our job properly. I feel better when we haven\u2019t let in any goals.\u201d That day, Chelsea let in two. The game before, against Manchester City, it was three and the games after brought five more \u2013 two against Crystal Palace and three at Everton. Twelve already. No one has conceded as many in the Premier League and Chelsea have already let in more than a third as many as in the whole of last season. They began the season with defeat in the Community Shield against Arsenal, the first time Mourinho had lost to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, and have only one league win, secured by Azpilicueta. They are 17th. It was not supposed to be this way.   Related: Gary Cahill: Chelsea ready for Arsenal after Champions League morale boost    There have been suggestions that Chelsea\u2019s pre-season preparation, which began later than normal, was not ideal, plus doubts, too, about their recruitment. They have looked slower and less fit, lacking intensity and seemingly lacking confidence. Azpilicueta may well be the only outfield player whose level has not significantly dropped. If the question is why, Azpilicueta does not have an answer. What he does have, he says, is the conviction that they will put this right. \u201cPeople are passionate, they see things [in dramatic terms],\u201d he says. \u201cWe understand that. We want to change things as quickly as possible and it is true that we haven\u2019t had the start everyone expected; we\u2019re as surprised as anyone. But we\u2019re convinced that with the work we\u2019re doing we\u2019ll turn things around. We all know we need to improve, to get back to last season\u2019s Chelsea and there\u2019s belief that we can do that.\u201d Victory against Maccabi Tel Aviv was a start, making Chelsea the only English team to secure a Champions League victory in midweek and afterwards Mourinho said: \u201cI\u2019d forgotten that [winning] feeling. I can imagine what it would have been like going into training the next day if we had lost.\u201d Now Chelsea must beat Arsenal; their worst start in 29 years has left them trailing City by 11 points and 16 places. So, is retaining the league title still a realistic objective? \u201cThe objective is to produce a better performance on Saturday and win,\u201d Azpilicueta replies. \u201cWe have to concentrate on ourselves and pick up as many points as possible. We know we have less margin for error but we also know that in the Premier League every team\u2019s dangerous. There are surprises every week, we know that our rivals can drop points. \u201cOften in Spain you\u2019re winning 2-0, there are 15 minutes left, and it\u2019s as good as over. You control it and the tempo drops. In England, that doesn\u2019t happen. They put another striker on, long balls into the area, free-kicks, corners. They push you back. And if they make it 2-1 in the 90, you still have added time and the ball just keeps coming. It\u2019s a different mentality. Right until the last kick they give everything.\u201d       There is a fondness in the way that Azpilicueta talks about England. He arrived in 2012 and found his place, even if to start with he found himself hitting the curb when he took the car out. Things have improved; they can say his surname now \u2013 a video he recorded explaining it helped \u2013 and mostly they call him C\u00e9sar, although he says that Dave has stuck a bit too. On the pitch, he could hardly have taken to it more, nor the fans to him. It was February 2014 when Mourinho said that a team of Azpilicuetas would win the Champions League. \u201cIt\u2019s not just talent that counts but character and personality,\u201d the Chelsea manager explained. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of player I like.\u201d The kind of player that fans like too, probably more so in England than in Spain. His reliability is a quality more highly prized in the Premier League. \u201cI certainly feel appreciated at Chelsea,\u201d Azpilicueta says. \u201cPeople maybe [had an idea] of the supposedly \u2018typical\u2019 Spanish player ... the full-back that will get forward but not know how to defend. But in any country you have many different types of players and that has always been the way I play; at Osasuna and Marseille. Some didn\u2019t know much about me and I had to show that they could trust me.\u201d If assumptions were there to be challenged, it is not as if Spaniards have been unwelcome. By the time Azpilicueta arrived, he followed a well-trodden path. He was one of four Spaniards at Chelsea then and, although the other three have gone, he still is. \u201cThe \u2018mafia\u2019,\u201d Azpilicueta says, smiling. \u201cIt was Oriol Romeu, Juan [Mata] and Fernando [Torres], then. I outlasted them all and hopefully I can stay here for a very long time. And now, with Pedro coming, plus Diego and Cesc, there are four of us again.\u201d There are 31 Spaniards in England\u2019s top division and have been more than 100 in the Premier League era, beginning with Nayim in 1992 and Albert Ferrer six years later, the process accelerating. Outside the home nations, only Holland has provided more. Good players, too. A team of Azpilicuetas might not win the Champions League but a team of Premier League-playing Spaniards might. Azpilicueta works his way through a potential Spanish Premier League XI. He has been crowbarred in at centre-back \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t mind; wherever I can fit in,\u201d he says of a role in which he can be employed \u2013 and he pencils in his former Osasuna team-mate Nacho Monreal at left-back. David de Gea is the goalkeeper and in front of the defence the list seems endless: F\u00e0bregas, Mata, Cazorla, Silva, Costa, Pedro, Navas ... \u201cNot a bad team,\u201d Azpilicueta smiles. \u201cBut it\u2019s the mix of nationalities, of different types of players with different mentalities, that\u2019s key. The Premier League benefits from foreigners and the game\u2019s evolved in a way that\u2019s beneficial, but you can\u2019t lose the roots of the English game. It\u2019s been handled well; it\u2019s to be applauded. I love the English league. I wouldn\u2019t change any of that.\u201d Nor, it seems would most Englishmen. Spaniards come but Britons do not go; only Gareth Bale plays in Spain\u2019s top two divisions. The transfer of talent is one-way. Asked if there is an economic explanation, Azpilicueta does not hesitate: \u201cYes. You can see it with players from Spain\u2019s first division coming to play in the Championship. They\u2019ll earn more there. Look at TV rights: English clubs are more financially powerful. \u201cBut,\u201d Azpilicueta insists, \u201cit\u2019s not just that.\u201d The level of the league matters and the style that Spaniards have found suits them once they get used to the pace. The process Pedro is going through is a familiar one, a recurring theme in conversations with Spaniards in the Premier League. Azpilicueta explains: \u201cIt\u2019s true that the pressure is intense and it\u2019s played at a very high tempo, that it never stops, but it\u2019s also true that you can find space. A lot of teams press but then when you get past that, it opens up. You then have to make the most of that and finish off the moves, mind you, because if you don\u2019t the ball comes right back at you. Pedro will like that. He\u2019s still getting used to it but he is going to be a great player. \u201cDuring the transfer window you hear so many stories and there are so many games played in negotiations that you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true until it has actually happened. You hear about players leaving three years in a row and they never move; there are rumours and sometimes there\u2019s no substance at all or something changes, something unexpected happens. Pedro\u2019s an example. It never came out about Chelsea but then we signed him. When we heard, we were tremendously happy.\u201d Pedro came but Petr Cech went. On Saturday Cech will be on the other side. \u201cI was lucky to have him as a team-mate but he made us suffer in the final of the Community Shield: we know what a great keeper he is,\u201d Azpilicueta says. \u201cSanti [Cazorla] and Nacho Monreal, too; of the Spaniards at other clubs Nacho\u2019s the one I\u2019m closest to because of Osasuna. The thing is, we hardly have time to see each other. \u201cI\u2019ll shake hands with Santi and Nacho before the game, say hello, but then everyone fights their corner. From the moment I came to the club, I could feel that this was a special game, a big derby. You can sense its importance for fans. And for us it\u2019s vital. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a bad start and we have a tough job ahead to turn things around but it\u2019s in our hands. None of us are happy with the situation but we know we can put it right.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-09-18T15:00:13Z", "title": "C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta: \u2018We need to get back to last season\u2019s Chelsea\u2019", "sentences": ["We all know we need to improve, to get back to last season\u2019s Chelsea and there\u2019s belief that we can do that.\u201d Victory against Maccabi Tel Aviv was a start, making Chelsea the only English team to secure a Champions League victory in midweek and afterwards Mourinho said: \u201cI\u2019d forgotten that [winning] feeling."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/18/cesar-azpilicueta-chelsea"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "PARKING THE BANTERBUS Stories emerged in Certain Other Media Outlets this week that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho had banned banter at Chelsea, following their less than optimum start to the season, which is a decree that we can probably all get behind. However, if those reports are correct then it seems the man himself hasn\u2019t been following his own diktat. \u201cMaybe it was an agreement with a sponsor to promote the Rugby World Cup,\u201d he guffawed to the ladies and gents of the press when asked about Eden Hazard\u2019s cloud-bothering penalty against Maccabi Tel Aviv this week. Ho! Jos\u00e9 you card! Now, the Fiver is an expert in these matters, and we can testify that this, despite the apparent badinage moratorium at Chelsea, is most definitely banter. It\u2019s got all the hallmarks. Light-hearted dig in the ribs at a work colleague? Yup. Unfavourable comparison to an inferior sport? Sure. Topical reference? You betcha. Yes, we\u2019ve run the tests, looked at the charts, checked the results and it\u2019s most certainly, absolutely, 100% banter. Still, he\u2019s probably getting all this light-hearted repartee out of the way before Saturday\u2019s big game, because it\u2019s unlikely that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will be up for a spot of back-and-forth on the touchline, given his general thoughts on Jos\u00e9. He wouldn\u2019t even get involved in the raillery when a few journos attempted to engage him on the subject of Mourinho in his weekly meeting with the media. Does he regret going nose-to-nose with his opposite number on the touchline last season? \u201cI have nothing more to say about this situation.\u201d What about not shaking Mourinho\u2019s hand after the Community Shield? \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that.\u201d Will he be shaking his hand on Saturday? \u201cI won\u2019t tell you more than I just told you.\u201d Maybe Wenger won\u2019t discuss shaking hands because he\u2019s got a surprise for us in that area. Perhaps he\u2019s taking the Brendan Rodgers approach and will go in for the Cool Guy Handshake. Maybe he\u2019ll opt for a Tim Sherwood-esque salute. He could be following Ringo Starr\u2019s lead and not shake hands with Mourinho on hygiene grounds. (This is genuinely true by the way \u2013 the drumming Beatle and Sketchers salesman prefers to \u2018bump elbows\u2019 rather than sully his palms with yours. Which obviously isn\u2019t weird in the slightest.) Banter, handshakes. Eesh, remember when we all used to watch football? Because in front of the simmering feud between two men in suits and/or ill-fitting sportswear, there will be some football happening, and some quite good football too, if all goes to plan. Sure, the last time these two met it was more boring than listening to someone explain last night\u2019s dream (you showed up to an exam not wearing any trousers, did you? How fascinating), but now we have potential for all sorts of larks. Will Chelsea persist with the lumbering calamity that is Branislav Ivanovic at the back? Which of Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott will Wenger decide is the least average and pick up top? Will Cesc F\u00e0bregas remember that he\u2019s a professional footballer and not a handsome drifter who\u2019s paid to anonymously amble around a field every Saturday? Will Diego Costa insist that he\u2019ll only score if his pal Benny Benassi is personally in the ground to play the goal music? Yessir, there\u2019s plenty to keep us occupied at the ol\u2019 Bridge this weekend, as two of the better teams in the land meet to play each other at football. So ignore the banter, pay no heed to the handshakes, and look only at what happens on the field, rather than the sidelines. Unless Wenger and Mourinho start hitting each other of course.

There is no love lost between the pair and they have previous in terms of flashpoints, the most recent of which came at the Community Shield last month, when they did not shake hands after Arsenal\u2019s victory. Wenger appeared to give Mourinho a deliberately wide berth and the Chelsea manager made it clear that this was his interpretation of events, when it was put to him on Friday. \u201cI am happy that you describe, exactly, in the correct way, what happened,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI respond for my actions and the others respond for their actions. I don\u2019t have any critique about that.\u201d When managers do not shake hands, it is usually portrayed as an issue but only because it is a discernible sign of antipathy in what is a personality-fixated culture. Mourinho plans to wait for Wenger in the Stamford Bridge tunnel in order to shake his hand before the game, as he routinely does with visiting managers, although some figures at Chelsea would prefer that the gesture took place on the touchline, where it would be more visible.   Related: Chelsea a banter-free zone? Seriously, Jos\u00e9, you\u2019re having a laugh | Marina Hyde    Mourinho, who was unbeaten against Wenger in 13 meetings before the Community Shield, made the point that people would be more \u201cfocused on what happens on the pitch\u201d and that the past did not matter. \u201cI just go in the direction of the match on Saturday,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cIt\u2019s a match that I want to isolate from every possible context. It doesn\u2019t matter our fantastic record against Arsenal; it doesn\u2019t matter that in seven matches in the Premier League, they don\u2019t beat Chelsea; it doesn\u2019t matter they beat us in the Community Shield. It\u2019s a match that we want to win.\u201d Mourinho talked about his faith in Eden Hazard, how the out-of-form winger remained the \u201cbest player in England\u201d and how his team selection continued to be based on form only and not \u201cthe passport or the ID or the age\u201d. Or, indeed, the reputation. He is expected to recall John Terry, Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic and Diego Costa to the starting XI after Wednesday\u2019s 4-0 home win over Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Champions League. Mourinho\u2019s overriding message, though, was that the Maccabi result had brought back the confidence to his squad, after their stuttering start to the season. After five Premier League matches Chelsea are 17th in the table with four points. \u201cIn football, when you lose matches, you are affected,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cYou can say you\u2019re not but you are. Normally, when bad things in football happen, the first thing is to find a dramatic story. \u201cBut the reality is that, if you lose matches, you are affected \u2013 you lose confidence, you don\u2019t want the ball. You are afraid of the ball. You fear the worst. The Maccabi victory was not what we need now to win 15 matches in a row. It was important [in order] to be a bit more relaxed, a bit more confident.

Next time someone says \u201cmost dangerous city on earth\u201d, I\u2019ll pull a machine gun on them \u2013 that spurious claim was made over a quarter of a century ago, in Time magazine in March 1988. Like Bogot\u00e1 and Santiago de Cali, Medell\u00edn is a much wealthier, safer and more fashionable city these days, and its year-round summery climate, nearby forests and bird reserves and, indeed, the fact that it hasn\u2019t been backpackered into oblivion \u2013 unlike Cusco, say \u2013 makes it a rather more desirable destination. But I was also dubious about claims that the city is the epitome of the \u201cColombian miracle\u201d \u2013 shorthand for the quelling of violence of the left-wing Farc and paramilitary forces. In just a quick glance around Medell\u00edn I saw sizable shanty towns, and the heavy presence of cops in the centre indicates that vigilance is vital to keeping up appearances. However, on a balmy Sunday morning in the zen-inspired, \u201cinteractive\u201d Parque de los Pies Descalzos (Barefoot Park), I started to believe that Colombia\u2019s second city might have something interesting to tell me after all.     The zen-\u2019interactive\u2019 Parque de los Pies Descalzos (Barefoot Park). Photograph: Chris Moss    It began with me removing my shoes to stroll along a footpath of pebbles lined by native guadua bamboo. The stones and slimy mud were sort of soothing. Next, I walked out on to a lawn which, according to Adriana, my guide, \u201cabsorbed static energy\u201d. A larger group led by two of the park\u2019s official guides (provided free of charge) was hugging some trees. Next came a maze, which visitors are encouraged to cross with closed eyes, using only touch, sound and instinct. Finally I dipped my lower legs into a cooling footbath. It sounds hippyish, but Adriana gave it an urban slant. \u201cHow much time do you dedicate in a whole week to your feet?\u201d she asked. \u201cConsider all that they do for you.\u201d This all took place in the heart of the city, in the shadow of a utilities company building, for whose employees the park was originally created. With cafes and restaurants close by, it has become a focal point for workers as well as tourists. On that Sunday, the visitors were mainly families with small kids; in fact, it would make anyone feel like a small kid.     The Charlee hotel    Round the corner was an eco-\u00e1rbol, a tall, hi-tech tree-like structure that purifies 22,000 cubic metres of air every hour by removing carbon dioxide and traffic toxins. Built by a company called ConTreeBute, it was developed with help from Italian engineers. When, in 2013, Medell\u00edn was hailed as \u201cmost innovative city in the world\u201d by the influential non-profit Urban Land Institute \u2013 beating New York and Tel Aviv to the title \u2013 its civic spaces were praised. The eco-tree, and other urban installations around the city such as the Orquideorama, a wooden meshwork of modular \u201cflower-tree\u201d structures in the botanical gardens, are part of this image rebuild. Not that good old consumerism was in small supply. I was staying at striking US-owned hotel, The Charlee (surely an expat joke), in the leafy Parque Lleras area of El Poblado, an upscale residential district south of the centre. All around are independent boutiques and interiors stores, art supplies outlets, bars and clubs, loads of places to eat and even a Belgian coffee shop. I skipped the sushi and ceviches and went to Mondongos (Calle 10, 38, mondongos.com.co) for a bandeja paisa \u2013 an orgy of fried pork, beans, egg, black pudding, maize buns and plantain. It was a Saturday night, clubbing night, and the whole area was throbbing, despite torrential rain. The sheer bulk of my dinner precluded any notion of dancing. El Poblado was lively and comfortingly middle class, but more interesting \u2013 and indigenous \u2013 was Comuna 1, a working-class suburb on the north-eastern edge of the city which had served as a recruiting ground for local drug lord Pablo Escobar. I travelled there on Line K, part of the city\u2019s new cable-car network. From my little pod I surveyed a vast acreage of gimcrack houses and, beyond, the densely forested peaks of the mountains that surround Medell\u00edn.     The cable car system has cut journey times in the hilly city. Photograph: imagebroker / Alamy/Alamy    At the top is the eyecatching and award-winning Parque Biblioteca Espa\u00f1a or Spain Library-Park, an arts-cum-community centre funded by the Spanish government and opened by the king and queen of Spain in 2007. Inside I watched a funny little play for children that made them laugh while teaching them about hygiene. Outside I took in the street art. One mural by young artists celebrated the World Urban Forum of 2014. Another commemorated flood victims and displaced persons who had been victims of violence in Comuna 1 in the past. The smell of meat empanadas and roasting chicken mixed with fresh mountain breezes blowing through this once disaffected, disconnected poverty-stricken sprawl. On the way back down, a man returning from a visit to friends said the journey to the barrio had been reduced from an hour or more on foot to 10 minutes by cable car. Comuna 1 belongs to Medell\u00edn now, and vice versa. Artist Fernando Botero is the Beryl Cook of Colombia, known for paintings and sculptures of figures of exaggerated volume. He provides a useful commentary on Medell\u00edn\u2019s sense of self and the body. In the south-west corner of central Parque Berr\u00edo is his Torso Femenino, a bronze sculpture of a very inflated female form nicknamed La Gorda (The Fat Lady) by locals. It was given to the city in 1987 \u2013 the first of many donations by Botero, who was born here in 1932. On nearby Botero Plaza are more of his bronzes \u2013 of men, women, a cat, a Roman soldier. Adriana told me some of the sexier figures had become meeting points for couples. \u201cLocal men like voluptuous women,\u201d she said.     Boteros figure in Plaza Botero. Photograph: Alamy    In Plaza de San Antonio stand two bronze birds by Botero. At first they look similar but as you approach you see that one is intact and the other is all twisted, with bits broken off. In 1995, a bomb \u2013 planted allegedly by Farc militants \u2013 killed 23 people attending a concert and destroyed the statue. It has been left as a \u201chomage to the barbarians\u201d. In 2000, Botero had an intact version of the sculpture placed in the park as a symbol of peace. Under the tropical noonday sun, you can only do so much outdoors. I slipped into the Museo de Antioquia (an art museum with lots of Botero oil paintings) for a coffee \u2013 a good one. Colombians are beginning to take their best-known (legal) export seriously, training baristas and toasting the beans with care. There is plenty more art here, if you want it. The Museo de Arte Moderno (MAMM), housed in a repurposed steel factory, has just opened a new wing to house a permanent display of Colombian artists, making it the largest in the country \u2013 and the city\u2019s vibrant art scene now rivals Bogot\u00e1\u2019s.     Fernando Botero\u2019s outsized figures adorn a wall in Medell\u00edn, with the Andes in the background. Photograph: Chris Moss    Medell\u00edn is also known for its textiles industry, which has been established for more than a century. In recent years this has developed into a fashion scene. El Poblado\u2019s V\u00eda Primavera (also called Carrera 37) is an open-air space for independent designers \u2013 especially of shoes, leatherware and accessories \u2013 trying to tempt shoppers away from the huge malls that dominate the city. Local designer Camilo \u00c1lvarez, whose silky, summery couture opened last year\u2019s Colombiamoda (the country\u2019s biggest fashion show held in Medell\u00edn), says: \u201cThe local paisa style is most evident in underwear and swimwear, sexy with a rich mix of textures.\u201d The sea is many miles and quite a few Andean mountains away from Medell\u00edn, but the penchant for skimpy bikinis is of a piece with Botero\u2019s love of \u201cvoluminous\u201d women. All this enterprise and creativity give Medell\u00edn a tangible, youthful energy. In three days I\u2019d done no ordinary touristy things \u2013 no souvenir shopping, no ancient ruins, no major museums, no trendy galleries, no folksy dance and music \u2013 but I liked this city and felt I was getting to know it. Medell\u00edn says something original about regeneration and tourism. In future, perhaps other cities will invite visitors to feel and sense things, to meet people and learn about them, to visit the margins as well as the museums of the centre. I hope so, because that would reopen a lot of places that have become jaded or bloated or just boring. Medell\u00edn is definitely not the most dangerous city in the world. It\u2019s not even the most dangerous city in Colombia. But it\u2019s almost certainly the most interesting and innovative one. \u2022 The trip was provided by Miraviva (020-7186 1111, miravivatravel.com) which has seven days in Colombia, including flights and three nights in Medell\u00edn, from \u00a31,995pp. The Charlee hotel (+574 444 4968, thecharlee.com)has doubles from \u00a372.

Up front, half-time substitute Danny Ings impressed not only with his first goal for the club but with his energy, pressing and darting runs in behind opposition defenders. Put simply, the former Burnley forward looked far more suited to the style of play that Rodgers admits has gone awol than Christian Benteke did in the first half. Benteke was withdrawn at the interval due to a tight hamstring but will the Liverpool manager omit the club\u2019s most expensive summer signing at \u00a332.5m when fully fit to give Ings an extended run? It would appear more likely than Simon Mignolet paying the price for his part in Russell Martin\u2019s equaliser. Opting against buying a recognised first-choice goalkeeper who could exert pressure on Mignolet was a baffling move in the off-season, with Liverpool signing free agent Adam Bogdan instead, and Rodgers went to great lengths to absolve the Belgium international of blame on Sunday. \u201cI think there were other factors for the goal,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery keeper you bring in is there to challenge the keeper. I have [dropped Mignolet] before. I will do it again if I feel I need to make changes, whether goalkeeper or outfield. But for their goal, there were other elements involved.\u201d Andy Hunter  \u2022 Match report: Liverpool 1-1 Norwich City      Substitute Danny Ings made a positive impact, scoring the opening goal as Liverpool drew 1-1 with Norwich at Anfield. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images    2) Hodgson must surely consider Wilson for his next England squad Eddie Howe said he has not seen Roy Hodgson at Dean Court yet but the England manager could do far worse than taking a trip to see Callum Wilson and considering him for his squad to face Estonia and Lithuania next month. The ease with which Wilson turned Youn\u00e8s Kaboul for Bournemouth\u2019s first goal on Saturday \u2013 subsequently terrorising the Sunderland defender to the point where he got himself sent off for a pair of ludicrous challenges on the striker \u2013 was wonderful to see. That was his fifth from four games and considering England have already secured their place at the European Championships, the options available to Hodgson in recent squads and the theory that form players should be rewarded, Wilson\u2019s inclusion would appear a no-brainer to some. \u201cI would love him to go on and make England appearances,\u201d Howe said. \u201cHis potential is limitless and he is developing all the time. There\u2019s never been a Bournemouth player close to being capped for England and I\u2019d like nothing more than that.\u201d The call-up cannot be far away. Alan Smith  \u2022 Match report: Bournemouth 2-0 Sunderland  3) Van Gaal as defiant as ever over defensive issues If you, like Ronald Koeman, thought that Manchester United showed defensive weaknesses at St Mary\u2019s on Sunday in the match in which Southampton scored two goals, hit the post once and were denied by several excellent saves from David De Gea, then you might like to consider Louis van Gaal\u2019s case for his defence. Here is part of the United manager\u2019s post-match exchange with journalists (J), starting with his response to the suggestion that his team may have to continue scoring a lot this season because they risk conceding a lot:     Louis van Gaal consults his notes during Manchester United\u2019s 3-2 victory against Southampton at St Mary\u2019s. Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/Rex Shutterstock    LVG: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with you. Have you seen the goal average against, also last season? All the media was writing the defence is very bad but at the end we were third in the Premier League [ they actually had the fourth best defence in the Premier League last season]. You say something and don\u2019t think about what you are saying.\u201d J: \u201cKoeman also said there were weaknesses \u2026\u201d LVG: \u201cMaybe you have twisted his words?\u201d J: \u201cNo, he said United showed some defensive weaknesses \u2026\u201d LVG: \u201cThis is also remarkable, that he says that.\u201d J: \u201cDo you think you were good defensively today?\u201d LVG: \u201cI think so yes but not in the last 15 minutes. I explained the reason. I\u2019m not concerned.\u201d J: \u201cWhat about the first 30 minutes?\u201d LVG: \u201cNo, I am not concerned, you have to write it that the first half hour they were better.\u201d J: Why did you take Matteo Darmian off at half-time?\u201d LVG: \u201cBecause he gives too much space on [Dusan] Tadic in my opinion and Tadic was the most dangerous man and that is why I have changed him and Valencia did very well. I didn\u2019t see Tadic any more in the second half.\u201d Paul Doyle  \u2022 Jonathan Wilson: Martial takes attacking burden from Rooney\u2022 Match report: Southampton 2-3 Manchester United\u2022 Van Gaal says his philosophy is working after 44-pass goal  4) Terry may have a different role to play at Chelsea this season There was a bear hug at the final whistle between Chelsea manager and captain, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho going on to insist that, if he had to rely upon one member of his 25-man squad, it would always be John Terry. \u201cHe knows that I care about him as a person, as a player,\u201d said the Portuguese. \u201cIf you want to paint a dark picture, I ask you please don\u2019t because it is not the reality. He\u2019s in a great condition and a great situation with the manager and with the club.\u201d In short, there is nothing to see here. Please move along. Even if there was a logic in seeking swifter legs in anticipation of having to combat Theo Walcott\u2019s pace on Saturday, sitting out a derby against Arsenal will have hurt Terry, not least because Branislav Ivanovic, whose form had been dismal up to Saturday, had earned a recall to Mourinho\u2019s lineup. But this may simply be how this season, potentially his last at Stamford Bridge, is going to play out for the 34-year-old.        Defender John Terry   Appearances 4  Shots blocked 2  Clearances 10     The skipper had defied logic \u2013 particularly given his toils under previous managers \u2013 to play every minute of last season\u2019s title-winning campaign but he might have to accept his appearances this time round really will be more fleeting, handpicked with the opposition in mind. That is not to say he does not still have a role to play. But it may be as much about inspiring off the pitch as on it these days: whipping up team-mates in the dressing room; encouraging and cajoling younger players from the sidelines; being a different kind of leader at his club. For now, Terry has to prepare for a Capital One Cup tie at Walsall on Wednesday where he will potentially start alongside the new signing, Papy Djilobodji, in central defence. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, so impressive against Maccabi Tel Aviv last Wednesday, should also play with Radamel Falcao \u2013 in place of a rested Diego Costa \u2013 and the likes of Bertrand Traor\u00e9 and Kenedy hopeful of involvement against League One opposition. Playing alongside the strength and presence of Terry should benefit those younger charges, and he should relish the opportunity to inspire an evolving Chelsea team. These are changing times, but Terry should still embrace them.

Manchester City lost 2-1 to West Ham yet the Belgian was the contest\u2019s shining light. The choice of pass, the touch and control, De Bruyne\u2019s movement, and the calm chess-like vision amid the Premier League\u2019s hue-and-cry, suggest City have acquired a heck of a player \u2013 even at his \u00a352m price tag. This was a David Silva-esque or, rather, a De Bruyne-esque display that should make football fans of all stripes eager to watch him each time City\u2019s livery is pulled on. De Bruyne operated in Silva\u2019s No10 position with the latter withdrawn from City\u2019s XI just before kick-off due to injury. The Spaniard thinks the calf problem may keep him out of Tuesday evening\u2019s visit to Sunderland in the Capital One Cup. But just wait until De Bruyne and Silva can start games together. Of the prospect, the 24-year-old said: \u201cYes, I can only get better if I play with great players. This team has a lot of great players. I think when I know the team a bit better I will get even more of the ball. I\u2019m happy with the way I\u2019ve started. All is going well. I\u2019m only 10 days here but I\u2019m fitting in well.\u201d Silva, too, plies his trade this way. He strolls around the park as if operating a contest by remote control. De Bruyne\u2019s addition means his manager, Manuel Pellegrini, has a pair of sublime footballers who, if harnessed correctly, should allow City to stroll to the championship despite Saturday\u2019s setback. Jamie Jackson  \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 1-2 West Ham United  6) McClaren should relocate Coloccini to a defensive midfield role Coloccini is struggling at centre-back but Newcastle have just handed their captain a new contract and, given the right framework, he can still play a bit \u2013 so why not turn him into a midfield anchor, a sort of quasi-sweeper capable of both protecting his defence and initiating attacks? With Cheick Tiot\u00e9 seemingly having slipped out of the picture, McClaren is worryingly light when it comes to defensive midfield options so Coloccini \u2013 who has played the role in Spain and Argentina in the past \u2013 could yet fit the bill. The promising Chancel Mbemba could then be paired with Steven Taylor (who is a really good defender, when he\u2019s fit) at centre-half. Coloccini\u2019s reassuring, ball-playing, presence at the base of what could possibly turn into a midfield diamond with Siem de Jong at its apex (although there are other options) should surely bring the best out of Newcastle\u2019s attacking creators. With the Argentinean behind them, we might yet see the best of Florian Thauvin, Rolando Aarons, Georginio Wijnaldum and friends. Given Taylor\u2019s injury record this re-configuration will necessitate signing a new centre-back in January as well as the extra striker \u2013 preferably Charlie Austin \u2013 McClaren is currently missing. Louise Taylor  \u2022 Match report: Newcastle United 1-2 Watford  7) Pardew shows he is not perfect as Palace stall Alan Pardew has been touted as a potential candidate to succeed Roy Hodgson as England manager after transforming Crystal Palace\u2019s fortunes since he returned to Selhurst Park in January. But amid all the backslapping, there are still question marks about some of the former Newcastle manager\u2019s team selections and substitutions this season. In the absence of Connor Wickham against Spurs, Pardew opted to pair natural wingers Bakary Sako and Yannick Bolasie up front in a traditional 4-4-2 formation, with Wilfried Zaha and Jason Puncheon on the flanks. The experiment lasted all of 20 minutes as Palace struggled to relieve the pressure Tottenham exerted on them in the opening exchanges at White Hart Lane, and the visitors looked much more comfortable when they switched to a 4-2-3-1 with Sako on the left flank and Puncheon behind Bolasie. After substituting him for the fifth time in six matches, Pardew singled out Zaha for criticism afterwards but the winger had only just set up Yohan Cabaye\u2019s effort which struck the post and could count himself unlucky to make way. The decision to introduce Fraizer Campbell at the break was also surprising given that the former Tottenham striker had not played a single minute in the Premier League before Sunday, and because Palace had Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford on the bench. Ed Aarons  \u2022 Match report: Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Crystal Palace  8) Pulis\u2019 diplomacy has allowed Berahino to blossom again Saido Berahino turned from villain to hero at Villa Park and was feted by supporters and team-mates alike after turning in the winning goal against West Bromwich Albion\u2019s rivals. If the former England Under-21 striker can keep smiling, then his movement and goalscoring instinct mean West Brom have the cutting edge to steer them comfortably into safe waters by the time the next transfer window opens. That would be worth at least \u00a322m of anyone\u2019s money. But while the jury can debate the manner in which Jeremy Peace, the chairman, publicly and persistently rejected Tottenham\u2019s pursuit of the striker, Tony Pulis has played an absolute blinder for his club. He has never criticised Berahino\u2019s ambition, simply commented in a fatherly manner about the rashness of immaturity that bedevils most of us. He has brought him back into the fold slowly, awaiting the corners of his mouth to rise, from the bench and then \u2013 at the right time \u2013 into the starting team. Pulis is a past master at caring for troubled souls in order to get the most of them for his club. Look back at Jermaine Pennant and Matthew Etherington at Stoke City. He has kept a careful arm available for Berahino\u2019s shoulder and now stands to benefit from the player\u2019s contribution over the coming months. If the troubled young man comes to leave next January or June, at least West Brom will have had the opportunity to court their preferred replacement in the meantime \u2013 and probably from the greater platform of the Premier League. Peter Lansley  \u2022 Match report: Aston Villa 0-1 West Bromwich Albion      Tony Pulis has played a key role in helping Saido Berahino, who said he would not play for the club again after being denied a move to Tottenham, return to the West Brom first team.

While Shinji Okazaki looks lightweight and, so far, unconvincing up front, and Gokhan Inler is clearly struggling to adjust to the pace and physicality of the Premier League, Kant\u00e9 has brought real energy to the Foxes\u2019 midfield, and on Saturday\u2019s evidence, times a tackle beautifully. Much of the credit for Leicester\u2019s impressive start to the season has gone to Riyad Mahrez, but while they wait and see whether Inler can take on the directional role performed so effectively in the latter part of last season by Esteban Cambiasso, the less celebrated Kant\u00e9 is proving equally important. Richard Rae  \u2022 Match report: Stoke City 2-2 Leicester City  10) Barkley consistency should have Everton\u2019s fans rubbing their hands with glee Although justified, the constant cooing over the excellent performances of John Stones threatens to overshadow the early-season contribution of his fellow 21-year-old Ross Barkley to Everton\u2019s cause. The stand-out player during their game against Swansea in which several players from both sides could justifiably have laid claim to the man-of-the-match fizz, Barkley came in for special praise as his manager lauded the mental fortitude of a player who is showing signs of blossoming into one of the Premier League\u2019s most consistently influential midfielders. \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting journey, the one that Ross has been on over the past three seasons,\u201d said Roberto Mart\u00ednez. \u201cYou do see a player who controls games. I felt against Southampton that he had a very similar role to the one he had today. What is incredible with Ross is that he\u2019s very consistent now. Last season was a challenge and it would have been very easy for him to say \u2019Well, the team doesn\u2019t play well so I cannot play well,\u2019 but he was the first one who wanted to change things from his point of view ... that he wanted to play better, that he felt he could do a lot more. That\u2019s incredible, to see a young man take that sort of responsibility.\u201d He is arguably the best player in a very good football team with no shortage of emerging talent. We can only hope that Barkley\u2019s maturity rubs off on the Everton supporters who spend so much time admiring protest banners that they\u2019ve paid to trail across the sky that they fail to appreciate the wealth of young talent representing their club on the ground. Barry Glendenning  \u2022 Match report: Swansea City 0-0 Everton      Ross Barkley has shown consistency and maturity in Everton\u2019s strong start to the season, earning praise from his manager, Roberto Mart\u00ednez.

The Maccabees do not wear payis and heavy beards, and they do not break into prayer during matches. But they are passionate about their religion and their studies, as well as the beautiful game. And they have turned into the surprise team of the Skyline Conference, sitting atop behind a 2-0-1 start; they are 3-3-1 overall. At one time, you might have said that the Maccabees did not have had a prayer of being successful. They entered this season with an abysmal 5-64-2 conference record over the past eight years. Though they cracked the .500 barrier for the first time in 2014 (10-7-1), they finished out of the conference playoffs at 2-5-1. But now the team is talking postseason for the first time. \u201cI would be surprised if we weren\u2019t there,\u201d said team captain and defender Joey Krombach, a Los Angeles native.   Related: Hand-me-downs, Snickers and warm Pepsi: the early years of US women's soccer    Yeshiva is not your everyday NCAA Division III soccer team. The New York school is known for training rabbis, but it also has opportunities for other academic pursuits. The soccer team faces more than its share of challenges. The players must take a double academic load. The team has to bus to practices and games from Manhattan across the George Washington Bridge to Votee Park Sportsplex several days a week. They cannot play on Friday or Saturday, and usually have a break right smack in the middle of their schedule because of the Jewish high holy days. In other words, it\u2019s not for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. It\u2019s tough,\u201d Krombach said. \u201cWith a dual curriculum, we\u2019re choosing to be here because we care about the Jewish values in our everyday education. We make time for it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d coach Josh Pransky said. \u201cI stress to them all the time, from the earliest recruiting conversations on, [that] is not a party school atmosphere. The only people who are successful here are driven, mature, committed individuals who are able to manage their time. You basically you have to DVR every show you want to watch until after the season. You have to tell your girlfriend, \u2018I\u2019ll call you in November.\u2019 And you\u2019ve got to buckle down. You\u2019ve got to study on Saturday nights, you\u2019ve got to get your sleep in.\u201d That\u2019s because every player faces long days. Jewish studies run from 9am to 1pm. After lunch, the traditional college courses go through 8pm. \u201cIt\u2019s good preparation,\u201d said native New Yorker and junior midfielder Sasha Bakal-Schlomann. \u201cDuring soccer season, you pretty much have time for school and soccer and that\u2019s just about it. but it helps you with time management. It\u2019s a learning curve. but I think it\u2019s very good for the real world.\u201d Freshman defender Chino Grobman added: \u201cYou get used to it. If I didn\u2019t have soccer, I would feel like I had too much free time and I would get bored. I\u2019ve been playing soccer since I\u2019ve been a little kid. It\u2019s part of your schedule.\u201d All that work doesn\u2019t necessarily leave that much time to play, or in this case, practice. Yeshiva training sessions usually are held at night from 8.30-10pm at Votee. Early practice sessions are out of the question because some players are in morning prayer sessions. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee they won\u2019t get stuck in hours of traffic getting back into the city,\u201d Pransky said. \u201cI can\u2019t do that to them. The only thing I can do is run a 6am practice in the gym or the weight room or the pool, the only facilities on campus. I can\u2019t even run a small sided practice session on campus itself.\u201d Many home games are at noon Friday \u2013 to get back to Manhattan before sunset \u2013 and 8.30pm on Sundays. When the Maccabees go on a rare long road trip, the university will pack kosher lunches. If they\u2019re traveling to an area with a large Jewish population, a kosher deli is another option. When there\u2019s time, the team has even prayed together. When the team arrived early for a game in Farmingdale, New York last year for an evening game, the players had an opportunity to say their afternoon prayers prior to the kickoff. \u201cOne of the guys turned to me and said, \u2018Hey, coach, we\u2019ve got time to daven [pray]. Can we get it in right now? Warm-ups don\u2019t start for another 25 minutes,\u2019 \u201c Pransky said. \u201cRight then and there, guys in their uniform, some of them in sweats went off to the side and stood up up and prayed together in a communal prayer. I say credit to the guys.\u201d Pransky, a former Yeshiva player, started to change the team culture when he took over in 2013. \u201cWhat I walked into was a lot of players who had acted like I did when I was playing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many people have been telling us, pat on the back. \u2018We can\u2019[t believe you get out there and go for 90 minutes and practice at night. We\u2019re so proud of you for putting in the effort.\u2019\u201d But he heard from his players. \u201cCoach, we want to do good,\u201d he said. \u201cCoach, we should be good. Coach, we should be winning. We need to be focusing on that. I said, \u2018Look, this is the kind of program that should be doing better, and it just needs for that belief. The university was pushing for that kind of thought process. It was an easy decision on a two-way street.\u201d     Yeshiva host Lehman College Friday, before playing Farmingdale State College on Thursday October 8. Photograph: Yeshiva University Athletics    The Maccabees\u2019 fast start was surprising to some of its conference foes as opposing coaches ranked them eighth out of 11 teams in a pre-season poll. The top six teams qualify for the playoffs, which begin October 31 and run through November 7.To prepare, Pransky scheduled some difficult non-league opponents. The Maccabees started off the season losing to then 21st-ranked Stevens Tech, 5-0. They dropped a 6-0 home decision to Kean College, allowing two soft goals in the waning minutes. \u201cThree and four years ago Yeshiva absolutely had no business being on the same field as a team as established and as competitive as well put-together as Kean or Stevens Tech,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact we\u2019re sort of breaking our teeth in going up against these guys is really as a coaching staff the only chance of competing was out of our conference. My guys got an earful after the game about heart, desire and pride and commitment, and things like that. I can\u2019t sit there watching young men sell themselves short after all their hard work.\u201d Their most recent match, a wild 4-4 road draw at Mount Saint Vincent Sunday night, had enough twists and turns and drama to entertain fans for a week. The hosts grabbed an early two-goal advantage before Yeshiva rallied with a pair of goals apiece by senior midfielder Daniel Amar (team-best six goals, four assists) and junior striker Itamar Ben David. An own goal allowed the hosts to equalize in the 82nd minute. \u201cThey will feel disheartened and let down if we don\u2019t make the playoffs,\u201d Pransky said. \u201cWhere in past years, making the first round of the playoffs would have been the farthest reach of our imagination of what was possible. It all goes back to the players. They\u2019re the ones putting in the hard work, they\u2019re the the pioneers, coming to this program when it really wasn\u2019t a program. They\u2019ve got this belief and it\u2019s fantastic.\u201d Pransky certainly believes in Ben David. The Tel Aviv native has been the mainstay of the attack, leading the Maccabees in scoring the past two seasons (16 goals, 10 assists in 2013 and 18 goals, 10 assists in 2014). After some injury issues earlier this season, the 6ft 1in, 185lb striker has five goals and two assists in six matches. A first-team All-Skyline selection last year, Ben David also was named the Jewish Sports Heritage, Inc. Jay Fielder outstanding Jewish college soccer player of the year. \u201cItamar has a very close place next to my heart, because he was my first every recruit,\u201d Pransky said. \u201cTo be able to grab him first, before anybody else, really set the bar. He is a calm, cool, collected character. He really is not seized by a whole lot, an extremely down-to-earth and likeable guy. He just just loves the game. He sees the game beautifully.\u201d After hosting Lehman College Friday, they will take a 13-day break before playing Farmingdale State College on Thursday October 8. After dropping its two opening matches, Yeshiva is 3-1-1 in its last five games, so the break could interfere with the team\u2019s momentum. \u201cI tell my recruits that we\u2019re the only college team that has the Italian mid-winter break in the middle of September,\u201d Pransky said with a laugh. \u201cSo it\u2019s definitely not ideal. If i could get a week\u2019s practice to get the rust out \u2026 \u201cWe play against a very fit and a very competitive Farmingdale State the day after we come back. That\u2019s brutal to come back against real high level competition.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think its going to be easy,\u201d Grobman said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to try to stay fit, keep doing exercise, try to play soccer as much as I can during the break; stay focused.\u201d Pransky\u2019s recruiting options are limited because not only he is restricted to Jewish players, but mostly ones that want to further their religious studies. He has created a network of alumni, his contacts and an international net as well. \u201cWe hear about a Jewish player out in Northwestern or in Maryland in certain big-time programs,\u201d he said.\u201dThere\u2019s that myth that Jews are not athletic or not good in sports or something like that. I think stereotyping any culture or ethnicity is short-sighted, dangerous and extremely erroneous.\u201d Yeshiva is proving that. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good amount of good players from areas and school that normally wouldn\u2019t feed into Yeshiva University,\u201d Krombach said. \u201cBut our coach has gone out, and he\u2019s said the right things to the right people, and we\u2019ve got in some great players over the course of the past few years.\u201d Sometimes a player attends the college and decides to play later. After his freshman year, Krombach, an accounting major, sent Pransky what he called \u201can audition video.\u201d He was invited to training camp, joined the practice squad before working his way up to captain. Sometimes it just happens. Bakal-Schlomann admitted Yeshiva wasn\u2019t on his radar. He visited Israel on a summer program operated by the school. He liked what he saw. \u201cI learned about the school, and saw that they had a mix of religious kids as well as kids who didn\u2019t come from a religious background but were interested in Judaism,\u201d he said. \u201cI fit into that mold.\u201d And sometimes word of mouth works. Grobman, a Peruvian who moved to Miami, had a friend who recommended Yeshiva. \u201cHe [Pranksy] told me he was trying to grow the program every year,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I kind of believed in the program.\u201d That belief has spread to the rest of the team. Whether Yeshiva has turned the corner remains to be seen. The Maccabees will certainly learn a lot about themselves when they return from break next month.", "publicationDate": "2015-09-22T10:00:13Z", "title": "The Jewish college soccer team defying stereotypes", "sentences": ["The Tel Aviv native has been the mainstay of the attack, leading the Maccabees in scoring the past two seasons (16 goals, 10 assists in 2013 and 18 goals, 10 assists in 2014)."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/22/jewish-soccer-team-yeshiva-university"}, {"tags": ["Premier League", "Manchester City", "Leicester City", "West Ham United", "Arsenal", "Everton", "Swansea City", "Norwich City", "Liverpool", "Crystal Palace", "Southampton", "Tottenham Hotspur", "Watford", "West Bromwich Albion", "Aston Villa", "Bournemouth", "Chelsea", "Stoke City", "Sunderland", "Newcastle United", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "1) Will Leicester increase Wenger\u2019s woes? Leicester City currently hold something that belongs to Arsenal: fourth place. The never-say-die attitude that saved them last season has spilled over into this one and Leicester have been one of the most exciting sides in the league; they never know when they are beaten, their resilience demonstrated by two stirring fightbacks from 2-0 down in the past fortnight. They never stop and the Premier League\u2019s only unbeaten side will be determined not to let Arsenal leapfrog them by beating them at the King Power Stadium. Indeed they may regard Arsenal as wounded prey after their defeat at Chelsea last weekend. Francis Coquelin could be out with a knee injury and Arsenal will be in trouble if they fail to match Leicester\u2019s intensity, not to mention their attacking brio. Inspired by Riyad Mahrez, Leicester have scored 13 goals in six matches. Arsenal? Five in six. JS  \u2022 Ranieri surprised by Arsenal\u2019s Premier League title drought \u2022 Flamini proves point in Arsenal fans\u2019 biggest fixture            Video: Ars\u00e8ne Wenger comments on Mathieu Flamini\u2019s performance against Tottenham, and says the FA\u2019s decision to revoke Gabriel Paulista\u2019s red card is not enough, as his team suffered from the sending off.    2) West Ham seek consistency at home Analysing West Ham United\u2019s start to the season is a tricky business. Slaven Bilic\u2019s side are third after last week\u2019s 2-1 victory over Manchester City and the feelgood factor around Upton Park meant that there was a calmer reaction than usual to Tuesday\u2019s extra-time defeat to Leicester in the Capital One Cup, a level of patience that Sam Allardyce did not always enjoy when he was manager. Supporters who railed against Allardyce\u2019s caution have quickly warmed to Bilic\u2019s willingness to push forward, not least because his fearless tactics have led to famous and unlikely wins at Arsenal, City and Liverpool. Dimitri Payet has been exceptional, Victor Moses has added pace and incision on the flanks, Manuel Lanzini is a neat passer and Diafra Sakho is scoring. Yet the memory of those defeats to Bournemouth and Leicester at Upton Park has not been washed away yet. Which is the real West Ham? The team who ended City\u2019s 100% record or the team who could have been 5-0 down by half-time against Bournemouth? Fresh from drawing 1-1 at Anfield, Norwich City will hope that it is the latter and Alex Neil\u2019s side will have a chance of achieving a positive result if they can frustrate the Hammers in the early stages. West Ham picked up their first home win by beating Newcastle United 2-0 last week, but they were settled by a pearler from Payet in the ninth minute. Scoring early allowed West Ham to use their pace on the break and Norwich, who have good counterattacking players, will be determined not to allow them as much space.

Under fire after a disappointing run of results, Brendan Rodgers could probably do without a visit from Aston Villa. Anfield has been a happy hunting ground for Villa since they last lost there in December 2010, and although Paul Lambert was in charge when they won there last season and in December 2012, Tim Sherwood also had Liverpool\u2019s number at Wembley in April. Neither side are in form and Anfield will be an anxious place. Liverpool are winless in their last four league matches and Villa are a point above the relegation zone after failing to win since the opening day. Selling Christian Benteke to Liverpool in the summer was bound to make life harder for Villa, although they have still scored two more goals than the team who bought the Belgian, who is expected to miss out against his former club with a hamstring injury. Yet could it be a blessing in disguise for Liverpool? Danny Ings scored his first goal for Liverpool in the draw with Norwich and his movement gave their attack more zest after he replaced Benteke at half-time.

Headline news: Diego Costa is suspended. Chelsea will be without their roguish striker against Newcastle United and that could mean there will be a rare start for Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my against a former club, assuming Jos\u00e9 Mourinho prefers the Frenchman to Radamel Falcao. R\u00e9my\u2019s opportunities at Chelsea have been limited because of Costa\u2019s form \u2013 although he started the Champions League victory over Maccabi Tel Aviv \u2013 but he is a fine striker, quick, clever and deadly, and Newcastle\u2019s teetering defenders will not relish the task of containing him. Judging by the way that Watford\u2019s Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo tore Newcastle apart, R\u00e9my could fill his boots if Chelsea\u2019s creative players are in the mood.

Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters    5) Swansea need to rediscover menace in front of goal This is a match that Swansea could do with winning if they are to attain their highest ever league finish. Pre-season, and in the early weeks after the season kicked off, Swansea looked a fair bet to continue their serene progress under Garry Monk and even end up above the sixth place that John Toshack\u2019s thrilling side achieved in 1982. But doubts are spreading, with the midweek Capital One Cup defeat by Hull City meaning they have failed to score for three matches in a row. Far from a crisis, but irksome enough to draw attention to the fact that Jefferson Montero has gone off the boil after his scorching start to the campaign, Gylfi Sigurdsson has yet to find the net and there is a strong, perhaps excessive, reliance on Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis remaining sharp. Finishing higher than last season means avoiding hapless streaks and leapfrogging sides who were above them \u2013 that includes Southampton, who go into Saturday\u2019s game after a satisfying 6-0 win at MK Dons and with Graziano Pell\u00e8, Sadio Man\u00e9, Dusan Tadic and Shane Long all in good form. So Swansea will probably need to score a few to win. That task could be harder if Ryan Bertrand returns for the home side. Plenty to look forward to at St Mary\u2019s then. PD  \u2022 Livermore returns as Swansea go down at Hull \u2022 Man\u00e9 shows what Manchester United lack at No10  6) Wilson hopes to send a message to Hodgson  Charlie Austin got an England call-up last season after successfully taking his lower-league scoring exploits into the top flight. Callum Wilson has ambitions of doing the same and looks well set to do so. Eddie Howe said last week that as far as he knows, Roy Hodgson has yet to watch Wilson in person. From the striker\u2019s viewpoint, this weekend might be a good one for the England manager to check him out, as his speed, strength and sharpness could do further damage to a Stoke City defence that has yet to find a way of coping without Ryan Shawcross. Bournemouth, by contrast, coped well without their injured captain and centre-back, Tommy Elphick, last week, as Sylvain Distin stepped in and showed he can still be solid in the Premier League \u2013 against Sunderland, at least. Stoke\u2019s creativity and firepower mean the veteran will face a far tougher test this weekend.

David Silva pulling up injured in the warm-up last weekend deprived us of the first chance to see the Silva-De Bruyne-Sterling-Ag\u00fcero quartet so the opportunity to witness that this weekend is certainly something to look forward to. Mind you, Spurs look like they have the makings of a nifty forward line too, with Delle Alli blossoming, Son Heung-min looking like a splendid purchase and Christian Eriksen getting back into the groove. All Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side need now is for Harry Kane to regain the sharpness that saw him finish just behind Ag\u00fcero in last season\u2019s scoring charts. His chances of doing that could hinge heavily on whether or not Vincent Kompany is fit for the visitors.

It is becoming increasingly difficult for Louis van Gaal to justify including Wayne Rooney in his first XI, whether at centre forward or in the hole, but the England striker should start against Sunderland.

After six years in Spain, Allan Nyom has made an excellent start to life in England, proving a crucial part of Watford\u2019s defensive solidity while also launching regular dangerous raids from right-back.

At times he is devastating \u2013 such as during the 3-0 win at Southampton last month \u2013 but at other times he seems to lack finesse and even struggles to get involved in matches when Everton\u2019s play becomes too intricate for him. It\u2019s a problem because Everton have no real alternative to the Belgian. When Lukaku returns to the Hawthorns, the scene of his prolific season, Everton would be well advised to give a first league start of the campaign to Gerard Deulofeu, who was wonderful in the midweek win against Reading, and could provide Lukaku with crosses and also open up winding avenues of attack that Arouna Kon\u00e9 cannot.

That result, coupled with Porto\u2019s draw against Dynamo Kiev on the same night, means Chelsea could consolidate a strong position in Group G with victory in Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o on Tuesday, yet this is Mourinho\u2019s third visit as their manager and his record at his old club is not encouraging.   Related: Chelsea\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Mourinho says FA has set precedent with Gabriel\u2019s ban    His initial return was in his first season in England, when a late Benni McCarthy header inflicted Chelsea\u2019s second defeat under his stewardship, three weeks before Christmas. Chelsea managed a draw through an Andriy Shevchenko goal the next time, in 2007, although they lost John Terry to injury and on a feisty night had Petr Cech, Michael Essien, Michael Ballack and Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 booked. On both occasions Chelsea managed to recover the damage at home, though in 2007 Porto took a shock lead before Ballack and Arjen Robben saw Mourinho\u2019s side through. Porto have changed since Mourinho left them, morphing from a winning team to a selling phenomenon. In the past 10 years the club and the agents they favour have banked in the region of \u00a3500m from player sales. It is an interesting question, though an academic one, to ponder how Porto might have fared had they kept hold of James Rodr\u00edguez, Pepe, Fernando and Radamel Falcao and many others, though the likelihood is that was never their intention. Porto have established a niche in the market as shrewd movers-on of mostly South American talent and everyone seems happy with the profitability of the exercise. If only everyone at Chelsea was happy the reunion might turn into a party, though the possibility seems remote at the moment. The big difference Porto will notice, apart from a few more grey hairs and a wholly altered Chelsea squad, is that Mourinho is not returning as the Special One, self-proclaimed or otherwise. He received a warm welcome on his first return because his 2004 Champions League success with Porto was still fresh in the memory. In 2007 he had two Premier League titles under his belt, had topped the group stage ahead of Barcelona and was on his way to another semi-final showdown with Liverpool. He was a manager at the top of his game whereas Mourinho has not been cutting the same sort of dash this season. Damaged goods might be putting it a shade too strongly, but he looks like someone whose pride and confidence has taken a battering. Mainly because there is, or was, someone else at the club whose pride and confidence has been completely shot to pieces, all through the manager\u2019s doing. If Porto fans with memories of the 2004 version could have seen Mourinho\u2019s performance after the Capital One Cup win at Walsall on Wednesday they would have been surprised at the transformation. Sitting hunched behind a table and almost slipping out of sight behind the pulled-up collar of a tightly zipped anorak, Mourinho dealt wearily with the fall-out from Diego Costa\u2019s suspension, Gabriel Paulista\u2019s reprieve, Chelsea\u2019s faltering start to the season and why he was unwilling to reveal his true feelings on refereeing and disciplinary issues. He was not asked about the Eva Carneiro situation, partly because time was short and the situation unsuitable, but mostly because he would have declined to speak on that subject too. Yet perhaps more than the surprisingly poor results in the Premier League, Mourinho\u2019s treatment of his own medical staff \u2013 the physiotherapist Jon Fearn as well as Dr Carneiro \u2013 has dominated the negativity surrounding Chelsea. Mourinho was in the wrong and must have known it, yet no apology was forthcoming, there was to be no explanation or olive branch on offer. A powerful, highly regarded Premier League manager publicly humiliating less well-paid employees at his own club, presumably on the basis that they are expendable, can never be a good look. Someone at Chelsea must be able to see that, ought to have been capable of ending the whole unpleasant situation, yet it has been allowed to fester to the point where Carneiro has had to leave the club to consider her legal position. That in itself will not worry Chelsea unduly \u2013 they are big enough to take a hit \u2013 but the damage to Mourinho\u2019s reputation could be significant. If he was ever at odds with his players over the issue he appears to have won them back for the time being, for Chelsea have looked much more like their old selves in their most recent outings. But the manager has been noticeably defensive and guarded over the past six weeks. He appears not so self-assured, and a breezy, almost arrogant confidence in his own convictions formed a large part of the successful Mourinho schtick. Along with Eden Hazard, Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Terry this season, he seems to have lost much of his old oomph. Form is temporary though \u2013 it is class that is permanent. While Chelsea\u2019s players will have plenty of opportunities to demonstrate the truth of that old saying, their manager might be wondering if the opposite applies. The worry at the back of Mourinho\u2019s mind must be that lack of class could turn out to be permanent as well.", "publicationDate": "2015-09-27T09:00:04Z", "title": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho faces diminishing returns when Chelsea go to Porto", "sentences": ["With all the distractions currently surrounding Chelsea a return trip to Porto is probably the last thing Jos\u00e9 Mourinho needs, though at least the Champions League is the competition that allowed the club some breathing space after their dismal start to the domestic season, in the form of a straightforward win against Maccabi Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/sep/27/jose-mourinho-diminishing-returns-chelsea-porto-champions-league"}, {"tags": ["Fiorentina", "Serie A", "European club football", "Internazionale", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Paulo Sousa was not exactly a popular choice as Fiorentina manager. \u201cWelcome to hell,\u201d read one of the many fresh pieces of graffiti addressed to him near the Stadio Artemio Franchi as rumours of his imminent appointment began to spread back in June. Another described him as a \u201cgobbo di merda\u201d \u2013 a \u201chunchback piece of shit\u201d. The author of this slogan was not making reference to the coach\u2019s appearance, but rather to past allegiances. Sousa played for two seasons with Juventus, known to Fiorentina\u2019s supporters as \u201cGobbi\u201d. Depending who you ask, this nickname was either a disparaging verdict on the design of Juventus\u2019s shirts in the 1950s or a reference to the Bianconeri\u2019s good fortune with refereeing decisions. Old Italian superstitions dictate that hunchbacks bring good luck.   Related: Fiorentina\u2019s Paulo Sousa: we can challenge for Serie A title    Few people in Florence believed Sousa would do the same. Fans questioned whether he was even qualified for his new role. He had won domestic titles over the last two years with Maccabi Tel Aviv in Israel and Basel in Switzerland, but these were lesser leagues and in both cases he had taken over the clubs when they were already reigning champions. All he had needed to do (on paper, at least) was maintain the status quo. Fiorentina\u2019s supporters, on the other hand, were tired of treading water. Vincenzo Montella had guided their team to fourth place in three consecutive seasons, before getting fired after a dispute seemingly caused by his own desire to aim higher. He had challenged the club\u2019s board to back him in the transfer market or at least remove the \u20ac5m release clause in his contract which might discourage other clubs from giving him the opportunity to win trophies elsewhere. Instead of seeing their squad strengthened after Sousa\u2019s appointment, fans were instead confronted with the news that Mohamed Salah was jumping ship to Roma. Although Fiorentina had agreed with Chelsea to take up their option to extend his loan by another year, the player exercised his own right \u2013 enshrined in a separate document \u2013 not to play along. The Viola have since lodged a complaint with Fifa. Sousa refused to be discouraged by Salah\u2019s departure, or indeed those of other starters who moved on. Stefan Savic, one of the best defenders in Serie A last season, was sold to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, while Joaqu\u00edn returned to Real Bet\u00eds and Fiorentina\u2019s goalkeeper Neto joined Juventus, but the new manager simply said that: \u201cI prefer to dedicate my attention to players who know and respect the value of this shirt.\u201d Whatever flaws Sousa might have had, a lack of conviction was not one of them. During a lengthy webchat hosted by Florence-based newspaper La Nazione, he expressed a desire to \u201ccreate a recognisable idea of who we are, a \u2018Fiorentina passport\u2019 that will make us recognisable anywhere\u201d. Montella had, to some extent, already achieved this, but Sousa\u2019s vision differed to that of his predecessor. While he was not minded to tear up everything that had gone before him, the Portuguese wanted more physicality and directness. He said he would install a \u201csystem that is both knowing and aggressive \u2013 both with and without the ball\u201d. Right from their opening home game against Milan, Fiorentina appeared more single-minded \u2013 still dominating possession but adding more verticality to their passing. Their new signing Nikola Kalinic was slipped repeatedly in behind the Rossoneri\u2019s defence with through-balls and chips over the top. Milan were soon enough reduced to 10 men after Rodrigo Ely was caught too many times on the wrong side of the striker. Fiorentina went on to win 2-0. Further victories followed. By the time the dust had settled on Serie A\u2019s fifth round of fixtures last Thursday, Fiorentina sat alone in second place. They would have an immediate chance to go one better, facing off against the league leaders Inter at San Siro on Sunday night. Inter, yet to drop a point, had founded their own fast start on rugged defending and a muscular midfield core of Felipe Melo, Geoffrey Kondogbia and Fredy Guar\u00edn. They had won every game by a single goal, and their football had rarely been attractive, but what did that matter as long as the positive results kept coming? Gazzetta dello Sport\u2019s front-page on Saturday was dedicated to \u201cThe Beauty of Being Ugly.\u201d But there would be nothing pretty about the indecision shown by Samir Handanovic in the second minute of their match against Fiorentina. The Inter goalkeeper was far too leisurely in controlling a backpass and found himself lunging belatedly into Kalinic as the striker seized on the loose ball. A penalty was rightly awarded, which Josip Ilicic crashed into the corner of the net. The Viola had been gifted a perfect start, but what came next was a testament to their newfound decisiveness. One other attribute that Sousa has discussed wanting to embed into his team is the capacity to \u201cseize the right moment in a match\u201d. Sensing Inter\u2019s panic, Fiorentina went for the jugular. They extended their lead a quarter of an hour later, Kalinic poking the ball in from close range after Handanovic failed to palm Ilicic\u2019s shot over the bar. Not long afterwards, Marcos Alonso danced past Ivan Perisic down the left before sweeping a wonderful cross into the middle of the six-yard box, where Kalinic forced the ball home. An Inter defence which had conceded just once all season had now been punctured three times in 23 minutes. The hosts continued to unravel, with Miranda sent off just after the half-hour mark. Just like his Milan counterpart Ely, he was caught out by a threaded pass and wound up fouling Kalinic from behind. The match was effectively over. Although Inter did get a goal back through Mauro Icardi in the second-half, they never threatened to make things close. Instead Kalinic completed his hat-trick, profiting from an unselfish square ball from Ilicic, who had run rampant throughout. Circumstances had favoured Fiorentina. Inter lost Stevan Jovetic to injury during their pre-game warm-up, and were it not for that momentary lapse of judgement by Handanovic then this might have been a very different game. Sousa, though, did also win the tactical battle with Roberto Mancini, his team\u2019s directness in possession allowing them to bypass that heavy-footed Inter midfield. Early in the season it may be, but if there are still supporters in Florence who doubt their new manager then they are unlikely to get much of a hearing this morning. His team, inspired by the likes of Alonso, Ilicic and Matias Vecino, are flying. Kalinic, signed from Dnipro for just \u20ac5.5m this summer, has already scored as many league goals this season as the departed Mario G\u00f3mez did in all of 2014-15. \u201cWe know difficult moments will arrive,\u201d said Sousa at full-time, before adding with a grin: \u201ceven if we hope there won\u2019t be many.\u201d Perhaps this supposed hunchback will turn out to be lucky on that front. For now, though, he and his team will just have to make do with being good. Talking points   Related: Roger Schmidt\u2019s high-pressing Bayer Leverkusen have sights set on Bar\u00e7a    \u2022 I failed to note above that Sunday night\u2019s result means Fiorentina are top of Serie A (level on points with Inter) for the first time this century. The last time they were there, in February 1999, the good times did not last long. A strike partnership of Gabriel Batistuta and Edmundo had fired them to the top of the table, but the former got injured and the latter \u2013 despite being needed by his team more than ever \u2013 exploited a clause in his contract that permitted him to return to Brazil for Carnival. Fiorentina scraped together just three points in four matches during February and finished the season in third. \u2022 To say that this is shaping up as one of the most unpredictable seasons in decades might sound like hyperbole, but is also true. This weekend was the first time since the 1994-95 season that Inter, Juventus and Milan all lost in the same round of Serie A fixtures. Meanwhile, the last undefeated team left in the division is Sassuolo, who drew with Chievo on Sunday and now occupy joint-fourth. \u2022 Just call him Marco Van Benassi. Or maybe Marco Benasten. Or stop trying to force the name combinations and just watch this ridiculously gorgeous goal from Torino\u2019s 21-year-old midfielder over and over again.    .@TorinoFC_1906&#39;s Marco Benassi channels his inner Van Basten with a sensational volley from a tight angle. #SerieA http://t.co/T09dunYMA0&mdash; BT Sport Football (@btsportfootball) September 27, 2015    \u2022 Torino are now up to third, by the way, after Benassi\u2019s goal helped them beat Palermo 2-1 despite them being down to 10 men for most of the second-half, and nine for the final moments of the game. Their president Urbano Cairo told reporters he had taken a photo of the league table to commemorate the moment. \u2022 In the space of seven days, then, Napoli beat Juventus and smashed Lazio 5-0 but also drew with Carpi. The pattern of beating big teams and dropping points against lesser ones was a regular feature of Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s tenure, and appears to have carried over into the Maurizio Sarri era, too. The Partenopei were brilliant in patches \u2013 especially before Lorenzo Insigne left with an injury (happily this turned out to be nothing serious) \u2013 but they did also remind us of their vulnerability by conceding within moments of taking their two-goal lead. The jury is still out for now on whether this team is making progress, but at their best they are certainly scintillating. \u2022 As for Juventus, they have already lost as many league matches in this campaign as they did in all of 2014-15. That the papers were full of stories about Massimiliano Allegri\u2019s job security still feels faintly absurd, given that the club is still just a few months removed from a domestic double and a Champions League final.

Mourinho was disgusted with the first-half display at Newcastle on Saturday, pinpointing six of his players as having put in \u201cvery bad performances\u201d. \u201cSince half-time [at St James\u2019 Park], they know who they are,\u201d said the manager. \u201cThe matches where we performed with a consistent attitude were the matches we won, so we need to learn how to be consistent again. Physically there\u2019s no problem. Tactically it\u2019s the same. Clearly it\u2019s an attitude perspective of some individuals.

Almost every season they have something in the pocket. But how many other serial champions do we have? \u201cLast year we were champions, but the point for me is are we serial champions? Of course it\u2019s very difficult to win every season, but you can be a serial champion in your approach and your attitude. If we fight every minute of every game and in the end someone has two more points, then we don\u2019t go from champions to losers. Not at all. If you lose the Champions League final to Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain or Bayern Munich you are not a loser. Mentally I can say I am a serial champion. I can be five or 10 years without winning a title, but I will still be a serial champion in my approach and my attitude. This is the problem we have at this moment. We have champions, but not serial champions. \u201cNobody understood it but when the Arsenal fans were singing against Chelsea last week and I was tapping my arm, I was saying: \u2018Look at the shirts.\u2019 We have the [golden] Premier League badge on our shirts because we\u2019re champions.

Related: FA: Chelsea\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Mourinho will not be punished over Eva Carneiro incident    Mourinho claimed post-match that the trio\u2019s omission had not been a punishment for the dismal first-half showing at Newcastle on Saturday, a display he had rated as worth \u201cminus one out of 10\u201d. The manager did not name the six players whose \u201cattitude, desire and commitment\u201d he had questioned after that draw on Tyneside, though if he had hoped his actions would provoke a positive response, he was left disappointed. Defeat by Porto put Chelsea third in their Champions League group. The absence of Terry is also drawing focus, particularly as faith has been retained in Branislav Ivanovic, the vice-captain who has worn the armband of late despite his poor performances. The Serb has sat out only one game \u2013 the win over Maccabi Tel Aviv \u2013 with his regular involvement, despite having entered the final 12 months of his contract, perhaps born more of doubts over the new \u00a317m left-back Baba Rahman\u2019s adjustment than Ivanovic\u2019s form. Terry, in contrast, has started only the League Cup win at Walsall of the team\u2019s past five fixtures stretching back to the loss at Everton in mid-September, and was an unused substitute in Portugal. He conducted a solo warm-down in front of the visiting fans, who had been kept behind at the Drag\u00e3o, at around 10pm on Tuesday and was serenaded with a chorus of \u201cWe want our captain back\u201d. The 34-year-old, who acknowledged their support, played every minute of last season\u2019s Premier League campaign and is adamant he will fight to regain his place, with the manager having consistently stressed the esteem in which he holds the centre-half. \u201cI cannot have a better relationship with him, or more trust in him as a player as I have,\u201d Mourinho said last week, with his decision to play Gary Cahill with Kurt Zouma instead apparently born of the specific qualities of the opponents Chelsea are facing. It remains to be seen whether Terry, who signed a 12-month contract this year, is restored for Saturday\u2019s awkward game against Southampton \u2013 Chelsea have now conceded at least twice in seven of their 10 competitive fixtures this season \u2013 though Matic, Hazard and Falcao are expected to begin the match. The Colombian forward, whose only start to date was at Walsall, would replace Costa as the Spain international completes a three-match domestic ban having been charged with violent conduct over his duel with Laurent Koscielny during the recent win over Arsenal. Costa was impressive at Porto, striking the woodwork as his team chased an equaliser, and called for unity post-match. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good moment now, and we must do more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a good squad with a great deal of quality. We have maybe lost some confidence but the manager knows the strengths of his team. To come out of this we need to be all together, and for everyone to give a little more.\u201d The Football Association has published the written reasons behind a regulatory commission\u2019s decision to suspend Costa, with the minutes revealing Chelsea and their player sought to have \u201cthe analysis of two of the FA\u2019s refereeing experts discounted\u201d.

Yet they seem more ubiquitous than ever. And not just at home either. Their lifestyle and fashions now extend way beyond the borders of the places they originated in (New York\u2019s Brooklyn, the 3rd Arrondissement in Paris, Shoreditch in London, Berlin\u2019s Kreuzberg and Prenzlauer Berg, and S\u00f6dermalm in Stockholm). This autumn they have set up shop on Paris\u2019s Left Bank.   Related: From flappers to grunge, a century of the invincible hipster \u2013 in pictures    On the edge of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, last bastion of the Paris intellectual, Le Bon March\u00e9 department store \u2013 a beacon for the bourgeoisie since it opened in 1852 \u2013 is showcasing the culture of Brooklyn, the New York borough that, if it were a city, would be the fifth most populous in the US. On the rue de S\u00e8vres these days, you can get a tattoo, buy a vegetable-tanned leather bag, or nibble on a brookie, a cross between a brownie and cookie. For most of the 20th century, Brooklyn was working-class. Movie directors Woody Allen and Spike Lee grew up there; so did rapper Jay-Z. In the 1990s, a better-heeled class started moving in, fleeing the high rents of Manhattan, and after that the borough became the destination of choice for young nonconformists and artists. This is what Le Bon March\u00e9 has seized on: the emergence of hipsters not as a fashion trend but as a social phenomenon. \u201cThey\u2019re urban bohemians who help each other out, who have this desire to produce and consume in an alternative way,\u201d says Lisa Attia, the store\u2019s commercial director, explaining the idea behind the Brooklyn Rive Gauche theme. \u201cOur clientele is looking for authenticity, for creative people who are dedicated to their work, for meaningful stories.\u201d The term \u201chipster\u201d was coined in the jazz age of the 1940s, a catch-all for trendily dressed young people. Today\u2019s hipsters are a particular type of nonconformist. Truly \u201chip\u201d people now tend to be entrepreneurs, buying and selling local products and running micro-businesses. And it is Brooklyn where these organic-minded foodies and savvy techies feel at home. \u201cA real community has emerged, people who want to unplug from a hyperconnected, dehumanised world, artists and others who don\u2019t fit into the classic American definition of success,\u201d say Daniel and Brenna Lewis, founders of Brooklyn Tailors, a business they started in their apartment in 2007. They now sell around the world, most notably at Barneys New York, the luxury retail chain, and is among the 150 companies featured at Le Bon March\u00e9. Others include Fishs Eddy dishes (modelled on the Arts and Crafts movement), Coral &amp; Tusk embroidered linens (inspired by Native American art) and Save Khaki sportswear (designed for the outdoorsy, no-frills kind of guy). Almost all are locally made, artisanally crafted and clearly labelled. The hipster lifestyle is fertile ground for alternative businesses, and most manage to hold on to their start-up ideals while embracing the fundamentals of the free-market economy. \u201cI like nice things, I like being able to have a nice life, it\u2019s not taboo. The art world, which is also run by money, is nowhere near as honest,\u201d says Scott Campbell, an American tattoo artist invited to set up shop at Le Bon March\u00e9. In Brooklyn, he works out of a studio in the Williamsburg neighbourhood, and his clients include Sting, Jennifer Aniston and Marc Jacobs. \u201cTattooing, just like the alternative culture that hipsters advocate, has gone democratic and today attracts people from all social classes, even the most privileged,\u201d he says.     Participants compete in the Horn-Rimmed Glasses Throw at the inaugural Hipster Olympics in Berlin, in 2012. Photograph: Gero Breloer/AP    The real-estate market in Brooklyn tells the tale: today, prices in neighbourhoods such as Dumbo largely outstrip Manhattan\u2019s tony Upper East Side. In Williamsburg, another hip neighbourhood, a new Apple store is being built, while retail boutiques such as J Crew and Sandro share the streetscape with an increasing number of independently run stores. Some big stars are coming to live, too: actors Lena Dunham and Sarah Jessica Parker now call Brooklyn home, with luxury apartments to suit their status. Hipster culture has become a global commercial and social phenomenon, and some western cities are now living by its rules. For British economist Douglas McWilliams, hipsters have inherited the \u201cgolden boy\u201d ethos of the 1990s and updated it with more populist values, ostentation now being seen as in supremely bad taste. \u201cThe Ferraris and champagne of yesteryear have been replaced with Tube tickets, bicycles and cappuccinos to go,\u201d says McWilliams. He is a former British government adviser.     It has also helped change people\u2019s habits: now, even police officers can wear a beard and have tattoos    In his book, The Flat White Economy, McWilliams sees the phenomenon of the hip young entrepreneur as a central element of the new world economy, whether it be in Shoreditch or Pigalle, Tel Aviv or Lisbon. The success of hipster style comes from the fact that \u201cit isn\u2019t associated with a logo, unlike the bling-bling 90s, and so it can be reproduced at all levels of fashion,\u201d McWilliams says, giving the example of skinny jeans and lumberjack shirts, which are as easy to find at upscale designer shops as they are at a discount outlet. \u201cYou show that you\u2019re \u2018in\u2019, not by buying something with a logo on it but by your ability to follow the rush for the latest eccentricity.\u201d This quest for fine-tuned individuality has often been the subject of mockery in the cities where it occurs. In 2012, Berlin started organising the Hipster Olympics, an event that pokes fun at hipster fashion with competitions such as the Cloth Bag Sack Race and the Horn-Rimmed Glasses Throw. In the UK, Channel 4 ran a TV sitcom called Nathan Barley, satirising the hipsters of Shoreditch. In 2013, the New York Times ran an article, How hipsters ruined Paris, condemning a now- global phenomenon that threatens to lay waste to real neighbourhood cultures. On social networks, there are satirical quizzes that show readers how to distinguish a hipster from a jihadist. One of the most virulent criticisms is summed up by sociologist Pascal Monfort, who teaches fashion and design at Paris\u2019s HEC business school: \u201cHipster culture,\u201d he says, \u201ccreated a lifestyle that produces the exact opposite of what it promises: the search for global uniformity instead of local authenticity.\u201d Nevertheless, say Isma\u00ebl Jmili and Ines de Peretti, students at ESMOD fashion school in Paris, hipsters are a market no one can ignore; they say they have even studied the phenomenon in class. \u201cIt\u2019s a commercial reality. And if the in-crowd of the capital are getting tired of it, they should be aware it doesn\u2019t only exist in Paris. It has spread to the provinces, which are more plugged into the trends than ever thanks to the advent of brands like Asos (the UK online fashion retailer). It has also helped change people\u2019s habits: now, even police officers can wear a beard and have tattoos.\u201d This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde \u2022 This article was amended on 7 October 2015. An earlier version said that Douglas McWilliams \u201cis facing trial for allegedly assaulting a prostitute\u201d. This is incorrect.

I have, I say, though later I Google it to get the facts straight.  It\u2019s attributed to Joseph Kennedy, paterfamilias of the Kennedy clan who, in 1929, was getting his shoes shined by a young boy who was also making confident predictions about which stocks would rise. For Kennedy, it was a moment of revelation. He sold his portfolio. Not long afterwards, Wall Street crashed and the world was plunged into the greatest depression ever seen. So a tip from the shoeshine boy is a sign that the bubble is about to burst. That the wave of confidence will finally crash upon the shore. That the jig is up.  Pallot used to be the digital editorial director of Cond\u00e9 Nast in New York and now he has a startup. But then, we\u2019re at the world\u2019s biggest startup conference in San Francisco, a few miles down the road from Silicon Valley where the world\u2019s greatest concentration of technology startups first started up.  His company is in the booming field of VR, or virtual reality, which is to 2015 roughly what Rubik\u2019s Cubes were to 1982, though with rather bigger potential consequences. Pallot claims it\u2019s the logical next step for journalistic content. In 20 years\u2019 time, you won\u2019t be reading this on the page, I\u2019ll probably be leading you by the hand through a 3D rendering of a virtual TechCrunch conference floor. Or, more likely, you\u2019ll be leading yourself and I\u2019ll be claiming jobseeker\u2019s allowance. But anyway. In the meantime, Pallot asks me if I\u2019ve heard of the tip from the shoeshine boy. I have, I say, and tell him it\u2019s been on my mind. Because for three days, I\u2019ve been hearing about \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2013 a Silicon Valley term for companies that have been valued at more than $1bn. When this usage was first coined, less than two years ago, there were 39 of them. Today, there are 147. Or as Matthew Wong, a senior analyst at CB Insights, tells me: \u201cThe funding is at levels that we haven\u2019t seen since 2000.\u201d As those with longer memories will recall, that was the year the dotcom bubble burst. It needs explaining because there are an awful lot of people at TechCrunch whose memories simply don\u2019t go back that far: the typical startup founder is male and in his 20s. Back in 2000, Google was less than 18 months old and Facebook wasn\u2019t even a glimmer in Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s eye \u2013 he was still at high school. (At 31, he\u2019s now practically Silicon Valley\u2019s elder statesman.)   Related: Five lessons Silicon Valley has for UK tech entrepreneurs    Everything has changed. And is changing at an ever-faster pace. Eight years ago, TechCrunch launched its Disrupt conference with 45 startups. This year, there are 5,000 of them. Over three days I talk to founders of companies from San Francisco and Texas and Uruguay and Beirut and Stockholm and Tel Aviv and Warsaw. There are apps for crowdfunded mortgages and cheaper divorces and better sex. There\u2019s \u201cExpedia for golf\u201d and \u201cFacebook for cars\u201d and \u201cNest for water\u201d and \u201cTinder for dogs\u201d. There\u2019s a virtual reality teddy bear, a device that claims it will be able to read your emotions via a contact lens in your eye and another that will automate your home cannabis farm (marijuana is a big deal in Silicon Valley right now). I miss the panel on nuclear fusion startups but they\u2019re around.  They\u2019ve all paid upwards of $3,000 (\u00a31,900) to be here and they\u2019re all trying to attract the attention of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest beasts. The VCs \u2013 venture capitalists to you and me. The money guys.  \u201cHow do you spot them?\u201d I ask Peter Becronis, the founder of a real estate startup called Owner\u2019s Vault. \u201cOh, it\u2019s easy,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re all men, older guys who are in jeans and brown boots and perhaps a blue jacket. Oh, and a good watch. They\u2019re the ones who shuffle past you trying not to catch your eye.\u201d It\u2019s a long shot for the likes of Becronis to be here, but not a total pipe dream. Because hundreds of startups are being funded each month. Vast sums of money are changing hands. Crunchbase, TechCrunch\u2019s sister site, lists the deals that are being done on a daily basis. On the day I write this, I check it and find 24 companies that have just received funding, including Kreditech, which got $92m (it uses \u201cbig data and complex machine-learning algorithms to credit score everyone worldwide\u201d) and Medium, which received $57m (it\u2019s a platform that has found another new business model that seems to involve not paying journalists). Every month the amount of money being invested in early-stage startups goes up. And every month, more and more people are starting to use the B-word. Bubble. The last time this amount of money was swilling around, we know how it ended. \u201cBack then, a lot of websites launched but that\u2019s all they were, websites,\u201d Mike Butcher, TechCrunch\u2019s editor-at-large, tells me. \u201cNow in 2015, all those technologies that were predicted \u2013 AI, drones, VR \u2013 have all turned up. The innovation is real. And it just continues to get bigger and bigger. There are more VC firms here than you can poke a stick at. \u201cIs it a bubble?\u201d he asks and then answers the question himself, vividly, if not entirely clearly. \u201cIt depends. How many unicorns can you fit through the eye of a needle? Anyway, unicorns are over. It\u2019s all about decacorns now. Companies that are worth tens of billions of dollars.\u201d     AOL\u2019s takeover of Time Warner in 2000 was the largest merger in US corporate history at the time. Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/AP    In 2000 the bubble was in publicly listed companies \u2013 organisations like the then upstart AOL, which bought Time Warner for $164bn, the largest merger in America business history, and then most spectacular blow-up. Or in Britain, Lastminute.com, whose share price peaked at 511p before crashing to 80p a month later. Both companies survived, unlike many, but it was a long struggle back up for both of them. (In a neat bit of circularity, AOL bought TechCrunch along the way.) In 2015, it\u2019s private money flowing into companies that may or may not go public one day. The shoeshine boy wouldn\u2019t be tipping stocks in 2015, but what would he be doing? I ask Ned Desmond, the chief operating officer of TechCrunch. He thinks for a moment. \u201cHe would probably be an Uber driver who has his own angel investment line,\u201d he says. But James Pallot tops that. He\u2019s flown in from JFK and had his shoes shined in the airport. \u201cAnd the guy had a startup. I literally got a tip from the shoeshine boy! He was trying to find an investor for his national shoeshine franchise.\u201d But then, in many ways, there has never been a better time to be a startup. Niko Bonatsos, a VC with General Catalyst Partners, tells me that the sheer number of companies at TechCrunch \u201cspeaks volumes about how the barriers to entry have been removed. It\u2019s really easy to start a company. And lots of companies from other parts of the world see this as a lottery ticket. And for some of them, it will be. It\u2019s the survival of the fittest. And the luckiest.\u201d Pallot and his co-founder are currently \u201cbootstrapping\u201d their company, Emblematic Group, which is creating virtual reality news content. \u201cBootstrapping\u201d is Silicon Valley jargon. It means getting by with what you\u2019ve got. It\u2019s how people have set up companies since the dawn of capitalism. You start a business with a bit of money you already have and you try to attract customers and build it from there. \u201cBootstrapping\u201d is how you figure out if there\u2019s a market and, if so, how you reach it. It\u2019s also, like, totally 20th century. The reason 5,000 companies pay $3,000-plus to come to TechCrunch is because Silicon Valley has another model. People \u2013 strangers \u2013 will give you vast sums of cash to build your company into a global brand overnight. If you can deliver the killer pitch. The pitch that convinces the valley\u2019s top VCs that you are the next Facebook, the next Uber, the next Airbnb. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like this in the rest of the world,\u201d Ned Desmond tells me. \u201cIn Indonesia or Turkey or wherever, normal business culture demands collateral and security. Venture investing has none of that. You are investing in potential.\u201d You\u2019re gambling, basically. Silicon Valley, in 2015, is a giant casino. And the bets are so large because the potential payoffs are so huge. The next Google has to start somewhere. So is it a bubble? \u201cEverything is cyclical,\u201d says Desmond. Does he remember the last crash? \u201cI was there! I was in it. It was terrible. We had just launched a magazine, Business 2.0. Even the name sounds so cringeworthy now. We launched in May 2000 with a record number of advertisements. We had 150 ad pages. A year on, we had 15.\u201d This is not exactly an answer, so I try again. Is it a bubble? \u201cWe published a graph showing the unicorns. It\u2019s a hockey stick. It\u2019s near vertical growth.\u201d So, is it a bubble? \u201cSome people say we are living through a period of history that is unprecedented. They say that everything has changed. That it\u2019s different now.\u201d So is it a bubble? \u201cLook,\u201d he says finally. \u201cYou can answer that question for yourself. Look at the graph. It\u2019s just about common sense.\u201d ***** Out on the exhibition floor, it\u2019s mayhem. Everyone is pitching everyone else. And it\u2019s all being conducted at volume 11. Because if you have a big idea and you want to find a VC, it\u2019s just possible that you might find one out there. I lived through the 2000 bubble and subsequent crash vicariously via a flatmate who got a job with a thrusting new website, and it\u2019s probably my imagination, but there\u2019s something of the atmosphere that I remember of the time: loud, overexcited twentysomethings who tended to leave a mess on the floor. A dozen or more countries have bought into the Silicon Valley dream and sponsored their companies to be here: there are pavilions representing Brazil, the Middle East, Uruguay, Taiwan, Norway, the Czech Republic. And the posters above the stands look like they\u2019ve been produced by an automatic startup buzzword generator. \u201cDigital innovation platform!\u201d reads one. \u201cAccelerate growth disruption\u201d another. A third offers to \u201cquantify your coding\u201d. The first person I talk to \u2013 and that\u2019s because he stops me in my tracks by holding an iPhone with a picture of an anchor on it right in my face \u2013 is Lev Moravtchik. He\u2019s a 33-year-old from Israel who has a dating app \u2013 Diggidi \u2013 that he tries to convince me is going to be bigger than Tinder. Is this the dream? To start your own company? \u201cNo, never! Nothing is forcing me to ruin my life.\u201d Is that the fear? That you\u2019re ruining your life? \u201cOf course! Do you know the figures? More than 90% of all startups fail.\u201d So why are you here? \u201cIsrael is a startup nation. And Diggidi is different from anything else. It\u2019s disruptive.\u201d This is TechCrunch Disrupt. Of course it is. But how exactly? \u201cBecause it\u2019s a dating revolution. Because it can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d     The process of \u2018disruption\u2019 is supposed to describe how established firms such as IBM were overtaken by the likes of Microsoft. Photograph: Fabian Bimmer/AP    But then, if there\u2019s one thing that I learn, it\u2019s that disrupting is to now what dropping out and tuning in was to the 1960s. Everyone\u2019s disrupting. Or at least everyone thinks they are. The usage of the term was coined by Clayton Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business School, to describe how even massive, seemingly invincible companies like IBM can be displaced by scrappy little upstarts like (once upon a time) Microsoft. He called it the \u201ctechnology mudslide hypothesis\u201d. Or how some small new technological breakthrough can have huge world-changing consequences. And if I\u2019m not convinced that Diggidi is the revolution the world has been waiting for \u2013 it takes me a good five minutes to understand how the anchor even comes into it \u2013 I also have no idea what revolution the world is waiting for. But then, as Tod Francis, a Silicon Valley VC with the firm Shasta Ventures, tells me, often the world has no idea either. Until it arrives. \u201cIt\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to keep an open mind. Think about what billion-dollar companies looked like at this stage. Most of the really big ideas were easy to dismiss. Nobody thought sleeping on people\u2019s couches was some amazing business plan, but look at Airbnb. Look at FitBit \u2013 did anyone really need that? No, but people bought it. We see crazy ideas in action every day. Often they are the ones that are accepted.\u201d I meet him on the way into the startup \u201cbattlefield\u201d. It\u2019s the heart of TechCrunch, where 25 companies take to the stage and pitch their hearts out to a panel of VCs who make the judges on Dragons\u2019 Den look like kindergarten teachers. It\u2019s a big deal. Dropbox was a battlefield contender, as was Yammer (sold to Microsoft for $1.2bn), and Mint.    Everyone knows it\u2019s a bubble. That doesn\u2019t mean a lot of people won\u2019t make a lot of money. It\u2019s like musical chairs    And it\u2019s incredibly competitive. More than 950 startups applied and yet, to the outsider, it\u2019s hard to quite see how the ones that got through, got through. There\u2019s a company that is looking to change the world through its robotic nail-art machine. There\u2019s a \u201cpersonalised content relevancy platform\u201d. And an app that will deliver food for your kids\u2019 lunchboxes. (You can\u2019t move in Silicon Valley for delivery apps these days. Or, as one tech editor summarised the sector to me, \u201ctwentysomething men who have set up companies to provide things their mother used to do for them.\u201d) The odds are that one of them will be the next unicorn, but I\u2019m having a hard time spotting which, not least because the man sitting next to me is offering his own running commentary. \u201cEasyPaint?\u201d he says, as we watch a presentation for an app that\u2019s going to revolutionise the painting and decorating industry. \u201cEasyDud more like. People will use it once then take the guy\u2019s number and call him directly.\u201d Michael, who doesn\u2019t want his full name in this article, works for a Japanese technology company and is at TechCrunch to make recommendations for early-stage startups that he thinks his company should acquire. He practically guffaws when I ask him if it\u2019s a bubble. \u201cOf course it\u2019s a bubble. Everyone knows it\u2019s a bubble. Which doesn\u2019t mean that a lot of people won\u2019t make a lot of money. It\u2019s like musical chairs. The question is not if it\u2019s a bubble, but will it remain long enough for us to get in on it? The question is: am I too late? \u201cLook at how many companies are cash-negative. Twitter is still cash-negative. Even Uber is cash-negative. Silicon Valley is a hype machine. That\u2019s how it works. And sometimes if there\u2019s enough hype, it pays off. And sometimes it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s like when you go house-hunting and the real estate agent doesn\u2019t say, \u2018Look at how great the space is. Look at how great the area is.\u2019 They say, \u2018If you don\u2019t buy now, it\u2019ll be twice the price in six months\u2019 time.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t reflect true value. It\u2019s just a sort of herd mentality.\u201d And he gives me the example of San Francisco\u2019s first gold rush, the huge influx of money in 1849 that created large swaths of the Victorian city that still stands today. \u201cPeople thought prices would go up and up and up and that eventually they would fill in the bay and build there. People were buying plots of land beneath the ocean because they thought that in the future prices would rise. It\u2019s exactly the same as we\u2019re seeing today.\u201d     Rocketing property prices have caused tension in San Francisco between wealthy tech staff \u2013 who are often driven by bus from downtown areas to their places of work \u2013 and longer-established residents. Photograph: John Orvis/Demotix/Corbis    It\u2019s an apposite example because San Francisco is in the grip of a property boom that makes London\u2019s look almost sane and reasonable by comparison. The average rent on a one-bed apartment has just hit $3,500 (\u00a32,300) a month, and that\u2019s if you can find one. The entire city is pinched. I can\u2019t find a single hotel room for under $350 and so rent a room in someone\u2019s house via Airbnb, and even that is $150 a night. The founders of a Parisian startup, Aircall, tell me they\u2019ve come to look for funding. \u201cWe are four guys so we thought, OK, we will share an apartment and it is $10,000 a month! We were like, wow!\u201d They still came though. \u201cBut we left the tech team in France. Europe is like the third world to Silicon Valley now.\u201d Mike Butcher tells me that \u201cSilicon Valley isn\u2019t a place any more. It\u2019s a state of mind. You can be in Ukraine or Berlin or wherever.\u201d You can. But if you want to be where the money is, you still want to be here. And it\u2019s here in San Francisco that the tectonics of the tech industry are smashing up against those of the real world, a San Andreas-sized faultline rumbling deep beneath the ground. \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d used to be a chain of dormitory towns a commuter train ride away from San Francisco where the likes of Google and Apple have their campuses. But increasingly, it\u2019s moving to San Francisco itself. Everyone wants to be downtown, where the bars and hipster cafes are. But the more attractive the city becomes to startups, the more cripplingly expensive it is for everyone else. The city that gave birth to the counterculture, that stuck it to the Man, that is still home to organic co-ops and vegan co-living spaces, is right in the path of the Great Disruption \u2013 a storm whipped up and driven by the most relentless form of capitalism ever witnessed. Tim Fernando, 31-year-old co-founder of an Oxford-based startup, Esplorio, explains why they\u2019re staying in Oxford. \u201cA software engineer will [cost us] $120,000 here, whereas in Oxford, it\u2019s more like \u00a326,000.\u201d And yet, it\u2019s hard to ignore the benefits that just being here confers. \u201cWe\u2019d literally just arrived and were sitting in a coffee shop and it turned out that the woman sitting opposite us was a director of marketing at Apple. That kind of thing just doesn\u2019t happen in Britain.\u201d I rather like Esplorio. It uses data from your phone to create an automated travelogue of where you\u2019ve been, and they tell me they\u2019ve had $300,000 in early-stage funding. \u201cWell done, I say. \u201cThat\u2019s sounds like a lot.\u201d \u201cDoes it?\u201d says Fernando and he sounds slightly mournful. \u201cNot in Silicon Valley terms it\u2019s not.\u201d And it\u2019s true, it\u2019s not. And it\u2019s as useful a measure as any of how Silicon Valley has parted ways with reality. Or at least the reality that most of us know; a world where $300,000 remains quite a lot of money. Silicon Valley, on the other hand, is a place where billion-dollar companies are being created almost overnight. Six years ago, Uber didn\u2019t exist. In its last round of funding, it raised $1bn in capital from private investors, giving it a supposed value of $50bn. It\u2019s a penta-decacorn. Less a mythical creature, some might argue, more a Frankenstein monster. But Silicon Valley\u2019s primacy remains indisputable. \u201cLook at how many world-changing technologies have been created within a few miles of here,\u201d Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, tells me. \u201cYou\u2019re using an iPhone, which was invented 25 minutes away. You\u2019re staying in an Airbnb, which was invented five minutes from here. You\u2019re probably using Twitter, which was dreamed up around the corner. It\u2019s incredible how concentrated the real innovation has been. How much has come out of this one area.\u201d Y Combinator is probably the most famous of Silicon Valley\u2019s seed funds. It runs a three-month programme that nurtures startups and eventually helps launch them into the world. Dropbox, Airbnb and Reddit all began life there. \u201cEight thousand companies applied for the last batch,\u201d says Altman. \u201cAnd we have two batches a year.\u201d There\u2019s so much money in Silicon Valley at the moment, he says, because interest rates are so low and \u201cstartups have been one of the few asset classes that have generated real growth\u201d. And the reason there are so many unicorns is that VCs bet big or they go home. He says it doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s a bubble or not, good companies will still make it whatever, an argument that echoes Bill Gates\u2019s remarks from last year. He claimed that half the companies being created in Silicon Valley were \u201csilly\u201d and two thirds of them would fail. \u201cBut the dozen or so ideas that emerge out of that are going to be really important.\u201d Already \u201cunicorpses\u201d have started to appear. Groupon\u2019s value is dropping like a stone. It\u2019s being predicted that Dropbox, once valued at $10bn, will be \u201cthe first dead decacorn\u201d. On the TechCrunch stage, people try not to say the \u201cbubble\u201d word. They say there is \u201cfrothiness\u201d. That there is \u201ca lot of capital that is seeking returns\u201d. That \u201cvaluations are a bit robust\u201d. Elsewhere, people are not so restrained. Earlier this year, Bill Gurley, a partner at Benchmark, a big Silicon Valley venture firm, sent out a series of tweets warning of a bubble, including this one: \u201cArguing we aren\u2019t in a bubble because it\u2019s not as bad as 1999 is like saying that Kim Jong-Un is fine because he\u2019s not as bad as Hitler.\u201d    When Airbnb first pitched their idea at me, that you\u2019d stay on an airbed in a stranger\u2019s house, I was not excited  Marcus Hawkins     Out on the exhibition floor, I meet Marcus Hawkins, another Brit. He\u2019s from Norfolk and has successfully run his own software company for a decade or so but he recently set up a new company, Patrolo, a business-to-business enterprise offering a website mistake-correction service. What are you disrupting, I ask him. He thinks for a moment. \u201cKing\u2019s Lynn.\u201d We swap other bits of jargon we\u2019ve picked up. Have you pivoted, I say, a piece of startup-ese I\u2019d learned five minutes earlier. It means to change your business strategy rapidly. \u201cI\u2019ve pivoted so many times I\u2019m practically facing backwards,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s OK. I have a lot of runway left.\u201d Which is the amount of time a startup has before the money runs out, he explains. With the flights and so on, it was a \u00a36,000 gamble to come, he says, \u201cbut I know everyone says this. But what we\u2019re offering is unique.\u201d And unique is what Sam Altman tells me is what investors want. They want unique. Quirky. Crazy. And he cites the Airbnb example that everyone cites, though in fairness he was actually there at the time. \u201cWhen Airbnb first pitched their idea at me, that you\u2019d stay on an airbed in a stranger\u2019s house, I was not excited at all by that. Only halfway through did they develop the idea of renting the whole apartment and then I got excited. If the ideas aren\u2019t crazy enough, the industry is not taking enough risk.\u201d It\u2019s something you\u2019d be hard-pushed to say of some of the startups here. I inspect a smart dog bowl aimed at preventing your dog from overeating, a wristband that will tell a woman precisely when she\u2019s at her most fertile, and a robotic cooking machine that has a lot of parts that look like they\u2019d need washing up.     Even rapper Snoop Dogg is attempting to establish a tech startup \u2013 with the vital ingredient of cannabis. Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images    And any number of cannabis-related businesses. Since marijuana was made legal in four states, the tech industry has rushed into the space. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a marijuana unicorn,\u201d a man from a website called Investing in Cannabis tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s hotter than hot right now. Everyone\u2019s placing their bets.\u201d A point that is proven when Snoop Dogg takes to the stage to announce his cannabis startup, Merry Jane (a lifestyle media site aimed at cannabis users). The inventiveness of the hardware and ingenuity of the software and chutzpah of everyone is quite mind-boggling. There are so many ideas and so much energy and hard work and, more often than not, hard-earned cash being invested in them. If you have come from Bratislava, you\u2019ll have put your own money into the business, a Slovak startup founder called Lukas Alner tells me. \u201cWhereas here, they all graduate from Stanford and Harvard and then go and work in the same places. If they want to make a contact or raise money, they just pick up the phone. It\u2019s very hard to break into that as an outsider. They are pack animals.\u201d    We all love to talk about disruption. But if you are doing something disruptive, people are\u00a0getting hurt  Vinod Khosla     And then there\u2019s the small matter of what it may all mean one day not long from now. Where all this innovation will lead \u2013 a question I contemplate when a founder from Hong Kong called Henry Hu shows me Cafe X, a robotic coffee machine which, he claims, makes perfect artisanal cappuccino. So you\u2019re disrupting baristas? \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cA barista will design the programme which the machine will copy. So, we are extending the skills of talented baristas to a lot more people.\u201d Yadda, yadda, yadda. A Dublin-based startup shows me impressive software that uses \u201cmachine creativity\u201d to create graphic art. \u201cSixty one per cent of the cost of video games is the artwork,\u201d the co-founder, Eric Risser, tells me. \u201cWe\u2019re disrupting that.\u201d So you\u2019re putting artists out of work? \u201cNo, we\u2019re enabling video-games companies to create more and better games.\u201d ***** The truth is, it\u2019s a dog-eat-dog world out there. Disrupt or be disrupted. As Vinod Khosla, a somewhat irascible billionaire and head of a leading venture capital firm reminds the audience: \u201cWe all love to talk about disruption. But if you are doing something disruptive, people are getting hurt. Revolutions are hard on people. People get hurt.\u201d It\u2019s what is forgotten in all of this. If it is a bubble, and if it bursts, the VCs will be OK, of course they will. They\u2019re already rich. It\u2019ll be the little people who will suffer. The 1,100 employees of Groupon who just lost their jobs will be a tiny taste of the pain to come. The ripple of potential consequences vast and as yet unknowable. And if it isn\u2019t a bubble, if the world really has changed, and economic laws too, and everything keeps going up and up and up, it\u2019s still the little people who\u2019ll suffer. The great swaths of us whose services will no longer be required in a coming era that is just around the corner. In the past 18 months, all of us who live in cities around the world have watched as taxi drivers have protested and lost their livelihoods and Uber has swept in and cleaned up, taking 20% of every fare along the way. Don\u2019t think this is going to stop at taxis \u2013 where Uber is going to end up is more or less anyone\u2019s guess. Last month I met the head of Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s robotics faculty, whose entire department has just been poached by the firm. Including him. First they came for the booksellers and I did not speak out because I was not a bookseller. Next they came for the taxi drivers etc etc. Then baristas, divorce lawyers, artists, journalists\u2026 there are not going to be an awful lot of jobs of any description left. How any of us are going to be earning a living in 20 years\u2019 time, in 10 years\u2019 time, is something that most of us aren\u2019t thinking about. In this light, building a startup that has a 90% chance of failure looks like a pretty smart option. \u201cI think there is going to be massive job destruction in the next 10 to 20 years,\u201d says Sam Altman. \u201cI think we are already seeing it. Technology increases wealth but it also concentrates it. There\u2019s a huge coming threat to all of us.\u201d Companies in Silicon Valley think differently from the rest of us. Their ambition is of a different order. Their rate of growth is like nothing we\u2019ve ever seen before. And it\u2019s in San Francisco, where technology meets the real world, that we\u2019re starting to see the beginnings of what this clash of civilisations will look like. Or as Altman puts it: \u201cIf founders in San Francisco can build a new $50bn company in five years but the city can\u2019t approve a single new housing development in that time, that\u2019s a mismatch.\u201d It\u2019s all a mismatch. We and the great tech world we\u2019re building. But then I probably would say that. My industry is just one of hundreds in the throes of the Great Disruption. Yours too, possibly. Even if you haven\u2019t realised it yet. It might not just be startups that need to learn to pivot.", "publicationDate": "2015-10-04T09:00:13Z", "title": "Is the dotcom bubble about to burst (again)?", "sentences": ["Over three days I talk to founders of companies from San Francisco and Texas and Uruguay and Beirut and Stockholm and Tel Aviv and Warsaw."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/04/is-dotcom-bubble-about-to-burst-again"}, {"tags": ["Jos\u00e9 Mourinho", "Chelsea", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho continues to benefit from the \u201cfull support\u201d of Roman Abramovich and the Chelsea board after the Premier League champions reacted to their worst start to a campaign in 37 years by pledging to stand by their increasingly beleaguered manager. The London club released a brief statement on Monday afternoon confirming Mourinho, who signed a new four-year contract in the summer, will remain in charge for the foreseeable future, while also acknowledging the urgent need to instigate a revival. Saturday\u2019s defeat by Southampton, witnessed by Abramovich, left them 16th, four points off the relegation zone, having lost half of their eight league games. The manager had in effect challenged the hierarchy to sack him in his post-match conference, claiming this was a \u201ccrucial moment in the history of the club\u201d, as if testing Chelsea\u2019s desire for long-term stability. Informal discussions held at Stamford Bridge that night between the owner, the board and various department heads ended with the Portuguese\u2019s position not in any immediate doubt. However, the hierarchy did feel compelled to issue public backing having been alarmed by the manner of Mourinho\u2019s seven-minute monologue to camera post-match. \u201cThe club wants to make it clear that Jos\u00e9 continues to have our full support,\u201d read the statement. \u201cAs Jos\u00e9 has said himself, results have not been good enough and the team\u2019s performances must improve. However, we believe that we have the right manager to turn this season around and that he has the squad with which to do it.\u201d There is little prospect of significant strengthening in the January transfer window, with Chelsea\u2019s general policy of raising major funds through sales still in place. The cash received through Mohamed Salah\u2019s sale to Roma is likely to swell next summer\u2019s coffers rather than those in mid-season. Yet the manager, who has been charged by the Football Association after suggesting after the Southampton match that referees are \u201cafraid to give decisions to Chelsea\u201d, has acknowledged the time has come to shake up the playing staff with the introduction of younger talent. Ruben Loftus-Cheek will start against Aston Villa when the Premier League resumes after the international break, with Mourinho promising to grant the youngster \u201ca run of matches\u201d as he seeks to kickstart a revival. Loftus-Cheek, who has been selected for the England Under-21 fixture against Kazakhstan next Tuesday, impressed in his Champions League and Capital One Cup outings for Chelsea against Maccabi Tel Aviv and Walsall this season and the manager is confident the 19-year-old has the physical and mental attributes to thrive. \u201cI have to read the situation in difficult moments [and determine] what is the best thing,\u201d said Mourinho, who would most likely pair Loftus-Cheek with Ramires. \u201cShould I keep the experienced players in? Can they cope better with the pressure of the moment? Who can cope with the pressure best between Ruben, [Nemanja] Matic or [Cesc] F\u00e0bregas? \u201cBut maybe a young player feels less pressure now than when the team are not top of the league, fighting to be champions. So now it is time to play them: not five or six kids but Ruben is the one who is most ready. If everything goes normally in these next two weeks, yes he\u2019s a player to start the next game and have a run of matches to try to get that stability as a first-team choice. \u201cIt\u2019s not to save the season. Given the moment we\u2019re in and the profile of the young players \u2026 it\u2019s a good time to do this. My senior players won the title for me last season. But while I\u2019m not going to name the players, it\u2019s easy to see that some players are in difficulties. As a manager, you have that situation where you like them, trust them, keep them and, so, give them your trust, or you drop and change them, put some pressure [on them]. \u201cWhen John Terry is not playing people say immediately the team needs the captain, the stability, his personality. If I drop [Branislav] Ivanovic and play Ola Aina, people say: \u2018Ivanovic did so much for this club in the past, is such a big personality and has a stronger mentality.\u2019 If I didn\u2019t play F\u00e0bregas and played Ruben instead, they would say the same. But I was never afraid of responsibilities. The one who is most ready is Ruben.\u201d Mourinho, who had received public backing from Terry over the weekend, retains doubts over the \u00a317m left-back Baba Rahman\u2019s readiness to feature in the Premier League and has stressed his decision to substitute Matic, introduced at half-time on Saturday only to be replaced 28 minutes later, was not designed to humiliate the Serbia international.   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho seeks home comforts in bid to improve Chelsea fortunes    \u201cI don\u2019t do that to anyone, in football or in life,\u201d said the manager. \u201cIt was not the case. With the players, I live a situation that is not easy: I like them, I trust them, I know they are good players. But some of them are really in a difficult moment. Matic is one of them. \u201cHe\u2019s not playing well. He\u2019s not sharp defensively and is making mistakes with the ball, not the best decisions. I brought him on because Ramires had been doing a great job on [Sadio] Man\u00e9 but with a yellow card and an inexperienced referee, I was afraid of a second yellow card. I changed him for Matic and we conceded. \u201cWhen Southampton scored again I wanted to make a change, play a second striker, so needed a player from midfield and kept Oscar and F\u00e0bregas, who copes better with the pressure from his time at Barcelona. Even when he\u2019s not playing well, his emotional stability is high. So I took Matic off. But I like the player very much. I have a fantastic relationship with the boy. No humiliation.\u201d Mourinho\u2019s FA charge relates to comments he made in anger at the referee Robert Madley\u2019s refusal to award his side a penalty against Southampton when Maarten Stekelenburg darted off his line and made contact with Radamel Falcao in the box. The Colombian, who appeared to have been falling when contact was made, was booked for a dive. \u201cI think it is time to be honest and say clearly that referees are afraid to give decisions to Chelsea,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cAt 1-1 there is a huge penalty and, once more, we do not get it. It was at a crucial moment in the game. I repeat, if the FA wants to punish me they can punish me, it is not a problem. But I want to repeat because my players deserve it, Chelsea fans deserve it.\u201d The FA confirmed the charge on Monday , alleging Mourinho\u2019s remarks \u201cconstitute improper conduct in that they allege and/or imply bias on the part of a match official or match officials and/or bring the game into disrepute\u201d. The Chelsea manager has until 6pm on Thursday to respond. Although there are no set punishments for breaches of rules such as this while conducting media duties, he is likely to be fined if found guilty. That would be his fourth such sanction since returning to English football in 2013.", "publicationDate": "2015-10-05T21:47:21Z", "title": "Chelsea outline \u2018full support\u2019 for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in vote of confidence", "sentences": ["Loftus-Cheek, who has been selected for the England Under-21 fixture against Kazakhstan next Tuesday, impressed in his Champions League and Capital One Cup outings for Chelsea against Maccabi Tel Aviv and Walsall this season and the manager is confident the 19-year-old has the physical and mental attributes to thrive."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/05/chelsea-outline-full-support-jose-mourinho-bad-start-season-season"}, {"tags": ["History", "Education", "Educational books", "Teaching", "Schools", "Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Religion"], "article": "Last year, I took a group of my history students to Israel and the West Bank. It was a terrific success. We spent three days in Israel visiting the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, meeting a documentary maker and a senior civil servant in prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s office, before crossing to the West Bank, where we walked through the disputed areas of Hebron, visited Bethlehem and played football with the boys in a Nablus refugee camp.    Related: How conflict narratives reveal much about power | Letters    Shortly after our return home, a few of the students decided to attend an event at our local university as part of an \u201cIsraeli apartheid week\u201d. Here they ran into the parent of a Jewish student who was upset to find them there. She argued that it was wrong to call Israel an apartheid state and unfair to single it out for criticism. They told her that their previously positive view of Israel had been changed by seeing the occupation in action. It is not surprising that teachers tend to shy away from the subject of the history of conflict in Israel and Palestine. There is a fear of being accused of coming down on one side or the other, or being caught in the firing line of conflicting claims and opinions. For several years now, I\u2019ve been teaching this subject at a northern state school. It\u2019s a difficult thing to do because it arouses strong emotions among students and their parents. And the history of the conflict itself is fiercely contested. Put simply, the Jewish people tell it one way and the Arab people tell it another. And yet teaching this is essential. If this generation of students doesn\u2019t grasp how the conflict came about and why it is so difficult to resolve, how can we in the West ever hope to play any role in bringing about a workable solution? We also need to give Muslim students more confidence that history is a subject that involves them. At present, white British students are twice as likely to pick history at A-level as students of Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage. The trouble is that history text books which cover the conflict tend to take refuge in the middle ground between the two narrative extremes and have produced a watered-down account. This neither does justice to the truth nor captures the fervour, rigidity and exclusivity of each side\u2019s historical claims.    White British students are twice as likely to pick history at A-level as students of Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage    This summer, I went to Israel and Palestine on a Winston Churchill Memorial Trust fellowship to talk to Jewish and Palestinian academics and teachers about how they teach their respective histories. My aim was to try and find a better way of teaching about the conflict in the UK \u2013 to develop a curriculum that takes account of the competing narratives and enables students to look behind the propaganda. For Dr Hillel Cohen, of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the crucial year when these two conflicting narratives began was 1929, 12 years after the Balfour declaration promised the Jews they would have a homeland in Palestine. Until 1929, the established majority Arab community and the growing Jewish minority had lived in relative harmony. But for reasons that are hotly contested, violence erupted in several cities and in the process of mutual blame and recrimination, each side began to develop its own history \u2013 two separate narratives which, argues Cohen, have moved further apart over time. Thus, 1948 was for the Jews a glorious year in which they fought a national war for independence. For the Arabs, it was the year of the Nakba [disaster] that led to the loss of their homes and lands. Similarly, 1967 is noted in history for the Jews as the year they faced down the combined attacks of four Arab countries and liberated the rest of the Land of Israel. For the Arabs, 1967 marks the beginning of a hostile military occupation that has lasted for nearly half a century. Fast forward to 1995 and the Oslo accords. Modern Jewish history teaches that this led to the creation of an independent Palestinian government in the West Bank with full responsibility for health, education and policing. The way the Arabs see it couldn\u2019t be more different. They say that the same accords have led to a form of apartheid, that they have been left with only limited control within just 18% of the West Bank while there has been unlimited Jewish settlement in the other 82%. Six weeks into my trip, after hours of interviews and discussions, it was clear that I could pick any date, any event, any archeological artefact and it would produce a different interpretation, depending on who I was talking to.     A Palestinian boy and Jewish settlers face each other at a disputed home in east Jerusalem. Teaching about the competing narratives in the region is fraught with difficulty. Photograph: Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty    And then I made an exciting discovery \u2013 I found a book. It was a single history book, published in 2012 by a group of Israeli and Palestinian academics and teachers who had set out, with a grant from the US state department and under the auspices of Prime (Peace Research in the Middle East) to write a combined history of the Jews and Arabs in the hope of, once and for all, reconciling these two competing stories. What happened to the book is as interesting and significant as the impulse behind it. The authors soon realised it couldn\u2019t be done in the way they\u2019d hoped. As Prof Eyal Naveh of Tel Aviv University, one of the Israeli project leaders, says: \u201cThis might be possible in a post-conflict situation, but it was not possible in an \u2018in conflict\u2019 situation.\u201d So, the authors decided to try the next best thing: to write their own separate narratives and place them side by side, in Hebrew and in Arabic, on the opposite pages of a single book.   Related: Schools should teach Middle East politics to counter extremism    It didn\u2019t work out. In Israel, says Naveh, they began pilots using it in extra-curricular classes, but within three weeks parents had complained and the book was withdrawn. In Palestine, 1,000 copies are still sitting in an apartment, deemed too inflammatory to distribute and despite numerous requests, I have been unable to get any comment from Prof Sami Adwan, the Palestinian co-author, on this issue. It is in so many ways a depressing story, that such a brave collaborative project should come to nothing. But my hope is that some good can come of it. By using the same side-by-side approach, my aim is to develop a new curriculum in the UK for teaching this seemingly intractable conflict. By giving students extracts from the book in its English translation, supplemented by access to a wide range of web-based source evidence, news reels, oral histories, music, even recipes, we can challenge them to immerse themselves in the two cultures and two stories and look behind the propaganda to work out the most truthful narrative. As Cohen says: \u201cThere are really two kinds of people: those who understand that history is constructed, and those who don\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s an approach, furthermore, that would offer Muslim students a sense that their voice is being listened to, that their stories are being heard and studied. It\u2019s an approach which, I hope, could mean they will no longer be underrepresented in history A-level classes. Free and open discussion is the best way to build community cohesion. I have found school trips to places such as Belfast and Jerusalem to talk face-to-face with opposing parties are a powerful teaching tool, but not many school governing bodies are as adventurous as mine. So, my plan is to create an immersive web-based experience for students. I want to build in a control so that if, for example, you listen to an oral testimony from a Nakba refugee, you won\u2019t be able to continue until you\u2019ve also listened to a Holocaust refugee. This is early days. I\u2019m in the process of looking for a sponsor for this effort. I really hope it works. Our voters and future leaders need to understand there are always competing narratives, and be able to pick apart the propaganda and the facts. \u2022 Michael Davies is a teacher at Lancaster Royal grammar school.

Related: Carlo Ancelotti: I want to manage a club in the Premier League again    Ivanovic, who has endured a miserable campaign to date, damaged a hamstring in the 2-0 win in Albania last week and returned to Cobham over the weekend for scans and treatment. Those tests have suggested an absence of around three weeks at best, ruling him out of the visit of Villa when Chelsea will seek to revive their title defence after their worst start to a domestic campaign in 37 years. The absence of the 31-year-old, who has featured consistently this season despite poor form and Chelsea having conceded 17 goals in eight games, would normally present an obvious route into the team for Baba Rahman, the Ghanaian left-back purchased for around \u00a317m from Augsburg over the summer, with C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta reverting to full-back duties on the opposite flank. However, Mourinho has been unconvinced by Rahman\u2019s adaptation to life in England and has limited his involvement to a Champions League appearance against Maccabi Tel Aviv and a Capital One Cup victory at Walsall. \u201cBaba Rahman arrived on the last day [of the transfer window] and he doesn\u2019t know what it is to play in this kind of championship,\u201d said Mourinho when asked about the Ghana international after the 3-1 home loss to Southampton immediately before the international break. \u201cHe had no pre-season with us. He needs time to learn and adapt. \u201cAt the same time, every team except Maccabi Tel Aviv is a team of giants.

But Villa\u2019s threat at Stamford Bridge is likely to revolve around Rudy Gestede, whose ability in the air is his forte, suggesting Mourinho may seek a solution elsewhere. Zouma, who has played in central defence this season and featured in midfield last term, can operate at full-back and may now deputise, with Gary Cahill \u2013 rested for England\u2019s trip to Lithuania given recent back problems \u2013 and John Terry retained in the centre. The France international could potentially fill in on either flank, with Azpilicueta retaining his place, having played at left-back on the club\u2019s pre-season tour of the US this summer. Mourinho watched the Spaniard play for his country in Kiev on Monday night. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, the England Under-21 international midfielder, will start against Villa as Mourinho seeks to freshen up his side after seeing them lose half of their eight Premier League fixtures, dreadful form which prompted a public vote of confidence in his management from Roman Abramovich and his board.

It was, after all, a goalless scrap in a far-flung capital across the continent, a match marred by spats among home supporters in the stands as a reflection of the political tension currently gripping Ukraine, and a point which left the Premier League champions third in their section. Yet Jos\u00e9 Mourinho departed this arena talking of solidity and progress. He may yet pinpoint this as the moment his team\u2019s faith and conviction were reaffirmed. Something clicked in Kiev. This was more like the effective Chelsea from the latter stages of last season, when attacking threat was allied to the required work-rate and defensive nous. The likes of Eden Hazard and Nemanja Matic, so off-colour up to now, reacted to their manager\u2019s recent criticisms and were recognisable against Dynamo as the talents of last term, with each conjuring their most convincing displays of the campaign to date.

Related: Porto top Champions League Group G after victory over Maccabi Tel Aviv    The team\u2019s destiny in Group G remains in their own hands, and there will be confidence the remaining home fixtures can be won, together with the trip to the section\u2019s whipping boys Maccabi Tel Aviv, to smooth passage into the knockout phase. The sense of satisfaction obtained here, though, should maintain the optimism generated from Saturday\u2019s welcome win over Aston Villa. \u201cThe team were really solid and compact, the midfield really strong,\u201d said Mourinho. \u201cWe are recovering some of that compactness, solidarity, effort, tactical discipline, qualities which are very important when you are not flying or playing with that confidence or flair, when your attacking players are not killing [opponents]. So in three days, two solid performances are good for us.\u201d There was, inevitably, one gripe that needed to be aired. The game had edged just beyond the quarter-hour mark when Cesc F\u00e0bregas wriggled into the penalty area and was clipped by Serhiy Rybalka, only for the Slovenian official, Damir Skomina, to wave away the appeals for a spot-kick. \u201cThe referee was weak and naive,\u201d offered Mourinho, echoing Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s unpunished criticisms of Mike Dean\u2019s display when Chelsea beat Arsenal in September. \u201cA big penalty. I keep not understanding what the referee standing behind the goal does because [he] doesn\u2019t make a clear decision. \u201cI think the referee was very good \u2013 I\u2019m serious \u2013 but he made one mistake. And, for example, in the Rugby World Cup, I think the referee [Craig Joubert] in the Scotland game was very good but made one mistake. And that mistake cost Scotland their chance.

Regardless, the phrase \u201cweak and naive\u201d may be muttered with some regularity over the course of the campaign to come. Rybalka\u2019s trip should have presented Chelsea with their clearest sight of goal, but they still created enough opportunities to have inflicted Dynamo\u2019s first home defeat to English opposition since 2007. It was profligacy which cost them a victory. Hazard, nominated for the Ballon d\u2019Or earlier in the day, broke away from his industrious defensive running to curl a shot on to the base of the far post early on while Willian struck the crossbar with a free-kick just after the interval. The link-up play between the wingers, F\u00e0bregas in midfield and Diego Costa was exquisite at times, even if it was Matic who created and missed the best chance of all. Intercepting the ball in central midfield, the Serb rampaged through and beyond four flustered Dynamo players and into the area. He seemed as startled at his progress as anybody, which might have explained the awkward finish poked wide of the far post as Oleksandr Shovkovskiy dived almost in despair. The frustration was that Dynamo were there for the taking. Thrashed at home by Shakhtar Donetsk last Friday, they were as timid and fragile as Chelsea have been at times this term, their only real attacking threat carried by the much coveted Andriy Yarmolenko on the flank. Only in the last 10 minutes, with Chelsea wondering whether to stick or twist, did they threaten to pilfer reward, again with Yarmolenko to the fore. Yet the visitors held firm. This is another step towards recovery, a display and result from which to draw encouragement.

He was not supposed to be eating such foods \u2013 doctor\u2019s orders. As they were finishing up, Bibi\u2019s wife, Sarah, came in, saw the evidence and began to see red. Netanyahu, all righteous indignation, looked her straight in the eye and said he had eaten no such hamburger. The storyteller said he was convinced at that moment that Netanyahu himself believed it. If apocryphal, it is definitely in character. Netanyahu regularly embraces bad ideas or even lies so totally that he convinces himself of their rightness. Others start to believe them too. His outlandish idea, uttered in a speech, was that Hitler would have been happy with just expelling Jews if a Palestinian, the then grand mufti of Jerusalem, had not suggested annihilation instead. And they all have a purpose. In each phase of his career, Netanyahu has had a trope that he pushes so aggressively it can drive a citizen crazy. But they are fabulously popular with the public and they keep the headlines on him alone, while making him king of the issue. Taking office for the second time in 2009, he began saying \u201cdelegitimisation\u201d against every conceivable form of criticism. Israelis can hardly mouth the awkward English word, but it was a powerful and intuitive statement: we\u2019re not doing anything wrong, they just hate us. It\u2019s us against the world. He won a third term. In the third term, Netanyahu turned up the volume on his decades-old obsession with Iran to a fever pitch. Each of these Bibi tunes responded to a particular political need. Delegitimisation was his answer and very soon all of Israel\u2019s answer to a torrent of global anger following the first of three wars Israel fought in Gaza \u2013 Operation Cast Lead \u2013 and the Mavi Marmara incident in which Israel attacked a flotilla that had tried to break the Gaza siege, killing nine Turkish citizens. Iran, meanwhile, was the issue that Netanyahu used to sideline any discussion of the Palestinians and the occupation. It is no coincidence that these tropes are rooted in existential threat. Bibi knows it resonates with the (Jewish) Israeli public. But now he has really done it, say the critics. He has defiled the Holocaust, which is sacrosanct for the Jewish people, with absurd historical inaccuracies. Even his supporters will wither in the face of this blatant distortion of history, right? Probably not. Netanyahu knows what he is saying and the Jewish Israeli public knows. This isn\u2019t about Hitler or Haj Amin. It\u2019s about incitement \u2013 the fourth-term Bibi tune. In this tune, Palestinian incitement, which indeed exists, is the sole reason for the recent escalation in violence. That and nothing else. Not the relative deprivation thrown in the face of East Jerusalemites daily. Not the relative justice \u2013 Palestinian knifemen killed on the spot while Jewish terrorists who burned the Dawabshe family while they slept are not charged. Not the nearly five-decade occupation. Only incitement. There are three ways the \u201cPalestinian incitement\u201d accusation works for Netanyahu. First, as mentioned, it explains the recent violence to the satisfaction of the bulk of the Israeli public and justifies Israel\u2019s response: everything is self-defence. Second, it contains the existential threat that is the core of all of his themes. Palestinian incitement is now linked to the greatest physical destruction Jews ever faced. Jews in Israel and everywhere must always fear existential destruction; it justifies Israel\u2019s policies and it helps get Bibi elected. Third, and most disturbing: somewhere in the late-2000s, it became acceptable to be openly racist in political discourse. In 2009, Avigdor Lieberman ran a campaign targeting Israel\u2019s Arab population. One of the sarcastic slogans was: \u201cOnly Lieberman speaks Arabic!\u201d Latent racism in Israel became fair game for political sloganeering. Likud was quick to compete, its representatives sponsoring and co-sponsoring legislation in Israel\u2019s parliament targeting Arabs, such as the loyalty oath bill. Likud then voted in a new list in 2012 full of extremists who latched on to the xenophobia theme. Into the fray jumped Naftali Bennett. His Jewish Home party eats away at Netanyahu\u2019s Likud from the right, partly by escalating rhetoric against Arabs. One of his party members, Orit Strock, told Arab parliamentarians they (Arabs in general) were \u201csavages\u201d. The words had hardly left his mouth before Israeli historians trounced them; a Holocaust survivor wrote against his comments and the chancellor of Germany insisted on Germany\u2019s guilt for the mass murder and a US State Department spokesperson hinted that it was \u201cinflammatory rhetoric\u201d. Maybe this time, Netanyahu has been truly chastened. He quickly provided a clarification that was billed as a partial rowing back of the statement. Based on the recent past, however, he probably will get away with it. On the international level, Netanyahu recently took America-Israel relations to a new low and he is still standing. He threatened Jewish Israelis that his own citizens, Arabs, were coming to vote \u201cin droves\u201d on election day, causing outrage abroad \u2013 yet here he is. At home, on the day after the H-(Hitler/Husseini) bomb, the top-read Israeli news portal Ynet didn\u2019t run any opinion piece about the issue. The main rightwing news website Arutz 7 had a story about Israel\u2019s deputy foreign minister telling Fox News about Palestinian incitement. And another popular mainstream website, Nrg (Maariv), posted two op-eds supporting the point about Husseini and Palestinians encouraging genocide. Why not? Netanyahu\u2019s own putative rollback said just that: \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to absolve Hitler of responsibility, but to show that the father of the Palestinian nation wanted to destroy Jews even without occupation.\u201d Netanyahu knew what he was saying and who he was talking to. He knows how to weather the gasps while winking at a large segment of the Jewish Israeli public that needs to hear his trope. Only Netanyahu, it seems, speaks Israeli.

Rabin was honoured on Monday in ceremonies at the Mount Herzl cemetery in Jerusalem and in the Knesset, after President Reuben Rivlin solemnly pledged that his unrepentant killer, Yigal Amir, would never be released from prison. Many other events are taking place across Israel in the coming days. In September 1993, Rabin signed the Oslo agreement with the PLO leader, Yasser Arafat, with President Bill Clinton watching their famously hesitant handshake on the White House lawn. It was a landmark in the century-long war over the Holy Land \u2013 though a controversial one that generated furious opposition on both sides.  But his murder at a peace rally in Tel Aviv on 4 November 1995 (the anniversary is marked according to the Hebrew calendar) was widely seen as a hammer blow to hopes that the interim deal, involving a partial Israeli withdrawal and the creation of a Palestinian Authority, could indeed lead the way to a just and lasting peace.      Yitzhak Rabin\u2019s daughter Dalia speaks at a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of his murder. Photograph: Debbie Hill/AFP/Getty Images     \u201cSadly, I have no news,\u201d Rabin\u2019s daughter, Dalia, said poignantly at her father\u2019s graveside on Monday, in one of the memorial speeches broadcast live on TV. \u201cThere is no peace process. We are facing terrorism. Blood is being shed again. I have no other country and my country has changed.\u201d   Related: David Grossman: The night our hope for peace died     Rabin is remembered as a soldier, having expelled Palestinians en masse during the 1948 war and as chief of staff during the 1967 victory, when Israel occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. But the general-turned-peacemaker was also the first Israeli political leader to be murdered \u2013 and, shockingly, by another Jew; not, as had always seemed more likely, by an Arab.   The 20th anniversary of his death has seen a torrent of comment against an unusually turbulent background: high tension over the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif site in East Jerusalem and the deaths of 50 Palestinians and 10 Israelis in the last month. Whether or not this constitutes a new intifada (uprising) or not, it has come as a vicious reminder of the intractable nature of the conflict and the persistence of the occupation \u2013 not to mention the hatred and desperation that can erupt when hopes for finding a solution die.   Related: We have been given a frightful glimpse into Netanyahu\u2019s mind | David Grossman     Binyamin Netanyahu, the Likud prime minister, made an immediate connection with the current violence. \u201cI didn\u2019t agree on everything with Yitzhak Rabin,\u201d he told the Mount Herzl gathering. \u201cRabin wanted to end the conflict and he worked for peace, but he too was forced to deal with a cruel wave of terror. No knife, no stone, no petrol bomb or mine will stop us. We will never surrender to terrorism.\u201d In the mid-1990s, Netanyahu, then in opposition and a fierce opponent of the Oslo accord, was blamed for contributing to an atmosphere of incitement. Rightwing activists portrayed Rabin in SS uniform, while extremist, pro-settlement rabbis ruled that by talking to the PLO and ceding territory to Arafat, Rabin was a traitor \u2013 views that Amir used to justify his crime.  Much of the current discourse around Rabin\u2019s death is about the danger of extremism in Israeli society. \u201cThe shots that killed him targeted the very essence of the sovereign Jewish state,\u201d the thinker Prof Yedidia Stern commented in Haaretz this week. \u201cThe blood on the pavement was the blood of democracy itself.\u201d Schools are holding classes on the meaning of political murder and the importance of tolerance. Yet critics question the way Rabin is seen. \u201cThe main political forces in Israel today are the extreme settlers, and Rabin\u2019s memory has nothing to do with them,\u201d argued Tom Segev, one of Israel\u2019s leading historians. \u201cRabin has become the poster boy for what Zionism and Israel have lost. He was the opposite of the fanatics. He was secular, pragmatic and sane. He was the last of the beautiful Israelis.\u201d   Related: Rabin, the Last Day review \u2013 form and structure hamper Israeli PM murder story    Many clearly hanker after a more decisive prime minister than Netanyahu, whatever their views. \u201cIsrael needs a leader with Rabin\u2019s DNA, who will act with faith and determination to reach an agreement,\u201d said Uzi Baram, a former Labour minister. Palestinians are sceptical. In 1987, when the first intifada erupted, Rabin was the defence minister who threatened to \u201cbreak the bones\u201d of the young stone-throwers confronting the occupation. \u201cRabin never wanted a Palestinian state,\u201d insisted Mahdi Abdel-Hadi of the Passia thinktank. \u201cHe played politics and worked with an isolated, corrupt Arafat. He wanted to contain the PLO, to tame the shrew. Oslo was an illusion. Israelis who believe it would have led to a real peace are indulging in wishful thinking.\u201d But if the memory contains elements of myth, it remains a powerful one. On Monday evening, Israel\u2019s Channel 2 TV broadcast an interview about Rabin with Clinton, who describes his devastation when the stunning news reached the Oval office. \u201cMy first thoughts were not even for the peace process,\u201d the former US president said. \u201cThey were just for my friend. Then immediately I thought, \u2018This could kill all his dreams.\u2019\u201d Twenty years after Rabin\u2019s death, Israelis and Palestinians agree on little. But many on both sides are certain that Oslo is dead, or in its dying days \u2013 with doubts growing that its institutional legacy, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank under Arafat\u2019s successor, Mahmoud Abbas, can survive much longer. \u201cRabin probably stood a better chance of forging a durable reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians than any other leader before or since,\u201d writes Dan Ephron in Killing a King, a riveting new book about the prime minister and his murderer. \u201cThat we\u2019ll never know how close he would have come is one of the exasperating consequences of the assassination.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-10-26T17:50:04Z", "title": "Anniversary of Yitzhak Rabin's murder stirs what-ifs amid violence", "sentences": ["But his murder at a peace rally in Tel Aviv on 4 November 1995 (the anniversary is marked according to the Hebrew calendar) was widely seen as a hammer blow to hopes that the interim deal, involving a partial Israeli withdrawal and the creation of a Palestinian Authority, could indeed lead the way to a just and lasting peace."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/anniversary-yitzhak-rabins-assassination-what-ifs-violence-israelis-palestinians"}, {"tags": ["Small Business Showcase"], "article": "Giuseppe Pennestri, marketing manager of Diego Comics Publishing, explains why the business should win the marketing and PR category of the Guardian Small Business Showcase competition.

According to Keret\u2019s translator, the Afghan writer and journalist Aziz Hakimi, it is \u201calmost unprecedented\u201d for books by Israeli writers to be translated into Farsi. Iranian government restrictions mean Keret\u2019s title cannot be published in Iran. But the Farsi edition, Aan Haft Saal-e Khoob, will be published in London via the H&amp;S Media imprint Nebesht, and available in print in Afghanistan for the Iranian market on 1 November. It will also be sold in digital format, and there are plans in place to publish the book in Kabul. \u201cThe Persian book market is very limited and the fact that Etgar\u2019s books are not allowed to get published in Iran makes it even more difficult to reach customers in a traditional way through bookshops,\u201d said Hakimi, who estimates that around 4,000 copies of the book will sell online, in print and digital format, with another 1,000 sold through the Kabul publisher. \u201cAny Iranian writers whose works don\u2019t get the approval from the government prefer to publish them in Afghanistan. Such books are then smuggled into Iran and distributed through clandestine networks,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course Iranian authorities have in many cases warned against selling unapproved books and in quite a few cases they have arrested people or plumped bookshops for selling such books. [But] I\u2019m sure that Etgar\u2019s book will find its way into Iranians\u2019 homes.\u201d A collection of personal essays ranging from the birth of Keret\u2019s son during a terrorist attack to the death of his father, The Seven Good Years was described as the work of a \u201cmaster: bracing, compassionate, so absolutely himself\u201d by Rachel Cooke in the Observer.  Hakimi hopes, like Keret, that the author\u2019s stories of daily life in Israel will change perspectives in Iran, even in a small way. \u201cI can relate to Etgar\u2019s stories at a personal level and that\u2019s because they allow me to see for myself how it feels to be an Israeli or a Jew. I\u2019ve grown up in Iran where there is a lot of propaganda against the Israeli state and a general ban of any sort of literature which challenges the official views on this matter,\u201d he said.  \u201cAt a time when Iran\u2019s leader promises Israel will cease to exist in 25 years, [these] wise, witty stories about family and life in Israel are a vital life line between the two countries. I am confident that [these] stories can change the views of Iranians (and Afghans) about people of Israel.\u201d Hakimi is now planning to translate other works by Keret, along with other Israel authors. \u201cI will do this, because I know it will help us get closer,\u201d he said. \u201cAs one born into a Muslim family and grown up in Iran, I believe that the main problem we have in the Middle East is that we all are so absorbed by propagandas and conspiracy theories that we can\u2019t imagine we could be wrong. Politics and politicians have proved to be part of this problem and perhaps it is time for us, the ordinary citizens, to sit and talk to each other.\u201d Keret, speaking from Tel Aviv, said there was \u201csomething beautiful\u201d about the fact that \u201cI can\u2019t go [to Tehran], but my stories can\u201d. \u201cI really feel there is something very reductive about these kinds of narratives where we seem to see people as some kind of monolithic enemy,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this kind of exchange, for me, says if you can humanise each other, see each other as human beings, all the problems can become solvable.\u201d Keret\u2019s bestselling books have been translated into 38 languages, although The Seven Good Years is not being released in Hebrew, or in Israel, a fact the author attributes to the personal nature of the essays, and their focus on his son. But he called its Farsi translation \u201cthe most moving one\u201d. \u201cWhen you write, you want others to share your human experience. This is a pretty modest ambition when you write for family or friends and it becomes a greater one when strangers read your work, but to be translated to a language of those who are, supposedly, your greatest enemies is as good and as far as those bridges of empathy could go,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope my book will help some of its Iranian readers to see the Israeli people as flawed human entities and not just as mortal enemies.\u201d Keret acknowledged, however, that he doesn\u2019t \u201coverestimate the strength of literature\u201d. \u201cI have lived in this region long enough to know there is not a book written which could stop a bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut literature is like a whisper.

At least 15 men pressed up against him, clutching his arms and patting him down but Amir heard the voice of just one policeman asking questions in rapid succession: Were the bullets real? Was the prime minister the intended target? Amir had regarded his lunge at Rabin as an act of suicide, yet somehow he was alive. He responded loudly enough to be heard over the chaos: Yes, he intended to shoot Rabin and yes, the bullets were real. Inspector Yuval Gershon pushed him into a police car, a late-model Subaru, and got in behind him. Already on the ride to the station, Amir delivered a full confession. He was a law student at Bar-Ilan University, he owned the Beretta that police had picked up in the parking lot, he had gone to the square intending to shoot the prime minister, and he was reasonably sure his bullets had struck Rabin. For the policemen in the car \u2013 Gershon and three others \u2013 the incident itself had been a bewildering experience. Amir\u2019s swagger, his nonchalance, added another layer of astonishment. One of the men asked Amir if he\u2019d been aware that his actions could cause Rabin\u2019s death, information that in court would help establish intent. Amir, who had completed two full years of law school, including at least two courses in criminal law, understood the question. Not only was I aware, he said. That was my objective. The bluster continued pouring out at the precinct, along with a giddiness that made Amir seem weirdly detached from the enormity of his crime. Before he was even booked, he asked first sergeant Yohanan Ronen to reach into the pocket of his jeans, pull out his skullcap, and put it on his head. The policeman obliged. While pressing his fingers to an inkpad, Amir noticed that his wrist was bare. \u201cMy watch fell off in the parking lot,\u201d he remarked to the lab technician. \u201cCan you check if someone found it?\u201d To the technician, it must have seemed like the suspect had mistaken him for a summer-camp counsellor. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know,\u201d he said. Throughout the booking, Amir kept replaying the shooting in his mind. Though it remained unclear to him whether Rabin had survived, Amir was now certain that God had wanted him to act, that he\u2019d managed to fathom God\u2019s will, in the words of that settler rabbi. The proof was in the outcome. Only divine intervention could account for the fact that he eluded police for 40 minutes, outmanoeuvred Rabin\u2019s vaunted protection force, and fired at the prime minister without getting shot himself.     Yigal Amir, second from left, is led into a Tel Aviv courtroom. Photograph: Nati Harnik/AP    In one of the waiting rooms, he told a policeman his act would cause people to rise up. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m crazy. Otherwise, I won\u2019t achieve my goal.\u201d To Ronen, he explained that the Talmudic doctrine din rodef amounted to a death sentence for Rabin \u2013 an explication that only people familiar with the internal discourse in the Orthodox community over the preceding year would have understood. When the policeman pointed out that even the most hardline political parties would condemn the assassination attempt, Amir seemed untroubled. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it in order to go down in history,\u201d he said. Then he added: \u201cBut you guys will be famous.\u201d In the interrogation room, Amir faced Motti Naftali, the chief superintendent who had helped draft the security plan for the rally. Word had reached the precinct by now that Rabin had died on the operating table. With a pipe wedged in the corner of his mouth, Naftali told Amir he would be charged with the murder of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. Amir\u2019s response nearly unhinged the police officer. Amir threw up his cuffed hands and declared, \u201cI did it.\u201d Then he asked Naftali if he could bring a drink \u2013 a \u201cschnapps\u201d, he said \u2013 to toast the news. While the interrogation continued, several policemen and investigators of the security agency Shabak made their way to Borochov 56 in Herzliya, to search the house and pick up Hagai. Forensic technicians had already discovered the modified bullets at the bottom of Amir\u2019s magazine. When Naftali asked about them, Amir said they were the handiwork of his brother, Hagai, and bragged about his technical skills. Now Hagai was a suspect as well. In Herzliya, Hagai waited for a knock on the door. He\u2019d been watching a television movie earlier in the evening when a newscaster interrupted the programme to report that shots were fired in Rabin\u2019s vicinity at Kings of Israel Square. Though the initial details were scant, Hagai knew immediately that it was his brother. He turned to his father and told him to brace himself \u2013 Amir had tried to kill Rabin at the peace rally. Shlomo erupted: What did you and your brother do? How could you do this to me?     More than 100,000 Israelis crowd Tel Aviv\u2019s municipal square in a show of support for the government\u2019s peace-making policies. Photograph: AP    An hour passed and somehow the police had still failed to show up. Hagai considered dismantling some of his homemade armaments, including the grenades and the timers. The parts alone would be less incriminating. But he worried that investigators would walk in as soon as he got to work. Instead, he grabbed what he could from the bedroom and the shed and stashed it in a small chicken coop he\u2019d built over the summer in the backyard \u2013 on the left side, near the incubator. The deadlier munitions, the TNT sticks and C-4 explosives, remained hidden in the attic and inside one of the walls. Back in the house, he spotted a relative who lived in the neighbourhood and had come over to console the family. Hagai still had a few things left to hide, a supermarket bag with fuses, explosives, and the handcrafted silencer. He pulled the relative, Uriel Ben-Yaakov, to the back patio and asked if he\u2019d be willing to stash the munitions in his home. In the dimly lit yard, Hagai opened the bag and showed him the contents. When Ben-Yaakov refused, Hagai pointed to the hiding place in the coop and asked him to remove the materials after he was arrested. The policemen and Shabak agents, delayed apparently by the chaos, finally pulled up around midnight. On the street, journalists were knocking on doors to interview people about their neighbour, the assassin. Inside, the friends still lingered; Shlomo sat alone in a bedroom reading Lamentations. The officers took Hagai to a bathroom, told him to undress, and searched him. Then they combed the shed and the bedroom he shared with Amir, confiscating whatever items seemed relevant. In several boxes, they carted off the ammunition Hagai left lying around and tools from his shed but also a phone book, four photo albums, a camera with film in it, and a worn copy of The Day of the Jackal. Near Amir\u2019s bed, they found a book titled Baruch the Man, a paean to Baruch Goldstein who had massacred 29 Palestinians as they worshipped in a mosque in Hebron. Amir had not only devoured the 533-page book, he\u2019d recommended it to friends. The officers walked Hagai out and cuffed him in the car. Borochov, the sleepy suburban street, swarmed with people. At one in the morning, the day was not over yet. In Tel Aviv, Shimon Peres had gathered Rabin\u2019s cabinet ministers to formalise the transition of power. Alongside his responsibilities as foreign minister, Peres held the title of deputy prime minister, which meant he would be leading the government through the transition period. Dressed in the same suit and tie he\u2019d worn on stage a few hours earlier, his face pale and heavy, Peres looked wretched. He struggled to deliver a brief eulogy for Rabin and kept his gaze down through much of the meeting. Peres had preceded Rabin in the parking lot by a few minutes. In updates he received from the interrogation room, he learned that Amir had considered shooting at him but decided to wait for the prime minister. Had the two men come down together, Amir told Naftali, he would have killed them both. The trifecta \u2013 losing Rabin, having the country\u2019s leadership thrust suddenly upon him, and realising he\u2019d barely escaped death himself \u2013 had induced in Peres a kind of post-traumatic stress.

His body remained in a room at Ichilov hospital, waiting for the autopsy. Doctors had left the clothes he\u2019d been wearing in a neat pile, a pack of Parliaments still stuffed in his jacket pocket. At two in the morning, the government\u2019s chief pathologist, Yehuda Hiss, walked in with an assistant and began to probe what precisely killed Rabin. Speaking into a tape recorder, Hiss described what he saw: \u201cThe body of a man who looks to be about 70, nutritional condition looks normal, measuring 172 centimetres from his left heel to the top of his head, naked and covered in sheets.\u201d He noted the obvious and the obscure: the long lines of stitches crisscrossing Rabin\u2019s chest and abdomen where surgeons had cut him open and the yellow stains between his index and middle fingers from a lifelong smoking habit. In back, Hiss traced the pathway of the bullets into Rabin\u2019s body. One hollow point entered his lower back, ruptured his spleen, then travelled up and to the right, where it punctured his left lung. The other pierced his back below the clavicle, smashed through the rib cage, and entered the right lung. The massive bleeding alone and the collapse of his lungs had made Rabin\u2019s chances of surviving the shooting extremely low, Hiss concluded. But it wasn\u2019t until doctors wheeled the body to a lab room for a brain scan that the full picture came into view. In the computerised image, they noticed an embolism in one of Rabin\u2019s cerebral arteries, a large pocket of air that entered his bloodstream in the lungs and made its way to his brain, restricting the flow of blood and oxygen. The blockage, it was now clear, had hindered the resuscitation effort and, with every passing moment, eroded the prime minister\u2019s mental capacity. In effect, Rabin\u2019s brain died well before his body did.", "publicationDate": "2015-10-31T23:14:00Z", "title": "\u2018I did it!

The two attacks \u2013 which occurred within hours of each other on Monday in Rishon LeZion near Tel Aviv and later in the coastal city Netanya \u2013 further reduced the prospect that weeks of violence between Israelis and Palestinians is coming to an end. In the first incident a 19-year old Palestinian from the West Bank city of Hebron, which has featured heavily in recent incidents, attacked and wounded several people, including an 80-year-old woman, in a stabbing spree in central Israel before being arrested. That in turn came several hours after Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian who they said tried to stab a soldier at a northern West Bank checkpoint.   Related: Israel places heavy security in East Jerusalem before Muslim prayers    According to Israeli police and media, the incident in Rishon LeZion began when a Palestinian stabbed an elderly woman on a bus and then ran into the street and stabbed another woman before continuing to run down the street and carrying out another attack.  A police spokeswoman, Luba Samri, said that after stabbing the first two people, the attacker had tried to enter a clothing shop but a woman in the store slammed a door on him.  The Palestinian then went into another shop and stabbed a woman. Bystanders apprehended him and then police detained him. Yitzhak Scharf, of Assaf HaRofeh Medical Center, said that the elderly woman was stabbed in the back and waist, sustaining damage to blood vessels and fracturing her hip. A 40-year-old man was stabbed multiple times in the chest. Another person was lightly wounded, he said. In the second incident, a 71-year-old man was stabbed and seriously injured in Netanya in the early evening, reportedly by a 23-year old Palestinian from the West Bank city of Tulkarem who was shot and arrested. The unrelenting spate of attacks, including within the so-called green line in Israel, which demarcates the pre-1967 borders from the occupied territories, have underlined both the persistence of the current violence and Israel\u2019s inability to bring it under control. Many of the initial attacks were centred on Jerusalem but as Israeli security forces swamped that city, the focus moved to Hebron in the southern West Bank and to other Israeli cities.    Related: The Guardian view on the war of knives in Israel and the West Bank | Editorial    A series of Palestinian attacks linked to tensions over the highly sensitive holy site in Jerusalem, known as Temple Mount to Jews and al-Haram al-Sharif to Muslims, began in mid-September. In addition to the near-daily attacks, violent demonstrations have erupted in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, with Palestinian stone-throwers clashing with Israeli troops. Eleven Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks, mostly stabbings. Sixty-nine Palestinians have died by Israeli fire, including 43 who Israel says were involved in attacks or attempted attacks. Rights groups say some of the killings were unjustified because the Palestinians did not pose a threat to soldiers\u2019 lives. Israeli media reported that a military investigation found that the shooting death of an 18-year-old Palestinian woman by Israeli forces last month could have been avoided. The woman was shot as she brandished a knife at a military checkpoint in the West Bank city of Hebron, according to the army\u2019s account. The military said the woman refused to heed repeated warnings to stop and that shots were then fired when troops felt threatened. On Monday, Palestinian security forces held a military salute at a funeral ceremony in the West Bank city of Ramallah for two Palestinians killed by Israeli fire. One had tried to grab a soldier\u2019s rifle in Jerusalem, and the other had tried to stab a soldier at a West Bank checkpoint, according to the Israeli military. The Palestinian Authority has been holding official funeral parades in recent weeks to prevent militant groups such as Hamas from using such ceremonies to whip up popular support, a senior Palestinian security official said on condition of anonymity.", "publicationDate": "2015-11-02T17:58:05Z", "title": "Eighty-year-old woman among four Israelis knifed in twin attacks", "sentences": ["The two attacks \u2013 which occurred within hours of each other on Monday in Rishon LeZion near Tel Aviv and later in the coastal city Netanya \u2013 further reduced the prospect that weeks of violence between Israelis and Palestinians is coming to an end."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/02/eighty-year-old-woman-among-four-israelis-knifed-two-attacks"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "It is only a half an hour from Kafr Qassem to the bustling heart of Tel Aviv, but the Arab town feels a world away from Israel\u2019s largest and most sophisticated city. The shops, restaurants and garages that line its badly maintained roads display signs in Hebrew as well as Arabic. But most Jews are staying away in these troubled times of stabbings across the country \u2013 symptoms of a conflict seemingly without end. Last week, Kafr Qassem marked an infamous event in its otherwise unremarkable history \u2013 the killing of 49 residents by Israeli police on the eve of the 1956 Suez war \u2013 when Israel colluded with Britain and France to attack Egypt. They were gunned down because they were unaware of a curfew that had been imposed on Arab communities on the then frontier with Jordan; their names are now inscribed on a column in the town centre. Hundreds gathered to listen to anniversary speeches by Israeli Arab leaders, including prominent Islamists, who called for both formal recognition of the massacre and the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. All made a clear link between then and now, past and present fused into a single narrative of oppression and discrimination on both sides of the pre-1967 \u201cgreen line\u201d border. \u201cGlory and eternity to our innocent martyrs,\u201d proclaimed the banners and T-shirts worn by excited children placing floral wreaths around the column. \u201cThe policies of the Israeli government continue, though they have changed their face,\u201d said Abdullah Sarsour, who lost five close relatives in 1956. \u201cYes, I am an Israeli citizen and our situation is better than in Nablus [in the West Bank], but they use different ways to crush our freedom.\u201d Relations between Israel\u2019s Arab minority \u2013 20% of the country\u2019s population \u2013 and their kinfolk in the occupied territories have evolved in the decades since they were reunited after the Six Day war. The so-called Arabs of 1948, who stayed in their homeland after the Nakba, routinely express solidarity with their fellow Palestinians. Now they are doing so again over the tensions and violence around Jerusalem\u2019s Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount, which were triggered, in the opinion of many, by Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s hardline policies. \u201cNetanyahu has closed off all paths to a two-state solution,\u201d declared Ahmed Tibi, Israel\u2019s most high-profile Arab MP and onetime adviser to Yasser Arafat. \u201cThe value of a Palestinian life was always less. Israelis only started to talk about a deterioration in the security situation when Jews were killed. But 21 Palestinians were killed between January and September. We are an inseparable part of the Palestinian people, but our struggle is a nonviolent one.\u201d In happier times, Kafr Qassem\u2019s bargain Saturday market drew thousands of Jewish customers. Last week it was down to a few hundred. It has been a similar story in Nazareth, Israel\u2019s largest Arab town, where the mayor castigated another leading Arab MP, Ayman Odeh, during a live TV interview, for talking about the al-Aqsa mosque, and demanded that he leave. \u201cGet out of here. Enough with the interviews. You ruined the city for us. There wasn\u2019t a single Jew here today.\u201d In Jaffa, a down-at-heel but increasingly gentrified suburb of Tel Aviv where Arabs have long been a minority, Jewish customers have been returning to the haunts they abandoned after an al-Aqsa protest in early October \u2013 just as they did when tensions subsided after last year\u2019s Gaza war. Abu Hassan\u2019s hummus restaurant overlooking the old port is fairly busy again, though Hani, the head waiter at Abulafia\u2019s legendary bakery, is furious at troublemakers who triggered boycott calls. \u201cThrowing stones won\u2019t solve anything,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople light the fire and then run away.\u201d In the five weeks since the latest unrest began, the majority of incidents have taken place in the occupied West Bank or East Jerusalem, with an overall death toll of 72 Palestinians and 11 Israelis. Israel says 43 of the Palestinians were carrying out attacks when they were killed. Amnesty International has documented four cases of what it describes as \u201cextrajudicial killings\u201d of Palestinians. Inside Israel, demonstrators in Kafr Qassem threw stones at police, while 12,000 people attended a protest at Sakhnin, Galilee. In Beersheba, an Israeli Bedouin \u2013 from a tribe whose members serve in the army (unlike other Arabs) \u2013 grabbed a soldier\u2019s gun and killed him. But after an Arab woman wielding a knife was shot by police in Afula, it transpired that she was mentally unstable, not a terrorist. Few on either side expect serious violence to spread inside Israel. \u201cThe Jews have succeeded in the fragmentation of Palestinian society to the extent that the Palestinians themselves stress how different they are from their compatriots,\u201d says Meron Benvenisti, one of the country\u2019s most astute liberal commentators. \u201cMost Israeli Arabs imitate Jews in their pursuit of the good life. Israel has imposed its policy of divide and rule, and Israeli Arabs have internalised that way of thinking.\u201d In Nazareth, the Arabic-language Bokra website is running a campaign promoting nonviolence. \u201cMistrust of the other, and Netanyahu\u2019s policies, are dragging this country into confrontation,\u201d warned the participants in a debate it organised. Israeli officials blame the trouble on \u201cincitement\u201d by Palestinians, citing violent and antisemitic images on social media and the glorification of \u201cmartyrs\u201d. Palestinians everywhere retort that occupation without end and a rightwing government that appeases extremist Jewish settlers breeds desperation; and that incitement works both ways. \u201cNetanyahu has promoted a culture of fear of Arabs,\u201d argues Mehdi Abdel-Hadi of the Passia thinktank in East Jerusalem. Avigdor Lieberman, then foreign minister, called earlier this year for disloyal Arab citizens to be beheaded. No one has forgotten the warning by the prime minister on the eve of March\u2019s election that Arabs were \u201ccoming out in droves to vote\u201d \u2013 a transparently racist dog whistle. \u201cBibi [Netanyahu] plays on Israelis\u2019 fears and anxieties,\u201d says Daniel Seidemann, a lawyer who specialises in protecting Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem. \u201cHis vision is a Hobbesian one. When he speaks in the name of the Jewish people, he is excluding 20% of the citizens of this country.\u201d For Menachem Klein, a political scientist, the events of recent weeks mark the transformation of a national conflict over land into an ethnic/religious struggle between Jews and Arabs in a bitterly divided country, which has given up believing in the two-state solution or any form of workable peace settlement. \u201c[Netanyahu] says he is against a binational state, but admits we will have to live by the sword for ever,\u201d sighs Klein. \u201cThat is his vision. It\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d Many Palestinians agree. \u201cA lot of it is about hatred and fear between the two societies,\u201d says Passia\u2019s Abdel-Hadi. \u201cPeople on both sides say: \u2018I don\u2019t trust you and I don\u2019t respect you. I fear you and I will stay away from you. And if you come into my space I will kill you.\u2019\u201d Debate over whether what is happening can be classified as another intifada \u2013 or is something different and harder to define \u2013 is irrelevant to the risks of random violence. Several Jews have been killed or injured by other Jews because they were mistaken for Arabs: thus the widely circulating social media image of a dark-skinned man wearing a T-shirt proclaiming in Hebrew: \u201cPlease calm down. I\u2019m a Yemeni.\u201d Yet even if things do calm down, most people agree that the situation could easily escalate again, as the underlying conditions look unlikely to change. \u201cWhat do you think? That Jews are suckers?\u201d rages Meir Rahamim, a fifty-something driver from Rishon Le Zion, south of Tel Aviv, where a Palestinian stabbed an elderly woman this week. \u201cWe have our crazies too. We can throw stones at Arab cars too. If this goes on like this, there\u2019s going to be a civil war here. If we are not going to have peace with the Arabs, we are going to screw them.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-11-06T04:00:09Z", "title": "Wave of violence fuels Arab-Jewish suspicions in Israel's heartland", "sentences": ["It is only a half an hour from Kafr Qassem to the bustling heart of Tel Aviv, but the Arab town feels a world away from Israel\u2019s largest and most sophisticated city.", "There wasn\u2019t a single Jew here today.\u201d In Jaffa, a down-at-heel but increasingly gentrified suburb of Tel Aviv where Arabs have long been a minority, Jewish customers have been returning to the haunts they abandoned after an al-Aqsa protest in early October \u2013 just as they did when tensions subsided after last year\u2019s Gaza war.", "That Jews are suckers?\u201d rages Meir Rahamim, a fifty-something driver from Rishon Le Zion, south of Tel Aviv, where a Palestinian stabbed an elderly woman this week."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/wave-of-violence-fuels-arab-jewish-suspicions-in-israels-heartland"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Higher education", "Boris Johnson", "Education", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Politics", "London", "UK news"], "article": "The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has hit out at those involved in boycotts of Israel, describing them as \u201clefty academics\u201d who were unlikely to have influence in Britain.

Was she ready to die? \u201cOf course. Everybody involved in the operation was ready to die,\u201d she says from her home in Amman, Jordan. Halsa is the only survivor of the four Black September hijackers who seized the Sabena airlines Boeing 707 20 minutes into its flight from Vienna to Tel Aviv on 8 May 1972. After forcing the plane\u2019s British captain Reginald Levy to land at Lod (now Ben Gurion) airport, the hijackers demanded the release from Israeli jails of 315 Palestinians convicted of terrorism offences, and threatened to blow up the plane with its passengers if their demands weren\u2019t met. \u201cThey called us terrorists, but we weren\u2019t. The real terrorists were the Israelis who threw the Palestinian people off their land,\u201d Halsa says. Halsa is talking to me because a new Israeli docudrama about the hijacking, Sabena Hijacking \u2013 My Version, premieres at the Jewish film festival in London on Saturday. It mixes interviews from those who took part on both sides with archival footage and dramatisations. During the 30 hours in which Halsa and her accomplices held 90 passengers and 10 crew at gunpoint, she recalls, she expected to die. \u201cI thought I would be shot by Israeli soldiers. Or we were going to blow up the plane if our demands weren\u2019t met. I was ready to die because I wanted to make the Europeans and Americans realise that there was a Palestinian people and that they had been treated unjustly by the Israelis.\u201d     A scene from Sabena Hijacking \u2013 My Version    The Black September group was named in commemoration of the deaths and expulsions of thousands of Palestinians in Jordan in September 1970, but became famous mostly for its attacks on Israeli targets, notably the murders of 11 of Israel\u2019s athletes in Munich during the summer Olympics a few weeks after the flight 571 hijacking. How did the Israeli-born Arab nurse become a hijacker? \u201cIt\u2019s a long story. Difficult to talk about on the phone with my bad English.\u201d But she tries. Halsa came from a family of Arab Christians and graduated from an Israeli school in Acre. She says she wanted to join the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) because of growing hostility of Jews toward Arabs in and outside of Israel. Six months before the hijacking, she crossed the Israeli-Lebanese border and took part in training at a camp near Beirut, learning how to use a handgun, explosion belts and grenades. Early in 1972, she and three other Palestinian members of the Black September group were chosen to hijack flight 571. The four \u2013 Ali Taha Abu Snina, Abed al-Aziz Atrash, Rima Tannous and Halsa \u2013 only met the day before they seized flight 571, and posed as two young couples. They flew from Lebanon on forged passports to Rome, where they were provided with forged Italian passports, before flying to Frankfurt, then Brussels, where they boarded flight 571 with yet more forged passports (this time Israeli ones), on the first stage of its journey to Israel. Twenty minutes after takeoff from Vienna, they seized control of the plane. At that point, the captain laconically remarked to passengers over the PA: \u201cAs you can see, we have friends aboard.\u201d The four men and women were armed with two handguns, two hand grenades and two explosion belts. The hijackers told Levy to fly to Lod airport near Tel Aviv. Once on the runway, they issued their demands to ground control staff. Soon after, the defence minister Moshe Dayan and the transport minister (and future PM and president) Shimon Peres arrived to oversee negotiations.     Israeli troops patrol around the plane. Photograph: Anonymous/AP    The Israelis used the negotiations to play for time, pretending to accept the demands, while 16 commandos from the special forces unit Sayeret Matkal prepared to storm the plane. Twenty-four hours after the plane had landed, Operation Isotope began. All the Israeli commandos involved were wearing white overalls to dupe the hijackers into believing they were technicians who had come to fix the plane\u2019s hydraulic system. In the ensuing gun battle, the two male hijackers were shot dead and the two women captured. Three passengers were injured and one, 22-year-old Miriam Anderson, later died in hospital. Operation Isotope was all the more remarkable for the fact that two other future Israeli prime ministers \u2013 Ehud Barak and Binyamin Netanyahu \u2013 were among the commandos. Hence a headline in the Times of Israel recently: \u201cWhen the prime ministers took down the hijackers.\u201d Operation Isotope has long been celebrated in Israel as showing the cunning and resolve of its politicians and armed forces against terrorist threats. When prime minister Netanyahu spoke at the film\u2019s premiere in Jerusalem in September, he recalled that in the 1970s, \u201cterrorists were like preying animals, grabbing planes, kidnapping passengers and threatening to kill them and sometimes doing so\u201d. The \u201cmost important lesson\u201d of this era for Israel, he said, \u201cis that it was not merely sophisticated military expertise but our determination and our daring against those who threaten us that curbed this particular form of terrorism\u201d. Does Halsa have any regrets about what she did? \u201cYes. I wish we had blown up the plane.\u201d Why? \u201cI think that European and Americans are looking at Israel with two eyes. With the Arab people, they look just with one eye.\u201d     A cockpit scene from Sabena.    Halsa was sentenced to 220 years in jail for her part in the hijacking of Sabena flight 571 \u2013 a life sentence for each of the hostages on the flight. \u201cThe Israeli authorities wanted to break us, to break our character, to break the spirit of the Palestinian people, by giving us these long sentences, \u201d Halsa says. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t.\u201d In November 1983, as part of the prisoner exchange between the PLO and Israel after the first Lebanese war of 1982, she was released and now lives in Jordan. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose to go out [of Israel],\u201d says Halsa. \u201cIt was imposed on me. Now I\u2019m very happy in Jordan.\u201d Now in her mid-60s, she is married, has two sons and a daughter and is a care worker with disabled people. The film is, among other things, a window into another world. \u201cIn those days,\u201d says the director, Nati Dinnar, \u201cpeople would hijack planes because they believed they could get what they want.\u201d Indeed, two of Halsa\u2019s accomplices had successfully hijacked planes before. One had participated in the hijacking of an El Al plane to Algeria in 1968 and a Lufthansa plane to Aden, Yemen, in 1972, while another had been involved in PLO hijackings in Jordan. \u201cNow nobody hijacks planes like that. Instead, they fly them into the twin towers or blow them up over the Sinai,\u201d says Dinnar. \u201cEverybody knows that negotiators are not going to give in, as they did in the past, but stall for time. So hijacking doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Dinnar\u2019s docudrama was given more detail and authenticity by the discovery of the late Levy\u2019s tape-recorded account of the hijacking, some of which is played during the film. But what Sabena even more poignantly dramatises is the quiet heroism of the London-born Jew, who received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his wartime service for the Royal Air Force, during the 30-hour ordeal, which coincided with his 50th birthday. \u201cHe functions so calmly,\u201d says Dinnar. \u201cOne minute he was about to be killed by the hijackers when he tries to grab their pistol, but a few hours later he managed to convince them to let him go and speak to the Israelis.\u201d     Theresa Halsa, right, and Rima Tannous, left, hear the reading of their life sentences at the trial in Lod on 14 August 14 1972. Photograph: AP    Levy was astute enough not to disclose to the hijackers that his wife was one of the passengers. He had brought her on the flight for a romantic meal to celebrate his birthday in Tel Aviv, planning to return the following morning. In one fine scene, Levy is allowed to leave his cockpit to visit his crew and passengers in the cabin. He speaks to his wife as if she were a passenger: \u201cI am so sorry,\u201d he says, \u201cfor the terrible ordeal I have put you through.\u201d   Related: Reginald Levy obituary    In another scene in the cockpit, the leader of the hijackers, Ali Taha Abu Snina, discovers that not only is the captain a Jew but, even worse, an English Jew. \u201cSo you are the ones to blame,\u201d says Snina, clutching his gun. \u201cSorry?\u201d says Levy. \u201cYou. The English. You gave the Jews a state. So you are to blame.\u201d The two men crack thin smiles, then go on to exchange confidences about their respective families and children. \u201cSuddenly you make me miss my daughters,\u201d says Ali. \u201cWell, I hope that you\u2019ll be able to hug them all again soon,\u201d replies Reginald. Moments later, the plane is stormed and Ali shot dead. At one point during the dramatised storming of the plane, we see Netanyahu grab Halsa by the hair. But the hair is a wig, which comes off in his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a movie,\u201d says Halsa, when I asked her what it was like to watch herself played by an actor in such scenes. \u201cI can\u2019t say it\u2019s a wonderful movie.\u201d Why not? \u201cIn the film, they didn\u2019t show that I was injured in the storming of the plane. But I was.\u201d But the truth of what happened is stranger than she suggests. When Netanyahu burst in through the plane\u2019s emergency door, he grabbed Halsa and tried to get her to tell him where the explosives were. Another soldier, Marko Ashkenazi, then struck her with a loaded gun, which went off. A bullet from the gun struck Halsa, but passed through \u2013 straight into Netanyahu\u2019s biceps. The Palestinian hijacker and the Israeli commando were injured by the same bullet.     A still from Sabena.    After the Israeli premiere, Netanyahu recalled lying wounded on the runway after the shootout: \u201cI recognised my brother Yoni.\u201d Yoni Netanyahu was at the time a fellow commando, disappointed not to have taken part in Operation Isotope. \u201cHe ran to me, his face was very worried. He came closer. He saw me lying there with my white overalls stained with blood. In a moment [after realising his brother\u2019s injury was minor], his face changed and he said: \u2018You see, I told you that you shouldn\u2019t have gone!\u2019\u201d Yoni was to die in action four years later, when he was the only Israeli commando killed during Operation Entebbe to free Israeli hostages held by PLO fighters in Uganda.   Related: Operation Thunderbolt: Flight 139 and the Raid on Entebbe review    Would Halsa like to meet the Israeli prime minister now to talk about what happened on 8 May 1972? There is a pause on the line. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t like this idea.\u201d Dinnar tells me he would have liked Halsa to attend the premiere in Jerusalem, but that it was not possible due to Netanyahu\u2019s presence. \u201cRescuing hostages from a plane is easier than arranging security for a screening for the prime minister of Israel,\u201d he says. Halsa also has misgivings about the way in which she was portrayed in the film. \u201cThis actor is playing my character, but it\u2019s not close to me.\u201d In what way? \u201cI was always smiling with everybody on the plane, to try to make them feel less afraid. She made me very tough, very unsmiling, but I wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d The film does sometimes depict Halsa sympathetically, though, as when she is shown administering an insulin shot to a diabetic passenger. The film also includes interviews with passengers who recall that Halsa was kind to them. Why did she behave that way to her hostages? \u201cWe didn\u2019t want people to suffer. We didn\u2019t want people to be afraid.\u201d But, quite possibly, what vexes Halsa most about the film is that it dramatises how she and her accomplices were duped by the Israelis who ran Operation Isotope. \u201cThey think they were very clever. But they weren\u2019t as clever as they think. They were lucky. It could have turned out much worse for them.\u201d     A still from Sabena. Photograph: PR company handout    But it didn\u2019t and, as a result, the foiled hijacking served as propaganda coup for the Palestinian hijackers and the Israelis who foiled their plan, serving to publicise the Palestinian cause as well as Israeli virtuosity and resolve at resisting Palestinian terrorists. The Israeli-Arab actor George Iskandar, who plays Snina, took a different message from the hijacking and from the film. \u201cThey were not terrorists, but fighters, people who fought for their principles,\u201d he told Israeli reporters after the premiere. \u201cI am not against peace and I am not in favour of such things, but I see these things differently. Instead of \u2018terrorists\u2019 I call them \u2018fighters.\u2019\u201d Certainly, the hijacker whom Iskandar plays in the film was of a very different mindset from Halsa, who was prepared to blow up the plane. Indeed, the film includes an interview with Bassam Abu Sharif \u2013 a former senior adviser to Yasser Arafat \u2013 who says he knew Snina and believes he would never have blown up the plane, \u201cnot because he wasn\u2019t courageous enough, but because he was wise enough\u201d. What Sharif means by that, no doubt, is that murdering 100 people by blowing up a plane would hardly have furthered the Palestinian cause. Dinnar tells me that the message of his film, which he hopes gives a balanced picture of the events of 43 years ago, is that violence will solve nothing. But it is a message that has not been heard. \u201cThe only thing that has happened in the 40 years since the hijacking is that the violence has escalated.\u201d And it escalated very quickly. Only three weeks after the foiled hijacking of Flight 571, Lod airport suffered a much bloodier attack: 24 people were killed and 80 injured when three members of the Japanese Red Army, who had been recruited by a Palestinian group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-External Operations, machine-gunned the passenger arrival area. Does Halsa remain committed to the Palestinian cause? \u201cYes, of course. The Palestinian cause is not for two years or 10 years or 20 years. When it is solved, it will be OK, but it is not solved.\u201d Sabena is at the Jewish film festival on 14 November, ukjewishfilm.org", "publicationDate": "2015-11-11T17:37:57Z", "title": "Four hijackers and three Israeli PMs: the incredible story of Sabena flight 571", "sentences": ["Halsa is the only survivor of the four Black September hijackers who seized the Sabena airlines Boeing 707 20 minutes into its flight from Vienna to Tel Aviv on 8 May 1972.", "The hijackers told Levy to fly to Lod airport near Tel Aviv.", "He had brought her on the flight for a romantic meal to celebrate his birthday in Tel Aviv, planning to return the following morning."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/sabena-flight-571-hijack-plane-black-september-film"}, {"tags": ["Football", "Republic of Ireland", "Spain", "Scotland", "Australia", "Morocco", "Cameroon", "Chile", "Russia", "Wales", "Israel", "Hungary", "Belgium", "Sport"], "article": "1) Spain v Republic of Ireland, 1965 Taking four points off the world champions in a qualifying campaign only to reach the play-offs is a novel development for the Republic of Ireland. Back in 1965, getting to a play-off was a good deal easier: all the Irish had to do was finish in the top two spots of their group \u2013 which contained only two teams. Originally Ireland were to face Spain and Syria, but the latter withdrew \u2013 they had been included in a European group to facilitate travel but, as it turned out, the Irish and Spanish were reluctant to go there because of fighting following a coup and in the end Syria pulled out citing solidarity with 16 other Asian and African countries who boycotted England\u2019s World Cup in protest at those continents being offered only one place in the finals between them.   Related: The Joy of Six: Short-lived football rule changes    So that left Ireland and Spain to play out their group games against each other knowing that they would meet again in a single-legged play-off. In the group games Ireland won 1-0 in Dublin when the Spain goalkeeper, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Iribar, fumbled a Frank O\u2019Neill free-kick into his net and then spun to the ground as if auditioning for the role of overcome damsel in the next Harold Lloyd production (\u201cLook at him! Look at him in anguish!\u201d said the commentator). Spain then had an idea: since Ireland had to come to their place to fulfil the group fixtures, why not save everyone a lot of money and hassle and just hold the play-off in Spain, too, 48 hours after the last group game? The Irish were not stupid enough to agree to that. Nor would they agree to the Spanish suggestion to stage the play-off in Lisbon. So, after Spain won the second group game 4-1, negotiations over the play-off venue went on. The Irish suggested London. Spain refused and suggested Paris. The Football Association of Ireland initially rejected that proposal too, for the same reason that it had turned down Lisbon: there would be far more Spain supporters. But then the Irish attitude changed. Explanations for the change differ: the FAI subsequently said that it got wind that Fifa were planning to impose Paris anyway so decided to pull a stroke on the Spanish, agreeing to their Paris proposal on the condition that the FAI got all of the gate receipts. Others say there was no talk of a Fifa diktat and the FAI, perhaps not for the last time, decided off its own bat to jeopardise Ireland\u2019s chances of World Cup qualification for the sake of a quick buck. Either way, the match went ahead in Paris, with Spanish supporters accounting for around 90% of a 35,000 crowd. The odds turned even more against Ireland when their key defender Charlie Hurley was ruled out of the match with injury, forcing Noel Cantwell, the Manchester United forward who had tormented the Spaniards in Dublin, to revert to central defence. Eleven minutes from the end of a tense contest in Paris, Jos\u00e9 Ufarte, the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid outside-right who had made his international debut in the defeat in Dublin, scored his first international goal to seal a 1-0 win and send Spain through to the finals in England. Ireland lost, but trousered \u00a37,448 in gate receipts. And to think, John Delaney was not even born. 2) Wales v Israel, 1957  Egypt refused to play against Israel in the qualifiers for the 1958 World Cup \u2013 something to do with the military invasion of Gamal Abdel Nasser\u2019s country following the nationalisation of the Suez Canal, apparently \u2013 and Turkey, Sudan and Indonesia took similar stances. With Israel getting walkover after walkover, it looked like they could stroll into the finals without actually playing a match. Fifa knows a farce when it sees one and decided it couldn\u2019t wave this one by. It was decided that Israel would have to contest a two-legged play-off against one of the runners-up from the other groups. Past champions Italy and Uruguay felt such a second chance was beneath them. Belgium were picked but then embarrassment overcame them, too. So lots were drawn again and this time Wales came out and they were not too proud to accept their good fortune. And what a Welsh team it was. Managed by Jimmy Murphy, Matt Busby\u2019s right-hand man at Manchester United, the Welsh had an unprecedented bevy of top players, including two sets of gifted brothers, Ivor and Len Allchurch and John and Mel Charles.     Israel goalkeeper Yaacov Hodorov, makes a flying save at Ninian Park. Immediately behind the keeper is John Charles. Photograph: PA    John Charles had just joined Juventus from Leeds United for a world record fee and the Italian club made it difficult for him to play for his country but such was Wales\u2019s strength in depth at the time that they could occasionally cope without one of the best players in the world, whose replacement, Des Palmer, scored a hat-trick in a 4-1 home win over East Germany (the Welsh lost away to both East Germany and Czechoslovakia, hence the second-placed finish in their group). Wales proved too strong for Israel in the first leg in Tel Aviv, winning 2-0 thanks to goals by Len Allchurch and the inspirational wing-half Dave Bowen. An excited crowd turned up for the second leg expecting to see a drubbing but the Israel goalkeeper Yacov Chodorov put in a defiant performance, keeping the hosts at bay until the the 76th minute, when Ivor Allchurch beat him from 20 yards. Swansea City\u2019s Cliff Jones made it 2-0 four minutes later. Before the end, Charles accidentally clattered into Chodorov and sent him to hospital. Wales, meanwhile, headed to the World Cup, technically as representatives of Asia and Africa. So the next time someone tells you Morocco were the first African team to reach the knockout stages of the World Cup, annoy them by pointing to the feat of Terry Medwin and friends. 3) Hungary v Belgium, third-place play-off, Euro 1972 There was something whiffy about Belgium\u2019s victory in the first international football tournament that they hosted \u2013 the 1920 Olympics \u2013 at least that was the opinion of the Czechoslovakian team, who stormed off the pitch in the final in protest at the perceived bias of the English referee, John Lewis, whom the Czechoslovaks said was influenced by the home crowd, which included many visible members of the local army, who were said to have pointedly trampled a Czechoslovak flag during the game. But the hosts certainly did not benefit from any special favours in 1972, when Belgium had to earn the right to take part in the four-team finals on their own soil by navigating their way through a tough qualifying group (that they topped despite losing in Scotland) and then a play-off against the defending European champions Italy. The Belgians drew 0-0 at San Siro before winning 2-1 at home thanks to a goal by Paul van Himst. Ah, Van Himst, one of the forgotten greats, or very goods at least. Blessed with the technique to outfox even the best opponents and the toughness to get up and carry on conjuring no matter how often opponents decked him (fans of Anderlecht, where he spent nearly all of his club career, nicknamed him Polle Gazon \u2013 \u201cPaul Lawn\u201d \u2013 because of the frequency with which he was sent sprawling to the grass). For the national team that he captained, Van Himst formed a fearsome partnership with another one-club legend, Raoul Lambert, scorer of 216 goals in 373 appearances for Club Brugge and 18 in 33 for Belgium.     Hungary\u2019s Tibord Fabian performs an overhead kick in the Stade Maurice Dufrasne in Li\u00e8ge. Photograph: Colorsport/Rex Shutterstock    Belgium were outgunned in the semi-final by Gerd M\u00fcller and West Germany but they could still ensure a triumphant end to their tournament by winning the third-place play-off against Hungary. Securing a tangible prize was important to the Belgians, who were often referred to mockingly as the \u201cworld champions of friendlies\u201d because of their habit of beating the best in the world in matches that didn\u2019t matter so much, going right back to a 5-4 victory over the Mighty Magyars of Hungary in 1956. Lambert opened the scoring for Belgium in the 24th minute and then Van Himst, who was earning a record-equalling 68th cap for his country and seeking a record-equalling 30th goal, took advantage of a blunder by Istvan Geczi, who confused his own keeper by bizarrely stepping out of the way of the ball and letting it run to Van Himst, who tapped it into the empty net. Hungary pulled one back but Belgium were not to be denied their finest international moment to that point. Alas, it was not quite the dawn of a new golden age, as they missed out on qualifying for the 1974 World Cup despite not conceding a goal during the entire qualifying campaign.   Related: The Joy of Six: fictional football    4) Scotland v Australia, 1985  Australia had topped an Oceania qualifying group featuring New Zealand, China and, yes, Israel, but to make it to the finals they had to contest an intercontinental play-off with Scotland, who had finished second in a European qualifying group behind Spain but narrowly ahead of Wales thanks to Davie Cooper\u2019s equalising penalty in Cardiff. That match, of course, is mostly remembered for the death of Jock Stein. Alex Ferguson agreed to carry on the work of his friend and mentor and delegate most of his Aberdeen duties to Archie Knox for a spell. He had a lovely team to lead \u2013 Souness, Dalglish, Strachan, Miller \u2013 names to make modern Scottish fans weep. Cooper cracked in a wonderful free-kick to give the Scots the lead in the first leg at Hampden Park before Frank McAvennie made it 2-0 with a dainty clipped finish in the second half. But the Aussies warned that would not be enough for the second leg in Melbourne, where their manager, Frank Arok, vowed to ensure the match was played in conditions as hostile as possible and smiled fiendishly as he advised the Scots to \u201cpack their sunscreen\u201d.     Frank McAvennie gets the close attention of Australia\u2019s David Ratcliff, left, and Charlie Yankos. Photograph: Colorsport/Rex Shutterstock    Arok was aghast when his superiors subsequently agreed to play the match at night \u2013 apparently meaning more TV money for the hosts, but a more benign temperature for the visitors \u2013 and was incredulous when groundstaff even started watering the pitch before kick-off. Had they no sense of making visitors uncomfortable at all? Still, the Scots, deprived of Kenny Dalglish, were given a torrid time by Australia\u2019s players, who might have clawed back the deficit if not for a series of excellent saves by Jim Leighton. Scotland held on for a 2-0 aggregate victory and Ferguson celebrated World Cup qualification as only he could: \u201cI\u2019m a little bit disappointed. It\u2019s great to get there but I wish we\u2019d played better.\u201d 5) Morocco v Cameroon, 1981  The World Cup wasn\u2019t all larks and cheers for Just Fontaine. The former France international may hold the record for the number of goals bagged in a single tournament but his attempt to spread a bit of that joy to the country of his birth, Morocco, ended in chastening failure. It all started so well for Fontaine. He was appointed as Morocco\u2019s manager in 1979 and led a young team to third-place finish at the following year\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations, beating an accomplished Egypt side in the process. They overcame the Egyptians again in qualification for the next World Cup, igniting hopes that Fontaine could lead a talented generation of players to the country\u2019s second appearance in the finals and make a real mark there. The last qualifying round was effectively a play-off between Morocco and Cameroon, and Fontaine was buoyant. Too buoyant, as it turned out. Despite pleas from the local press and some of his own squad, the manager eschewed the services of Morocco\u2019s two overseas professionals, Toulouse\u2019s Abdelkrim \u201cKrimau\u201d Merry and Servette\u2019s Mustapha Yagcha, allegedly reasoning that sparing them the journey would help keep them fresh for the following summer\u2019s finals. Morocco put the match on in Kenitra, an isolated town in the north of the country, but if that was intended to put off the visitors, the ploy did not work: Cameroon were a rising force, who had destroyed Zaire 6-2 in the previous round. Moroccan fortunes plummeted on the eve of the game when their outstanding goalkeeper, Badou Ezzaki, suffered a wrist injury. Morocco started well, nonetheless, but were further disheartened when Mohammed \u201cChicha\u201d Rabih missed a first-half penalty. Then the hosts conceded a spot-kick themselves and Roger Milla converted it. Jean-Pierre Tokoto, a wonderful midfielder reaching the end of his club career at New England Tea Men, then made it 2-0. \u201cRoger Milla, Thomas Nkono, Jean-Pierre Tokoto, Th\u00e9ophile Abega \u2013 they just had great players all over the park,\u201d recalled Morocco\u2019s Aziz Bouderbala some years later. \u201cThey swept us aside without any problem.\u201d     Cameroon goalkeeper Thomas N\u2019Kono comes out to claim a cross against Morocco. Photograph: Peter Robinson/Empics Sport    For the second leg in Yaound\u00e9, after a player uprising, Krimau and Yagcha were brought back. Cameroon scored early thanks to a penalty by Ibrahim Aoudou, then Yagcha pulled one back from the spot for Morocco. But Milla struck again before the end to complete a 4-1 aggregate victory, ending Fontaine\u2019s Moroccan tenure and beginning Cameroon\u2019s long and singular relationship with the World Cup finals. They were unbeaten in 1982, eliminated after draws with Peru, the eventual semi-finalists Poland and the eventual winners Italy. 6) Chile v USSR, 1973  The qualifying draw for the 1974 World Cup determined that the winners of Uefa Group 9 would compete for a place in the finals against the winners of Group 3 in the South American zone. That, it transpired, pitted the USSR against Chile, where, in September 1973, the democratically elected Marxist president, Salvador Allende, was overthrown in a CIA-backed coup led by Augusto Pinochet. During the ensuing reign of terror, perceived opponents of the new regime were killed, tortured or \u201cdisappeared\u201d. Thousands of dissidents were held hostage and abused in Santiago\u2019s Estadio Nacional de Chile. That is where the second leg of the play-off was supposed to take place. The USSR, decrying the stadium as \u201ca concentration camp\u201d, demanded that Fifa move the match to a neutral venue. Fifa sent an inspection team to Santiago, where they were shown around by officials eager to present a pleasant image of the new regime. Whether hoodwinked or wilfully blind, the inspection team reported back that everything was hunky-dory, accepting the official claim that the stadium was merely being used as an \u201corientation centre\u201d where dissidents were accommodated while their identity was checked. The Cold War was in full blow. There were conspiracies on top of conspiracy. The Soviet media alleged that the Western-run world governing body refused to find anything amiss in Santiago because it supported the capitalist murderers in power, and also because they wanted to provoke the USSR and its satellites into withdrawing so that the World Cup would be an exclusively Western affair. Fifa supporters claimed the USSR\u2019s complaints were unfounded and they were only whining because they knew they were going to be eliminated anyway after drawing the first leg 0-0 in Moscow. Neither side backed down and the USSR announced they would not show up in Santiago. Chile would be awarded a walkover. The Chilean authorities pressed ahead with the match and some 30,000 people turned up to watch. At kick-off there was no opposition to prevent the home side toddling forward and scoring. Some of the players celebrated by heading to a part of the ground where there were no fans, a homage to the disappeared.", "publicationDate": "2015-11-13T09:15:33Z", "title": "The Joy of Six: international football play-offs | Paul Doyle", "sentences": ["Wales proved too strong for Israel in the first leg in Tel Aviv, winning 2-0 thanks to goals by Len Allchurch and the inspirational wing-half Dave Bowen."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/13/the-joy-of-six-international-play-offs"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Five people have been killed and up to a dozen injured in two attacks by Palestinians in Tel Aviv and the Gush Etzion bloc of settlements in the occupied West Bank.

Police arrest a man after an attacker fatally stabbed two people in a Tel Aviv office building on Thursday.     In the second incident, which took place a couple of hours later, a Palestinian gunman in a car opened fire on a minibus at a road junction outside the settlement of Alon Shvut.  According to an Israeli military spokesman, the gunman then drove towards another junction, where he intentionally rammed his car into a group of pedestrians before being shot by soldiers. Other reports suggested the gunman had exited his vehicle and was still firing when he was shot.

The attacks bring the number of Israelis killed in the past seven weeks of violence to 18. Eighty Palestinians, some of them assailants, have died in the same period. A third man was injured in the attack in south Tel Aviv. He stumbled into the shop, and others inside blocked the door as the attacker attempted to follow him in. A wounded suspect was arrested and identified as a 36-year-old Palestinian man from the Hebron area of the occupied West Bank, who had a permit to be in Israel and had been working in a local cafe.

Someone shouted: \u2018There\u2019s a terrorist!\u2019\u201d he said.  \u201cWe managed to close the doors and he tried to force them open.

We used all of our strength to not let him inside and then he went on to the nearby shops to try and hurt someone there.\u201d It was the highest death toll in such attacks in a single day since the recent round of violence began seven weeks ago. The current wave of violence between Palestinians and Israelis began amid friction over a Jerusalem holy site known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, where al-Aqsa mosque stands, and to Jews as Temple Mount. Earlier on Thursday, three Palestinian women attempted to infiltrate an Israeli military post in the West Bank, the military said.

Chelsea have spent heavily in previous winter windows, most notably when David Luiz and Fernando Torres arrived for a combined \u00a373.3m in 2011, though their policy in recent years has been to fund the vast majority of their purchases through sales. Regardless, Mourinho will not push for business in mid-season. \u201cI will not ask for any changes,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not ask the board [for players] in January. I\u2019m happy with the players I have. I trust the players I have. I don\u2019t need to clean the dressing room, and I don\u2019t need to ask the club to spend money in January. I\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t sign anyone. I\u2019m saying I won\u2019t ask the club to do that. I don\u2019t have the right to do it, in my opinion. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I have the right? Because our performance \u2013 if you can use that word, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the correct word \u2013 during the season in the Premier League has not been good enough. If I ask for players, or if the club gives me a handful of players, it\u2019s like taking a bit of the responsibility off us and suggesting we needed extra [help] to reach our objectives. \u201cI want the responsibility to be in my hands. I want the players to have the responsibility in their hands. I want them to feel I trust them and don\u2019t need other players to reach our objectives. We should be together, me and the players. We have put ourselves in this situation. Now we have to put it right.\u201d Although Everton have indicated they will not consider Stones\u2019 departure in the new year, there remains the possibility Abramovich could sanction big-money arrivals without Mourinho agitating for additions, as the owner did with Torres and David Luiz when Carlo Ancelotti was in charge. Asked if he would accept being presented with a stellar signing, Mourinho said: \u201cOf course yes but not because I\u2019m not happy now or don\u2019t trust my players, or that I think only a superstar will help us reach our objectives. We believe in ourselves, we trust ourselves. I\u2019d be more than happy to go with this group to the end.\u201d That would apparently include retaining the loanee from Monaco, Radamel Falcao, who has managed a solitary goal in 10 appearances and is out injured until December. \u201cI hope he stays,\u201d said Mourinho. \u201cGenerally, I hope everybody stays and I hope nobody comes in, and we go together to the end. For sure, in the end of the season, we\u2019ll be in a different situation to where we are at the moment.\u201d Mourinho will return to the dug-out against Norwich after a one-match stadium ban, with Chelsea then flying to Israel on Sunday before their Champions League group game against Maccabi Tel Aviv, to be played in Haifa on Tuesday night.

So much of a dismal title defence to date has had the Belgian skulking away, perplexed by his own failings as much as those of a team of recent champions. Now a slender victory over a promoted side has fuelled talk of recovery. \u201cI hope this is the start, yes,\u201d he offered before listing, unprompted, the next few fixtures. His eagerness to use this win as a platform was clear. Chelsea have finally sparked their game of catch-up. Rewind a year and they had rattled up 33 points from their opening unbeaten 13 games and it will take similarly startling form if they are to haul in a distant top four, currently specks on the horizon a daunting 12 points away. Yet this team\u2019s capabilities make that far from an outlandish proposition and, given they will rely on last year\u2019s stellar performers to propel them up the table, that made this narrow win a source of encouragement. Key players have offered signs of promise.   Related: Chelsea\u2019s Eden Hazard looks as if he has woken from a baffling dream | Barney Ronay    Diego Costa, heckled at times when crowd and management alike grew frustrated at sluggish movement and dozy anticipation, must build on a first goal in a month with his winner slickly taken. Cesc F\u00e0bregas, whose assist was sharply executed, has to crank up that much missed conveyor belt of chances to the forward ranks. Nemanja Matic, all leggy aggression, must keep imposing himself in the centre having appeared diminished for months. And then there was Hazard. The side\u2019s playmaker-in-chief has rediscovered his spark in recent weeks, one anaemic display against Liverpool aside, and was back to his scuttling best, galloping upfield with the ball at his feet to leave opponents dizzied. The Belgian operated as the team\u2019s No10, a central role he had suggested he might attempt in talks with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho before last month\u2019s Capital One Cup tie at Stoke City. \u201cI\u2019d said to him: \u2018Maybe we have to try something, to change something. Maybe I have to play as a No10 because we have to try,\u2019\u201d said Hazard, those discussions at Cobham having taken place immediately after another damaging defeat, by West Ham. \u201cWe did and I played a very good game in the cup at Stoke. And, today, it was the same. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of things about me having a problem with the manager, but that is not the case. Everything is good with him. He is the best manager. He is the best manager for Chelsea, and we hope we can win a lot of trophies together. Maybe not this season because it will be difficult, but next season and beyond.\u201d Nervous supporters might cling to that as an indication that, as per his contract, Hazard considers his long-term future still to be at Stamford Bridge. The club consider all mentions of Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain or any other prospective suitor to be off limits. Last season\u2019s PFA player of the year could offer no explanation for his malaise, or that of his team. Perhaps markers have been paying closer attention to him this year, though he has been a marked man since arriving in England in 2012 and, this season at least, opponents have sensed they need not always mass behind the ball to prosper against Chelsea. There have been frailties that all-comers have sought to exploit. Hazard did put Costa\u2019s toils down to the Spain forward not receiving \u201cenough good passes for him to score, but he has tried everything\u201d. Saturday finally brought reward to ensure a team who won the league with something to spare in May have leapfrogged Norwich into 15th place. The visitors could draw heart from a rugged defensive display, bemoan the non-award of a penalty when Willian barged Robbie Brady and curse John Terry\u2019s excellent block which denied S\u00e9bastien Bassong. Ultimately they were undone by a lapse of concentration at a free-kick and a lack of bite across their own front line. Alex Neil will look to address that in January but, before then, there is no respite with Arsenal, Everton, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur awaiting in their next five games. Theirs has been a brutal run. \u201cBut we drew at Liverpool, lost narrowly at Manchester City and arguably should have got a point, and then had a few opportunities at Chelsea, should have had a penalty and only lost 1-0,\u201d said Neil. \u201cSo it\u2019s not as though we are being dominated. We are competitive in games. We have done OK, and we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Players such as Nathan Redmond and Brady, and the industry of Youssouf Mulumbu in midfield, offer Norwich hope, as do the energy and optimism of their manager. Chelsea, for their part, can take solace from Hazard\u2019s revival. They travelled to Israel on Sunday looking to seal progress into the Champions League knockout stages in Tuesday\u2019s against Maccabi Tel Aviv feeling more like their own selves, even if there have been false starts already this season.

I will only have one shot, so I need to use it very carefully.\u201d   Related: Vincenzo Montella returns to Sampdoria but there will be no quick fix for club | Paolo Bandini    He is certainly deploying it to good effect so far. If there is still some novelty in the idea of a footballer moving virtually straight into an upstairs role then perhaps it was right to expect Cruyff to choose an unconventional path. Following prolonged knee problems that ruined a playing career taking in spells at Barcelona and Manchester United he made a low-key comeback with Metalurg Donetsk and Valletta. He became assistant manager at the latter \u2013 a role he admits he did not take to \u2013 before carving out a director of football role at the Cypriot club AEK Larnaca, who asked him to name his job after he rejected a coaching position. Their progress, reaching the Europa League group stage in 2011-12, attracted the attention of Maccabi\u2019s Canadian-based owner, Mitchell Goldhar. Maccabi had not won the Israeli league for nine years when Cruyff arrived but they have now rattled off three consecutive titles and are two-thirds of the way through their first Champions League group stage appearance since 2004-05. \u201cI\u2019d never have expected this 10 years ago, but life and football will always surprise you,\u201d he says. \u201cI took my Pro Licence and I love tactics, but at the moment my passion is not being out on the pitch every day. I prefer the other part of it; this is a club that tends to be a trampoline for coaches, who have success here and then move to bigger leagues, so you need someone who stays and looks at the long term \u2013 a football person to make the football decisions. It\u2019s my job to try and put together a good squad, coaching team and scouting setup, and then collaborate with the coach on how to improve.\u201d It is an arrangement that has benefited everybody. Of the coaches brought in by Cruyff, Oscar Garc\u00eda went on to work for Brighton and Watford while Pako Ayestar\u00e1n now manages the Mexican champions Santos Laguna. Most notably, Paulo Sousa moved on to Basel after a title-winning season in Tel Aviv and now sits third in Serie A with Fiorentina. Along with the current incumbent, Slavisa Jokanovic, all three fitted the profile for Cruyff\u2019s vision of Maccabi as a club that can improve careers while becoming a force in its own right. \u201cMy task was to bring a bit more of a European way of working here,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean professionalism, technology, physical conditioning, bringing in people with a Mediterranean kind of mentality [Jokanovic, a Serb, has largely been based in Spain since the 1990s] who can adapt to the lifestyle quickly. The intention is that the foreigners will make us better on the pitch and also act as educators off it. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been successful. If you told me this would be our situation three years ago, I\u2019d have signed up for it immediately. It\u2019s taken a lot of contributions from some talented people, and I think the Champions League is the final confirmation that we are on the right track. At the same time, our results there are clear proof that we still have a lot of improvements to make.\u201d A glance at the Group G table bears that out. Maccabi are yet to win a point and have conceded 11 goals in their four games. Victory against Chelsea could give them a theoretical chance of a Europa League place but the learning curve has been steep. \u201cIt is a clear lesson in the things we lack,\u201d says Cruyff. \u201cSuddenly we find ourselves in a competition where the rules are basically different. What you need to win a game in Israel, where we know we\u2019ll dominate most weeks, is not what you need in the Champions League \u2013 if you are out by 10cm, you go a goal down, and we haven\u2019t been able to put our own small chances away.\u201d Cruyff believes Maccabi \u2013 and Israeli football in general \u2013 are hindered by the local league\u2019s five-foreigner limit for each squad, although he is adamant their development has not hit a ceiling. When that view changes, it is likely that the next step for which he is preparing so assiduously will arise. His success has already attracted the attention of clubs in Germany and the Championship but for now he is happy to take lessons from the work of others, including those at Manchester United. His father, Johan, and Louis van Gaal are \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 not close but he views United\u2019s fortunes with equanimity. \u201cWhen you bring in a coach like Van Gaal you know you will get interesting press conferences but also a team that has control over the ball, possession and movement,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s important to listen to the club legends, people like Gary Neville and Paul Scholes, and not to lose the identity they created. Sometimes you have to find a middle ground between what you want and what has already made the club successful, and if they find that they will return to being the biggest and the best.\u201d Perhaps a return to Old Trafford with one of their Premier League opponents is not out of the question. With managerial upheaval a running theme in some quarters, Cruyff\u2019s ability to execute a plan that both harnesses and cuts through the movement beneath him suggests that there are a number of clubs for whom his name might be no issue at all.", "publicationDate": "2015-11-23T14:41:24Z", "title": "Jordi Cruyff: Because of my name I\u2019m not a guy who can make mistakes", "sentences": ["\u201cBecause of my name I\u2019m not a guy who can make mistake after mistake,\u201d says Cruyff, who has been the sporting director at Maccabi Tel Aviv, who face Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday night, since April 2012.", "Most notably, Paulo Sousa moved on to Basel after a title-winning season in Tel Aviv and now sits third in Serie A with Fiorentina."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/23/jordi-cruyff-maccabi-tel-aviv-chelsea"}, {"tags": ["Chelsea", "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho", "Champions League", "Maccabi Tel Aviv", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has defended his use of younger players and chose the eve of Chelsea\u2019s Champions League game against Maccabi Tel Aviv to stress the onus is on such as Ruben Loftus-Cheek to prove they should be granted more regular involvement in the first team.   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho takes swipe at Graeme Le Saux before Maccabi Tel Aviv match    Chelsea are still waiting for an academy graduate to follow in John Terry\u2019s footsteps and cement a regular starting place in the side, for all that Loftus-Cheek is highly regarded, has been training with the senior players since January and is a regular in their match-day squads. The midfielder has travelled to Israel, where a victory could secure passage into the knockout phase, with Kurt Zouma, Kenedy, Baba Rahman, Bertrand Traor\u00e9, the goalkeeper Jamal Blackman and the teenage right-back Ola Aina also in the squad. Yet there has been frustration that only Zouma, secured from St Etienne for around \u00a312.5m, of the younger crop is a regular in the team. The \u201crun of matches\u201d promised to Loftus-Cheek before October\u2019s international break amounted to 45 minutes against Aston Villa in a relatively unfamiliar playmaker\u2019s role before the manager withdrew him at half-time having grown frustrated at a lack of discipline when out of possession. The 19-year-old has not been on the pitch since. \u201cHe is a very talented player, no doubt about it, with ups and downs in his evolution, but he has had chances not many players at his age get in big clubs,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to get chances in smaller clubs. At big clubs, not many players his age have the opportunities he has had to start matches in the Premier League, Champions League and the cups, to be on the bench for lots of matches consecutively, living and learning with top players. So he is having everything. \u201cSometimes young players can argue, rightly or wrongly, that the chances were not too many for them. Ruben is the last one who can complain about that. Everything is in his hands. Even when he goes away with the national [Under-21s] team he has my assistant [Steve Holland] on the coaching staff, so we know every second of his development. Of course he is a player who we have lots of hope for but, sooner or later, he \u2013 him, not me \u2013 has to give one step forward to be more stable in the first team.\u201d Loftus-Cheek started against Maccabi in September, impressing in a 4-0 win which Chelsea will hope to replicate at the Sammy Ofer stadium in Haifa. Yet the criticism regularly levelled at Mourinho and Chelsea, who have more than 30 players out on loan, is that younger players are not offered a route into the first team. \u201cBut I can give you figures [that disprove that],\u201d the manager said. \u201cIn the first-team squad we have seven under-21 players who have 26 starts and 12 substitute appearances this season, and 43 appearances on the bench [when they were] not used. \u201cOK, Zouma is in his second season at this level and is unleashing himself as a top player, and people forget that he\u2019s 20. We are very happy with him and, to be fair, I\u2019m happy with myself too because, when he came here, he was not the player he is now. I remember the first two matches he played for us in pre-season in 2014 and he was not good. He was very bad. But now he\u2019s a player, fighting with Terry and Cahill hand to hand. But we have 26 starts. It\u2019s a lot in a club like Chelsea when you have a lot of top players.\u201d There have been suggestions some of the youngsters struggling to gain first-team involvement at their loan clubs \u2013 Izzy Brown and Nathan at Vitesse Arnhem, together with Patrick Bamford at Crystal Palace, are cited as examples \u2013 may return to Chelsea in January. \u201cBut the ones who are not playing at Vitesse, we cannot expect them to play here,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cThey have to fight to play. If they want to play with men and against men, at the top level, they cannot be protected forever. Sometimes \u2018evolution\u2019 is not about playing but feeling that it is difficult to play, and feeling the direction they have to go in if they want to be top players in top clubs.\u201d Zouma is expected to start here, where a win would secure progress if Dynamo Kyiv fail to beat Porto in Portugal, with Eden Hazard most likely to revert to a position on the left having played as a central playmaker in recent games. Although Hazard favours the No10 role, Mourinho used him there primarily \u201cto help him recover his confidence\u201d and considers him best operating from the flank. \u201cHe can attack defenders more in an individual way,\u201d he said of using the Belgian on the left. \u201cWhen he gets the ball it\u2019s more about him attacking the right-back and the right-back is always in trouble against a player who has his best quality in a one-against-one. When he plays at No10 he gets into areas where sometimes he is surrounded by teams who play zonal with two or three players in the same zone. Many times he receives the ball with his back to the opponents and players can be very aggressive, pressing him from behind. But he can do both.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-11-23T22:30:08Z", "title": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: Chelsea youngsters have to fight to make grade at club", "sentences": ["Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has defended his use of younger players and chose the eve of Chelsea\u2019s Champions League game against Maccabi Tel Aviv to stress the onus is on such as Ruben Loftus-Cheek to prove they should be granted more regular involvement in the first team.", "Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho takes swipe at Graeme Le Saux before Maccabi Tel Aviv match    Chelsea are still waiting for an academy graduate to follow in John Terry\u2019s footsteps and cement a regular starting place in the side, for all that Loftus-Cheek is highly regarded, has been training with the senior players since January and is a regular in their match-day squads."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/23/jose-mourinho-chelsea-youngsters-ruben-loftus-cheek-maccabi-tel-aviv"}, {"tags": ["Tottenham Hotspur", "Chelsea", "Mauricio Pochettino", "Qarabag", "Europa League", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Mauricio Pochettino feels it is a joke that Tottenham must kick off against Chelsea at midday on Sunday given they will arrive home from their Europa League match against Qarabag in Azerbaijan no earlier than 5am on Friday. The Tottenham manager said Chelsea, who play at Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Champions League on Tuesday night, will have the advantage and it is easy to imagine him cursing the Europa League. Pochettino said last April that he considered the competition to be a hindrance to a Premier League club\u2019s domestic ambitions. Pochettino believes that flying home after the game is, on balance, the lesser of two evils, with the other being staying the night, training at the local facilities in the morning and heading back on Friday afternoon. Tottenham chose this option last season after their Europa League last-32, second-leg defeat at Fiorentina and before the Capital One Cup final on the Sunday which, coincidentally, was against Chelsea. They lost 2-0 in the Wembley showpiece.   Related: Toby Alderweireld: opposition teams are scared of playing at White Hart Lane    The Qarabag game kicks off at 6pm \u2013 which is 10pm in Baku \u2013 and the flight back to London will take approximately five and a half hours. With the post-match obligations and travel time to the airport it is difficult to see Tottenham being able to take off before 10.30pm. And then, of course, there would be the time to get home from the airport in London. Pochettino made his feelings plain when asked to comment on the early kick-off against Chelsea. \u201cI laugh, I only smile,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s like the week we had three weeks ago when we played Monday night against Aston Villa, Thursday night against Anderlecht [both at home] and Sunday at Arsenal. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s worse, because you need to fly nearly six hours and then there is the decision about whether to come straight back or stay. It\u2019s very difficult because both decisions are bad. What will we do? Maybe we come straight back and give the players the day off on Friday. You never know, it might be difficult to fly from the airport. Maybe you need to wait two hours at the airport. \u201cFor us it\u2019s better to go straight after the game and get to England as soon as possible and maybe give Friday off for recovery. As soon as possible, we want to get back to England.\u201d Pochettino did admit that clubs could not have it all their own way \u2013 in other words, signing up to the riches of the Premier League\u2019s broadcasting deal and then complaining when, because of the demands of television, they got a kick-off time that did not suit them. \u201cIt\u2019s always the same problem,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cAt the beginning of the season all the clubs in the Premier League want to play on TV because it\u2019s a business. But when the moment comes to play we complain. The balance is difficult but we have to accept it because football is a business. But it is true that you give the advantage to the opponent.\u201d Tottenham are top of Group J and they could afford to lose at Qarabag and still qualify,.

None of the squad expressed a reluctance to travel. Chelsea departed for Haifa on Sunday hoping the extra day will help them acclimatise for the match against Group G\u2019s weakest side. It is 14 years since Chelsea played in Israel and on that occasion six members of the squad \u2013 Marcel Desailly, William Gallas, Graeme Le Saux, Albert Ferrer, Eidur Gudjohnsen and Emmanuel Petit \u2013 opted out of the fixture. Mourinho namechecked Le Saux when briefly reflecting on that issue from 2001. The former England defender, in his capacity as a member of the FA\u2019s inclusion advisory board, has been critical of the Chelsea manager over the demotion and departure of Dr Eva Carneiro earlier this season.   Related: Jordi Cruyff: Because of my name I\u2019m not a guy who can make mistakes    The fixture in 2001, against Hapoel Tel Aviv in the Uefa Cup, had been staged only a month after the September 11 attacks, with the world on high alert over terrorist attacks. The Israeli minister for tourism, Rehavam Ze\u2019evi, was shot dead on the eve of the match. Chelsea had been instructed by Uefa to fulfil the fixture but offered their players the choice of not travelling and ended up taking a youthful side. Under the management of Claudio Ranieri, Chelsea\u2019s matchday squad included the likes of Joel Kitamirike \u2013 a Ugandan centre-half whose only appearance for the club came that night \u2013 Rhys Evans, Pat Baldwin, Danny Slatter and Joe Keenan. Gianfranco Zola captained the side as they lost 2-0. Tuesday\u2019s game follows the terror attacks in Paris and with tensions high in Israel. Two people were stabbed to death outside a shop in Tel Aviv last week. \u201cI didn\u2019t speak in a formal way to the squad,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a meeting to ask them about their feelings. But I had a couple of individual contacts \u2013 more than a couple \u2013 to get the feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same to go and play in Israel as it is to go and play in Stoke or Newcastle. The feeling is obviously different. But I got from them the sense of responsibility and, of course, everybody has travelled. Nobody even tried not to go. I didn\u2019t have a single problem within the squad. I didn\u2019t have a Graeme Le Saux. I had everybody without fears, just wanting to come. I even have a player whose wife is going to have a baby either tomorrow or the next day but he\u2019s here, focusing on what he can do for us. \u201cThe fact we went two days before has given us a bit of time to adapt and feel we are OK.

Renowned genetic engineer Dr Wenger was very busy in his lab during the late 1990s, a fecund period of creativity that saw him invent raw vegetables, pasta, steamed fish and water. He subsequently transferred his genius for innovation and thinking outside the box to the world of product development and, since 2000, has been working on designs for a coat that can be successfully zipped up in less than six-and-a-half hours. He\u2019ll get there in the end, we\u2019re sure of it. But Dr Wenger retains a keen interest in the sciences, which may explain why he\u2019s been kicking off quite a lot lately about doping in football. Dinamo Zagreb midfielder Arijan Ademi failed a drug test earlier this season after he and the rest of his team beat Arsenal in Big Cup, and with the two sides set to meet again on Tuesday at the Emirates, the good Doctor has taken the opportunity to once again raise the subject of the Uefa rule which saw the player suspended but the club unpunished. What a way to welcome your guests, and them having travelled more than a thousand miles to get here. \u201cI personally don\u2019t agree with the rule,\u201d said a frowning Dr W as he opened the front door, the welcome mat conspicuously wedged under one arm. \u201cYou cannot say: \u2018OK, they had a doped player and the result stands.\u2019 That means you basically accept doping.\u201d Dinamo\u2019s manager Zoran Mamic, having presumably realised the offer of a gin and tonic would not be forthcoming, responded in kind: \u201cWenger can think and talk about what he wants, but there are other people who make decisions about that. I can suggest him to write the rules for Uefa.\u201d Which is, of course, a preposterous idea. Not least because who would be able to read them?

Now we have Jamie Vardy using the cryotherapy chamber to get as cold as possible before he gets back on the pitch (yesterday\u2019s Fiver).

It really needs to be said that Louis van Gaal should be applauded for what he has done at Old Trafford\u201d \u2013 flamin\u2019 Flavio L\u2019Abbate. \u201cSorry to dredge this up and drag it on far longer than is necessary (no one has ever levelled this accusation at The Fiver), but Liam McGuigan\u2019s mention of primary school football laws (Fiver letters passim) reminded me of something from my own childhood. Playing on a congested playground and taking professional footballers as our role models, a huge amount of cheating took place, matched only by the angry protests for any decision. Eventually all disputes would be settled by the \u2018penalty or goal\u2019 rule, often invoked by the attacking team, in whose favour the rule is heavily weighted. While the unfairness is clear for all to see, I have long maintained that it would be far more effective than any form of video technology\u201d \u2013 Ed Taylor. \u201cRe: yesterday\u2019s Quote of the Day. Maths is not my strong point but this one is easy.

Assuming Graeme had 89 minutes (\u2018just under an hour and a half\u2019) to get there and arrived 25 minutes before kick off \u2013 that leaves 64 minutes for travel: 83.9 miles in 64 minutes would mean an average speed of travel of 78.65mph\u201d \u2013 James Haughey. \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s side departed Haifa top of Group G on goal difference with a rare thrashing to celebrate and comforted by the knowledge a win from their final fixture against Porto will be enough to claim the group. Yet it was still a troubling flipside that occupied their minds. Anchoring the mood was the fact John Terry sustained ankle damage on a shoddy pitch. The injury to the captain will require scans before Sunday\u2019s awkward trip to Tottenham Hotspur. The manager, who had watched the 34-year-old depart forlorn on a stretcher, admitted he did \u201cnot believe too much\u201d the centre-half would be available and had already lost Ramires to a muscle injury when slipping in training the previous evening. He denounced the pitch as dangerous, though if he was helpless on that front he was disgusted on another.   Related: Maccabi Tel Aviv v Chelsea: Champions League \u2013 as it happened    It was the ugly argument with Diego Costa on the stroke of half-time that seemed more alarming, exposing a relationship that has become disconcertingly tense this term. The striker\u2019s lack of movement and anticipation is clearly infuriating the Portuguese, Costa\u2019s instincts dulled perhaps by a lack of confidence. Nothing the forward tried came off here. Last Saturday\u2019s winner against Norwich felt like an isolated incident amid sluggish reactions, though the Spain international is clearly quicker to fight his own corner. When Eden Hazard scurried on to Cesc F\u00e0bregas\u2019s clipped pass and lobbed the ball invitingly into the centre as the contest drifted into stoppage time at the end of the first period, Costa was dawdling on the edge of the area. Mourinho was livid and bellowed his exasperation, gesticulating frantically, with his assistant, Rui Faria, emerging from the dugout attempting to calm him down. Costa screamed back, flinging his arms in dismissal. Oscar and Terry approached him before he left the pitch but he waved them away and pursued his manager down the tunnel like a man possessed. \u201cI\u2019d wanted him to do a certain movement that he didn\u2019t and I was disappointed,\u201d said Mourinho. \u201cI reacted. He did too. At half-time in the dressing room, a few kisses and a few cuddles. No problem.\u201d That was deeply unconvincing. Indeed, more telling was his description of his team\u2019s third goal, when Oscar burst into the area to meet Baba Rahman\u2019s fine cross from close-range. \u201cOscar\u2019s goal, for me, was the one I was most happy with because, finally, we had someone in the box attacking a good delivery,\u201d said the manager. It is easy to see where Costa needs to improve, although, with Radamel Falcao diminished and currently injured and Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my a very different kind of centre-forward, Mourinho lacks alternatives in that forward pivot. He did not need Costa adding to his season\u2019s tally to overcome a poor Maccabi Tel Aviv team, whose status as the group\u2019s whipping boys was confirmed with another heavy defeat. They threatened only fleetingly and were undermined by Tal Ben Haim\u2019s first-half dismissal after he twice attempted to land a kick on Costa, even if Eli Dasa and, most spectacularly, Eran Zahavi subsequently forced Asmir Begovic into smart saves. Yet Chelsea monopolised possession and were always more inconvenienced by the surface than the opposition. They led when Gary Cahill headed down Willian\u2019s corner, Predrag Rajkovic doing well to scoop the ball on to the post before the centre-half poked in the rebound. Willian\u2019s free-kick and headers from Oscar and the substitute Kurt Zouma gave the scoreline a gloss Mourinho did not think was entirely merited. \u201cThe result was too nice for us,\u201d he offered, his frustration at the state of the pitch all too obvious. \u201cSuch a beautiful stadium, such a fantastic public \u2013 they deserve a better surface because that was bad and dangerous. Yesterday we tried to protect. We trained just a little bit, but Ramires slid and has a muscular injury. Then, to my surprise, Maccabi trained after us on it and, after the warm-up before the game, the pitch was really bad. \u201cJohn has an ankle injury I think down to the pitch. For him to have left the pitch with the score only 1-0, I know he\u2019s in trouble. John is a special guy with a special desire to recover. But to leave with the result 1-0, I don\u2019t believe too much that he can play.\u201d Mourinho had actually walked on to the turf while his players celebrated their opening goal to stamp in some of the divots.

Costa, such an integral figure in the team who won Chelsea\u2019s first Premier League title for five years in May, has cut an increasingly agitated figure over recent weeks. The 27-year-old\u2019s relationship with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has been extremely strong \u2013 most notably over the two costly retrospective bans incurred by the forward since February \u2013 but it is showing signs of fracture. This despite public insistences to the contrary, with the pair embroiled in an ugly disagreement as the teams left the pitch at half-time in Tuesday\u2019s comfortable 4-0 win against Maccabi Tel Aviv.   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Diego Costa made up with \u2018kisses and cuddles\u2019 after row    Mourinho, just as he did after a similar situation against Norwich on Saturday, made his frustrations clear at the forward\u2019s lack of anticipation over an Eden Hazard pass, which would have provided the striker with a tap-in had he been on the move. Costa returned his manager\u2019s remonstrations in kind. Oscar and John Terry tried to calm him down only to be pushed aside. The manager subsequently suggested there had been \u201ca few kisses, a few cuddles\u201d in the dressing room at the interval, and \u201cno problem\u201d, though the public show of dissent was notable. Chelsea, 15th in the Premier League, would be loth to enter the transfer market in January, when pedigree players are generally unavailable. It is unlikely, for example, the long-coveted Antoine Griezmann could be secured from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid or Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, whom the manager may prefer, from Napoli. Mourinho has admitted he has \u201cno right\u201d to ask the board for funds and said he would be happy to end the season with a squad largely unaltered from that which claimed the title. Yet there remains a need to qualify for next season\u2019s Champions League, with a top-four finish still considered the bare minimum requirement even in the wake of the club\u2019s worst start under Roman Abramovich\u2019s ownership. Given Costa has managed only seven goals in 10 months \u2013 there have been four in 17 games this season \u2013 the need for striker reinforcements is clear, with Radamel Falcao having proved ineffective over his loan spell from Monaco and Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my reduced to a bit-part role often spent on the flank. Furthermore, R\u00e9my\u2019s wife is due to give birth, which may rule him out of Sunday\u2019s trip to Tottenham. The recruitment department, under the stewardship of the technical director, Michael Emenalo, would prefer to promote a long-term view if there is to be a push for new players, and have asked to be kept abreast of Saido Berahino\u2019s potential availability at West Bromwich Albion. The England Under-21 forward had agitated for a move to Tottenham in August, with Spurs\u2019 hopes of reviving that deal in the near future surely wrecked by the antipathy between the clubs\u2019 respective chairmen, Jeremy Peace and Daniel Levy. Leicester\u2019s prolific Jamie Vardy is, like Berahino, contracted through to 2017 but the league leaders would resist any attempt to prise him away mid-campaign.           Mourinho: I kissed and made up with Costa after half-time row.    Neither of those forwards is likely to fit the profile Mourinho would prefer and the manager could, instead, push for a short-term fix to bolster numbers for the remainder of the season before more established targets are pursued in the summer. To that end, Emmanuel Adebayor\u2019s availability as a free agent makes him an option, with the Togo forward having worked under Mourinho at Real Madrid, while Robin van Persie has failed to settle in Istanbul since moving to Fenerbahce this year and could be made available on loan. Board and manager will liaise over the next few weeks, with Mourinho effectively reliant on Costa for the team\u2019s forthcoming games given the lack of experienced options \u2013 the club have a number of young forwards out on loan, but none is deemed ready for the first team \u2013 elsewhere in his squad. Although Costa, who scored 20 goals over his first season in Englandbut only three over the last four months of the season, played the whole of the second half in Haifa, his body language at half-time had been that of someone who no longer wanted to be on the pitch. He was already edging towards the tunnel while Predrag Rajkovic underwent treatment in stoppage time, and strode off immediately on the referee\u2019s whistle without acknowledging his manager, who was standing on the touchline. Gary Cahill is waiting to see whether he is offered new terms before his 30th birthday in mid-December. The centre-half\u2019s deal expires in 2017 but Chelsea have a strict policy of offering only 12-month extensions to players who have entered their 30s. Branislav Ivanovic, 31, has yet to discover whether he will earn a one-year deal when his contract expires next summer.", "publicationDate": "2015-11-25T22:29:10Z", "title": "Concerns over Diego Costa force Chelsea to consider striker search", "sentences": ["This despite public insistences to the contrary, with the pair embroiled in an ugly disagreement as the teams left the pitch at half-time in Tuesday\u2019s comfortable 4-0 win against Maccabi Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/25/chelsea-diego-costa-jose-mourinho-striker-search"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "UK news"], "article": "In the middle of the huge tarmac roundabout of the Gush Etzion junction in the occupied West Bank, a group of yeshiva students sits on plastic chairs reciting prayers as part of a protest. An Israeli army officer comes to talk with them and asks them to move on, citing not only the risk to the students but saying that \u2013 while they are sitting there \u2013 the army will be required to protect them. The reason for the warning is in evidence only 100 metres away, where a makeshift memorial of broken rocks and a bunch of fading flowers marks the spot where Hadar Buchris, a 21-year-old Israeli student, was stabbed to death by a Palestinian assailant next to a bus stop on Sunday.     Hadar Buchris, a 21-year-old Israeli student, was stabbed to death by a Palestinian assailant at the junction. Photograph: Facebook    The death of Buchris is not an isolated incident. Since 20 October there have been nine attacks in the vicinity of the junction carried out by Palestinians and four fatalities, all within four days in November. Situated on the main road leading south through the West Bank towards Hebron, Gush Etzion junction is a hub whose spokes radiate towards the cluster of Israeli settlements in the region, towards Alon Shvut, Gush Etzion itself, towards Migdal Oz and Efrat.  Both Palestinians and Israelis use the main road despite complaints by settlers who would like to see the traffic separated. On one side is a low rocky shoulder covered in trees, on the other a cluster of shops and cafes and garages. The roundabout, served by bus stops, is often used as a hitchhiking stop and is protected by soldiers in low, concrete sentry boxes. At the bus stop next to where Buchris died, two bullet holes have pierced the white painted metal support. The attacks have shone a harsh spotlight on the junction, which in recent days has seen visits from Israel\u2019s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, president, Reuven Rivlin, party leaders and senior army officers. \u201cIt\u2019s a symbol,\u201d said one young Israeli army officer among a group that had come with commanders to the roundabout on Tuesday. \u201cThat should be obvious.\u201d But a symbol of what? For Israelis it has become emblematic of the escalating violence of the last two months which has claimed more than 100 lives on both sides, including Palestinian attackers. For Palestinians \u2013 local farmers and commuters who travel through the junction on the West Bank\u2019s road 60, as well as those who work in the nearby Israeli settlements of the Gush Etzion bloc \u2013 it is symbolic of the continuing Israeli settlement enterprise and occupation.

The driver explains he has come to pick up his daughter, a young female soldier, who is too frightened to make the journey home to Tel Aviv. Inside a rest area behind concrete walls used by the soldiers, Talya Cohen and Avital Kleid, two 22-year-old trainee teachers are sheltering. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for our lift,\u201d explains Talya. \u201cUntil a week ago we would have waited outside by the bus stop, but after what happened on Sunday we\u2019re waiting here because it\u2019s safer.\u201d \u201cI would have hitchhiked before,\u201d says Avital. \u201cBut not since what has been happening.\u201d Avital has her own theory why the junction has attracted so many incidents. \u201cThis is a place where people were used to standing outside at the junction. It makes it an easy target.\u201d     Israeli soldiers patrol the Gush Etzion junction, which is a hub for roads leading to Israeli settlements where some 70,000 people live. Photograph: Peter Beaumont/Guardian    And amid mounting questions in Israel over the continuing violence, locations like the Gush Etzion junction have been thrust into the political spotlight. Netanyahu used the opportunity of his visit to the junction to insist extra security measures were being taken, including checking all Palestinian vehicles on the main roads, using bypasses where possible and revoking work permits for the families of Palestinian attackers. Not everyone, however, is convinced that Netanyahu and the Israeli military are going far enough, among them settlers or members of Israel\u2019s rightwing national religious sector who have come to demonstrate at the junction. It is members of this group who have plastered posters on all of the concrete sentry positions demanding Israel declare sovereignty in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Elsewhere, painted on a concrete barrier, is \u201cKahane was right\u201d \u2013 a reference to Meir Kahane, the extremist leader who wanted to expel Palestinians from the West Bank. Among those who have camped out at the spot where Buchris died on Sunday is Shuli Moalem, an MP from the rightwing Jewish Home party, who is among those who have been calling on the government to annex Gush Etzion to Israel. \u201cArabs have nothing more to do in Gush Etzion,\u201d Moalem told the Times of Israel last week. \u201cWe\u2019re stepping up the war on terror.\u201d     Relatives and friends attend the funeral of Hadar Buchris at a cemetery in Jerusalem. Photograph: Sebastian Scheiner/AP    She is not alone among those who have gravitated to the junction who see recent events as justifying tougher action. Among those protesting on the roundabout was Dov Baker, a yeshiva student, who is also calling for a wider separation. \u201cThis is our land. We need to be able to feel safe. You see that woman,\u201d he said, pointing to a Jewish woman approaching one of the bus stops. \u201cShe is probably scared, thinking she could be next because that car ... the one with the white and green number plate [indicating a Palestinian car approaching the junction]. The driver could stab her. That\u2019s what\u2019s in her mind.\u201d Like others demonstrating at the junction last week he said the main road should be closed to Palestinians. For Palestinians who live and work in the area, the anxieties are equally in evidence. For them the junction also feels a perilous place. Indeed, one of the three who died in a shooting attack on 19 November, the Thursday before Buchris\u2019s death, was a Palestinian bystander. Many Palestinians from the surrounding villages work among the 70,000 Israeli settlers inside the settlements, creating a degree of economic dependency. They are ferried to work by their employers, often entering the settlements through separate entrances. After the recent incidents, many were barred from work for several days. At his home a few miles from the junction, 50-year-old Yacoub \u2018Hassan\u2019 reflects the Palestinian concerns. He has sons who work in the settlements and has land with olive trees close to the junction. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it used to be. You can\u2019t go within a kilometre of the junction and feel safe with your hands in your pockets in case they think you have a knife. You can\u2019t walk there. You need to go there in a car. But sometimes you have to go. That\u2019s where the place is that you need to go to get a permit from the [Israeli] Civil Administration.  \u201cSince the trouble began I haven\u2019t used the junction. I don\u2019t go to Hebron. Where my olive trees are I have to return via the junction. This year I didn\u2019t harvest my olives because I didn\u2019t want to come that way.\u201d He also believes \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly given the demands of the demonstrators \u2013 that Israel wants to use the recent violence at the junction to bar Palestinians from road 60. He, however, has one last point to make \u2013 not about the junction but about the violence that has come to visit it. \u201cIt\u2019s different to the intifada that started in 2000 [the Second Intifada]. That was between the Palestinians and the Israeli government. This is between the settlers and the Palestinian villagers.

Frustration had boiled over in stoppage time at the end of the first half in the Sammy Ofer Stadium in midweek when Costa, with a tap-in on offer, failed to react to an Eden Hazard pass. Mourinho made his disappointment clear on the touchline, with his assistant Rui Faria attempting to calm down the manager, only for Costa to respond in kind as the players departed the pitch. The Spain international furiously brushed off attempts by Oscar and John Terry to intervene. Mourinho has since attempted to make clear he had reconciled with the forward in the dressing room at half-time, though the underlying issues behind the player\u2019s sluggish displays \u2013 Costa has scored only seven goals in 29 club appearances stretching back to mid-January \u2013 remain a concern. \u201cIn the game I told him, from a distance, that I was not happy with the movement he did,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cHe told me a few \u2018nice words\u2019 from where he was.

They are in the Europa League, in the group phase, and no one cares about that at this stage. They go smoothly, step by step, building a team, signing new players, giving conditions for the young players to develop. When the club is powerful to decide they don\u2019t sell, and to invest and bring in others, they have good conditions and no pressure to do magnificent work. I imagine that, with the stability they are showing, sooner or later \u2013 I think sooner \u2013 they will be winning trophies or in a Champions League position. For sure.

The queue was six deep, stretching back as far as the eye could see, by the time he arrived and it was clearly all a bit much for the woman, in her 20s, who was first in line. Drogba signed her book, flashed his smile and, for a few seconds, she looked as if she might pass out, bursting into tears before wandering off, still crying, somewhere in the direction of Banana Republic. She was from New York and, over and again, she kept repeating the same line. \u201cFinally, I\u2019ve met him.\u201d Drogba belongs to a small and exclusive band of players, along with Frank Lampard, Gianfranco Zola and one or two others, who can have this effect on Chelsea\u2019s supporters. It doesn\u2019t come easily but there was a point last season when it felt like Diego Costa might be destined for the same form of authentic greatness. Costa was never less than excellent in that period when he introduced himself properly to English football. He was constructed in a way that seemed more in keeping with another age, with a navvy\u2019s shoulders, the charging techniques of a Pamplona bull and a darkness of expression that told us a lot about his complete antipathy towards anyone who tried to stop him.   Related: Diego Costa on target as Chelsea beat Norwich to end disastrous run    Costa did also show why, as the Spanish football writer Santi Gim\u00e9nez put it, he \u201ccould invade an average\u2011sized country all by himself\u201d. Yet the good outweighed the bad, even if it was sometimes a close-run thing, and for all the kicks and scratches and elbows, and the impenetrably foul moods for which he has become synonymous, the lingering memory here is what happened when Chelsea went to Manchester City early in his first season and the ball appeared between the club\u2019s new striker and the home team\u2019s captain, Vincent Kompany. It was, I noted at the time, like watching two players \u201cholding their ground like warring old stags\u201d. Neither gave an inch, antlers locked. Then, finally, Kompany emerged with the ball and, however much it goes against pretty much everything we know about him, Costa accepted he had been fairly beaten, held out an appreciative hand and acknowledged his opponent. Since then, we have probably come to understand a little better why, in Spain, more people were booked for kicking Costa when he played for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, and why sometimes even his own team-mates had to ask him to stop him embedding his studs into the sides of opponents. It is also a little clearer to everyone, perhaps, why Jorge Valdano described him as \u201ca defender playing up front\u201d and how in the final 15 minutes of one game against Sevilla, two of their players and the assistant coach were sent off, with Costa the common denominator. Valdano, the former sporting director of Real Madrid, played in an Argentina team that could generally handle themselves. \u201cI have never seen a striker kick people so much,\u201d he said. Equally, this is nothing new. Costa has been bludgeoning opponents since his days in the Brazilian youth system, when he was suspended for four months for slapping a rival across the face. He is one of the few strikers who goes looking for the defenders and, over time, it becomes clear it is more than just a need for conflict. Costa is addicted. Coaches and team-mates have tried to get him to kick the habit. But it\u2019s futile, every time, and when he is scoring goals as freely as he was this time last year it probably doesn\u2019t concern Chelsea greatly that others think of him as the kind of guy who would knife you in the back then have you arrested for carrying an offensive weapon. But now? In the last 10 months Costa has scored seven goals, picked up six yellow cards and been banned for six games for two charges of violent conduct. He has gone, on average, 356.3 minutes without a goal this season whereas at the corresponding stage last year it was 99.8. Virtually all his other statistics \u2013 shots per game, accuracy, sprints, and so on \u2013 are down. Then consider the teams his goals came against: Southampton, Hull, Sunderland, West Bromwich, Aston Villa, Norwich and a Maccabi Tel Aviv side that have lost all five of their Champions League games, conceding 15 goals and scoring one. He is, in short, half the player he was and, yes, it has reached the point where it does seem reasonable that a club with Chelsea\u2019s ambitions are now ringing various agents and asking to be kept in touch about the players who might be better equipped to challenge for Costa\u2019s place than Radamel Falcao \u2013 a vanity signing from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, if ever there was one \u2013 or Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my. Mourinho\u2019s own job may depend on it and, however much they try to laugh it off, it was rare to see a manager and player clashing in the way that happened in Tel Aviv last Tuesday when Costa, for the second game running, would have been left with the near-certainty of a goal if he had anticipated a team-mate\u2019s cross. A year ago, he would have cleared everything in his way to get to the ball. These days, he is drifting to the edges, hanging back and doing everything that would not be expected of a scoring specialist. The difficult part is establishing what has gone wrong and, to give him his due, that is a question that could be asked of many Chelsea players this season. Eden Hazard has become an elegant frustration. Cesc F\u00e0bregas is not influencing games in the way he once did. Chelsea\u2019s supporters must have found it startling to see the way, for instance, a player of Branislav Ivanovic\u2019s sturdy reliability has suddenly become a danger to his own team, but that malaise has spread throughout the entire side. Yet Costa is the focal point of that team. It is all geared towards him playing well and Mourinho is right when he said the goal against Norwich last Saturday should not spare him greater scrutiny. \u201cHe\u2019s not reading the game properly,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cAs a striker, he must read. You have to play not only when you have the ball, but when others have the ball. You have to anticipate things and read the game faster. Everything is an accumulation [of confidence]. You\u2019re not on fire again just because you\u2019ve scored a winning goal against Norwich.\u201d   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho urges struggling Diego Costa to read the game faster    Not reading the game? Not anticipating things? Just compare that to what they remember of Costa in Spain or what the Premier League saw of him a year ago. \u201cEvery time there was a loose ball in an attacking situation it would seem to rebound to him,\u201d Diego Mainz, his former Albacete team-mate, said. \u201cAlways. The first time can be pure luck but when it happens a third, fourth, fifth time you learn that it\u2019s not luck. It\u2019s him.\u201d Costa is not short of competitive courage but the question has to be asked at this stage about whether his attitude has slipped. His hamstring issues have held him back, undoubtedly, but it is unusual that he has found it so difficult to find a peak level of fitness, when pace was once one of his main assets, and his admission that he was overweight when he returned to pre-season training hardly shifts the suspicion that he does not take enough care of himself. The same happened more than once at his previous clubs, including Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, where they also noted how when they were running laps Costa tended to be at the back of the pack and stayed in the inside lane because it meant covering a shorter distance. \u201cBlame my mum, she\u2019s far too good a cook,\u201d he said, having turned up four days late and badly out of shape. Madrid\u2019s football journalists remember him trying to avoid the cameras in training and insisting they did not film his whole body. All that can really be said for certain is that, whatever is troubling Costa, Chelsea desperately need him to shake it out of his system, starting in their game at Tottenham on Sunday. Yet Mourinho sounds like a man who is losing faith in the player who was previously the sharp arrowhead at the tip of his team. He is entitled to be aggrieved and there is no guarantee of a happy ending. Will leading clubs pass the concussion test? The Football Association has issued new guidelines about what should happen if players suffer concussion, the standout line being that there ought to be a minimum six-day period of rest at clubs that can provide elite care. \u201cIf in doubt, sit them out,\u201d is the slogan, with the recommendation extended to two weeks for under-18s or players with clubs where there are not full-time medics. In the process, the FA has been liaising with some of the leading experts in brain injuries, one of whom, Dr Willie Stewart, a Glasgow-based neuropathologist, has previously said he felt \u201cdepressed, disappointed and dismayed\u201d by the sport\u2019s attitude to concussion. If you remember what happened to Hugo Lloris a couple of years ago when he was knocked out in a match for Tottenham Hotspur against Everton but allowed to play on once he had come around, it is clear that something had to be done to highlight the potential risks. Yet these are guidelines, rather than rules, and the test will come when it is meant to be put into practice. The FA has made it clear what should happen but it will be intriguing to see if a Premier League club follows these recommendations should one of their players take a whack, say, on a Sunday with an important match to come the following Saturday. My suspicion is that when the next Lloris-type incident occurs we might find there are one or two clubs who still feel they know better.", "publicationDate": "2015-11-28T22:00:03Z", "title": "Are Chelsea losing faith in the effectiveness of Diego Costa? | Daniel Taylor", "sentences": ["Then consider the teams his goals came against: Southampton, Hull, Sunderland, West Bromwich, Aston Villa, Norwich and a Maccabi Tel Aviv side that have lost all five of their Champions League games, conceding 15 goals and scoring one.", "Mourinho\u2019s own job may depend on it and, however much they try to laugh it off, it was rare to see a manager and player clashing in the way that happened in Tel Aviv last Tuesday when Costa, for the second game running, would have been left with the near-certainty of a goal if he had anticipated a team-mate\u2019s cross."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/nov/28/chelsea-diego-costa-striker-future"}, {"tags": ["Chelsea", "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho", "Eden Hazard", "Tottenham Hotspur", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has tried the carrot, the stick and every other motivational trick to spark Eden Hazard back to the form that made him last season\u2019s Footballer of the Year. The Chelsea manager has tried tactical tweaks \u2013 using him as a No10, where Hazard played when he was younger, rather than on or off the left side. It was what Hazard himself had suggested when he had a heart-to-heart with Mourinho before the Capital One Cup tie at Stoke City on 27 October and the move worked that night. Hazard was good, although he did miss the decisive kick in the penalty shootout as Chelsea went out of the competition. It has been a mixed bag for him since in the position. He was poor and hauled off on the hour in the home defeat against Liverpool four days later. Last weekend, when restored to the role, he was excellent in the vital win over Norwich City, also at Stamford Bridge. He was back on the left for the Champions League away victory against Maccabi Tel Aviv on Tuesday night. Mourinho appears to have made up his mind and, judging by his comments in advance of Sunday\u2019s derby visit to Tottenham Hotspur, it would be a surprise if Hazard was given further opportunity as a No10. Mourinho was asked to name his perfect No10 and he put forward two of them \u2013 Wesley Sneijder and Deco, with whom he worked at Internazionale and Porto, respectively. Mesut \u00d6zil, now of Arsenal, and his player at Real Madrid, was described as \u201cvery good\u201d. Sneijder and Deco, Mourinho agreed, were complete. They could defend, create and finish. So, could Hazard emulate them? \u201cAs a No10?\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Mourinho has said that Hazard works well on the left because he is more often one-on-one with his man, where he can use his pace and skill to expose his opponent. It can be more crowded for him in the middle. But when Mourinho detailed his specific requirements for the player who occupies the No10 position for him, it became clear that Hazard did not measure up; that he had concerns over his attitude to the defensive side of things. \u201cWe have different concepts of the No10, me and him,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cFor me, a No10 does a lot of things. With the ball and without the ball. So for me, a No10 is a very special player in my team, when I play with one which, in this period at Chelsea, I have been. \u201cIn my first period here, we played without a No10. We played with two No8s. In a system of two midfield players and one No10, I demand a lot from a No10. Yes, I expect him to work back.\u201d It was put to Mourinho that Hazard does not do enough without the ball. \u201cAre you saying or asking?\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI am asking,\u201d came the reply. \u201cWe are doing OK now,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cAs a team, we are defending better. A No10, for me, is an eight-and-a-half when the team loses the ball and he is a nine-and-a-half when the team has the ball.\u201d Chelsea have won three of their last four fixtures in all competitions and yet there is the continued sense of a team that is groping for fluency. Tottenham are on the crest of a wave and they will begin as the favourites. With his club in 15th place and their title defence in tatters, Mourinho spoke of having to \u201clearn to live without the happiness of winning matches\u201d. He has been left to hunt for any signs of an upturn. \u201cWe have felt little differences,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cFor example, against Maccabi, they could score twice for 1-1. They didn\u2019t. A couple of minutes later, we get a free-kick. Two-nil. Goodbye. It was the first time where we felt the game could go in another direction and it didn\u2019t.

Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team have now gone 13 matches unbeaten, their best run since a 14-game stretch from November 1984 to March 1985 with Peter Shreeves as manager and Ossie Ardiles flitting around in midfield, but they did not have the wit or creativity to add to Chelsea\u2019s troubles on the day Jos\u00e9 Mourinho decided Diego Costa was no longer worthy of a place in his team.   Related: Chelsea\u2019s Diego Costa \u2018privileged\u2019 not to be dropped before \u2013 Mourinho    Mourinho\u2019s decision to leave Costa on the bench certainly jarred with his claim they had resolved their argument during the game against Maccabi Tel Aviv last Tuesday. If there were \u201ckisses and cuddles\u201d, as the Chelsea manager said, it was followed by the cold shoulder here. When Mourinho made his substitutions it was Kenedy and Ruben Loftus-Cheek who were instructed to come to the touchline and, for Costa, it was not far off a public humiliation given that Chelsea did not have another fit or available striker in the squad. Instead, Eden Hazard was given the leading role and Chelsea can be encouraged by the way they subdued a Spurs team who had scored at least three times in three of their last four matches at White Hart Lane. Chelsea still have not managed back-to-back league wins this season but they did gradually emerge as the more likely winners and with John Terry injured, can feel relatively satisfied about limiting Spurs to only a couple of decent chances in the first half and virtually nothing after the interval. This was Chelsea\u2019s first clean sheet away from Stamford Bridge in the league this season and that at least seems like a start. \u201cThe best Chelsea this season,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI think we have a team again.\u201d     Diego Costa cut an unhappy figure as an unused substitute at White Hart Lane. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian    As well as reflecting badly on Costa, a statement like that speaks volumes about how they have played before this point because it was still alarming to see the number of times a midfielder with Cesc F\u00e0bregas\u2019s gifts misplaced passes that would once have been routine. Nemanja Matic is still not influencing the games in the manner of old and though Hazard showed glimpses of last season\u2019s form and was acclaimed by his manager as \u201cphenomenal\u201d, it was probably unfair to expect him to take on Costa\u2019s role seamlessly. Hugo Lloris kept out his volleyed effort with a splendid save midway through the second half but Hazard\u2019s misplaced header after Oscar\u2019s cross had set up the outstanding chance of the opening 45 minutes exposed the obvious flaw of using a wide player as a centre-forward. Willian helped to give Chelsea\u2019s attack some energy and directness, with Pedro and Oscar buzzing around in support, but the tactic of not playing with an orthodox striker worked only sporadically.   Related: Eden Hazard shows Jos\u00e9 Mourinho what Chelsea have lacked with Diego Costa    Whatever is eating away at Costa, Chelsea will be a much more rounded team when, or if, manager and player can sort out what has been going wrong and find a way to fix it \u2013 and the player glowering on the bench, arms folded, collar turned high, did not give the impression that he had taken it well. Mourinho said it was not an issue that Costa did not take part in the warm-up and he might also have pointed out that another of his substitutes, Mikel John Obi, chose not to go out. It was strange, though, that when Costa did appear from the tunnel he was not even wearing his boots. He barely went through the motions when he was asked to warm up and when it became obvious he would not be playing a single minute he returned to his seat, pulled his bib over his head and tossed it over his shoulder, landing not a great distance from Mourinho\u2019s seat. \u201cIf he wants to hurt me, it\u2019s not with a bib,\u201d a smiling Mourinho said afterwards, adding that he was \u201cnot expecting a player to be on the bench jumping and singing\u201d. A difficult day for Costa was completed by Mourinho\u2019s eulogy about how well the team had played without a natural front-man. Tottenham had a more conventional formation with Christian Eriksen and Son Heung-min operating either side of Harry Kane. They started off as the more dangerous team but their passing was disappointing and it was tempting to think Thursday\u2019s trip to Azerbaijan to play Qarabag in the Europa League had dulled their senses. The home side tailed off badly in the second half and did not move the ball well enough to get behind the visitors\u2019 defence. \u201cMy players are heroes,\u201d Pochettino countered. \u201cTheir effort was unbelievable after a difficult week.\u201d Spurs must have been grateful it was Hazard, rather than Costa, with the headed opportunity to open the scoring but they also had a similar chance in the first half when Kane\u2019s right-wing cross deserved better than Son tamely heading the ball straight at Asmir Begovic. After that, however, there was not a great deal for Chelsea\u2019s goalkeeper to do and Pochettino, as he is sometimes inclined, was stretching the truth when he said his side deserved more than a draw.

The Thirty Meter Telescope: should another astronomical telescope be built atop Mauna Kea, the mountain that some Hawaiians consider sacred? Proponents say yes, because the $1.4 billion Thirty Meter Telescope project will bring jobs, help diversify the economy, provide more than $50 million for education of this island\u2019s children during the course of the contract and advance science. Opponents say none of that matters, because Mauna Kea, which they point out has already been desecrated with other telescopes and the waste and damage they have already been creating, is a sacred realm and a temple to the Hawaiian people, and is absolutely not for sale at any price.

Celebrate hula dance and song. Hilo is home to the annual Merrie Monarch Festival, a week-long hula event that honours the 19th-century Merrie Monarch, King David Kalakaua. He is credited with encouraging the perpetuation of hula and other traditional ways when they were in danger of being lost. While visitors are always welcome at the Merrie Monarch \u2013 if they can get tickets, which usually sell out the first day they go on sale \u2013 the festival is not geared toward tourists.

We state it on every form we fill out. We mark it with pronouns, names, clothing, and hairstyle. It\u2019s the first thing we register about a person. Sex categories \u2013 whether you have female or male genitals \u2013 are fundamental for reproduction. They are also the principal way we carve up the social world. No surprise then that scientists and the general public alike often assume that sex categories are no less essential to how we think, feel, and behave, taking it for granted that there are female and male natures subserved by a \u201cfemale brain\u201d and a \u201cmale brain\u201d, respectively.  But research published yesterday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), led by one of us (Daphna Joel), puts another nail in the coffin of this persistent view.  The research was inspired by a study with rats by Tracey Shors and colleagues, published in the Journal of Neuroscience. She found that just fifteen minutes of stress can change the \u201csex\u201d of some features of the brain from the \u201cmale\u201d to \u201cfemale\u201d form, or from the \u201cfemale\u201d to \u201cmale\u201d form. From this and dozens of similar studies \u2013 involving different experiences and brain features \u2013 two important principles emerged.    Related: Men are from Mars, women are from Venus? New brain study says not    First, a brain feature that is typical in females in one condition (a stress experience, say) may be what is typical in males under other conditions, and vice versa. And second, these interactions between sex and environment may be different for different brain features, cells, and regions. For example, lab rats that have enjoyed a peaceful, stress-free life show a sex difference in the density of the \u2018top end\u2019 dendritic spines (these transmit electrical signals to the neuron cell body) in one region of the hippocampus. (The female dendritic spines are denser.) But look at the same brain region in a group of rats who have been stressed for just fifteen minutes, and now the dendritic spines of the male rats are bushy, like those of unstressed female rats. Conversely, the \u201ctop end\u201d dendritic spines of stressed female rats become less dense, like those of unstressed male rats. In other words, brief stress exposure reverses the \u201csex difference\u201d for that particular brain characteristic. However, this same brief stress has a different effect on the \u201cbottom end\u201d dendrites of these same neurons. Here, male and female dendritic spines are identical, so long as those rats have lived a stress-free life. But what happens if the rats are stressed? There\u2019s no effect on \u201cbottom end\u201d dendritic spines in females, but their density increases in males, resulting in a sex difference. Imagine, then, these sex-by-environment interactions affecting many different features of every brain, from utero onwards. With each experience, some brain features change their form, others do not, giving rise to unique combinations of forms. Not a \u201cmale brain\u201d, or a \u201cfemale brain\u201d, but a shifting \u201cmosaic\u201d of features, some more common in females compared to males, some more common in males compared to females, and some common in both.  This is exactly what the new study found for the first time, with colleagues from Tel Aviv University, the Max Planck Institute, and the University of Zurich. They tested this prediction by analyzing magnetic resonance images, which directly capture structural properties of the brain, from more than 1,400 human brains from four large data-sets. They identified in each data set the regions showing the largest differences between women and men. Next, they defined a \u201cmale-end\u201d (males more prevalent than females) zone and a \u201cfemale-end\u201d (females more prevalent than males) zone for each of these regions, based on the range of scores of the most extreme third of men and women, respectively. They found that between 23% and 53% of individuals (depending on the sample) had brains with both \u201cmale-end\u201d and \u201cfemale-end\u201d features. In contrast, the percentage of people with only \u201cfemale-end\u201d or only \u201cmale-end\u201d brain features was small, ranging from zero to 8%. Where this differs to past research is that it looks for the first time at whether or not sex differences \u201cadd up\u201d in a consistent way. While future studies should investigate whether there is internal consistency in additional types of data, such as histological measures, this study of structural sex differences found that these do not combine consistently to create two categories of brains or a male-female continuum of brains.   Related: Brain development in children could be affected by poverty, study shows    So what is a \u201cfemale brain\u201d or a \u201cmale brain\u201d? Is a \u201cfemale brain\u201d the type of brain possessed by the very few individuals with consistently \u201cfemale-end\u201d brain characteristics - some of whom, by the way, are men? And if so, what kind of a brain do the majority of females have?  That brains don\u2019t come in two forms fits with what we know about gendered behaviour. With academics and commentators often arguing over the origins and size of sex differences, an important observation by psychologist Janet Spence is often overlooked. This is that correlations between \u201cmasculine\u201d traits are weak or non-existent; so too for \u201cfeminine\u201d traits . Having one doesn\u2019t imply you have another. For example, being gentle doesn\u2019t imply that one is also dependent. So do sex differences \u201cadd up\u201d in a consistent way to create two types of humans, or, like the brain, create \u201cmosaics\u201d of personality traits, attitudes, interests, and behaviours, some more common in males, others more common in females? The new PNAS study investigated this in over 5500 youth from three datasets. Most differences between females and males are small, but this study looked only at the largest differences (for example, worries about weight was the personal attribute showing the largest difference, with about 80% chance of correctly guessing someone\u2019s sex on the basis of being above or below average concern; while for sex-stereotyped activities, the largest difference was in the use of cosmetics, for which the chance of guessing sex on the basis of their use was above 90%). Even looking only at such behaviours, between 55% and 70% of people had a \u201cmosaic\u201d of gender characteristics, compared to less than one per cent who had only \u201cmasculine\u201d or only \u201cfeminine\u201d characteristics.  This makes the notion of female and male natures as unintelligible as that of female and male brains. Which of the many mosaics that males display should be considered the male nature? Is it a profile of pure masculinity that appears to barely exist in reality? Or is it time to let go of binary thinking and celebrate the fact that there are many different ways to be male, to be female, to be human? We can see social issues more clearly when we stop viewing them through the distorting lens of sex categories, and start fully appreciating human variability and diversity.

He gets us far closer than we have ever been to the act of alchemy by which a shy and slightly creepy Oxford don turned a pert little girl into an enduring heroine of children\u2019s literature. Parti cularly delicate is the way Douglas-Fairhurst deals clear-sightedly with the vexed business of Lewis Carroll\u2019s sexuality without spoiling the lingering enchantment of getting lost in Wonderland. Oxford also looms large in John Aubrey: My Own Life (Chatto &amp; Windus), Ruth Scurr\u2019s inventive account of the 17th-century antiquarian who, as the author of Brief Lives, has a good claim to be the first great biographer in the English language. Having been forced to abandon his alma mater during the civil war, Aubrey spent the rest of his life jotting down the kind of gossipy, scandalous biographical fragments that only circulate around high table after much port has been taken. In an act of daring ventriloquism, Scurr here tells Aubrey\u2019s life story in his own words, stitched together from his scattered manuscripts. The result is a triumph of historical imagination, as vivid and endearing as its subject\u2019s own. In Threads (Jonathan Cape), Julia Blackburn sets out to write the life of John Craske, a Norfolk fisherman who painted, and then embroidered, scenes of the sea that enchanted the chattering classes of the interwar period, who liked nothing more than discovering genius in a cottage. In this meandering \u2013 in the best sense \u2013 quest narrative, Blackburn goes in search of the hard facts of the fisherman-artist\u2019s life. She doesn\u2019t exactly find them, but then it might have been disappointing if she had. Outsider art requires outsider biography, and Blackburn, an expert in finding new forms to fit odd lives, has managed her task magnificently. Another outsider who has attracted a supremely skilled biography this year is Francis Barber, the Jamaican slave who became valet to Samuel Johnson. Michael Bundock\u2019s rigorously researched and judiciously told The Fortunes of Francis Barber (Yale) is a model of how to use one apparently insignificant life to break open a historical moment that could otherwise be approached only through official documents. Barber\u2019s extraordinary and varied career \u2013 he was, by turns, a British schoolboy, an able seaman, a bookseller and a schoolmaster, as well as Johnson\u2019s majordomo \u2013 allows Bundock to explore what life felt like for a black man in Georgian England. Barber attracted prejudice, but also a fair degree of kindness, not least from Johnson himself. Shakespeare might hardly seem to need another biography, but James Shapiro\u2019s 1606: William Shakespeare and the Year of Lear (Faber) is so much more than that. Using the same methodology that he brought to 1599, his masterpiece of 10 years ago, Shapiro digs deep into the social and political context that gave rise to Shakespeare\u2019s greatest late work. There is terror on the streets, thanks to the failed gunpowder plot and to an outbreak of plague, while at the Jacobean court politics is, as ever, rotten to the core. In masterly detail Shapiro shows how this simmering paranoia fed into every line of King Lear. Meanwhile, for an equally fine-grained account of living with Shakespeare, try Antony Sher\u2019s Year of the Fat Knight (Nick Hern). Like Shapiro, Sher has returned to a format that did well for him before. But whereas Year of the King (1985) dealt with his transformation into the \u201cbottled spider\u201d that is Richard III, here Sher offers an account of playing Falstaff in the RSC\u2019s recent production of Henry IV Parts I and II. In his earlier book, the thirtysomething actor wrestled with becoming evil, here the older Sher takes us through the process of becoming fat and ridiculous. His text, organised as a diary, is supplemented by his own paintings and sketches. Mohamedou Ould Slahi\u2019s Guant\u00e1namo Diary (Canongate) is almost unbearable to read, which is why it\u2019s so important that we do. Slahi, who has never been charged with any crime, has been unlawfully held in Guant\u00e1namo for the past dozen years. Teaching himself English by listening to his interrogators on the sly, he has written a shattering account of what it\u2019s like to spend more than a decade in hell. Chronic deprivation is punctuated by sessions of physical and psychological torture to the point where you wonder how Slahi could bear to stay alive. Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that, little by little, he also witnesses acts of humanity. Guards become friends with inmates while interrogators let slip their own doubts about what they are doing. It is in these moments that you begin to think there may be hope for Slahi and the remaining Guant\u00e1namo internees, although it will surely require a sharp shove from the outside world. The personal essays in Etgar Keret\u2019s The Seven Good Years (Granta) may seem slight \u2013 many of them are only a few pages long \u2013 but they are packed with good things. Brisk, funny, sad and sharp, Keret\u2019s bulletins from middle-class life in Tel Aviv mix rocket attacks with babygrows, nightmares about the former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with a particularly irritating telemarketer. The \u201cseven years\u201d of the title is not just a biblical reference, but covers the time during which Keret became a father to a son while also dealing with the decline and death of his own parent, a Holocaust survivor. This is tragi-comedy done with an elegant touch. Maggie Nelson\u2019s The Argonauts (Greywolf) takes the whole debate around transgender people and makes it into searing art. In telling the story of her marriage to the fluidly gendered film-maker Harry Dodge, Nelson meditates on the point, or pointlessness, of chopping up the world into male and female. While Dodge is receiving testosterone injections and a double mastectomy, Nelson is undergoing IVF and getting pregnant. As their two bodies swell and soften, harden and contract, Nelson interrogates the borders of language, law and custom that have been set up to keep them in their place. This makes the Argonauts sound heavy going, but it is also scabrous, tender and \u2013 perhaps an odd word to use \u2013 essential. Finally, if you want a more sequined version of gender at play, you could do worse than Paul O\u2019Grady\u2019s Open the Cage, Murphy (Bantam). In this, the fourth instalment of his memoirs, O\u2019Grady takes his alter ego Lily Savage from Butlins in Skegness to partying alongside (not exactly with) Madonna. There\u2019s a degree of candour and artistry to O\u2019Grady\u2019s writing that lifts it far above the usual slack demands of showbiz memoir.

He lived in one room on his Israeli army pension, paid on the condition that he would never say anything about his secret work. His lawyer Michael Sfard explained that Klingberg navigated the 20th-century\u2019s tumultuous events \u201cwith a certain dangerous pretence of controlling history rather than being controlled by it\u201d. Yet Klingberg was far from the popular image of a cold war spy, barely 5ft tall, with a bald, outsized head, finely rimmed spectacles and a trace of a goatee, all perched on a slender frame. He was dubbed a \u201cmaster spy\u201d by many in the media because he had recruited first his wife, Wanda (nee Yashinskaya), also a Polish Jew who survived the Warsaw ghetto, and, second, a scientist friend and colleague at Ness Ziona. He arranged meetings with his KGB minder \u201cVictor\u201d by drawing coded signs in chalk on concrete walls in Tel Aviv, learned the spycraft essentials of invisible ink and miniature cameras, although he never put them to any use, and divulged his secrets over vodka and caviar in the backroom of a Russian Orthodox church. He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour, the Soviet Union\u2019s second rank decoration after the Order of Lenin. Why did he agree to spy for Moscow? In 2007, he published his biography in Hebrew, The Last Spy, written with Sfard. He wrote that, like some of the leading scientists who worked on the American atom bomb, he believed the secrets and the power of weapons of mass destruction should be shared. Then both sides would be less likely to use them and more likely to ban them. But he also had his personal reason. He felt that he owed the Russians a debt for, as he put it, saving the world against the Nazis. \u201cI am and always was a communist,\u201d he told me when we met in 2013. Moscow never paid him a penny, he said. Israel\u2019s security services objected vigorously to his release, saying he was still a security risk, and producing in court the secretive, and legally unassailable, assertion that he \u201cknew things that he did not know that he knew\u201d. While he was spying for Moscow, he also became an internationally known epidemiologist and published numerous scientific papers. He was especially concerned with the potential birth defects caused by modern chemical concoctions, including the drug thalidomide and dioxins. He endeared himself to some of his fellow epidemiologists. Iain Chalmers, the British health services researcher, who met Klingberg before he was arrested, never knew about his espionage, renewed the friendship after Klingberg was released from prison, and was amazed that he had survived. Chalmers recalled: \u201cHe was always charming, full of jokes and good humour.\u201d Klingberg told me he used to pass the time in prison setting himself epidemiological puzzles and solving them. On his 95th birthday, Sylvia invited friends (including me, as I was writing his story for the Observer) to a Paris bistro on the Left Bank. After the cake, topped by a sparkler, and a chorus of For He\u2019s a Jolly Good Fellow, Avigdor Feldman, also Klingberg\u2019s lawyer, leaned across the dinner table. \u201cCome on, Marek [his preferred Polish version of Marcus]. What is it that you know that you don\u2019t know that you know? Tell us.\u201d Klingberg smiled and shook his head. Wanda died in 1990. He is survived by Sylvia, and a grandson, Ian, a member of the French Communist party, and an elected member of the Council of Paris. \u2022 Marcus Klingberg, epidemiologist and spy, born 7 October 1918; died 30 November 2015", "publicationDate": "2015-12-03T16:45:05Z", "title": "Marcus Klingberg obituary", "sentences": ["He arranged meetings with his KGB minder \u201cVictor\u201d by drawing coded signs in chalk on concrete walls in Tel Aviv, learned the spycraft essentials of invisible ink and miniature cameras, although he never put them to any use, and divulged his secrets over vodka and caviar in the backroom of a Russian Orthodox church."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/03/marcus-klingberg"}, {"tags": ["Republicans", "Sheldon Adelson", "US news", "US politics", "US elections 2016", "Ted Cruz", "Marco Rubio"], "article": "Republican presidential candidates were supposed to be competing for the endorsement of mega-donor Sheldon Adelson on Thursday. Instead, it seemed as if each was vying to give the most surreal performance at a forum held by the Republican Jewish Coalition in Washington DC. In front of the crowd of influential GOP powerbrokers and donors who are members of the RJC, bizarre moments repeatedly popped up as the two frontrunners in the race, Donald Trump and Ben Carson, both demonstrated their lack of knowledge of foreign policy in startling and astonishing ways. Closely tied to Adelson \u2013 the mega-donor and casino magnate who single-handedly kept Newt Gingrich\u2019s 2012 bid for the White House alive \u2013 the RJC has long attracted presidential hopefuls. The group focuses on promoting a hawkish foreign policy \u2013 it strenuously opposed the nuclear deal with Iran \u2013 and most candidates attending typically harp on these themes. Instead, Trump told borderline antisemitic jokes and Carson gave a monotone history lesson on the Middle East.  Trump repeatedly referenced stereotypes of Jewish business acumen and wealth in his speech. He told attendees \u201cYou\u2019re not going to support me because I don\u2019t want your money\u201d while suggesting they wanted to control politicians. Trump also asked the audience: \u201cIs there anyone who doesn\u2019t renegotiate deals in this room? Perhaps more than in any room I have ever spoken.\u201d He also compared himself to Elton John and said: \u201cI was the grand marshal of the Israel Day Parade at a very dangerous time.\u201d He presided over that parade in New York City in 2004. The one time that Trump discussed policy he was booed by the audience, when he dodged a question about whether Jerusalem should be the undivided capital of Israel.  For his part, Carson read a scripted speech in a quiet monotone. The retired neurosurgeon has long drawn questions about whether he has sufficient foreign policy experience to serve in the White House and recently took a trip to Jordan to burnish his credentials on the topic. In his speech, Carson repeatedly mispronounced the name of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, calling it \u201chummus\u201d on several occasions as he seemed to give a basic history lesson of the Middle East, reciting every war in the region since 1947. He also repeatedly cited truisms, such as: \u201cThere is a geographic challenge in trying to unite Gaza and the West Bank.\u201d The two are 25 miles apart. Among the establishment Republicans, Ohio governor John Kasich proclaimed that his mother told him as a child: \u201cIf you want a really good friend, find somebody who is Jewish.\u201d Even the gaffe-free speeches prompted raised eyebrows. South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham ignored foreign policy almost entirely and instead lit into Ted Cruz and Trump on abortion and immigration reform in a remarkable, rambling and somewhat unconventional speech. A well-known hawk who has ardently supported Israel and joked that he didn\u2019t need to even mention the issue, Graham told attendees: \u201cAnyone can beat Hillary Clinton as long as they are right on two things: on immigration and sensible on social issues.\u201d     Lindsey Graham speaks at the Republican Jewish Coalition Presidential Forum in Washington on Thursday. Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP    The South Carolina senator, who has been languishing at the back of the pack, went out of his way to target Cruz\u2019s claim that he could build a winning general election coalition centered around the Republican base. Graham mocked the idea and focused on the need to attract Hispanics to the GOP. He asked the predominantly Jewish crowd about the idea of rounding up illegal immigrants: \u201cDoes that sound familiar to you?\u201d Graham also said Cruz was unelectable in a general election because he was opposed to allowing victims of rape or incest to seek abortions. The South Carolina Republican said his party would not win a general election if the nominee did not support a rape and incest exception. Rand Paul abruptly cancelled his scheduled appearance due to votes in the Senate. The cancellation raised eyebrows among some at the group as the Kentucky Republican has long been viewed skeptically by pro-Israel advocates because of his relatively isolationist views. One person close to the RJC wondered aloud to the Guardian whether his absence was a deliberate snub. A few candidates did focus on foreign policy. Chris Christie gave an impassioned speech recalling 9/11 and suggested that in light of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, \u201clet\u2019s remember if a center for the developmentally disabled in San Bernardino can be a target for a terrorist attack then every place in America is a target for a terrorist attack\u201d. His warnings were echoed by Jeb Bush, who suggested the Obama administration was soft on terrorism and also got applause by saying on Israel policy, he relies most on his brother, former president George W Bush, for advice. But the most well-attended speeches came in the morning from Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, two candidates rapidly rising in the polls. Both sounded similar notes as ardent supporters of Israel. In a fiery oration on Thursday, Cruz reiterated promises from his stump speech including his pledge to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  However, he also made more detailed and nuanced proposals specifically to appeal to attendees. In particular, the Texas senator pledged that if elected, \u201cany university that supports the BDS movement will find federal funds stripped away\u201d.  BDS, which stands for Boycott, Divest, Sanction, is a movement that has become a major concern of Adelson and other pro-Israel advocates who consider the group to be antisemitic.     Billionaire and Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson in 2011. Photograph: Wong Maye-E/AP    He also raised the specter that the mass shooting in San Bernardino on Wednesday was Islamic terrorism. Cruz told attendees: \u201cAll of us are deeply concerned that this is yet another manifestation of terrorism, radical Islamic terrorism at home. Coming in the wake of terrorist attack at Paris, this horrific murder underscores that we are at a time of war.\u201d Rubio echoed Cruz\u2019s hawkishness in a tough address that condemned efforts by the European Union to label goods from what the Florida senator said come from \u201cwhat the EU considers \u2018Israeli-occupied territories\u2019\u201d.  Rubio warned darkly that \u201cdiscriminatory laws that apply only to Jews are now being written into European law for the first time in more than half a century\u201d. The Florida senator went on to say: \u201cI believe we need a president who is not afraid to call this out for what it is: antisemitism.\u201d Rubio also echoed Cruz\u2019s condemnation of the BDS movement and said \u201cit reeks of hypocrisy\u201d.  On Middle East policy, Rubio made clear he would be a firm ally of Israel as well. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between Israel and those who seek to destroy her,\u201d he told attendees. In his view, the peace process was \u201cnot a real estate deal with two sides arguing over money. It\u2019s a struggle to safeguard the future of Israel.\u201d However, Rubio and Cruz disagreed on Syria and the future of the Assad regime. Rubio targeted Cruz for saying he would be comfortable leaving Assad in power as the least of all evils in Syria. The Florida senator said: \u201cThis simplistic notion that \u2018leave Assad there because he\u2019s a brutal killer, but he\u2019s not as bad as what\u2019s going to follow him\u2019 is a fundamental and simplistic and dangerous misunderstanding of the reality of the region.\u201d It\u2019s unclear though how much the actual debate about policy between the two senators stood out from the political carnival surrounding them.", "publicationDate": "2015-12-03T17:19:39Z", "title": "Bizarre gaffes abound as Republicans speak at conservative Jewish forum", "sentences": ["In a fiery oration on Thursday, Cruz reiterated promises from his stump speech including his pledge to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/03/republicans-sheldon-adelson-speeches-republican-jewish-coalition"}, {"tags": ["Gender", "Neuroscience", "Women", "Feminism", "Science", "Life and style", "World news"], "article": "A study led by Daphna Joel at Tel Aviv university has shown that there\u2019s really not much in the way of difference between male brains and female brains. There are features that are more prevalent in the brains of women and features that are more prevalent in the brains of men. But human brains tend to have a highly individual mix of such characteristics. Interestingly, while hardly anyone has anything like the full set of mostly male features or the full set of mostly female features, by no means everyone with a significant collection of \u201cfemale end\u201d features is female, and vice versa. What\u2019s more, many of these characteristics aren\u2019t fixed. Environment and experience also play their part in shaping the brain, increasing its individuality.   Related: Men are from Mars, women are from Venus? New brain study says not    For me, the most astonishing thing about all this is the way that humans nevertheless generally resist the idea of such total individuality. People \u2013 girls and boys, women and men \u2013 are attracted to the idea that they are part of a group of like-minded others, and different to a group that are not like-minded. Whether it\u2019s class, family, tribe, nation, religion, the football team you support, the political views you hold, the music you prefer dancing to, or the sort of clothes you wear, it\u2019s all about sharing your values with some, and feeling, at best, a bit sorry for those less discerning than you, at worst utterly murderous towards them. Making a big deal out of biological gender is maybe just the most basic way we have of saying: \u201cYou\u2019re like me. And you\u2019re not.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s a bit scary for human beings, the idea (which is fast beginning to look like scientific fact) that there really is hardly another soul on Earth who is quite like them. It\u2019s one of these things that everyone knows, but largely resists thinking about. We may like the idea of individuality, but we are afraid of loneliness. When two men met their doppelganger on an aeroplane recently, amazement was expressed. Parents often declare their astonishment that the various children they had together could be so different. We understand that humans are highly individual, but we generalise about people, and what they need and want, all the time. The findings of this research will not surprise feminists, who have long argued that gender is a complex socially conditioned performance that seeks to create inherent-seeming differences in the characters of men and women, where none exist. Yet feminism itself, of course, seeks to assemble a group of like minds, sometimes even preferring to gather those like minds in safe spaces, free from the outbursts of wrong-minded heretics. It\u2019s all very difficult. Nevertheless, this research confirms something else that feminists often argue, which is that gender discrimination suits men no more than it suits women. It\u2019s dreadful to think of all the girls and women who continue to be denied an education because of their gender, or because they believe it\u2019s not what girls should want. (It is rather heartening, though, that many hundreds of years of such discrimination do not seem to have diminished our brainpower one jot.) But it\u2019s dreadful, too, to think of all the boys and men who continue to be conscripted into war because of their gender, whether by a state or because they themselves believe that that\u2019s what men should do. It\u2019s notable, of course, that the fundamentalist group that worries the world most at the moment, Islamic State, seeks both to deny education to women and glorify war for men. It seeks also to eradicate individuality, by lionising those who are prepared to eradicate themselves as long as they can kill others in the process. I suppose Isis\u2019s obsession with \u201cothering\u201d can be seen as a consequence of its members feeling that, as Muslims, they are \u201cothered\u201d themselves. It\u2019s how they justify their cruelty to themselves anyway, and how they recruit.   Related: In defence of intersectionality \u2013 one of feminism's most important tools | Eleanor Robertson    It\u2019s easy to feel despondent about the state of the world. But there are times when I feel very hopeful, and choose to see human anger and violence as a rearguard action against a growing understanding that our strength lies in our diversity, and that our diversity can only be accommodated if everyone gets to have their say and be heard, and everybody gets to use their own unique brain as well as they can use it. That\u2019s why, in feminism, the idea of intersectionality is so important. It helps people to focus on difference rather than similarity, to understand that a marginal issue for one person is an important issue for another, to understand that something one person takes for granted is something another person can\u2019t allow themselves even to dream of. A feminism that claims to speak for all women speaks only for the voices who dominate. Women, their brains, their environments, their experiences, are as broad as humanity. A powerful woman can damage a vulnerable woman as casually as a chauvinistic man can. It\u2019s true that intersectional feminism can be as self-righteous as any other intellectual framework, and as gleeful about hunting out and berating \u201cthe other\u201d. But that\u2019s just how people are. Perhaps fully acknowledging and understanding how people are is the first giant step towards changing it.

There was his \u201cno way, I\u2019m tired of them\u201d quip when asked whether he might enjoy a celebratory night out with his coaching staff before the festive season, and the suggestion his players were all under the thumb at home, ensuring none would ever have had the gall to stay out until 6am after their end-of-year bonding session in central London in midweek. If those comments were off the cuff, he spent a little longer mulling over the potential identity of the former player he would like to see replace Gary Neville as a pundit \u2013 a dirty word at Stamford Bridge for much of this campaign \u2013 at Sky Sports. There was a muttered expletive, a shake of the head and admission he was properly stumped, then a response. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, huh? Wait. Dennis Wise.\u201d The lack of an expert in the television studio with a Chelsea affiliation has been a common complaint, though the manager will hope the on-screen analysts have no real reason to be critical from now on. The champions are seeking to maintain a much-needed upturn.   Related: Chelsea v Bournemouth: match preview    Theirs has been a restorative fortnight since the international window. If the victories over Norwich City and a feeble Maccabi Tel Aviv did not automatically scream revival, then there was more encouragement gained from arguably their most impressive display to date, at Tottenham Hotspur last Sunday. Eden Hazard was sprightly and menacing. The defence, even without John Terry and Thibaut Courtois, mustered a similar air of authority to that of last season. Nemanja Matic was imposing despite sustaining a double fracture, of nose and cheek, which means he must sport a mask for the foreseeable future. Throw in the contributions of Oscar, Willian and Pedro Rodr\u00edguez and this team were suddenly more recognisable. It was only a point, of course, played out to the brooding dissatisfaction of Diego Costa from the sidelines. But, in the context of so much that preceded it, Mourinho had cause for optimism. Chelsea did win three successive games in September \u2013 against the dubious might of Maccabi, Walsall and an Arsenal side reduced to nine men \u2013 but this is their first proper spell of discernible form. \u201cWe weren\u2019t playing very, very well in those games, and the Arsenal performance was isolated,\u201d said the manager. \u201cThis time, after playing well at Stoke even in defeat, we\u2019ve had solid performances and good results back to back. \u201cThree clean sheets, and good clean sheets too, not lucky ones: good discipline, communication, reading of the game. At Spurs we could have played a couple more hours and not conceded because we were so much in control against one of the best teams in the Premier League. We can build from that. If we can get a result against Bournemouth it\u2019ll be four good matches in a row. And it\u2019s been a long time since we managed that.\u201d The sense of relief was clear, and the urgent desire to maintain the improvement just as obvious. Mourinho\u2019s motivational game of carrot and stick has gone full circle, in terms of granting his players their night out and in attempting to maintain Hazard\u2019s revival. The Belgian has been indulged, publicly criticised, selected in his favoured playmaker role after a training ground heart-to-heart and dropped, all in the past two months. Now, having seen the player of the year excel as a makeshift centre-forward at White Hart Lane, it is carrot time again. This week the coaching staff provided Hazard with a hard copy dossier detailing his performance data from the draw at Spurs. \u201cThat was unusual, to provide written feedback,\u201d said Mourinho. \u201cIt had everything in it: my own assessment; my vision for him; numbers, figures, stats, graphics on every aspect of his game. \u201cHe knows how good he was, but his performance was so impressive that he needs that extra feedback to know his efforts were recognised by myself. Hopefully he can build on it now. With that attitude and dynamic, playing with the ball and attacking opponents, he can be a No9 or a No10, a No7 or a No11. The good is coming. The Premier League is crucial for us, and every point is important given our start because we want to finish top four. Then there is the Champions League, too, where we want to progress. He knows how much we need him.\u201d An eagerness to lean on Hazard is understandable but Mourinho and Chelsea need Costa just as keenly. This team\u2019s approach remains built around the Spain international as their forward focal point, despite a return of seven goals since January and some desperately sluggish and bad-tempered performances of late. Perhaps the demotion to the substitutes\u2019 bench at Tottenham will have provided a gee-up. If the bib tossing is anything to go by, it infuriated him. Maybe Bournemouth, saddled with the joint-worst defence in the division, will suffer the backlash. What is clear is that, up to now at least, Costa has been treated rather differently to many of his club-mates. There has been more leeway granted and, to a certain extent, he has been indulged. That is partly down to a lack of an obvious alternative in his position. Radamel Falcao is still injured and has offered no indications that he can excel in this team, and Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my is a very different kind of centre-forward. But, up until Sunday, Costa\u2019s indifferent form had been played out in front of the watching world whenever he was available, with each selection an opportunity to click into gear. There had been no internal sanction, either, when he returned for pre-season training overweight. \u201cHe didn\u2019t need to admit that publicly, you only had to look at the pictures,\u201d said Mourinho. \u201cNo, no disciplining him. We don\u2019t work that way. We tried to recover from the mistake and establish programmes to get him back into physical condition. He did that with [the fitness coach] Carlos Lalin in the gym and was working in terms of controlling his food, also, with relation to weight. He was pushing himself really hard and now, physically, he is back where he should be.\u201d There were training sessions, too, with the former IBF, British, Commonwealth and European middleweight champion Darren Barker. Now the management are working on the striker\u2019s state of mind. They have observed improvement in terms of his integration into the group this year, pointing to the fact he mixes with the players more readily these days where, last year, Mourinho said, \u201che belonged to a small group of Brazilian and Spanish guys\u201d. \u201cHe always trains very well,\u201d said Mourinho. \u201cIt\u2019s out on the pitch where he\u2019s not being so sharp. He\u2019s not being decisive or having the same influence in consecutive matches as last season.\u201d Is he considered a special case? \u201cI would say a bit, but not much. Just a bit in a few details. But, in the end, the rules are the rules. Commitments are commitments. He\u2019s the same as everyone. On Friday we meet to go to the hotel at 7.30pm. He cannot report at 7.45pm just because he\u2019s Diego. He has to be the same.\u201d He will gather for the pre-match team meeting on Saturday hoping to hear confirmation of a speedy recall to the starting XI as the champions seek to build on their most promising form of the campaign.

Related: Borussia Dortmund beat Wolfsburg to close gap at the top in Germany    \u201cI don\u2019t think we are able to win the Champions League now,\u201d he says, meaning 18 months into his Old Trafford tenure, not now that United have left themselves a mountain to climb in Group B. \u201cMaybe next year, when we strengthen our selection again. We think we are capable of beating anyone on our day but you have to be realistic also. We are not good enough to win the Champions League at this time.\u201d Few would disagree, actually. It is just unusual to hear a manager, especially a Manchester United manager, admitting there are limits to what might be possible. The way United have been playing of late, with Van Gaal himself damning his side with faint praise by claiming they have become hard to beat, it seems perfectly obvious that at least two of the manager\u2019s old clubs, not to mention a few other big names around Europe, will be strong favourites to go further once the knockout action starts. That is assuming United can even reach the knockout stage, which is far from a given, though on that front at least Van Gaal is confident a satisfactory result can be achieved. \u201cYes, we can win on Tuesday because we have already beaten them at home,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that Wolfsburg shall not attack too much because with a draw they continue and we are dependant on PSV, but I think we can always score goals. That might seem a little strange because we have not been scoring many goals, but every match we create chances, more in the European games than in the Premier League, I believe, so I think we can always score.\u201d In that case, it might have been better to score at home in the last round. Van Gaal said after the goalless draw with PSV that the best chance to secure qualification had been lost, and he still had the services of Wayne Rooney at that point. The United captain is rated doubtful for the Wolfsburg game with an ankle injury, and while that does not necessarily reduce the potency of the attack any more, it does rob the side of a wealth of experience. Van Gaal\u2019s frontrunners at the Volkswagen Arena are likely to be some or all of Anthony Martial, Memphis Depay and Jesse Lingard, so it is as well that United can call on the expertise (and German knowledge) of Bastian Schweinsteiger to back that callow trio. Schweinsteiger has even been getting on the scoresheet in recent weeks, and Van Gaal still thinks he can produce more. \u201cThe reason we bought Schweinsteiger is because he is a player who can lead and guide a team,\u201d the manager says. \u201cHis football qualities are important, but so is his leadership. He has been doing well for us but he can still play better. Until now we haven\u2019t seen the best of Schweinsteiger, we haven\u2019t seen the player I had at Bayern Munich.\u201d No, but it is possible Bayern Munich thought they might not see much more of that player either. It is more than four years since Van Gaal left the club and Schweinsteiger is now in his thirties, though in fairness after a few heavy-legged displays in early season he looked more like his old self at Leicester last Saturday, when he scored. While Schweinsteiger could be an important asset in Germany, Van Gaal\u2019s assertion that Wolfsburg will play for a draw appears more questionable. A draw would not be enough for United should PSV beat CSKA Moscow at home, which seems likely, given that the Russians have no further interest in the Champions League.   Related: If Louis van Gaal is a genius why are Manchester United so bland? | Daniel Taylor    While it is true that Moscow could qualify for the Europa League by beating PSV in Eindhoven, that is not motivation of the sort to base plans around. Van Gaal says he will have someone on the bench relating the score from Holland to him during the game, yet unless Moscow race to a three-goal lead inside the first half hour it is probably best to assume that PSV will win and United will have to do likewise. That combination of results would put Wolfsburg out, even though they presently top the group, which is another reason why the Germans might not be inclined to sit back and wait. The situation is somewhat similar in Chelsea\u2019s group, where the leaders could be overhauled by the two clubs below them should they lose their final game against Porto, though, whatever their struggles in the league this season, a side with such a strong European pedigree should not be unduly daunted by the prospect of having to gain at least a point at home. A win would guarantee top spot for Chelsea, a draw would make things complicated but could still leave them in second. Porto need a win to guarantee progress, as Dynamo Kyiv are likely to reach 11 points with a final game against the bottom club Maccabi Tel Aviv. Thankfully, things are more straightforward in the other two groups involving English teams. In Athens on Wednesday, Arsenal need to better or equal Olympiakos\u2019s 3-2 win at the Emirates to join Bayern Munich in the last 16, but it would not be an enormous surprise to see Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s side manage it. Manchester City have already qualified, though their hopes of topping the group and avoiding the seeded clubs in the next stages receded with a second defeat by Juventus. Only a Sevilla win against the leaders would allow City a route back to the top. That seems unlikely, indeed City beating Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach cannot be taken for granted, though the overall situation is a little rosier than at the start of the cycle when three of the four English clubs lost their opening games. There might be a casualty this week, with United looking most precarious, but two if not three English teams should make the last 16.", "publicationDate": "2015-12-05T22:30:01Z", "title": "Louis van Gaal is mistaken if he thinks Wolfsburg will play for a draw | Paul Wilson", "sentences": ["Porto need a win to guarantee progress, as Dynamo Kyiv are likely to reach 11 points with a final game against the bottom club Maccabi Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/dec/05/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-wolfsburg-bastian-schweinsteiger"}, {"tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Philosophy"], "article": "There could not be a more propitious location for a meeting with Petite Meller than number 19 Berggasse in Vienna, home of the Sigmund Freud Museum and birthplace of modern psychoanalysis. It was on the second floor of this solemn, haute-bourgeois mansion block that the great man encouraged his patients to recall their dreams, and formed his theories about sex and the unconscious mind. Today the gift shop will sell you a printed mouse mat of his famous carpet-covered couch.    My weekend is study,\u00a0and I go to Lacanian seminars. I like to combine it with the music.  Petite Meller     The French-born singer Meller is one of the most arresting and divisive figures to emerge in pop music this year, a postgraduate philosophy student at the Sorbonne in Paris and the University of Tel Aviv, devotee of pigtails, white over-the-knee socks and high-cut swimwear, and purveyor of delirious Europop fused with the thoughts of Jacques Lacan. The night before we meet she was performing in Milan, and today she arrives 10 minutes late in a taxi with her British manager. The edges of her pink satin frock-coat betray the smudges of air travel, and behind the swash of blusher that she habitually wears from ear to ear \u2013 including nose \u2013 she looks a bit crumpled. Nonetheless she seems excited to be at the museum, which she has visited before, and clumps with alacrity up the stone stairs in velvet shoes with three-inch platform soles and heels that are closer to seven. When she enters Freud\u2019s consulting rooms, the hushed Sunday visitors with audio guides pressed to their ears flicker only momentarily as they catch a flash of Meller\u2019s thighs. While eye-catching outfits are certainly one reason for Meller\u2019s rapid ascent this year, pop music has seldom been short of female singers with a few revealing items in the wardrobe. It is a sequence of airily ecstatic sing-alongs and high-concept videos that has raised her above the melee, and above all the infectious summer anthem Baby Love, a riot of piano chords and all-round jubilation shot in Africa. As we creak our way across the Freudian floorboards, I attempt to tune in to her high, childlike voice as she points out items of interest in a strong Parisian accent given to sudden Americanisms. Despite the big shoes she is a foot below me, and I\u2019m at full stoop as she spots Freud\u2019s battered copy of Friedrich Schiller\u2019s 18th-century essays on the sublime, and begins an enthusiastic explanation of how they have inspired her to write hands-in-the-air gospel-house.         Petite Meller\u2019s video for Baby Love.    \u201cMy thesis is about the sublime and psychosis,\u201d she says. \u201cSchiller was the first to raise this term \u2018the sublime\u2019 \u2013 he wrote some poetry about this \u2013 and then Kant, who I\u2019m writing about. Kant was writing about the sublime of Schiller. The sublime is related to aesthetics and art \u2013 the transcendental. Kant says when you look at a drawing or a piece of art and enjoy it, you transcend your mind \u2013 you go beyond it to places\u2026 it expands your mind. It\u2019s like a joyful game.\u201d She points out a brass plate that shows Freud\u2019s opening hours \u2013 or, in fact, hour: \u201cHe only accepted patients between 3pm and 4pm,\u201d she says, with satisfaction. \u201cDo you know the association game that he played in his therapy? Each dream is like a puzzle. This is like the structure I use in my videos. I believe that somehow when you want something and you imagine it\u2026 it happens. The time before you go to sleep, and before you wake, is the time when you are really connected to the unconscious. I imagine my next video and it\u2019s so vivid that it really comes to life.\u201d Her melodies may be catchy, but it is through these pop videos that Meller\u2019s reputation - some might say notoriety - has grown. She works exclusively with directorial duo AT Mann and Napoleon Habeica, the latter a Mexican photographer whose provocative images have appeared in advertising campaigns for clothing brand American Apparel. A number of elements combine to give the films their highly individual stamp. Firstly there are Meller\u2019s witty visual ideas, with their Freudian allusions and flirtations with the unconscious. Then there is Habeica\u2019s sporadic indulgence of the male gaze, the kind of gusset fixation that has earned censure for American Apparel in the past. Music may play, but there is often little movement, each shot a fixed tableau like a page Habeica might have shot for a fashion magazine. At the centre is Meller, the mannequin. She and her female stylist Nao Koyabu devise her outfits; Balthus would have loved them. But this is perhaps to paint too lurid a picture. The videos are also hilarious, and have a generosity and joy that feels wholly innocent. In Baby Love giraffes put their heads through open windows and Kenyan schoolchildren dance as if they are having the time of their lives. In Barbaric the geriatric ranks of a Florida retirement home do the same. The casting is done by Meller herself, to a formula of considered spontaneity. \u201cI go to the location a week before we start shooting. I just love the coincidence of meeting the people at the right destiny that they should be in my videos. I never cast them before. I like to find them with eye contact. Coincidences are so strong.\u201d     Petite Meller outside the Freud Museum: \u2018I believe in unconscious thought\u2026 I go to the mic and just let it out.\u2019 Photograph: Island Records    \u201cHow I met my manager is coincidence,\u201d she continues, explaining how Stuart Clarke once arrived in the US from London and, confused about the time difference, typed \u2018NYC time\u2019 into Google and was offered the video for her song of that name. He got in touch and offered his services. \u201cYou tell the universe what you want, if you know what you want,\u201d she says. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t know what you want, it doesn\u2019t give you it. But exactly when I looked for a manager, he came. The guy who is with me in the NYC Time video I met on the way to a Yankees [baseball] game. I saw him on the subway and approached him. He was so excited to do the video and we are friends still now \u2013 he writes to me every day on Facebook.\u201d Meller has, it seems, an unlimited supply of similar stories from this world of fateful encounters. \u201cI had this scene in my mind of doing water-ski. Everyone said to me, you can\u2019t, you\u2019ll never know how to do it for the video [for 2013 song Backpack]. By coincidence I met someone that was my fan, and he\u2019s a teacher of water-ski. So I ask him, every weekend we met \u2013 it was on the French border of Switzerland \u2013 and he taught me. I discovered I\u2019m a natural in water-ski! Ha-ha. It\u2019s an amazing feeling because if you trust the driver, you can water-ski. If you think too much, you can\u2019t go up.\u201d While she is effusive is recounting these kind of tales, she resists attempts to anchor this world of Yankees games, Swiss watersports and Kenyan wildlife interludes in much hard biography. She lives in east London now, but was raised in Paris. Her parents \u2013 \u201cAre they academics?\u201d \u201cYes, kind of\u201d \u2013 left France to live in Israel, hence the connection with Tel Aviv university. She tells me she is one of two sisters, but shuts down questions about \u201cpersonal stuff\u201d, except when I ask her to describe her music, which she designates \u201cmy own genre \u2013 nouveau jazzy pop\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s jazz saxophone: I write the parts. House piano. Gospel. French chanson melodies, like my mum used to sing in the house. My mother is French and my father is Polish. Although I don\u2019t speak Polish, I speak a little bit of Yiddish. Then I have some African inspiration, like Fela Kuti and Paul Simon\u2019s Graceland. I do a little beatbox [makes horse clip-clopping sound with her tongue]. And use some bongos and congas. Then I go to a producer and say I like this, this, this: it\u2019s like a formula. So we have a basic thing. Then I go to the microphone, and I believe in unconscious thought, but I have to get inspiration before I try. I have to read, or see movies, to fill my mind with things, and then I go to the mic and just let it out. Sometimes you don\u2019t know what you sang about. And after a lot of time you understand.\u201d         Petite Meller\u2019s video for Barbaric.    We leave the Freud museum and adjourn to the cafe next door. She is booked to do a show later at the Arena Wien. I wonder how she juggles her studies with the itinerant life of the musician. \u201cI told my manager that I have to free my weekends,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it was becoming impossible and I soon have to hand in my thesis. So my weekend is study, and I go to Lacanian seminars \u2013 there are many places in London. Someone reads, and then you talk. I like to combine it with the music. I know it\u2019s unusual.\u201d So which is most important to her \u2013 success in showbiz or academia? She sips her glass of trocken for a while. \u201cI go a lot to libraries,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I sit there and I feel it\u2019s like heaven, because people are just in those books, all the people I admire, and they are just waiting for someone to open them, to exist again after life. That\u2019s what I think I want to be. I wanna have my book there that someone will open, just like I opened when I was a child in the library. That\u2019s the way you live for ever, no?\u201d    Quantum physics is many realities that exist at the same time. We still don\u2019t accept this theory, but I believe in it.  Petite Meller     It is hard to imagine a venue less suited to the Petite Meller aesthetic than the Arena Wien, not in fact an arena at all, but a collection of industrial sheds and former warehouses that contains four or five small stages. While a thrash metal band plays on one of them, Meller awaits her turn in a graffiti-covered dressing room, perching on a greasy armchair against a backdrop of Mot\u00f6rhead stickers. She is wearing a leotard that is cut high up towards her armpits, a large hat and purple leather gloves that end at her elbows. \u201cRat city riot\u201d, reads a daub above her head. The stage crew look embarrassed, but she seems perfectly happy. When she walks on stage, the crowd of 30 raise a non-committal cheer. Meller\u2019s all-black trio of backing musicians have been styled by Nao Koyabu and wear matching rollneck jumpers in a shade of taupe. They look a bit warm. Meller looks freezing. It\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve seen her live, and it\u2019s fair to say that stage performance is not her strong suit. The quirky panache of the videos is lost, and even the good tunes are just a blare. She climbs down from the stage to dance in the crowd, an ambitious move for any leotard-wearer, but then can\u2019t get back up, and scrabbles for what seems like a week. There is an electronic flute solo. I begin to wonder if Google-generated coincidence is really the best way to find a manager. The Pet Shop Boys \u2013 another act founded on quasi-intellectual disco music with a strong visual style \u2013 spent four years making their own videos with quirky panache before they attempted a live show. As Meller lies on her back on the chewing-gum-mottled stage to deliver her final note, I wonder if theirs might be a better strategy. After the show, the singer herself seems blissfully unconcerned. With her lack of cool comes a tangible sense of liberation. She is more interested in A Brief History of Time. \u201cMy music is unironic,\u201d she says. \u201cI have something against irony. I don\u2019t like it. I like honesty and positivity. I think people that look at my stuff ironically, they just don\u2019t understand what\u2019s behind it. Stephen Hawking has proved scientifically that quantum physics is many realities that exist at the same time. He has proved it! We still don\u2019t accept this theory, but I believe in it. I believe that you can create your own realities, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing: I wonder how the reality would be that you would create? I think that\u2019s what I do with my imagination. My music is about positivity. It\u2019s my world, and if you want to join it \u2013 you\u2019re welcome!\u2019\u201d Petite Meller\u2019s single Barbaric is out now on Island Records", "publicationDate": "2015-12-06T09:30:16Z", "title": "Petite Meller: \u2018I believe when you want something and imagine it, it happens\u2019", "sentences": ["Petite Meller     The French-born singer Meller is one of the most arresting and divisive figures to emerge in pop music this year, a postgraduate philosophy student at the Sorbonne in Paris and the University of Tel Aviv, devotee of pigtails, white over-the-knee socks and high-cut swimwear, and purveyor of delirious Europop fused with the thoughts of Jacques Lacan.", "Her parents \u2013 \u201cAre they academics?\u201d \u201cYes, kind of\u201d \u2013 left France to live in Israel, hence the connection with Tel Aviv university."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/06/petite-meller-interview-i-believe-french-pop-singer-philosophy-student"}, {"tags": ["Australian politics", "Malcolm Turnbull", "Science", "Australian economy", "Bill Shorten", "Labor party", "Coalition", "CSIRO", "Australia news", "Tax", "Business", "Technology"], "article": "The government\u2019s innovation package provides funding for more than 20 programs, spread across nine ministerial portfolios. The overall funding envelope is $1.1bn over four years. Where the money is coming from, and whether existing programs have been cut in order to pay for the new commitments, will be revealed in the Myefo budget update, expected later this month.   Related: Innovation statement: startups 'free to fail' in bid to encourage risk-taking    Some programs have no cost attached to them, while others start outside of the 2015-16 financial year. The government has grouped the programs into four separate categories. Culture and capital The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has argued that Australia is too risk-averse when it comes to funding startups. Around $219m of the $1.1bn package has been set aside to try and change Australians\u2019 attitudes towards failure through providing tax incentives for investment in new businesses. Under the changes, investors will receive a 20% nonrefundable tax rebate up to the value of $200,000 per investor per year, and a 10-year capital gains tax exemption. Venture capital investors will receive a 10% tax offset to expand startups in their early stages. The tax incentives will cost $106m over the forward estimates. The scope of which businesses will be eligible for the tax breaks is still to be determined, with Turnbull saying the government is engaging in a consultation period before the changes come into play in July next year. The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Dave Oliver, said he was worried investors might \u201crort\u201d the new system and leave workers and creditors \u201cout of pocket\u201d. Startups will be able to apply faster depreciation on their intangible assets, such as patents, in order to bring them in line with other assets, allowing business owners to make larger tax deductions over shorter periods of time. This measure will cost $80m over four years. Turnbull also announced the government will change bankruptcy laws in order to minimise the risk associated with launching startups. The government will introduce \u201csafe harbours\u201d for company directors to protect against personal liability for insolvent trading, as long as they appoint an adviser to try and spare the company financial difficulty. The default bankruptcy period will also be decreased from three years to 12 months. \u201cChanges to insolvency laws will help foster a culture of appropriate risk-taking,\u201d a statement by the Business Council of Australia said. \u201cSafe harbour provisions and reducing the bankruptcy period from three years to one strike a balance between protecting investors and creditors, while also promoting a more innovative business culture.\u201d The government will spend $10m over four years in establishing a Biomedical Translation Fund with the private sector for commercialising medical research, and a further $15m for a new innovation fund within the government\u2019s peak scientific research body, the CSIRO. The fund would help companies develop technology created by the CSIRO. Another $20m will go to the CSIRO to help expand its accelerator program, but the overall funding injection of $90m falls well short of the $115m that was taken out of the organisation when the Coalition came to power in 2013.           The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, unveils a package of measures designed to kickstart innovation in the Australian economy on Monday    Collaboration Australia has one of the lowest rates of collaboration between researchers and industry in the OECD, a statistic Turnbull said he aimed to fix. As part of the innovation package, the government will change the focus of existing block grant funding towards collaboration. The six research block grants will be channelled into two programs: one that supports tertiary education facilities with the cost of research, and the other to train up-and-coming researchers. Block funding grants will get $127m over four years. \u201cWe can\u2019t let the old and more scattered approach continue to dominate the allocation of a severely rationed resource,\u201d the chief scientist, Ian Chubb, said in a statement. There will also be provisions in the package to measure the nonacademic impact and industry engagement of research as part of the funding determination process, at an overall cost of $9m. The government will set aside $26m over the forward estimates period to allow greater global collaboration, too. It will create so-called landing pads in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv as well three other yet-to-be-determined locations, so that researchers can make connections with Australian intellectuals who live abroad. By far the largest chunk of funding \u2013 $459m over four years, with more planned outside the forward estimates period \u2013 will go towards the long-term funding of research infrastructure.  The National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, which on Monday received funding certainty to the tune of $1.5bn over 10 years, had been used as a bargaining chip by former education minister, Christopher Pyne, to pass contentious changes to university funding. Pyne, now the innovation minister, later backed down on the threat to cut the NCRIS\u2019s funding if higher education changes were not passed.   Related: Christopher Pyne denies 'mistake' to tie science research funding to education bill    The union representing engineers, Professionals Australia, welcomed the move away from piecemeal funding arrangements for research. \u201cOur scientists have been trapped in a never-ending cycle of grant applications, our spending on research is at best mediocre, and our supply of engineering graduates is so poor that we import two-thirds of the engineers we need to run the country year-on-year,\u201d chief executive, Chris Walton, said. Extra funding will also go towards boom industries in the tech sector, with $22m going to the funding of a new cyber security growth centre, and another $15m into developing quantum computing, hailed as the next era of computers. \u201cQuantum computing is a transformational technology in which Australia has an international lead, and there is now an opportunity for translating this research here in Australia,\u201d the director of the Australian Research Council Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, Michelle Simmons, said. Talent and skills A further $84m over four years will go towards the study of science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) subjects in schools, with money earmarked for promoting Stem subjects for women, and the teaching of coding to students in Years 5 to 7. The Australian Academy of Science welcomed the extra funding for women, calling it a \u201cgame-changer\u201d that aims to redress the gender imbalance in the sciences. \u201cDiversity underlies innovation. This government support will enable us to grow the diverse, talented research sector that Australia needs to create, shape and maintain the innovative society we want in the future,\u201d Academy fellow Nalini Joshi said. The government will also create a new visa class for innovators who wish to call Australia home. The entrepreneurial visa will not be capped, Turnbull said. \u201cThe more high-quality, effective, productive enterprising entrepreneurs we can attract, the better because they drive jobs. Entrepreneurs create jobs,\u201d the prime minister told reporters. ACTU\u2019s Dave Oliver expressed concern at news of the visa, saying the government should be focusing on training up the local workforce instead. Government as an exemplar Many programs in the package look at what the federal government can do to lead the way on innovation. The government will set up a new independent statutory body responsible for driving long-term policy on science and innovation, at a cost of $8m. A new committee of cabinet, to be chaired by the prime minister, will also be formed. A digital marketplace to help small and medium-sized enterprises to business with the federal government will be created. That initiative will cost $15m over four years. Turnbull has reversed a decision made by his predecessor, Tony Abbott, to scrap data research body, Data61. The body is the result of a merger between National ICT Australia (Nicta) and the CSIRO\u2019s digital research unit. Funding for Data61 was due to run out in July next year. It will now be funded until 2019, at a cost of $75m all up. The Coalition v Labor policies Late last week, Labor released the third tranche of its innovation strategy. There are many similarities between what the opposition announced and what the government announced on Monday, making it a largely bipartisan policy area. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, has long argued for school children to be taught coding, and that more teachers should be trained in Stem subjects. He has proposed to offer 25,000 scholarships for teaching graduates to take up the subjects, worth $15,000 each. Labor also wants to see an innovation hub built in the United States, similar to the Coalition\u2019s so-called \u201clanding pads\u201d, and has called for tax incentives for those investing in startups. It also wants new classes of visas for encouraging entrepreneurial visas for graduates and other applicants, but would cap them at 2,000 visas for each of the two streams. \u201cThey say imitation is the most sincere form of flattery,\u201d Shorten told reporters on Monday. \u201cThere are a number of Labor ideas which we\u2019ve been outlining since my budget reply speech [in May] which I\u2019m pleased the see the government has adopted with a few tweaks.\u201d He criticised Abbott for the \u201cdegradation\u201d of the sector. \u201cHow on earth can you say that you are pro-innovation when you cut $3bn from research, science and innovation, and then you put $1bn back? It doesn\u2019t really go towards filling the gap, does it?,\u201d Shorten asked. Labor axed funding to the science, research and innovation sector by $562m in the 2012-13 financial year, boosting it by $538m again the following year.  Abbott then kept the budget more or less steady, shaving $53m from the sector in his first budget in 2014-15. The budget estimate for science and innovation in the 2015-16 year is $315m less than the previous financial year, taking the sector\u2019s funding to its lowest point since 2012-13.", "publicationDate": "2015-12-07T08:22:33Z", "title": "$1.1bn innovation package aims to bridge gap between public and private", "sentences": ["It will create so-called landing pads in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv as well three other yet-to-be-determined locations, so that researchers can make connections with Australian intellectuals who live abroad."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/07/11bn-innovation-package-aims-to-bridge-gap-between-public-and-private"}, {"tags": ["Art and design", "Architecture", "Books", "Art and design", "Modernism", "2015 in review", "Best books", "Best books of 2015"], "article": "A striking aspect of Elain Harwood\u2019s Space, Hope and Brutalism (Yale University Press), a hefty survey of postwar British architecture, is that it isn\u2019t about brutalism precisely, but about this and many other styles of architecture. So it seems that someone, her publishers maybe, inserted the B-word because they thought it would help to sell the book. Which no doubt it does. Because brutalism, once the encapsulation in three-and-a-half syllables of everything thought hateful about modern architecture, a word whose inventors didn\u2019t even want to sound nice, is now exciting, sexy, intriguing. Which could have been predicted: baroque and gothic were once also terms of abuse. Owen Hatherley has done more than most to bring about this reappraisal, and this year further pushed the boundaries of received taste with Landscapes of Communism (Allen Lane), a loving exploration of the housing estates, TV towers and bureaucratic palaces built by eastern bloc countries in the Soviet era. It has the merit of confronting you with an alternative reality \u2013 in this case a different version of 20th-century architecture \u2013 to the one you thought you knew. The book is the outcome of epic travelling through places most architecture writers never visit. It also tries, with varying degrees of success, to reconcile Hatherley\u2019s beliefs that both communism and modernism have been wrongly written off.     Dresden\u2019s Palace of Culture, from Owen Hatherley\u2019s Landscapes of Communism. Photograph: Owen Hatherley    Challenging modern architecture from another direction was Sharon Rotbard\u2019s White City, Black City (Pluto), in which the much-admired \u201cBauhaus\u201d-style houses of Tel Aviv are attacked as agents of the colonisation and impoverishment of the Arab city of Jaffa. These works of progressive European intelligence, he argues, are actually instruments of conquest. Taken together, Rotbard and Hatherley show the relationship of buildings to politics to be a slippery but nonetheless vital aspect of architecture. Handsome, well-researched, substantial tomes thudded on to the shelves: a thoroughly revised edition of William Curtis\u2019s Le Corbusier: Ideas and Forms (Phaidon), and two magnificent catalogues, The World of Charles and Ray Eames and Latin America in Construction (both Thames &amp; Hudson), which accompanied exhibitions of the same name at the Barbican in London and MoMA in New York. The latter, like Hatherley\u2019s book, opened up new perspectives on modernism, by looking beyond the well-known monuments of Oscar Niemeyer that tend to dominate perceptions of Latin American architecture.     George Gilbert Scott\u2019s gothic buildings at St Pancras station in London. Photograph: Alamy    There were shorter, more individualistic studies of British architects from longer ago. Gavin Stamp\u2019s Gothic for the Steam Age (Aurum Press) was on the prodigiously productive George Gilbert Scott, whose practice splattered almost every part of Britain with churches and other important structures in a gothic revival style. Owen Hopkins\u2019s From the Shadows (Reaktion) is the liveliest account yet of Nicholas Hawksmoor, the amazing baroque architect of the early 18th century. Had he but known it, Hawksmoor was a proto-brutalist, his un-pretty and confronting forms being an inspiration to British architects in the mid-20th century. Melancholy and Architecture (Park Books), by Diogo Seixas Lopes, studies a neglected aspect of a profession that usually likes to be upbeat, and an architect, Aldo Rossi, who died in 1997, and who explored such matters. But of all these the book I found most immediately gratifying was Making Do and Getting By (Walther K\u00f6nig), by the artist Richard Wentworth, which is a series of photographs of unintended and incongruous details of city streets: signs, pipes, graffiti, discarded coffee cups, road painting, bodged repairs, misplaced adverts, exiled teddy bears. This is not architecture as usually considered, but it is hugely revealing of the ways life in cities is revealed through their physical fabric. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 December 2015.

The Monarch chief executive, Andrew Swaffield, said: \u201cAfter all the heavy lifting and the difficult decisions it\u2019s good to see the benefits in the numbers.\u201d  Swaffield said the restructuring, which included 900 redundancies and large pay cuts for most employees, had cut costs by \u00a3200m, while revenues had only dropped by \u00a3100m on a smaller flying network.  He added: \u201cThe restructure is behind us ... obviously we have to be vigilant but we are happy we have a sustainable cost base.\u201d Swaffield said he expected flights to Sharm el-Sheikh to resume in the new year, although he warned services could yet be suspended beyond the current date of 6 January.

But inside there was only darkness. For the next nine and a half hours, in the Jerusalem Cinematheque, they would sit, rapt and in silence, through Shoah, the film made by the French director Claude Lanzmann, which was already being garlanded by critics around the world as the greatest single film about the Holocaust and one of the very greatest documentaries in the history of cinema. It was June 1986, 14 months after the film\u2019s world premiere in France. Hushed audiences had sat spellbound at screenings in Paris and New York, but this June day was different. It was the first official showing of Lanzmann\u2019s masterpiece in Israel, its premiere marked as all but a state occasion. Taking their seats at the Cinematheque, then a newly opened arthouse cinema facing the walls of the Old City, were Israel\u2019s prime minister, Shimon Peres, along with the country\u2019s president, chief rabbi and even the chief of staff of the military. A surging pack of press and cameras had greeted their arrival. Less noticed as they made their way through the heaving crowd were the rest of the invited audience. Among them were several of those who appeared in the film: the survivors of the Nazi death camps, the resistance fighters, those who had witnessed the slaughter up close. They were in the room. Many had their children at their side. Lanzmann himself \u2013 a fighter in the French resistance, a former lover of Simone de Beauvoir and confr\u00e8re of Jean-Paul Sartre \u2013 was agitated. Earlier that morning, Alan Reich, then working as an intern at the Cinematheque and now a documentary maker in his own right, had brought the director breakfast in his hotel room. \u201cHe was completely stressed out: he was sitting there, writing notes, getting up and pacing the room, popping pills to calm himself down. He was really quite anxious.\u201d The film had been lauded everywhere, but the judgment of Israel mattered to Lanzmann especially. He was presenting his account of one of the defining events of Jewish history to the world\u2019s only Jewish country \u2013 a country whose leading officials had chosen him for the task, entrusting him with this work of memory. He was adamant that the Jerusalem audience not miss even a moment of the story he had to tell. Just before the screening, he had clashed with the Cinematheque\u2019s founder, Lia van Leer. \u201cHe said, \u2018There\u2019s one thing you have to know: when the film starts, you lock the door, nobody leaves,\u2019\u201d Van Leer recalled when I spoke to her in Jerusalem earlier this year. \u201cI said, \u2018Are you crazy? If somebody has to go the lavatory, what do they do? Should they pee in their pants?\u2019\u201d Only when Van Leer declared that she would not forbid Israel\u2019s prime minister from visiting the bathroom, did Lanzmann relent. At last, everyone was seated. A hush descended. The director rose to introduce Shoah \u2013 the Hebrew word for destruction, and the preferred Israeli term for the Holocaust. He said how glad he was that so many had come to see his film, a film he had made with all his heart. He headed for his own seat, but he could not stay in it. Instead, and for the duration of the screening, he was in and out of his chair, patrolling the auditorium, unable to sit still. He wanted to see the 380 faces that made up his audience. For some, seeing the story of the Shoah played out on screen for 566 slow minutes proved too much. At one point, a member of the audience, a survivor, collapsed and suffered a heart attack. He had to be stretchered away. Another fainted.    At one point, a member of the audience, a survivor, collapsed and suffered a heart attack. Another fainted    It was as if, for one extraordinary June day, Israel itself grappled with the event that preceded its birth by three years, and has haunted it ever since. It did so in an unprecedentedly concentrated way: the leaders of the Israeli state were all present, together, in one room and in the dark. What the audience experienced during those hours was a reminder that Israel\u2019s relationship with the Holocaust has been impossibly tangled, stirring emotions that linger still: grief and pain, of course, but also guilt, fear and even shame. The story of the day Shoah was screened in Jerusalem is also the story of how the Shoah has reverberated, and continues to reverberate, through Israeli life. In the politics of the country, in the way it relates to the rest of the world, the shadow of the Holocaust is never far away. It is there in the crudest, most basic argument offered for Israel\u2019s right to exist: that after the murder of six million, Jews need a safe haven that they can call their own. It is there too when Israeli leaders insist that they have not only the right but the duty to crush any and every threat to the security of their citizens, because \u201cnever again\u201d will Jews be left defenceless. When, in 1981, Prime Minister Menachem Begin sent Israeli air force jets to destroy Saddam Hussein\u2019s Osirak nuclear reactor, a site assumed to be dedicated to the production of atomic weapons, Begin reached for this same formulation. \u201cThere won\u2019t be another Holocaust in the history of the Jewish people,\u201d he said after the raid. \u201cNever again. We shall defend our people with all the means at our disposal.\u201d The Holocaust is similarly present in almost every speech that Begin\u2019s successor Binyamin Netanyahu has made to warn of the prospect of a nuclear Iran, invoking the right of the Jewish people to protect themselves against the possibility of annihilation. It colours the way Netanyahu sees his closer enemy too: earlier this year, in a claim that was later withdrawn after much criticism, not to say scorn, from historians, Netanyahu suggested that the notion of exterminating the entire Jewish people, what the Nazis called the \u201cfinal solution to the Jewish problem\u201d, was planted in the mind of Adolf Hitler by the Palestinian leader Haj Amin al-Husseini, the mufti of Jerusalem. Netanyahu\u2019s remarks were egregious and almost universally denounced, in Israel as much as anywhere else. He had next to no defenders. And yet, the prime minister was voicing a strain of thinking \u2013 feeling, more accurately \u2013 that lurks somewhere deep in the Israeli psyche. It was articulated best by the Israeli novelist Amos Oz, who in his memoir, A Tale of Love and Darkness, describes the curious symmetry of Israeli and Palestinian views of the other. Despite their common history of suffering at the hands of Christian Europe, one through persecution, the other through imperialism, each struggles to see the other as a victim, Oz writes. The Palestinians fail to see Jews as the past target of European oppression and genocidal hatred. They don\u2019t see Jews, as Oz puts it, as \u201ca bunch of half-hysterical survivors\u201d. By the same token, he writes: \u201cWhen we look at them, we do not see fellow victims either; we see not brothers in adversity but pogrom-making Cossacks, bloodthirsty anti-Semites, Nazis in disguise, as though our European persecutors have reappeared here in the Land of Israel, put keffiyehs on their heads, and grown moustaches, but they are still our old murderers.\u201d With his bizarre flight of fantasy about the mufti, Netanyahu had revealed again the extent to which the Holocaust still colours the Israeli mindset, fearfully seeing neighbours near and far as \u201cNazis in disguise\u201d. All of this hung heavy in the air at the main auditorium of the Cinematheque that day nearly 30 years ago, as Lanzmann paced among the rows, watching the faces in the dark. Staring out most keenly of all were the survivors, those who had been present at the conflagration and who had built new lives and new families in a new home \u2013 a home that had never quite known how to embrace them. * * * The youngest face to appear in Shoah belongs to Hanna Zaidel. She is a grandmother now, in her 60s, but on screen she is in her 20s, beautiful, taking long moody drags on a cigarette. Speaking first in Hebrew, then through a French interpreter \u2013 one of the reasons why the film is so long is that Lanzmann eschewed subtitles, insisting on consecutive translation \u2013 Zaidel tells how she learned the remarkable story of her father, Motke, in scraps, extracting one fact at a time. \u201cI had to tear the details out of him,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was a silent man, he didn\u2019t talk to me.\u201d Addressing the camera, she adds that only \u201cwhen Mr Lanzmann came\u201d did she hear the whole story, told in one go.     Hanna Zaidel in Shoah. Photograph: Claude Lanzmann    When the Nazis liquidated the Vilna ghetto, in today\u2019s Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, they did it by leading an estimated 90,000 Jews eight miles to the Ponari forests and shooting them dead, en masse, letting their bodies fall into vast pits originally dug by the region\u2019s previous Russian occupiers for use as petrol reservoirs. When the killing was over, as many as 25,000 corpses were left in each pit. Next, the Nazis sent in chain gangs made up of some 84 Jews \u2013 80 men and four women \u2013 shackled above their calves day and night, to dig the bodies out and burn them. One group was charged with removing gold teeth from the dead. Motke Zaidel was one of those 84, forced on pain of death to burn the corpses of his own friends, neighbours and even relatives. In Shoah, Motke Zaidel tells this story with the Israeli forest of Ben Shemen as a backdrop. In the distance, there is a bonfire, sending wreaths of smoke into the air. When I met Hanna Zaidel earlier this year in her home in the Tel Aviv suburb of Hod Hasharon, her hair shorter and grey now, and with a picture of her late father looking on from the sideboard, she offered an unexpected memory of him. \u201cThe main thing is that he was washing hands all the time. He was washing his hands, he was washing our hands. All the time. He was cleaning up all the time. And he kept on doing it, to my sons, to his grandchildren. So whenever they saw him, they used to hide their hands like this.\u201d She pulled her hands into her sleeves. \u201cUntil I told him, \u2018Daddy, their hands are clean. They don\u2019t need to clean Ponari from their hands. Please stop it.\u2019 And he did.\u201d The Holocaust survivors \u2013 and their children \u2013 who gathered in the audience at the Jerusalem Cinematheque that day would have recognised that account and especially Motke Zaidel\u2019s reluctance to speak of his experience. It fitted well with what was then an established narrative of Israel\u2019s complex relationship with the Holocaust. The accepted view held that those who had survived the Nazi whirlwind were, initially at least, all but silent about the hell they had endured. Perhaps it was because they were simply too traumatised, rendered mute with pain. Perhaps they were simply determined to start afresh, to put the torments of Europe behind them and begin anew, never looking back. But that view \u2013 the myth of a self-imposed silence \u2013 has begun to crumble in recent years. The evidence shows that, in fact, there was plenty of discussion in Israel, beginning even before the state was established in 1948. Yehuda Bauer, a pre-eminent Holocaust scholar who served as the historical adviser to Lanzmann on Shoah, told me: \u201cIf you look at the [Hebrew] newspapers between 1945 and 1954, practically every week, sometimes every day, there were stories published \u2013 articles, memoirs.\u201d     Hanna Zaidel, now in her 60s, holds a picture of her late father Motke Zaidel. Photograph: Gali Tibbon for the Guardian    The survivors were talking a lot, even if the most intense conversations were with each other. The trouble was, the rest of the new Israeli society \u2013 those who had been in Palestine throughout the war years or who had not been touched directly by the Nazi death machine \u2013 did not always know how to listen. Hanna Zaidel\u2019s own experience was a case in point. As a child, she saw her father gather with fellow survivors from Vilna: inevitably, she had no uncles or aunts, so these friends of Motke\u2019s were the closest she had to an extended family. \u201cThey used to meet every three of four weeks for a big meal: lots of food, lots of alcohol, singing songs from the ghetto and talking in Yiddish or Russian or Polish.\u201d But with outsiders, things became complicated. One day, around 1950, an interviewer from Tel Aviv University came to the Zaidel house, keen to explore the events of the Ponari forest. During the conversation with Motke, the researcher suggested that the Jews of Europe had gone to their deaths \u201clike sheep to the slaughter\u201d. The phrase had first been deployed as a call to arms in the Vilna ghetto, issued on the last day of 1941 by the resistance leader and poet Abba Kovner: \u201cLet us not go like sheep to the slaughter!\u201d But in Israel it acquired a toxic currency. It conveyed the disdain of the new Israelis \u2013 so proud of their muscularity and their newly acquired power of self-determination \u2013 for the powerless, defenceless Jews of the diaspora. \u201cTo say something like this to my father, he just stood up and banged his fist on the table,\u201d Hanna Zaidel recalled. \u201cTo those professors who were asking him, he said \u2018I wish you were there.\u2019 And then he walked out.\u201d As it was in the Zaidel family, so it was in Israel itself. Those who had been there, those who understood, could talk to each other. But among those who had not, there was incomprehension or, worse, a harsh brand of judgment. If it was not outright condemnation for failing to fight back \u2013 \u201csheep to the slaughter\u201d \u2013 it was a more invidious form of suspicion. The final speaker in Shoah is Simcha Rotem, one of the last surviving heroes of the Warsaw ghetto uprising. He describes how, after the liquidation, he emerged from the sewers to find himself utterly alone in the place, now reduced to a ruin. He walked for hours in the ghetto but nothing and nobody was left: \u201cI didn\u2019t meet a living soul. At one point I recall feeling a kind of peace, of serenity. I said to myself: \u2018I\u2019m the last Jew. I\u2019ll wait for morning, and for the Germans.\u2019\u201d Those are the last words of the film. Rotem was in the audience, watching himself on the screen that day in Jerusalem. Now aged 90, his eyes still sparkling with almost boyish energy, he described the significance of Lanzmann\u2019s film and why it meant so much to Israel. \u201cTestimony was important,\u201d he said. \u201cTelling my story, the experience in and around the ghetto first hand, was hugely important. I think it helped people first to see at first hand that it was true, that these things really did happen, but also to think more deeply what had happened.\u201d He left the cinema full of admiration. \u201cLanzmann made an extraordinary film, a film that\u2019s incomparable with anything that\u2019s been made since.\u201d     Simcha Rotem, one of the last survivors of the Warsaw ghetto uprising, tells his story in Shoah Photograph: Claude Lanzmann    Even now, Rotem is best known by his nom de guerre from the Jewish underground: Kazik. Despite his impeccable resistance credentials, in the early days of Israeli statehood, even the legendary Kazik was wary of talking too much about his past. \u201cPeople had a problem understanding and digesting the story. Really hearing the story. And I felt there was sometimes a question about what we did and how we got through it. People would ask, \u2018How did you survive?\u2019 And what they really meant was, \u2018What did you do to survive?\u2019\u201d Tired of being viewed as a suspected collaborator, he developed a coping strategy. \u201cWhen people asked where I was from, I said I was from Petach Tikva\u201d \u2013 a town close to Tel Aviv. A shift came in 1961, with the trial in Jerusalem of Adolf Eichmann, one of the prime architects of the Nazis\u2019 \u201cfinal solution\u201d. \u201cThe Eichmann trial was a real turning point, because it engaged the young generation, the Israeli-born generation,\u201d said Yehuda Bauer. \u201cEveryone was walking in the street, with transistor radios, listening to the testimonies in the trial. And that made a tremendous impact.\u201d For hour after hour, survivors were on the witness stand, describing in painstaking and painful detail what they had endured and what they were up against: the relentlessness of the Nazi machine, herding Jews into ghettos, murdering them in forests, starving them and using them as slave labour in concentration camps, murdering them on an industrial scale in the death camps of Auschwitz, Sobibor, Treblinka, Belzec, Chelmno and Majdanek. For the first time in such concentrated form, Israelis were exposed to the full picture of the Holocaust, learning of the factories Nazi Germany had built across Poland \u2013 factories whose only product was death. According to Bauer, \u201cThe original attitude to the Holocaust changed. Before, the question had been, \u2018Why didn\u2019t the Jews resist?\u2019 After the Eichmann trial, a slower process begins: \u2018How come there were so many who resisted?\u2019\u201d But by the early 1970s, Israeli officials, particularly those around Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s state Holocaust memorial and museum \u2013 a fixture on the itinerary of every visiting foreign dignitary \u2013 worried that the impact of the Eichmann trial was beginning to fade. They wanted to find a new way to communicate this formative event in Jewish history to the next generation, this time harnessing the power of cinema. The call went out to Lanzmann, a luminary of the French intellectual left and a documentary film-maker who had just made Pourquoi Israel, a sympathetic portrait of Israeli life produced to mark the country\u2019s 25th anniversary in 1973. The director was summoned to Jerusalem, where he delivered a presentation for the top brass at Yad Vashem, confining himself to \u201cgeneralities\u201d, according to Bauer: \u201cHe didn\u2019t want these people to have a say in what he was doing.\u201d Nevertheless, he had done enough to impress. As Bauer put it, \u201cPeople in those days, when they saw a genius, they realised he was a genius. And you don\u2019t try to stop a genius.\u201d The director left with a promise of funding. The timing of Lanzmann\u2019s commission would prove crucial. Ten months later, Israel would face a near-death experience, believing itself to have come close to defeat and invasion in the Yom Kippur war. The muscular \u201cnew Jews\u201d of 1948, the conquerors of 1967, suddenly saw themselves as vulnerable. For the Israeli journalist and historian Tom Segev, who charted the complex relationship of Israelis with the Holocaust for his book The Seventh Million, the 1973 war shifted the country\u2019s understanding of the Nazi period once again: \u201cWhat it basically says is if we [the Israelis] could hardly survive the Egyptian and Syrian armies, what do I expect of some elderly woman in Warsaw facing the Nazis?\u201d Segev told me. \u201cAnd it is at this point that the concept of heroism in Israel begins to change. It is no longer [just] someone who throws a grenade at the Nazis. It is also someone who manages to get some bread for her children, who manages to retain their human dignity. Because that\u2019s what the Nazis wanted to take away.\u201d This was the context in which Lanzmann set to work on a project that would dominate the next 12 years of his life \u2013 and help reshape Israel\u2019s, and the world\u2019s, understanding of the Holocaust. By 1974, he was meeting survivors and ghetto fighters, perpetrators and bystanders, in Poland, in Germany, in the US, in Israel. One door he knocked on, all those years ago, was that of the Zaidel family home in Petach Tikva. Lanzmann put his tape recorder on the dining table and asked Motke to talk about the horrors he had lived through in the darkness of Ponari. And there in the room, absorbing each word as she dragged on a cigarette, was Hanna, the face of the new Israeli generation, born far away from the killing fields of eastern Europe \u2013 the daughter whose young hands Motke nevertheless needed to scrub, to wash away the dust of the forest. * * * The length of Shoah, the demands it imposes on the audience, make it less like seeing a movie than taking part in a ritual, a sacred rite of remembrance. I went to see it with a friend, at the Curzon cinema in London, in September 1986, just a few months after the premiere in Jerusalem. My friend made the mistake of bringing popcorn \u2013 but he did not get very far with it. He had barely begun chomping when a woman from a nearby row leaned over and slapped him, hard, on the thigh. In an accent thick with the sound and memories of prewar Europe, she said: \u201cHave you no respect?\u201d The film\u2019s pace is unsettling. There are slow, lingering shots of the (usually Polish) countryside, unbroken by either commentary or music. There is none of the familiar, expected footage: Shoah includes no archive material at all, none of those now-stock images of skeletal inmates or corpses piled into small mountains. There are no interviews with politicians or government ministers. Instead, it focuses on the ordinary people who were caught up in a period of collective human wickedness, in which cruelty became a system and day became night. The film listens as they describe it, detail by murderous detail.     Claude Lanzmann in 1985, the year the Shoah was released. Photograph: Jean-Regis Rouston/Roger Viollet/Getty Images    The effect is mesmerising. Zaidel recalled the extraordinary hush inside the Jerusalem Cinematheque: \u201cIt was very strong, people sitting for so many hours. It was, shhhhh. Even the flies didn\u2019t want to fly there. You didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d There was little of the usual shifting in seats, despite the marathon length of the film. People stayed still, riveted. Nevertheless, and despite Lanzmann\u2019s edict, some did have to take a break. One woman went to the bathroom just to wash the tears off her face. Another went outside and found herself dazzled by the sunlight: it was a shock after the darkness and the crematoria and the death. But when they went back inside the auditorium, Shoah was still going on. Because that is how it was: for at least four years, the killing did not stop. Between 1941 and 1945, no matter what else was going on in the world, the wheels of death were still turning. Somehow the very form of Shoah conveyed something important about the reality of the event itself. For many in that audience \u2013 and not just the ones who fainted or suffered cardiac arrest \u2013 it was overwhelming. Shimon Peres was the prime minister at the time and, thanks to the demands of high office, he had to leave before the film was over. But it was more than diary commitments that took him away. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay,\u201d he told me from his office, which overlooks the Jaffa coast. \u201cI felt like a broken man.\u201d Now in his 90s, the film took him to his childhood in prewar Poland. \u201cThese were the people with whom I lived. There was nothing imaginary about it. It was very hard. [Afterwards] we didn\u2019t know what to say to each other. All of a sudden, words lose their meaning. They look so pale.\u201d For some critics, it was excessive. Tom Segev faulted the film for adding drama to an event that needed no added drama. He disliked the way Lanzmann staged certain scenes, demanding for example, that a man who, as a boy, had been forced by the Nazis to sing a particular folk song, sing the song again, for the cameras. Others resented the director\u2019s probing, relentless style. For one sequence, involving Abraham Bomba, a former inmate of Treblinka and a trained barber, Lanzmann recreated a barbershop, in Tel Aviv \u2013 and put questions to Bomba as he cut the hair of an unidentified customer. In English, and in a voice which is, at first, oddly matter-of-fact, Bomba combs and clips and combs as he explains that he and his fellow barbers were forced to cut the hair of women as they entered the gas chambers. The women did not know what was about to happen to them. They believed they were \u201cgetting a nice haircut\u201d. (Their hair was, in fact, collected and sent to Germany for commercial use.) Bomba then recalls how one day a transport arrived from his hometown of Cz\u0119stochowa. \u201cI knew a lot of them. I knew them; I lived with them in my town. I lived with them in my street, and some of them were my close friends. And when they saw me, they started asking me \u2026 \u2018What\u2019s going to happen to us?\u2019 What could you tell them? What could you tell them?\u201d He goes on to say that a fellow barber suddenly saw his own wife and sister enter the gas chamber.\u201d At that moment, Bomba \u2013 previously so controlled, so fluent \u2013 halts. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s too horrible. Please.\u201d He pauses for about 90 seconds. Lanzmann\u2019s camera remains on Bomba\u2019s face. We watch as the armour a man has built to protect himself over the intervening four decades crumbles before our eyes. Bomba seems to be breaking. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to do it,\u201d he pleads. \u201cYou have to do it,\u201d Lanzmann tells him. \u201cDon\u2019t make me go on. Please.\u201d     Abraham Bomba cuts the hair of an unidentified customer in Shoah. Photograph: US Holocaust Memorial Museum &amp; Yad Vashem &amp; State of Israel    It is one of the most painful sequences in the film. There can be few more affecting scenes in cinema. But for the audience watching on that scorching day in Israel, it would have carried an extra power. The room was packed with survivors who knew Bomba\u2019s anguish, even if their experience had not been as extreme or as morally devastating as his. And what they saw on the screen was not black and white footage from faraway Europe. They saw a man in contemporary Tel Aviv, tanned and wearing a summer shirt. Yet slowly that exterior \u2013 the carapace of the confident, brash Israeli \u2013 was peeled away, to reveal a Jew trembling with grief and pain. This gets close to the heart of what was singular about Lanzmann\u2019s film. If it had a message, it was that the Holocaust was not in the past: it had a presence in the present. It was all around. It did not exist only in archival monochrome, but in colour, in the here and now. The places where it happened were not in some distant galaxy, on the mythical Planet Auschwitz. They happened in this world: in this forest, in this field, in this village. And its pain lives on in this world too, in the places where the victims are remembered and the places where the survivors fled. The Holocaust runs deep in the soil of Poland and Germany and Lithuania and Belarus and every place Jews were killed, of course. But the Bomba sequence, like the shots of Motke Zaidel in the Ben Shemen forest, told that Israeli audience watching in Jerusalem that the Shoah was alive in their country too. They could not escape it. Too many people, and too many of their children, had been shaped \u2013 or broken \u2013 by it. * * * In the 12 long years Claude Lanzmann spent making Shoah, he came to Jerusalem often. He would take the same room in the same hotel, at the artists\u2019 colony of Mishkenot Sha\u2019ananim, and promptly drive everyone crazy. Those who encountered him on these visits described a man who was impossibly demanding, spectacularly self-absorbed and brutally unbothered by the needs of others. When he had toothache, he thought nothing of telephoning the distinguished professor from the Hebrew University, Yehuda Bauer, in the middle of the night to insist he find him a dentist. Lia van Leer put it baldly. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s a man that thinks he is the one and only. He has an ego that is quite enormous, and never changed until today.\u201d According to Van Leer, when Steven Spielberg made Schindler\u2019s List, \u201cLanzmann was furious: \u2018How dare he [Spielberg] talk about it, when I have already said everything?\u2019\u201d    Lanzmann was furious about Schindler\u2019s List: \u2018How dare he [Spielberg] talk about it, when I have said everything?\u2019  Lia van Leer     But what they all said \u2013 these same people who described him as a monstrous egomaniac \u2013 was that Lanzmann is a bona fide genius, a true artistic original. It was his determination, his obsession, that ensured Shoah became a landmark document of one of the darkest chapters in human history. Only a man with Lanzmann\u2019s single-mindedness would have spent more than a decade crossing the globe, generating an estimated 225 hours of filmed footage, interviewing every subject for hours, even days, before the cameras started running, to get the story exactly right. Only Lanzmann would have devoted his life to this project, sacrificing every waking hour to it. \u201cI remember his wife pouring out her bleeding heart to me,\u201d Bauer recalled, chuckling at the memory. \u201cShe thought she had married a man. In fact she had married a film.\u201d Visit Lanzmann in Paris, as I did earlier this year, and you are confronted, as soon as the front door of his modestly sized apartment is open, with an enormous cinema poster for Shoah. Staring at you is the face of the train driver who took Jews to their deaths at Treblinka, the man who in one unforgettable scene recalls the Poles who would gather by the railway tracks to watch the death trains. He describes how they would signal to the Jews the fate that awaited them: he re-enacts the gesture, running his finger across his throat. Inside the apartment, fighting for space among the personal snaps that show Lanzmann on vacation with De Beauvoir and Sartre \u2013 they seemed to have functioned as a trio, Lanzmann the bright young man walking alongside those two giants of French thought \u2013 or receiving an honour from Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, are boxes of DVDs, new versions of the film, spin-offs from the film, books about the film. Shoah is all around. There was no show of false modesty. In answering my first question, Lanzmann \u2013 who last month turned 90, his movements now slow and laboured \u2013 declared that once his film was screened in Israel, it changed everything. \u201cThe film was a triumph everywhere. In all the newspapers. Amos Oz wrote five articles about the film. It was unanimous. I don\u2019t know how many interviews they made. They made pictures, they made profiles of me. They understood perfectly that there was \u2018before Shoah\u2019 and \u2018after Shoah\u2019\u201d. Our conversation turned to one especially haunting sentence from the film. It comes in Lanzmann\u2019s interview with Yitzhak \u201cAntek\u201d Zuckerman, a leader of the Warsaw ghetto uprising and one of those revered as a hero by Israel in its earliest days. Interviewed on his kibbutz, Antek says: \u201cI began drinking after the war. It was very difficult. Claude, you asked for my impression. If you could lick my heart, it would poison you.\u201d I heard that sentence nearly 30 years ago and I have never forgotten it. But it nearly eluded Lanzmann. \u201cAntek liked to drink. He was a drinker. And he says, \u2018Claude, I started to drink after the war, when I climbed on this huge mass grave.\u2019 The translator, who was Jewish, did not translate this, but this is what he says. And the people of the kibbutz did everything they could so that I would not talk with Antek, because they were ashamed of him. The authorities of the kibbutz did not want to show a hero who drinks \u2013 like me.\u201d And with that, Lanzmann reached for a glass.     Yitzhak \u2018Antek\u2019 Zuckerman, a leader of the Warsaw ghetto uprising, appearing in Shoah. Photograph: Claude Lanzmann    This was part of what Lanzmann was forcing Israel and Israelis to confront that day in Jerusalem. There were men and women living among them \u2013 even those, like Antek, who had been lionised as legends of resistance; even those, like Bomba, who appeared to be getting on with their lives \u2013 who were, in fact, broken. The film had a lasting impact on Israel in other ways, too. By letting his camera linger so long on Poland and Poles \u2013 to an extent still resented by many in that country \u2013 Lanzmann succeeded in shifting the focus from Germany alone. Shoah made clear that the elimination of the Jews was not only a German project, but involved most of the nations of Europe. More deeply, the film signalled to Israelis that there was a place they could go to reflect on and mourn the past. Until then, the Yad Vashem museum in Jerusalem had been the focal point of national commemoration. After Shoah, and especially after the fall of communism in 1989, Israelis realised they could get on a plane and travel to the heart of darkness, that they could see the sites of mass murder for themselves. Today such trips are a staple of the Israeli school calendar. It has made the Holocaust tangible and real, rather than distant and mysterious. As that hot June day in Jerusalem turned to evening, all that lay in the future. Lanzmann\u2019s film was finally reaching its conclusion. Not everyone had made it to the end, the cinema was not as packed as it had been nearly 10 hours earlier. But most had stayed. And when it was over, they remained fixed in their seats, stunned by what they had seen. There was no applause. Instead, one by one, many stood up and walked over to Lanzmann. Several hugged him. One survivor sobbed as she thanked the director; she kissed him and told him that he had \u201cdone such a heroic thing\u201d. And she was not the only one. For her part, Hanna Zaidel remembered that her father, Motke, left the cinema as if he were two centimetres taller. \u201cHe said, \u2018Thank God. Now people will understand. Now people will know.\u201d He had carried the burden for so long: \u201cHe burned his family \u2013 his own family \u2013 in that pit in Ponari. How can you live with this?\u201d But Lanzmann\u2019s film had granted him \u201csome respect and understanding\u201d. When we met, Hanna Zaidel told me something that surprised me. I had long known that many Holocaust survivors, those who had lived so close to starvation, could become agitated, even decades afterwards, if there was not a plentiful supply of food around. They might be comfortably settled and living in affluent countries, but they would still keep the cupboards stocked, just in case. What I had not realised was that this habit sometimes passed on to the next generation. \u201cFor many years, I had six loaves of bread in my freezer,\u201d Hanna told me. \u201cOr butter or flour in the freezer, just to be safe. My boys helped and said, \u2018Mummy, what do you think? They won\u2019t have it in the grocery tomorrow?\u2019 They did it slowly. And I don\u2019t have bread in the freezer now.\u201d Remember, Hanna Zaidel herself was never in those forests. She was never in the camps. But the Shoah was all around her. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland\u2019s documentary, Shoah in Jerusalem, is on BBC Radio 4 at 1.30pm on Sunday December 13 \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 January 2016.

For over half a century it has hung in the Museum of Art, in Ein Harod, Israel, but how it came to be there had not been questioned by curators. Until last year that is. Looted in Paris by the Nazis, the story of Zak\u2019s painting, and how it ended up Israel, is a testament to the continuing story not only of so-called orphaned works of art, where the owners cannot be traced \u2013 but also the complex and continuing politics of the identification and restitution of stolen Nazi art. The work was only recently identified as stolen by a visiting Polish graduate student, studying art stolen from the period. \u201cIt was discovered last year,\u201d Galia Bar Or, the museum\u2019s director, said. \u201cA researcher had a hunch and we took off the backing paper.\u201d What was revealed was a Nazi official stamp showing it had been looted in Paris. The fortuitous discovery of the provenance of the Zak painting is a stark reminder that even after so many decades the issue of art looted by the Nazis from European Jews \u2013 including art held by museums \u2013 remains and fraught and sensitive subject. In 2014 an international conference on the issue of restitution disclosed that some two-thirds of countries that had signed treaties on identifying art stolen by the Nazis had not met their obligations to identify stolen art held by collectors and museums.   Related: The Black Years: how Nazi art came back to Berlin    According to Israel Peleg, the director of Hashava \u2013 the Holocaust restitution company \u2013 Israeli institutions have not been exempt from this, unwittingly holding and displaying stolen works of art, perhaps numbering in the hundreds, brought to Israel \u2013 some of which have since been returned, including by the Israel Museum. \u201cWe know that after the war, at least 400 pieces of art reached the shores of Israel and the museums in Israel,\u201d Peleg said, last year. And while some paintings arrived after being sold on, others arrived as part of a programme to rescue Jewish and Jewish owned-art and artefacts. The Beggar, it appears, is part of this story: brought to Israel by Mordechai Narkiss, regarded as one of state of Israel\u2019s first serious art historians and curators. Born in Poland, Narkiss emigrated to British mandate Palestine in 1920, where five years later he would be appointed the first director of the newly established Bezalel Museum \u2013 later the Israel Museum \u2013 becoming among other things, an expert in the neglected field of Jewish objects from Islamic countries. But it was a decade after the end of world war two that Narkiss would be drawn into another important project. By the end of the war, the allies had found well over a million looted art objects from across the Reich. While some were returned to owners or their heirs, a large trove of orphaned art remained. The allies ruled that heirless property or property in \u201cexcess of capacity to preserve\u201d should be distributed among Jewish communities in Europe, Palestine, America and elsewhere. So in the early 1950s Narkiss, in his role as director of the national museum was invited to Europe to select from what remained of that orphaned art, bringing back to Israel about 1,200 objects of Judaica, paintings and works on paper. Among these, it now seems certain, was Zak\u2019s painting.   Related: Heirs of Nazi-era Jewish art dealers sue for return of treasure in US courts    Ein Harod, it must have seemed then, was a logical destination. A newly built museum, first founded in a wooden shed on a kibbutz in the 1930s, it was collecting art by Jewish painters from Europe who worked in the period between the wars, whose careers had been cut short by the global conflagration and Holocaust. \u201cIn the 40s and 50s Ein Harod was collecting art from what we called the \u2018lost generation\u2019,\u201d says Bar Or. \u201cMany of artists gathering in Paris between the wars were just starting their careers. For many no one even knows their names. The curator here at the time was very much dedicated to keeping alive the memory of these artists.\u201d Finding Zak\u2019s painting on one of his collection trips to Europe in one of the allied stores, Narkiss it is now believed, passed it on to Ein Harod. Over the intervening decades, how it came to be in the museum was forgotten. Elinor Kroitoru of Hashava takes up the story after the revelation of the Nazi stamp. \u201cThe stamp enabled [the researcher],\u201d Kroitoru told the Times of Israel, \u201cto go to the appropriate data bank and there she found the catalogue card filled out by the Nazis after they\u2019d confiscated it. The card included information about the painting, but not about the owners. \u201cThat same card, belonging to the ERR (Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg, or Reichsleiter Rosenberg taskforce, a Nazi organisation that seized cultural property during the war) revealed that the painting had been stolen in Paris as part of a drive to confiscate Jewish property.\u201d But there is still much that is unknown about the painting, including who its owners were. Zak died in 1926, enjoying some fame after his death. And as other other works of art were distributed around Europe \u2013 or destroyed because the artists were Jewish, Zak\u2019s painting was stored in Paris.

With an estimated net worth of $20m (\u00a313.4m), the 30-year-old model and her mother are allegedly suspected of failing to report discounts on luxury goods and other perks that should have been subject to income tax. The revelation that Refaeli was the internationally known model under investigation had been one of the worst-kept secrets in Israel after it was reported that an individual had been questioned but their identity was being suppressed under a gagging order. Israeli media had dropped strong hints over the last 24 hours as to the model\u2019s identity, mentioning she had attended the interview with her wealthy businessman husband. Refaeli, the former girlfriend of actor Leonardo DiCaprio, married the Israeli billionaire Adi Ezra in a high-profile ceremony near Haifa earlier this year. Among the allegations are that Refaeli did not pay rent for her apartment in Tel Aviv, paid an interior designer for his services by doing publicity for his business, and received a car from a company in return for publicity, none of which were declared.

The threats were familiar, warning of gunfire, backpack bombs and mayhem in New York and Los Angeles schools. Sent at 1.20am EST, the messages were routed electronically through Germany, though the author\u2019s whereabouts are still unknown. The two cities responded in dramatically opposing fashion. The Los Angeles Unified School District shut down more than 1,000 facilities, preventing over 640,000 children from attending class. Officials searched 1,500 buildings and police patrols were expanded throughout the week. The price tag was estimated at $29m, but could cost much more. New York, on the other hand, swiftly dismissed the threats as a hoax. Their assessment was made possible by the city\u2019s massive investments in counter-terrorism capabilities following 9/11. The tough-talking chief of police, William Bratton, suggested the sender had indulged in too many episodes of Homeland. Though called out by New York\u2019s mayor for overreacting, LA can hardly be faulted for taking the terrorist threat seriously \u2013 it came on the heels of this month\u2019s massacre of 14 people in San Bernardino, less than 50 miles from LA, and counter-terrorism experts have been expecting attacks for months.     The goal is to shut cities down, separate people from one another and push them into mental fortresses  David Kilcullen        A man raises his arms to French police in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis during the manhunt for the surviving terrorists who killed 129 people in November. Photograph: Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images    Nevertheless, the jittery reaction seemed to reveal a chink in our cities\u2019 armour \u2013 a vulnerability not just to terror attacks, but to the mere threat of such attacks. Post-Paris, the sense of unease is pervasive. US Homeland Security regularly issues alerts \u2013 including last week\u2019s warning of \u201cself-radicalised actors who could strike with little or no notice\u201d \u2013 that come without any specific information. There are dozens of warnings a day. Law enforcement agencies are bogged down. And the probability of actual attacks seems to be growing. Which means that, pranksters or not, terrorists are inflicting real costs, both in terms of life and money, on our cities \u2013 which is of course the point. In other words, our increasingly panicky reaction to terror threats mean you can inflict a degree of damage on a city at the click of a mouse. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that there has been a 158% increase in the number of threats to US schools in 2014. More than a third of these were sent electronically. Many resulted in evacuations and shutdowns. \u201cThe goal is to shut [cities] down for as long as possible, separate people from one another, break down communities, and push them into mental fortresses,\u201d says counter-insurgency specialist David Kilcullen. He believes that cities themselves are under assault precisely because they are the places that different communities come together; and the result of the assault is that different ethnic and religious communities stop trusting one another, and become more susceptible to exploitation. Terror in cities is nothing new, of course. LA was rocked by home-made bombs in 1910, and parts of Wall Street were decimated by a wagonful of explosives in 1920. The single deadliest act of domestic terrorism in US history occurred in Oklahoma in 1995, and with the exception of 9/11 violent attacks in the US are almost all homegrown. European cities are even more accustomed to it. Well before al-Qaida and Isis, the people of London, Madrid and Rome were battered respectively by the IRA, ETA and Anni di Piomi. There were more than 16,000 terrorist attacks in Europe over the past 45 years, according to the University of Maryland\u2019s Global Terrorism Database, most of them during the 1970s and 1980s. Moreover, it is easy for westerners to forget that the vast majority of terrorist actions occur elsewhere : a recent study of more than 1,300 cities ranked Baghdad, Mosul and Ramadi as the most terrorism-prone. It also showed that cities in Afghanistan, Egypt, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan and Somalia are far more vulnerable to devastating violence than those in the UK, France or US. From 2000-2014 there were 3,659 terrorist-related deaths in all western countries combined. In Iraq, there were 13,076 in 2014 alone. What can the worst-hit cities teach the rest about how to respond? Unfortunately, not much: there is no one-size-fits-all response to urban terrorism. Preventing attacks by lone wolves or sleeper cells in America requires a very different set of tactics than countering sophisticated networks of highly trained operatives in an active war zone such as Yemen, where \u201cterrorists\u201d are more like guerrillas, with highly elaborate operations and weaponry.

For example, many are installing extra layers of police surveillance in crowded spaces, and re-routing traffic away from critical infrastructure. Others are adding unobtrusive adaptations and reinforcements to city landscapes to reduce blast exposure, installing physical barriers around government offices and major businesses, and hiring counter-terrorism advisers. Positive police-community relations are also widely acknowledged as an essential feature of counter-terrorism strategy. The goal of all this is to minimise risk without choking city life altogether. As the saying has it, that\u2019s when the terrorists win. In the meantime, technology firms are lining up from Baghdad to Boston to equip city authorities with the software and skills to disrupt terrorism. Today there are more than 75 data fusion centres in major US cities, which share information between federal, state and municipal agencies. It is increasingly routine to use crime forecasting programmes \u2013 the Los Angeles Police Department has itself used predictive policing algorithms since 2013, and is reportedly mapping historical crime trends to predict future incidents \u2013 not without some controversy. New York, too, launched a controversial cyber intelligence unit that taps into conversations of potential jihadi recruits. And advanced electronic surveillance systems are commonplace, from city air terminals to city streets.  Civil liberty specialists are fearful that these measures confuse lines of authority, undermine privacy legislation and \u201cmilitarise\u201d law enforcement. \u201cThe real question is how to make a society more resilient in a way that does not destroy the very way of life in the city,\u201d says Kilcullen. After the Paris killings, French security agencies clamoured for more power \u2013 leading to a backlash from citizens who were unwilling to let terrorism restrict their freedoms.      A CCTV camera near Big Ben in London. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    So how does a city judge how seriously to take a threat? Why did LA shut down while New York shrugged? The short answer is that judging a threat is very difficult. \u201cEach threat needs to be surfaced and addressed in the context of the public safety officials\u2019 existing programmes,\u201d says Gary Margolis, CEO of Social Sentinel, a threat-awareness group focused on schools. \u201cAlert services can augment the existing safety and security plans within schools, municipalities, and those responsible for protecting critical infrastructure.\u201d By alert services, he means a new generation of social media monitoring systems \u2013 the tracking of millions of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram feeds to detect would-be perpetrators who telegraph their intentions.  But the fact is that there are limitations to what physical, policing and technological enhancements in cities can achieve. Not every bit of critical infrastructure can be made blast-proof. CCTV cameras may help with investigations, but likely won\u2019t prevent new attacks \u2013 although French railway authorities are planning to roll out up to 40,000 new security cameras that can monitor excessive body temperature and signs of anxiety, in the somewhat Orwellian hopes of identifying thought crimes before anyone gets killed. In truth, there are not many examples of cities getting it right. In Baghdad, they\u2019ve essentially resorted to the urban tourniquet of gated communities. In Tel Aviv, the locals are simply getting used to a heightened threat environment.    Related: Where are the world's most war-damaged cities?    Martin Powell, a former adviser to the mayor of New York, says the best strategy is straightforward: \u201cInvest in good planning and coordination, actionable intelligence and strategies to harden targets.\u201d It might be dull, but it delivers: the New York Police Department claims to have foiled at least 16 terrorist plots since 2001. London says it foiled seven terror plots in October alone. But governments cannot be expected to stop every attack. There is a temptation to erect barricades and build higher walls after each high-profile terrorist event. \u201cThis could create a debilitating culture of fear,\u201d says the urban theorist Richard Florida. In both LA and New York \u2013 not to mention most cities on the planet \u2013 urban terror is, real or not, a fact of life. The trick is not to lock cities down, not to introduce mass surveillance and strangle the city.

Amir Ohana, a lawyer, is head of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) caucus of the governing Likud party. Shalom\u2019s decision to step down was not expected to affect the stability of the rightwing government of Binyamin Netanyahu. Israeli media reported in recent days that several women have complained that Shalom, who served as the deputy prime minister and interior minister, had harassed them. Israel\u2019s attorney general instructed the police to investigate the allegations on Sunday. Shalom said: \u201cI have decided to resign my position as minister and member of the Knesset\u201d, adding that he was worried about the toll that recent events might take on his family. Ohana, 39, lives in Rishon Lezion, and is a criminal lawyer and former official of Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s internal security service. He and his partner, Alon Hadad, have a son and a daughter together, born through a surrogate in the US. He represented the Tel Aviv district for Likud and was placed at number 32 on the Likud party list.  In an interview last year Ohana told Israeli media, when criticising the LGBT community: \u201cThe gay community needs to grow up. I am against berating, invectives and boycotts every time someone disagrees with the agenda.\u201d He said the establishment of an LGBT caucus in Likud was met with people \u201cturning their nose\u201d and some \u201cpoisonous attacks\u201d. After a stabbing at the gay pride parade in Jerusalem this summer, Ohana accused the left of appropriating the fight for LGBT rights. \u201cHow is it that \u2018Pride in Likud\u2019 has become the focus of your sharpened arrows,\u201d he asked on his Facebook page at the time. \u201cIs it because you prefer the right to be full of racist, sexist, homophobes because it makes it easier for you to be on the \u2018good\u2019 side?\u201d he told Haaretz.   Shalom is not the first high-level Israeli politician to be forced from office in a scandal over allegations of sexual misconduct. A former Israeli president, Moshe Katsav, left office in 2007 and was later sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of twice raping an aide when he was a cabinet minister in the late 1990s, and sexually assaulting two other women who worked for him while he was president.

Ajmal Masroor, 44, is the second British Muslim over the past week to report that he had been recently barred from flying to the US, saying he was stopped by US embassy staff from boarding a Virgin flight from Heathrow to New York last week despite having travelled to the US multiple times already this year. The imam, who stood at the UK general election in 2010 as a Liberal Democrat candidate, had been due to lead Friday prayers at a mosque in Queens, New York, and says he had plans to meet friends and family. \u201cI went through all the security barriers, showed my boarding pass on my phone, I had my security check, bag checked and went all the way to the gates when I was taken aside by an American embassy staff,\u201d he told the Guardian.   Related: The US is stopping British citizens going on holiday \u2013 we can\u2019t look the other way | Stella Creasy    In the past week it has also emerged that a British Muslim family heading for Disneyland was barred from boarding a flight to Los Angeles by US authorities at London\u2019s Gatwick airport, prompting complaints from their MP, Stella Creasy. UK ministers are to demand an explanation from the US authorities as to why the British Muslim family was refused permission to fly to Los Angeles to visit Disneyland. Home Office sources said that inquiries would be made to enable the prime minister to respond to a letter from the Creasy, who has publicised the case and said she is concerned this is happening to a growing number of British Muslims. Mohammad Tariq Mahmood, one of the family members turned away from the flight, was travelling with his brother and nine of their children. He told the Guardian that his brother was once stopped and questioned at Tel Aviv airport about 10 years ago while trying to enter as part of a Middle East tour.           British Muslim children heartbroken by US flight ban, says father     According to a Reuters report, an unnamed US official said only one male member of the family had been deemed to be prohibited from flying. But because all 11 passengers had booked their travel together, they were all denied boarding at the instruction of the Customs and Border Protection agency of the US Department of Homeland Security. A department spokesman approached by the Guardian for comment would not confirm that account. In the latest case to emerge, Masroor said he was used to being profiled and receiving further questioning and bag searches when flying to the US. \u201cYet this time,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen I handed over my passport they took me aside.\u201d He said a man who said he was from the US embassy began to question him and asked him why he was travelling to the US. He described the official as \u201ccold, calculated and very unhelpful\u201d. He was also asked about his itinerary and where he would be staying. \u201cAfter some other frivolous questions, [the official] said: \u2018I\u2019m afraid your visa has been revoked\u2019.\u201d     Ajmal Masroor.    Masroor added that when he asked further questions, the official said: \u201cYou must have done something wrong ,\u201d before walking away. He claims to know of other British Muslims who have also been turned away. Masroor had withdrawn from the 2005 general election after being linked to a Muslim group accused of antisemitism. However, Masroor has previously received death threats for speaking out publicly against extremism, most notably after the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in London, which he said all Muslims condemned as \u201cinhumane and unacceptable\u201d. In October 2013 Masroor was alerted by anti-terrorist police that he been threatened by al-Shabaab, the Islamist insurgency group in Somalia, for speaking out. He said he saw the official interrogate others, and \u201cevery single person they took aside was visibly Muslim\u201d. Masroor said he saw the official interrogate a young couple, the woman in hijab. \u201cI saw him do that for a good 10 to 15 minutes, asking them all sorts of silly questions and giving them hell.\u201d He said the couple were eventually able to board the plane. Masroor first applied for an Esta, the electronic travel visa, in 2014 and was refused. After being contacted personally by staff from the embassy, he applied for a business and tourism B1/B2 visa that allows multiple entry to the US. Two interviews and further screening later, he said, he was given the visa and he has since then travelled to the US five times. \u201cIn my mind, the refusal and revoking of my visa was calculated. For me it\u2019s very callous.\u201d He said he received a phone call from the US embassy who said they wanted to sort the matter out. The US embassy in London said: \u201cThe embassy is aware of this matter. We are in contact with the individual and therefore have no further public comment at this time.\u201d Trump, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the presidency, prompted global condemnation this month when he pledged to ban Muslims from entering the US. But the US Customs and Border Patrol, which posts officers at foreign airports, said that \u201creligion, faith or spiritual beliefs of an international traveller are not determining factors about his/her admissibility into the US\u201d. To demonstrate that they can enter the country, CBP said applicants must \u201covercome all grounds of inadmissibility\u201d. There are more than 60 grounds of inadmissibility, divided into categories such as immigration violations, security reasons and health.  Mahmood, whose family spent \u00a39,000 on tickets for the Disneyland flights, told the Guardian that they were not given an explanation when they were told they could not board their plane at Gatwick. But he said he thought it was \u201cbecause of the attacks on America \u2013 they think every Muslim poses a threat.\u201d He told Sky News: \u201cWe had our visas. We had our Estas \u2013 maybe because we are Muslim and had a Muslim name \u2026 they have not given us any other explanation. We have not been in trouble with the police before.\u201d  He also dismissed any suggestion his family had links to a Facebook page that talked about a connection with a radical Islamic group. \u201cWe are a normal family. We pay our taxes. We are normal people,\u201d he said.  Creasy said she knew of other cases of families being denied access to the US. A wide variety of people were affected, she said, but what they all had in common was that they were Muslim. She said she hoped Cameron would be able to assure her that \u201cprejudice\u201d was not becoming a factor in tacking national security. \u201cNobody is suggesting that the Americans don\u2019t have a right to monitor and manage who enters their country,\u201d she told Sky News. \u201cBut as this is happening on UK soil, and does impact on UK citizens and how they feel, I think it is important that we have more scrutiny about what is going on.\u201d Michele Thoren Bond, the state department\u2019s assistant secretary for consular affairs, testified in Congress last week about the state department\u2019s screening process. Bond said the US has revoked more than 122,000 visas since 2001. Of those, 9,500 were pulled because of terrorism concerns.  \u201cWe face dangerous and adaptable foes,\u201d Bond said. \u201cWe are dedicated to maintaining our vigilance and strengthening the measures we take to protect the American public and the lives of those travelling to the United States.\u201d She said all visa applicants\u2019 data is reviewed through the State Department\u2019s Consular Lookout and Support System, a database that has nearly 36m records of people found ineligible for visas \u201cor against whom potentially derogatory information exists\u201d.

She said the department also uses an \u201cenhanced \u2018pre-departure\u2019 initiative\u201d that relies on records to recommend that airlines not allow certain individuals to board US-bound flights.  \u201cAlmost every day, we receive requests to review and, if warranted, revoke any outstanding visas for aliens for whom new derogatory information has been discovered since the visa was issued,\u201d Bond said. \u201cIn those circumstances, the department can and does use its authority to revoke the visa immediately, and thus prevent boarding.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-12-23T20:47:17Z", "title": "UK imam's US business visa 'revoked without explanation' before flight", "sentences": ["He told the Guardian that his brother was once stopped and questioned at Tel Aviv airport about 10 years ago while trying to enter as part of a Middle East tour."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/23/uk-imam-ajmal-masroor-us-business-visa-revoked-without-explanation"}, {"tags": ["Chelsea", "Guus Hiddink", "Diego Costa", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Guus Hiddink believes Diego Costa will channel his emotions and make a positive impact over the second half of Chelsea\u2019s season, and the striker will lead the line in the interim manager\u2019s first game in charge against Watford on Boxing Day. Costa\u2019s contribution was so significant when the London club claimed the title in his first season in English football, but he has been a snarling presence too often in this campaign. The forward has contributed only seven goals for club and country since mid-January, twice incurring retrospective suspensions from the Football Association for incidents on the field. He publicly argued with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho on the stroke of half-time in the Champions League win over Maccabi Tel Aviv.   Related: Chelsea fans boo their own players in win over Sunderland    The Spain international was left out of the games against Tottenham Hotspur, when he flung his bib petulantly towards the coaching staff after completing a half-hearted touchline warm-up, and Bournemouth, and he was one of those singled out for catcalls in last Saturday\u2019s win over Sunderland. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with him a few days and in the past I\u2019ve seen him on television a few times,\u201d said Hiddink of the \u00a332m signing from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. \u201cWhat I experienced in the last few days, and with the last game I watched last weekend, he was in control. \u201cHe was focused more on what he is hired for here, which is to help to score or assist and not go into \u2018other\u2019 things. I think he was well controlled when I experienced him over the last days. I cannot have any complaints about him. I think he can focus on what he is able to do. I cannot guarantee there won\u2019t be an outburst from him, or from other players, but they have to focus on what they\u2019re good at.\u201d Hiddink is aware of Costa\u2019s disciplinary issues and his aggressive style but can empathise with his frustration at being left out under Mourinho, who was sacked last week. \u201cDiego is clearly an emotional guy and there was something with a bib which I read about, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I understand that [frustration]. I remember a long time ago when I was a player, captaining my club team, and I was subbed. I wasn\u2019t used to that, which is why it\u2019s still fixed in my brain even though it was just after the second world war \u2026 \u201cThe manager substituted me at half-time saying I hadn\u2019t done well enough. I thought I\u2019d performed OK so I ripped off my armband and threw it at him: \u2018You make a new captain.\u2019 It was also an emotional reaction born of frustration. What Diego did was a sign of frustration. Sportsmen are allowed to show a bit of emotion but they must know, five or 10 seconds later, that they were wrong.\u201d Hiddink still hopes to secure Didier Drogba\u2019s release from his contract with Major League Soccer and Montreal Impact to take up a role, nominally as a mentor, in his coaching staff. The Ivorian is credited with making a major impact on Eden Hazard last season when the Belgian swept all before him. The playmaker has not managed a goal for Chelsea since Drogba left for Canada and will require a late fitness test on the hip injury sustained against Leicester, Mourinho\u2019s final game in charge, before determining whether he can play against Watford. The champions begin Boxing Day 11 points behind the Champions League places and only three above the relegation zone, though Hiddink has stressed to his players they can still finish in the top four. \u201cThe target is still to get into fourth position because, mathematically, it\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the target is impossible, don\u2019t set it. But I did put that to them when I spoke to my squad at Cobham on Tuesday. \u201cAfter that it\u2019s the Champions League. Then the FA Cup. So two or three targets still to go.

Photograph: Splash News/Corbis    Around the same time, rapper Angel Haze also came out as agender, and spoke about the way in which their gender identity has evolved. It\u2019s an outlook similar to singer-songwriter Ezra Furman, who explained in July: \u201cI am still exploring what [gender fluidity] means. I\u2019ve not quite decided on a gender identity. I may never decide, and that\u2019s all right with me. I am proud to exist in an ambiguous, undecided state.\u201d    Related: Pretty punk rock: how Ezra Furman found freedom in gender fluidity    Don\u2019t confuse these statements, however, with pop\u2019s rich history of theatrical, performative gender-blurring. From David Bowie and Prince\u2019s explorations of androgyny and fashion in the 1980s to the role-switching of Ciara and Beyonc\u00e9 in the 00s, music has been an outlet to expand gender assumptions, to question the socially conditioned roles men and women play \u2013 often in brilliant ways. In 2015, artists such as Young Thug, the Atlanta rapper with a penchant for cross-dressing, continued that tradition.  For the current wave of gender-fluid artists, it\u2019s not about dressing up, but about expressing their core identity. Furman muses about gender on the song Wobbly: \u201cI\u2019ve just been changing genders fluidly / Because they\u2019ll never pin me / Down in the pages / Like a bug or bumblebee / Never classify me, don\u2019t try.\u201d     \u2018They\u2019ll never pin me down\u2019 \u2026 Ezra Furman Photograph: Andy Sheppard/Redferns via Getty Images    For many others, however, gender identity is not necessarily central to their music: it\u2019s innate to their being, but largely incidental to their art. Their lyrical focus is on other subjects. Angel Haze\u2019s Back to the Woods is a devastating study of a break-up and subsequent breakdown. Shamir\u2019s album Ratchet is shit-talking party rap straight out of MySpace circa 2005. Amid the lengthy stoned burblings on Cyrus\u2019s surprise Dead Petz release, the most focused and affecting songs are those where she turns her attention to the environment \u2013 in particular on 1 Sun, a passionate lament for a dying Earth. That song works well alongside the similarly urgent 4 Degrees, the new propulsive single and scorched-earth vision by transgender musician Anohni \u2013 formerly known as Antony Hegarty, an artist who seems to have been casually misgendered by the media for the bulk of her career. Then there\u2019s the transgender deep house producer Terre Thaemlitz, AKA DJ Sprinkles, who has long made gender politics integral to her work. On this year\u2019s brilliant Fresh Insights EP, with Mark Fell, she turned her attention to British class politics and power structures with an extensive sample of a Tony Benn speech. These works may be informed by their creators\u2019 identities \u2013 but are not defined by them. The battle against male/female binaries gained scientific traction last week with the publication of a study by researchers at Tel Aviv University showing that there is no \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d brain, but instead \u201cmultiple ways to be male and female\u201d. These findings, along with the success of artists who identify as gender fluid or anywhere else on the queerness spectrum, are just a small step towards progress in a society so reliant on gender stereotypes that it can seem like propaganda at times. Witness the knee-jerk reaction of the Daily Mail \u2013 one of the worst propagators of \u201cmen are like this, women are like that\u201d narratives \u2013 to the study: \u201cBack in the real world, this simply can\u2019t be true.\u201d       The music world is hardly immune, either: the Lithuanian producer Ten Walls caused outrage with a homophobic rant last June. His comments reflected underlying issues in dance clubs. And in November, the London singer-producer Kindness revealed that homophobic and transphobic abuse from figures feted by the industry made him quit music for several years. Progress may have been made in 2015, but it\u2019s more imperative than ever not to treat it as a fad or selling point.", "publicationDate": "2015-12-28T15:00:34Z", "title": "Gender fluidity went pop in 2015 \u2013\u00a0and it's not just a phase", "sentences": ["The battle against male/female binaries gained scientific traction last week with the publication of a study by researchers at Tel Aviv University showing that there is no \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d brain, but instead \u201cmultiple ways to be male and female\u201d."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/dec/28/gender-fluidity-went-pop-in-2015-miley-cyrus-angel-haze-young-thug"}, {"tags": ["World music", "Music", "2015 in review", "Metal", "Electronic music", "Pop and rock", "Culture"], "article": "Best track/remix: Insanlar \u2013 Kime Ne This amazing slice of Turkish psych disco was recorded live at MiniM\u00fczikhol studios in Istanbul in 2010. Thanks to Honest Jon\u2019s, it finally got a full UK release \u2013 backed by two decent Ricardo Villalobos remixes \u2013 earlier this year. These time-dilating grooves, pitch-shifted vocals (the lyrics are modernised verses by the 17th-century poet Kul Nes\u00eem\u00ee and 16th-century poet Pir Sultan Abdal), acid house beeps and blats, not to mention smoking ba\u011flama jamming, all add up to an essential Balearic-sounding classic that never outstays its welcome, even at 24 minutes long.             Best metal of the year: Melechesh \u2013 Enki Melechesh are so damn satisfying to listen to. Many metal bands, from the west and the Middle East, try to combine extreme metal with Arabic musical traditions \u2013 with a variety of results. But no one nails it like these self-professed Sumerian metal titans, who mix death metal thunder and epic black-metal bombast along Levantine lines. The album features a guest spot by Sepultura founder and world metal enthusiast Max Cavalera and extraordinary art by John Coulthard.             Best soundtrack: Mdou Moctar \u2013 Akounak Tedalat Taha Tazoughai OST Agadez, the largest city in central Niger, is in the Sahara rather than north Africa per se, but like the huge region north of Timbuktu, the city is arguably musically closer to north Africa than central Africa, owing to its Berber and Tuareg heritage. Sahel Sounds\u2019s Bandcamp page has been promising this soundtrack by the Agadez-based Moctar for some time, and it\u2019s finally here. It is the original score to the film Rain the Colour of Blue With a Little Red in It, which charts the creative rise of Mdou Moctar. (It is loosely based on the Prince movie Purple Rain, but there is no Tuareg word for purple, hence the title.) Revel in the song\u2019s liquid guitar playing, carried rattling along on hammering railroad beats.    Akounak Tedalat Taha Tazoughai OST by Mdou Moctar   Best album: EEK ft Islam Chipsy \u2013 Kahraba Out via record label Nashazphone, we finally got to hear the debut album proper by the keyboard king of the Nile delta, Islam Chipsy \u2013 backed by his two drummers, Khaled Mando and Islam Tata \u2013 and it was worth the wait. EEK had already raised expectations with their blistering lo-fi release, EEK Live at the Cairo High Cinema Institute. The tracks that formed the basis of that work \u2013 Trinity and Kahraba \u2013 were revisited on the studio album but now exploding out of speakers in pointillist high definition. Of even more interest were the tracks Mouled el Ghoul and El Bawaba, which created propulsive Levantine techno by deconstructing Egyptian classical traditions and weaving them into something more organic.             Best compilation: 100Copies Mahraganaat 2015 Cairo mover and shaker Mahmoud Refat \u2013 who manages Sadat and Alaa Fifty Cent, and runs the city\u2019s only dubplate-cutting facility and the 100Copies studio \u2013 has been a key figure in popularising the chaabi sound in Egypt and beyond. This compilation album is one of Refat\u2019s productions, and provides a handy snapshot of where this vital scene is at currently. being spotted standing in for one of Islam Chipsy\u2019s drummer\u2019s on a recent European tour            Best mix: Ernesto Chahoud \u2013 Jakarta Radio 010 Middle Eastern Heavens II Mix Here\u2019s an absolutely belting pan-Arabic mix from Ernesto Chahoud, AKA DJ Spindle. Chahoud, who is Lebanese, is the founder of the Beirut Groove Collective, he\u2019s a big collector of Middle Eastern belly dance music and this particular mix, Middle Eastern Heavens II, was made for Jakarta Radio.       Best reissue: Ami Shavit \u2013 Alpha 1 Ami Shavit was a reclusive Israeli artist and professor who has a fascination with technology, psychology, philosophy and sound. He assembled a private collection of synthesisers in 1972 after a trip to the US and started work on his album Alpha Mood. It combined his love of Tangerine Dream and Philip Glass with then-emerging technique biofeedback to create a new style of music that would induce a meditative state. Shavit lost his enthusiasm for the project after being conscripted into the Israeli army in 1973; he was left profoundly disturbed by his work evacuating battlefield casualties during the short-lived but bloody Yom Kippur war. Until, that is, he realised this music offered him a chance to cope with what he had experienced. The LP was released as a tiny run of 500 copies by the Tel Aviv record store Mango. After it closed, the project faded into obscurity. The upstanding folks at Finders Keepers have just given it a typically lovely reissue, however, and now you can modify your own brainwaves with synths in the comfort of your own home.
