Police say the gunman entered the bar on the corner of Dizengoff Street and Gordon Street, an area of cafes, shops and many pedestrians, before firing an automatic weapon at a group celebrating a birthday and then fleeing the scene. Israeli authorities have cordoned off city centre streets to traffic and pedestrians, and are escorting residents to their homes and conducting door-to-door searches . The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, is to hold an emergency meeting later on Friday night.  The motive for the shooting is unclear, but it comes at a time of heightened tensions and a spate of attacks by Palestinians on Israelis since early October. Israel has also been bracing for a possible attack by Islamic State, which has a small but growing following among Israeli Arabs. An Isis audio message circulated on social media last week threatened to strike at Israel \u201csoon\u201d.  \u201cAll possible angles are being investigated,\u201d Luba Samri, a police spokeswoman, told Reuters. \u201cLarge-scale police forces are conducting searches for him.\u201d  Surveillance footage of the shooting released by Israel\u2019s Channel 10 and circulated online shows a group of men and women sitting outside the bar as the gunman opens fire.  More footage from before the attack shows the suspect, wearing glasses and dressed in black, picking up items in a health food shop before putting them back and pulling a weapon from a backpack. He appears to be aged under 30.  When emergency services arrived on the scene, bar stools were scattered across the pavement and wounded patrons were lying on the ground. The injured were taken to the city\u2019s Ichilov hospital and Beilinson Wolfson medical centre.  The victims were named as Alon Bakal, 26, the bar\u2019s manager, and Shimon Ruimi, 30, from Ofakim.  An eyewitness across the street from the attack, who was being treated for shock, described the scene to the media. He said the people inside the bar had been mainly young and had been drinking beer to celebrate a friend\u2019s birthday. Another witness, Noah, told the Jerusalem Post he had come face-to-face with the gunman while he had been waiting for a sandwich in a coffee shop. \u201cHe had a black jacket, black hair, a goatee, and he was holding his rifle with two hands,\u201d he said. \u201cWe dropped to the floor and I remember the smile on his face. He shot once again toward the cafe. Suddenly he fled and people began running after him.\u201d The mayor of Tel Aviv, Ron Huldai, visited the scene soon after the shooting and said he believed it was a \u201cterrorist attack motivated by nationalism\u201d.  \u201cTerrorism attempts to frighten us and disrupt our lives. I urge everyone to take a deep breath, relax and we will take care of this,\u201d he said. It was the first attack in Tel Aviv since a stabbing on 2 November in which two people were killed.  In the past three months, a combination of almost daily attacks by Palestinians and clashes with Israeli soldiers have killed more than 115 on the Palestinian side, 21 Israelis, a US citizen and an Eritrean. Thousands more have been injured.

Hundreds of police had been seeking Nashat Melhem, an Israeli-Arab resident of Wadi Ara, in a controversial and high-profile search. The 29-year-old was wanted for a gun attack on a bar on New Year\u2019s Day that killed Alon Bakal, 26, and Shimon Ruimi, 30, and injured seven. During his escape Melhem allegedly murdered an Arab taxi driver who had stopped to pick him up.     Relatives and friends attend the funeral of Alon Bakal, 26, who was killed in the Tel Aviv shooting. Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images    The police spokeswoman Luba Samri said the gunman was found in a building. She said he came out shooting at Israeli forces and \u201cwas then shot and killed\u201d. Photographs showed Melhem\u2019s body, dressed in black tracksuit bottoms and a T-shirt, lying next to a Falcon sub-machine gun, the same weapon allegedly used in the Tel Aviv attack. The hunt for Melhem has dominated the news in Israel for days, with hourly updates. It is unclear what Melhem\u2019s motives were for the shooting despite suspicions it was linked to recent violence which has seen more than three months of near-daily Palestinian attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers. Unconfirmed reports in the Israeli media after his death suggested Melhem may have been inspired by Islamic State. He had, however, previously been jailed for assaulting an Israeli soldier and trying to snatch his gun, in revenge for the death of his cousin by police fire. Melhem \u2013 who was identified as the Tel Aviv gunman by relatives from CCTV footage in the immediate aftermath of the attack \u2013 was shot dead at a mosque in the Wadi Ara town of Ar\u2019ara, where he was hiding from authorities. The shooting came at the end of a day that saw roadblocks and police reinforcements pour into Tel Aviv and neighbouring cities despite the fact that the focus of the hunt for Melhem had moved further north. The shootings plunged Tel Aviv into a state of fear, with many parents in the city\u2019s north initially keeping their children home from school. During the search, relatives of Melhem \u2013 including his brother and his father, who had reportedly identified him to police \u2013 were arrested.           Father of suspect: \u2018I am sorry for what he did\u2019 - video    According to reports in the Israeli media, the domestic intelligence agency had established in recent days that Melhem was holed up in a building in the cluster of Israeli Arab towns known as the Triangle. Initial reports said that when Shin Bet and police counter-terrorism officers arrived at the mosque at about 4.20pm on Friday, Melhem burst out of the building and opened fire on police before being shot dead in the return of fire. The hunt itself caused friction, with Israeli Arabs complaining about police tactics. That led to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel asking the attorney general\u2019s office to investigate complaints that police searched people\u2019s houses without permission and without showing a search warrant. The Israeli defence minister, Moshe Ya\u2019alon, said Melham\u2019s death \u201cproved once again that the state of Israel will pursue until the end those who seek its harm, anywhere, within the country, along its borders, and far from them, and it will place its hands on them\u201d.", "publicationDate": "2016-01-08T15:35:16Z", "title": "Israeli police kill suspect in New Year's Day Tel Aviv shooting", "sentences": ["A week-long manhunt that has gripped Israel since a fatal attack on a Tel Aviv bar has ended after the suspect was shot dead outside a mosque where he was hiding in his home town.", "Relatives and friends attend the funeral of Alon Bakal, 26, who was killed in the Tel Aviv shooting.", "Photographs showed Melhem\u2019s body, dressed in black tracksuit bottoms and a T-shirt, lying next to a Falcon sub-machine gun, the same weapon allegedly used in the Tel Aviv attack.", "Melhem \u2013 who was identified as the Tel Aviv gunman by relatives from CCTV footage in the immediate aftermath of the attack \u2013 was shot dead at a mosque in the Wadi Ara town of Ar\u2019ara, where he was hiding from authorities.", "The shooting came at the end of a day that saw roadblocks and police reinforcements pour into Tel Aviv and neighbouring cities despite the fact that the focus of the hunt for Melhem had moved further north.", "The shootings plunged Tel Aviv into a state of fear, with many parents in the city\u2019s north initially keeping their children home from school."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/08/israeli-police-kill-suspect-in-new-years-day-tel-aviv-shooting"}, {"tags": ["Property", "Work-life balance", "Life and style"], "article": "I meet Miguel McKelvey by the juice stall on the seventh floor of a glass-and-steel office building in Moorgate, central London. It\u2019s in a large common area with a polished floor, oversized light fittings and views of the Gherkin. All around us young people are lounging on sofas, MacBooks open on their laps. \u201cIs that pumpkin juice?\u201d says McKelvey, a 6ft-something 41-year-old who\u2019s originally from Oregon, peering into the chiller cabinet.    WeLive is their next big launch. It will do for co-living what WeWork has done for co-working    This is WeWork, a co-working space where freelancers and start-ups come to roost, one of seven WeWorks in London and 63 across the globe that McKelvey and his partner Adam Neumann have built in under five years. From New York to San Francisco to London to Amsterdam to Tel Aviv, the model is the same: groovy furnishings, free (hand-roasted, small batch) coffee, free (craft) beer, a mixture of communal and glassed-in office spaces and a young, hard-working clientele who are building apps or offering services or trying to build the new economy, all drawn by the convenience of a monthly lease and the company of like-minded people. It\u2019s like a hip Silicon Valley startup, basically. It\u2019s just that instead of being paid to work there, you have to pay them. A cool \u00a3725 a month per desk if you want a private space. The company is not unique. In fact WeWork is one of any number of co-working spaces in London these days. There are dozens of them, but Adam Neumann, a shaggy-haired Israeli and something of a motormouth who\u2019s 36 but looks about 22, shrugs this off. \u201cThey all came after us,\u201d he says. \u201cThey copied us.\u201d Well, not all of them, I say. The Hub \u2013 another co-working space \u2013 has been around for at least a decade. \u201cWe are very different,\u201d he says. And then: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in local competitors.\u201d     On a mission: Adam Neumann with Miguel McKelvey and DJ Mark Ronson, who performed at a WeWork party. Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images    But then why would he be? WeWork is a shark to other offices\u2019 minnows. Last August it was valued at $10bn. That\u2019s up from $5bn a few months previously, up from $1.5bn a few months before that. It\u2019s a staggering sum, particularly for a company few have heard of. Unlike other Silicon Valley billion-dollar valuations it hasn\u2019t built a new search engine or claimed to have reinvented the wheel. It deals in that most old-fashioned of businesses: real estate.    It\u2019s not about the colour of the wallpaper. It\u2019s being on that journey to redefine success    Neumann doesn\u2019t see it like that, however. He tells me how he\u2019s just come from an event organised by JP Morgan, the bankers who are one of WeWork\u2019s backers, where someone spoke at length about his marketing plan. \u201cOur business is the exact opposite! We don\u2019t need to spend money on marketing. Because we\u2019re part of a mission and a movement. And if you\u2019re part of a mission and a movement, your members will sell you. If they\u2019re doing something great that makes them feel good and they\u2019re excited about it, they\u2019ll post it. Everyone wants to be part of something.\u201d This sort of talk has led WeWork to skyrocket into the same league as Airbnb and Pinterest. It is now the eighth most valuable venture-backed private company in the world. It\u2019s not just a unicorn \u2013 a company that has achieved a $1bn valuation \u2013 it\u2019s a \u201cdecacorn\u201d, a company in the truly exceptional $10bn league. In the lift on the way to our interview, I stand next to a man who\u2019s trying to explain WeWork to a couple of his guests. \u201cTheir genius,\u201d he says, \u201cis that they\u2019ve been valued not as a real estate company but as a technology company.\u201d This is more or less it. \u201cWe happen to need buildings like Uber happens to need cars, like Airbnb happens to need apartments,\u201d says Neumann. WeWork isn\u2019t shared office space at all. It\u2019s a \u201cplatform for creators\u201d.     Hot desks: workers at a WeWork office in New York. Photograph: Cole Wilson/NYT    There\u2019s no doubt that Neumann and McKelvey have pulled off a remarkable trick. There\u2019s a rumour that they may shortly close another round of investment that would value the company even higher. They have investors throwing money at them, and the scale of growth is dizzying. In New York it\u2019s already the biggest lessee of office space in the city, with 20 locations and another 50 in the pipeline for the end of 2016. The first London office only opened in 2014. By the end of this, they\u2019ll have more than 20. But then, Neumann says, WeWork isn\u2019t an office, it\u2019s a community, it\u2019s a network. \u201cHave you seen the app?\u201d he asks and pulls his phone out of his pocket. \u201cIt connects everyone at WeWork all over the world.\u201d Neumann is the talkative one, the overexcitable one. But he and McKelvey are more similar than they are different. They were brought up thousands of miles apart but both raised by single mothers in communal environments. Neumann\u2019s mother was a doctor in Israel and part of his childhood was spent in a kibbutz. McKelvey\u2019s mother formed her own commune in Oregon. \u201cShe banded together with her best friends, a group of seven or eight women who all had kids. And they created a really cool kind of collective environment where we had really strong, awesome moms taking care of us kids, kind of collectively. They were super-proactive women who were interested in engaging in political and social dialogue, and set up an alternative newspaper.\u201d He has three sisters and a brother, two of whom work for WeWork. \u201cAnd my mom is getting older and keeps asking when we\u2019re going to do the equivalent of WeWork for older people. You know, she thinks this environment is so cool. She can\u2019t imagine going into some assisted-living facility.\u201d But then WeAge could perhaps be the next logical step. WeLive \u2013 that aims to do the same for co-living that WeWork did for co-working \u2013 is their next big launch. A prototype is currently being built in Chicago, with one shortly to follow in New York, though Neumann is evasive about exactly what the model will be. Are they going to be apartments or hotels or both?     Fair pay for fair work: cleaners picket offices in New York demanding better wages during a dispute last year. Photograph: Kirsten Luce/NYT    \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a new way of living, day to day, week to week, month to month, year to year,\u201d he says. \u201cYou will be a global citizen of the world. If you\u2019re a member of one, you\u2019re a member of all of them.\u201d Like Soho House? \u201cNo, because there you have to be voted in by a committee. And they care about how you dress and where you work. This is more like a private club that anyone can join.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s going to be ambitious, because everything WeWork does is ambitious. An investor\u2019s presentation was leaked online claiming that by 2018 WeLive will be pulling in $636m. Which is quite a big figure given that it hasn\u2019t actually launched, and no one is clear, as yet, whether anyone will want to live in what BuzzFeed described as \u201clike living in the Disneyland version of startup life\u201d. The Washington prototype will have \u201cneighbourhoods\u201d with expansive common areas, commercial-grade kitchens and dining areas. Think a hipster commune, or college life for grown-ups. I look at my notepad and try to make sense of the figures. \u201cAccording to your internal projections you expect to have 260,000 WeWork members in 376 locations and 34,000 WeLive members in 69 locations. Is that right?\u201d \u201cThe number of members is right,\u201d Neumann says. \u201cLocations will vary. If you have larger buildings, you need fewer locations.\u201d Really? \u201cThose are low numbers,\u201d he adds.     Greed is good: the WeWork founders loved Wall Street, starring Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko. Now their HQ is in the office block where the film was shot. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock    The two met in New York when Neumann was a serial entrepreneur trying and failing in the babywear business and McKelvey was an architect designing retail spaces. They became friends and discovered they shared certain bonds. \u201cIt was even the same movie that made us both initially want to move to New York,\u201d says McKelvey. \u201cWall Street.\u201d Gordon Gekko isn\u2019t very Oregon commune, I say. \u201cYeah, but that\u2019s the point. The endeavour can be many different things. But you still have to be pushing to the extreme to achieve it.\u201d In fairness, they probably are. They have six children between them, and the life of decacorn founder doesn\u2019t involve much sleep. And while they talk the talk and then some, there\u2019s a certain guileless quality to them. They were involved in a high-profile labour dispute in US cities that saw their cleaners, who worked for a contractor, picket their offices demanding better wages and conditions. They responded \u2013 eventually \u2013 by taking the jobs in-house and providing proper employment benefits. Have you learned from that? Are your cleaners in London staff? \u201cI\u2019ll find out,\u201d says Neumann. And he issues Siri with a command. \u201cI\u2019m dyslexic,\u201d he explains. A minion appears. \u201cThey\u2019re agency,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re scaling the company,\u201d says Neumann without a beat. \u201cWe can\u2019t do everything in a day.\u201d     Game changers: people work at WeWork\u2019s office space in New York. Photograph: Emily Anne Epstein/Corbis    The disjunction between the $10bn valuation and the minimum wage most agency cleaners are paid is pretty stark, but also standard in the new tech economy. It\u2019s the price of \u201cdisruption\u201d, the semi-mythical quality that all technology firms claim to have. Uber has disrupted taxis, Airbnb hotels. What exactly are you disrupting? \u201cJust look out of this window and you\u2019ll see it,\u201d says Neumann. We\u2019re in a glass-walled conference room overlooking the atrium of the WeWork building. We can see seven floors of eager young things arrayed over designer chairs, tapping into laptops. \u201cDriving here, I looked into the windows of office buildings in London. People look miserable. See here? They\u2019re working but they\u2019re smiling. What we\u2019re disrupting is work, because it used to be: \u2018I need to work because that\u2019s my job, then I use that money to live.\u2019 I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true. I believe that your life should be about creating your life\u2019s work. I believe that when you do what you love you find higher levels of satisfaction that can compensate for lower income. I actually think most people do what they love because it\u2019s really important to them.\u201d Neumann\u2019s own lightbulb moment, he says, came when he was 28. He\u2019d been running a baby clothes company and \u201cmy wife, then-girlfriend, said: \u2018Look, you\u2019re all confused. You\u2019re trying to make money \u2013 that\u2019s not how you build a great business. What\u2019s your intention? What\u2019s your meaning behind what you do? How is it going to be meaningful to other people?\u2019\u201d If this sounds like something you might read on Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s website, Goop, it may be because his wife, Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, is her cousin. But it\u2019s all very well talking about communities and meaning, but actually WeWork is, first and foremost, a commercial enterprise with a $10bn valuation and not some hippy lovefest. It reminds me of the last episode of Mad Men, I say. Don Draper has a nervous breakdown and ends up in a hippy retreat. The last scene sees him chanting on the grass and then the legendary Coca-Cola ad, \u201cI\u2019d like to teach the world to sing!\u201d, strikes up, the inference being that Don has repackaged the counterculture to do capitalism\u2019s work. Haven\u2019t Neumann and McKelvey just channelled the ideals of their youth into a $10bn business of the type that truly does belong in Gordon Gekko\u2019s old office? Albeit with a feelgood twist?     Adam Neumann: \u2018I believe that when you do what you love you find higher levels of satisfaction.\u2019 Photograph: Chris Floyd for the Observer    \u201cThere are two parts to that story that I think are interesting,\u201d says McKelvey. \u201cThe first is that while I did grow up, as Adam did, in some idealistic formulation that was purposeful, at the same time I grew up in the town where Nike was founded. Where it grew from being something being run out of the back of a car trunk to one of the biggest companies in the world. That was really one of the only bright spots in the town . I\u2019ve seen how business can transform communities. Commerce is a core component of pretty much any successful society. We\u2019re realistic about that.\u201d A friend of mine, I tell him, who had been working for a start-up in another of WeWork\u2019s London offices, had told me that it was the buzziest place she\u2019d ever worked. Though she\u2019d worried that the \u00a3700-plus-desk fee was one reason the startup was running out of cash. Two days later they\u2019d let her go because they needed to cut their costs. Is there a moral there, I ask. Is that the price of being cool? Working in a place with funky wallpaper probably does affect the fabric of your life, but at the same time it\u2019s pretty shallow, isn\u2019t it? Not to mention expensive. \u201cI don\u2019t think coolness has anything to do with it,\u201d says McKelvey. \u201cIt\u2019s being surrounded by people who are on that journey to try and find however they define success.\u201d And the Guardian, Neumann points out, \u201cis our biggest member in the world\u201d. When Guardian US needed larger offices last June, instead of taking a lease on a conventional office building, it entered into a long term agreement for two floors of self-contained office space in a WeWork building in Manhattan. WeWork has made a profit from day one, Neumann says. By carving up conventional office space, and throwing in free coffee and designer chairs, they\u2019ve been able to charge 10 times per square foot more than you can for conventional office space. \u201cWe have 41,000 members as of today,\u201d says Neumann. \u201cAnd I make $10,000 per person per year on a 40% margin. I\u2019ve been profitable since the second month of the creation of this business.\u201d Critics argue that the economics are based on WeWork taking on long leases which are discounted in the first years, meaning overheads will rise in future years. Come a recession, it will have large fixed expenses. But recessions are exactly when small businesses will want to cut overheads and move into shared space, argues Neumann. \u201cDo you want some wine?\u201d he asks. \u201cC\u2019mon!

It\u2019s what inspired some of WeWork\u2019s more fun innovations: an annual summer camp and the free bar. \u201cWe ran the numbers on it and it wasn\u2019t that expensive.

The global accommodation bookings website boasts listings in over 190 countries, including Israel and the \u201cPalestinian Territories\u201d, as the West Bank and Gaza are described on the company\u2019s website. But while a search for Airbnb properties in the Palestinian Territories turns up rentals in the Palestinian cities of Ramallah and Nablus, properties in settlements such as Efrat, Ma\u2019ale Rehavam and Tekoa are listed as being in Israel.   Related: Deflating Airbnb: when a rental turns into a party venue | David Shariatmadari    Those Jewish settlements are beyond \u201cthe green line\u201d \u2013 the border defined in the 1949 Armistice Agreements between the armies of Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria after the 1948 war. Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory are generally viewed as illegal by the international community and have long been seen as a major roadblock to a viable Palestinian state. Under the Israeli government, led by Binyamin Netanyahu, settlement expansion has surged. The Jewish settler population grew by 23% between 2009 and 2015, to over 400,000 people, in comparison to an overall population growth rate of 9.6% inside Israel. \u201cPeople come to us knowing that Efrat is part of the state of Israel, and are not concerned with safety and security issues,\u201d said Lily, the host of a cottage advertised on Airbnb at NIS471 (US$120) per night. Efrat is a Jewish settlement that was established in 1983 on occupied Palestinian land, 12km south of Jerusalem and 6.5 km east of the green line. Lily told the Guardian that she has lived in Efrat for 30 years and that her property is \u201cpart of Israel\u201d. \u201cThis is our country and we mean to stay,\u201d she said. Guests would have to travel through two Israeli military checkpoints to reach Lily\u2019s cottage. \u201cThere are risks everywhere in Israel and in the world \u2013 Paris, California, Tel Aviv, Chicago,\u201d she said. Airbnb spokesman Nick Papas suggested that Airbnb\u2019s platform incorporates an element of choice in location listings, which are powered through Google Maps. Google Maps automatically suggests an address for hosts, but they can choose to change it, and in some cases Google Maps does not automatically suggest a country, Papas said. \u201cWe follow laws and regulations on where we can do business and investigate concerns raised about specific listings,\u201d Papas said, but he would not respond directly to questions regarding which laws and regulations it considers itself bound by. In locations where both the Israeli and Palestinian governments claim jurisdiction, it\u2019s unclear which country\u2019s rules Airbnb is following.  Airbnb is increasingly popular in Israel, which is home to a thriving tech startup scene. (PriceWaterhouseCooper valued 2014 sales and IPOs of Israeli tech companies at nearly $15bn.) There are 13,000 Airbnb listings in Israel, and in 2014 the company\u2019s rentals were used by 128,000 guests, according to Haaretz. Husam Zomlot, ambassador at large for Palestine, condemned the company for hosting listings on occupied land. \u201cIt\u2019s not only controversial, it\u2019s illegal and criminal,\u201d Zomlot said. \u201cThis website is promoting stolen property and land. There will come a time when companies like this, who profit from the occupation, will be taken to court.\u201d Another Airbnb host, Itzhak Levit, advertises a three-bedroom home featuring an idyllic stone courtyard and lush green grapevine in Tekoa, a Jewish settlement on Palestinian land, for NIS810 (US$206) a night. Tekoa is located in Area C, which is under full Israeli military control. Under the Oslo Accords, it should have been returned to the Palestinian Authority by 1999. Levit told the Guardian that Tekoa complies with international law. \u201cIsrael has never agreed that the Geneva Convention resolutions applied to the territories occupied in 1967,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to Israeli law, Tekoa, and the vast majority of settlements in the West Bank, are authorized settlements, therefore entirely legal and consistent with national law.\u201d Staying in an Airbnb rental in a settlement \u201cfacilitates the commission of the crime of establishing settlements\u201d and \u201ctherefore aids and abets the crime\u201d, said John Dugard, professor of international law and former UN special rapporteur on Palestinian human rights. Similarly, Airbnb \u201ccould in theory be prosecuted in [a European Union] country with aiding and abetting the commission of a crime\u201d due to \u201cmaking money from property built on [an] illegal settlement\u201d, Dugard says. Airbnb did not respond directly to queries about its standing under international law. Other rentals listed on the Airbnb website as being located in Israel are in Kfar Eldad, Nokdim, Ma\u2019ale Adumim, Nofei Prat and Keidar. A few of the hosts specify that their properties are in \u201csettlements\u201d or Jewish neighborhoods, but nowhere on the listings does Airbnb mention the Israeli occupation, list security and safety concerns, or note the location of more than 100 permanent Israeli military checkpoints which guests may have to pass through in order to reach the accommodations. The listings in explicitly Jewish neighborhoods also raise concerns about whether all of Airbnb\u2019s users would be welcome in the rentals. In December, researchers at Harvard released a report finding \u201cwidespread discrimination\u201d by Airbnb hosts against users whose names were perceived to be African American. Levit told the Guardian that he would be willing to host a Palestinian guest. The other hosts approached by the Guardian declined to comment on who would be welcome.  \u201cDiscrimination has no place on our platform and we investigate any claims we receive,\u201d said Papas.

It came from his father, who was a youth team coach at Baladeyet Al-Mahalla in Egypt, and it was put into practice when Elneny was very young. \u201cI remember that my father demanded that I went to bed with the ball,\u201d Elneny says. \u201cHe said: \u2018You have to connect with the ball.\u2019 He started coaching me when I was three years old. His biggest wish was that I became a professional footballer.\u201d The subliminal approach was a novel touch but Elneny has fired the journey that has taken him through the ranks of Egyptian football to Basel in Switzerland and now Arsenal with a remarkable single-mindedness.   Related: Mohamed Elneny completes \u00a37.3m move from Basel to Arsenal    The north London club\u2019s new \u00a37.4m signing, confirmed by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger after Wednesday night\u2019s draw at Liverpool, had little time for school and he would meet up with friends to have kickarounds that he never wanted to end. \u201cAs a kid, I often played for 10 hours on the street,\u201d Elneny says. \u201cI think that\u2019s when I learned to run and run without a break.\u201d Elneny, 23, has the lung capacity of a long-distance athlete. In last season\u2019s Champions League, up until the last 16, which was when Basel were eliminated by Porto, no other player had covered more ground and it has been the same story in this season\u2019s Europa League, in which the Egypt international has helped what is now his former club reach the last 32. Arsenal are acquiring something they badly need: another body in central midfield to ease their injury-stretched ranks \u2013 and this one comes with durability stamped all over it. They are also acquiring a mind that has become attuned to the nuances of the defensive midfield role and, more recently, has added more forward-thinking accoutrements. In the first half of the season, Elneny scored five goals for Basel in all competitions; across his previous two and a half seasons at the club, he had a total of four. Elneny went to Basel in January 2013 from El Mokawloon in Egypt, initially as a nervous trialist \u2013 \u201cI had one overriding feeling: fear,\u201d he has said \u2013 but, having impressed, he earned a six-month loan deal. He was quiet and shy, and everyone in Basel at the time remembers him as living in the shadow of his great friend Mohamed Salah.     Mohamed Elneny celebrates at the end of Basel\u2019s Europa League match with Os Belenenses in November 2015. Photograph: Gualter Fatia/Getty Images    Salah, who had joined Basel from El Mokawloon in the summer of 2012, was outgoing and confident, always talking and joking. Elneny spoke only in Arabic and Salah acted both as his translator and big brother-style chaperone. Elneny did enough to win a four-year contract at the end of the season, with Basel paying \u20ac800,000 for him, but it was, paradoxically, after Salah left for Chelsea in January 2014 that he emerged from his shell. Elneny was forced to talk directly to the people at the club; his English improved and his integration was fast-tracked. His English is now very good. Elneny started to speak more on the pitch, too, and he became more of a presence. At first, he had been a no-risk kind of player, routinely looking square or backwards from his position as the more defensive midfielder in a 4-2-3-1 formation. As the first receiver of the ball from the defence, however, he began to demonstrate his ability to provide a platform for the team to play with simple and urgent passes. Elneny is no muscular enforcer, rather an intelligent reader of the game, who knows when to hold and when to intercept. He is the ultimate team player, a manager\u2019s dream because of his work-rate and lack of ego, and he has grown, particularly this season, in which he has been Basel\u2019s best player. The club have replaced him with Alexander Fransson, a 21-year-old Swede from IFK Norrkoping, and the fee Basel have received from Arsenal is substantial for them. Yet there is no escaping the feeling that they are gutted to lose him. Elneny draws strength from his family and his faith. Married with a young son and a baby on the way, he is a devout Muslim, who prays five times a day. He takes his prayer mat on away trips and he observes Ramadan strictly. \u201cAllah decided that I was going to be a footballer and that I was going to sign for Basel,\u201d Elneny said, in an interview with Aargauer Zeitung last year. \u201cWhen it comes to making decisions, I listen to him. If there is at some point an offer from another club and Allah tells me not to go, I won\u2019t go. And the same goes for the other way around.\u201d Elneny is not the type to attract unwanted publicity away from the field or be distracted by the bright lights of the city. In Basel he lived in the tall residential tower that is part of the club\u2019s St Jakob-Park stadium complex; his commute to work was via lift and escalator. For an illustration of his cold-eyed focus, consider the episode at the start of the 2013-14 season, when Basel were drawn to play Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Champions League third qualifying round. There was huge pressure in Egypt on Elneny and Salah not to play and Salah sparked a political stir when he said he would not travel with the squad to Israel. He would change his mind but he refused to shake hands with the Maccabi players before both ties. Elneny simply put his head down and got on with the job of being a footballer. He went through with the pre-match handshakes.     Mohamed Elneny celebrates with trophy and son after Basel won the Swiss Super League in 2014. Family \u2013 and religion \u2013 are cornerstones of his life. Photograph: Michael Kienzler/Bongarts/Getty Images    As Elneny prepares for the latest phase of his career, there is the inevitable concern about his lack of Premier League experience. He has fared well in European ties for Basel against Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur, however. Those against Liverpool in the Champions League last season were the highlight. Elneny starred at Anfield in the final group fixture, when Basel earned the draw they needed to qualify at Liverpool\u2019s expense for the last 16 but the earlier tie at St Jakob-Park was as emotional for him. It was the night that his father made a first trip over from Egypt to watch him and, after the famous 1-0 win, he was pictured hugging his son, with tears in his eyes. Elneny had another dream, which was to score with him in attendance. Two months ago, when his father came to a game in Basel for only the second time, Elneny scored the equaliser against Fiorentina in the Europa League. The bond between father and son runs deep. They are ready to share further memorable moments.", "publicationDate": "2016-01-14T10:34:04Z", "title": "Arsenal\u2019s Mohamed Elneny: the tireless street footballer who slept with a ball", "sentences": ["For an illustration of his cold-eyed focus, consider the episode at the start of the 2013-14 season, when Basel were drawn to play Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Champions League third qualifying round."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jan/14/arsenal-mohamed-elneny-basel"}, {"tags": ["Employment", "Global development", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Israel", "Women"], "article": "Tamara Alarja walks between the factory floor, where machines making and dyeing fabrics are whirring, and her office, where 20 orders are in progress. The Palestinian woman, 29, is managing the only remaining textile factory in historic Palestine. Not only does the business have a history of female leadership, it is defying the Israeli occupation and bridging the Israeli-Palestinian divide by servicing both markets. The business started from Tamara\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house in the Palestinian Christian town of Beit Jala in the mid-1960s. Leila Alarja, now 79, and her husband, Geries, 85, had little money in the 1960s \u2013 Geries worked as a waiter in a local hotel and Leila started sewing at home. They had nine children. \u201cIt grew slowly over time. When her children were teenagers she had gotten good at sewing and had expanded to two sewing machines,\u201d says Tamara. Her grandmother started getting orders for school uniforms. Eventually demand grew, and the family added more sewing machines. Geries quit his job and created a fabric knitting and dyeing section in their home. By the 1980s, Arja Textile Company was fully operational and in the 1990s two tall factory blocks were built around the couple\u2019s house, employing more than 120 local Palestinians.   Inside her house today, Leila sits playing on her iPad and checking on her grandchildren on Facebook as she enjoys her retirement.     Leila and Tamara inside Leila\u2019s house in Beit Jala. Photograph: Kate Shuttleworth    \u201cI started this whole thing with two sewing machines. Thank God for everything,\u201d she says. Today, the factory produces half of its own fabric (the rest is imported) and employs 70 people, of whom 50 are women, a figure that defies a trend in the Palestinian territories. In a speech to mark International Women\u2019s Day in 2015, the president of the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Ola Awad, said only 19% of Palestinian women participated in the labour force, compared with about 71% of men. Samia al-Botmeh, policy adviser for the Palestinian policy network al-Shabaka, says the low participation rate of Palestinian women is striking as girls have high education rates. \u201cBy 2000, Palestinian girls had higher school enrolment rates and lower dropout rates than boys,\u201d she says. \u201cPalestinian girls\u2019 primary and secondary school enrolment ratios are also higher than boys in the entire Middle East and North Africa region.\u201d According to Awad, the gender pay gap is also wide, with men earning, on average, 106 shekels (about \u00a318) a day, while women earn 81. Across the Palestinian territories, nearly a quarter of the workforce is unemployed, and the economy is stagnating, propped up by foreign aid. The long-running conflict means restrictions on the movement of people and goods. The Palestinian economy is heavily reliant on Israel, which buys 90% of Palestinian exports, including raw material and produce. According to PalTrade (Palestine Trade Center), exports have long lagged behind imports to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In 2012, the last year for which figures are available, Palestinian imports were worth $3.83bn (\u00a32.58bn), while exports stood at $739m. Almost three-quarters of those imports came from Israel, followed by Turkey and China. Keeping Arja Textile Company open has been a struggle in the face of two intifadas \u2013 Palestinian uprisings against Israel, which have weakened Palestinian businesses. The explosion of Chinese imports and steep overheads for water, electricity and fuel have only made things harder. Defying these odds and keeping the factory doors open is a challenge for Tamara, who left towards the end of the second intifada to study. The costs of running the factory and supplying it with enough water to carry out the dyeing process are high. But the business is still selling up to 5,000 items a week and making \u00a32m in sales a year. \u201cIt\u2019s a struggle every day to keep this factory going because we have to deal with so many expenses and difficulties with Israeli checkpoints, timing and accurate papers for the drivers. But the more difficult it becomes the more determined I become that I want to keep this going.\u201d On one side of the factory, Muslim Palestinian women wearing headscarves are producing dresses for conservative Muslim women. On another side orders are being filled for Christmas sweatshirts. Pre-packaged orders sit next to a pile of T-shirts for Christian pilgrims visiting Jerusalem\u2019s Old City. Tamara flicks through a booklet of cotton items that are in high demand in Israel. It includes leggings, crop tops, shorts, wrap dresses and harem pants \u2013 things you\u2019d see on the beach in Tel Aviv. Her two biggest customers are a distributor in Israel that serves secular markets and another in the West Bank city of Hebron catering to Muslim women. This business framework has been criticised as Palestinians come under pressure to boycott Israel. \u201cI understand boycotting is a peaceful way to demonstrate what you\u2019re feeling against Israeli policy, but at the same time life has to keep going and you have to choose your battles,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of people I know have stopped buying basic products made by Israel, like dairy products. Honestly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a legitimate way to protest [against] Israel\u2019s policies. \u201cI told the Palestinian ministry of commerce that they have so many campaigns on boycotting Israeli products, but they could have used the same money to advertise Palestinian products,\u201d says Tamara. She sees Israel and Palestine as one market: \u201cI still believe it\u2019s the same market \u2013 one country. No matter how you try to divide it, it\u2019s the same environment. \u201cI know politics divide us and they want us to have two states, but if you look at things from the ground, I think it\u2019s one country: if Israel\u2019s economy is not doing well, our economy is not doing well,\u201d she says.", "publicationDate": "2016-01-15T07:00:09Z", "title": "Cut from a different cloth: Palestinian textile company bridges the divide | Kate Shuttleworth", "sentences": ["It includes leggings, crop tops, shorts, wrap dresses and harem pants \u2013 things you\u2019d see on the beach in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/15/palestinian-artextile-company-gender-politics-israel"}, {"tags": ["UK criminal justice", "UK news"], "article": "Wing-Commander Bullus and the supporters of his birching bill, which will come before the Commons on 13 February, must be given credit for sincerely believing that the reintroduction of corporal punishment for crimes of violence would reduce the number of such crimes, but past experience does not confirm their theory.

Further reasons advanced by Wing-Commander Bullus in favour of his bill are that to birch offenders costs less than to imprison them for long periods and would relieve the strain on our overcrowded prisons. Part of the spurious attraction of corporal punishment as a remedy for crime is that it seems so much simpler than long-term measures of penal reform, but all it does in fact is to satisfy a primitive desire for taking revenge on criminals, while distracting attention from the constructive steps, such as more prisons, more police, and the improvement of bad social and family conditions, which are the most hopeful ways of reducing crime.

It did push through what is seen as a successful intervention in the Korean war while the USSR was away from the table. \u201cIt got worse before it got better in 1990 when the security council suddenly sprang into life, that tension that had been built into the system with that kind of caste system, the gap with the permanent five members at the table and the other countries on the outside,\u201d said Lord Hannay, former British ambassador to the UN and chair of the UN all-party parliamentary group. During the cold war the UN also oversaw one of its most complex operations, in Cambodia, which Hannay describes as being the \u201cSyria of the 1980s\u201d. \u201cWe were sitting around wringing our hands while a wretched number of people were being murdered and because of disagreement between the great powers nothing was being done about it.

Since then the security council has adopted 79 resolutions on the conflict, including one in 2002 calling for a two-state solution. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult issue, because anything we do requires getting over the US veto. American constraints are the constraint that we are living with,\u201d says Matthew Rycroft, current British ambassador at the UN. But his predecessor Sir Jeremy Greenstock adds: \u201cObama is the most pro-UN, pro-multilateralism president I can remember \u2026 the failure of the UN\u2019s initiatives hasn\u2019t been from lack of effort but from a lack of the stars being aligned as far as vetoes are concerned.\u201d And more enforcement might be better than more rules: \u201cWe don\u2019t need more resolutions on protecting civilians, we need to actually start protecting civilians.\u201d The Balkans, 1991-today     Muslim refugees from Srebrenica pass by UN armored personnel carriers, 13 July 1995.

Kofi Annan, UN secretary general from 1997 to 2006, described this as the worst crime in Europe since 1945, saying that, while blame lay \u201cforemost with those who planned and carried out the massacre\u201d, the UN had \u201cmade serious errors of judgment rooted in a philosophy of impartiality\u201d, and Srebrenica would haunt the history of the UN forever. Sir Kieran Prendergast, UN under-secretary-general from 1997 to 2005, said Kosovo, whose declaration of independence split the security council, was an example of the UN being curtailed: \u201cThe security council has a large \u2018too difficult\u2019 tray, it\u2019s good at responding to crises when they erupt but rather bad at nipping them in the bud. In Kosovo Kofi wanted to go in and make an assessment early but he was warned off as the Brits did not want that.

We had this tiny peacekeeping force that couldn\u2019t cope and most of the membership unwilling to get into a shooting war because of the trauma of what had happened the previous year in Somalia where the peacekeeping operation had collapsed and bodies of American soldiers were dragged through the streets.\u201d He said lessons learned may well mean the UN doing better today at peacekeeping in South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Mali.

Photograph: Natalie Behring-Chisholm/Getty Images    Having been blocked from condemning the Soviet intervention in the country in the 1980s by the Russian veto, the security council\u2019s main concern over the intensifying conflict in Afghanistan was the humanitarian situation and the growing terrorist activities. It imposed sanctions on Taliban finances in 1999. At the same time UN agencies were feeding 1.3 million Afghans. America, demanding that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden, began the longest war in its history in 2001, supported by the UK. Troops under UN mandate were deployed the same year in Kabul and Nato joined in 2003. Elections were judged to be a success, and UN-backed peace talks have since taken place between the Afghan government and the Taliban. In May 2014, the US said its combat operations were ending, and in October that year the British left Helmand, which has since been largely retaken by Taliban-loyal forces. The war has killed tens of thousands \u2013 more than 4,000 UN soldiers and civilian contractors, more than 15,000 Afghan national security forces members, and 20,000 civilians. Former United Nations diplomat Professor Mukesh Kapila says: \u201cThe UN is the only legitimate global force we have, but it\u2019s a mixed picture. Britain was in a noble position when it started the UN security council, but what has gone is that moral leadership, as the early giants of the UN have been replaced by Whitehall warriors and civil servants, while self-serving tactics undermine the UN. \u201cWhen you are on the 38th floor of the UN building in New York you look down on First Avenue and the people look like insects, and for all the glorified policy and intellectualising the people involved still appear as insects.\u201d Iraq, 2003     Colin Powell holds up a vial that could contain anthrax during his address to the UN security council, 5 February 2003. Photograph: Timothy A. Clary/EPA    The US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 went ahead without a security council resolution. Kofi Annan declared it \u201cillegal\u201d and Colin Powell later said he \u201cregretted\u201d the tub-thumping speech he made to the security council demanding intervention, during which he held up a vial of anthrax. The disastrous conflict was a low point for all concerned. Sir Jeremy Greenstock says it was clear at the UN that both America and the UK knew Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction as early as 1998 and, although the UN operation in Kuwait had been successful, there was massive international unease at toppling the dictator in the fevered post-9/11 world. Dr Francesc Vendrell, a Catalan former special envoy to the UN, says the UK undermined its independence by \u201cits willingness to subordinate its views to the US\u201d, which had \u201calways trimmed the UK\u2019s wings\u201d . Lord Hannay says that the conflict damaged the UK\u2019s reputation abroad \u201cquite a bit\u201d, but adds: \u201cThere is nobody who believes we would do anything like that again.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-01-17T00:05:11Z", "title": "Seven key questions in 70 years of the UN security council", "sentences": ["But it was our biggest ever peacekeeping operation and the security council did in the end do the job it should have done at the beginning.\u201d Israel/Palestine, 1947-today     Jubilant Tel Aviv residents celebrate with what would become the Israeli flag after the UN decision to approve the partition of Palestine, 29 November 1947."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/17/70-years-un-security-council-key-moments"}, {"tags": ["Chefs", "Marriage", "Food & drink", "Family", "Life and style", "Restaurants", "Work & careers"], "article": "Itamar When we first met, it was quite loose. Neither of us ever thought we\u2019d be in a relationship or get married. Sarit We met in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant near Tel Aviv, where I was sous chef. Our first impressions of each other were not good. He used to come into work very late and he was super-messy. I\u2019d just got back from working at a Michelin-star restaurant in London and I could not stand the way he was. I was very career-oriented and I did not ever want to have anything to do with a chef \u2013 I\u2019d had a bad experience in London. Male chefs are usually horrible \u2013 macho, sexist. Itamar It\u2019s a bad idea to date a chef. Always a bad idea. Sarit I really fought against it but Itamar was very persistent. Itamar We\u2019ve changed each other. I don\u2019t think I would have moved to London and started a restaurant if I hadn\u2019t met Sarit. Sarit He\u2019s taught me loads about relaxing and enjoying life, and also about taking risks. We say it all the time: if I\u2019ve added stability and organisation to Itamar\u2019s life, then he\u2019s added a laissez-faire approach to mine \u2013 remembering that we need to live as well as work. I didn\u2019t really have that before. Sarit Running a restaurant together allows us to combine our strengths. Upstairs is mostly Itamar\u2019s domain because he\u2019s better at talking with customers, whereas I\u2019m usually downstairs doing the admin. And then we split the kitchen. It\u2019s much better having two people tasting dishes and being brutally honest about it than doing it on your own and thinking your food is amazing. Itamar We\u2019re not people who take well to criticism from outside, but we can be quite honest and harsh with each other, because we\u2019re in it together and ultimately pushing for the same thing. Sarit It\u2019s one of the main reasons we ended up starting our own restaurant. Even if we fight quite angrily at times, we know we want the same end results \u2013 to have the best dish, the best customer experience, the best working environment. A good example: Itamar wanted to change the bar upstairs to a tiny corner so we could spread the tables out a bit more, but the reality is you cannot work from that tiny space. We argued about this forever and finally changed it in a way that did add a little bit of space. My instinct would have been to just leave it the way it is. Itamar It\u2019s often a case of being devil\u2019s advocate when we argue. Sarit We might even agree on something at the start and then argue about it for three days until we reach exactly the same conclusion. Itamar But it\u2019s important \u2013 and more enjoyable \u2013 to have a bit of \u2026 Sarit \u2026 a tiff about something. We prefer to really let it out. We\u2019re not very English in that aspect. You build up a lot of anger and anxiety and it explodes in a much worse way, whereas we explode every day \u2013 it\u2019s more workable like that I think. It also helps to have a language that no one else in the kitchen speaks. For a long time, we didn\u2019t want to hire anyone Israeli because they would understand our arguments.     Sarit and Itamar at Honey &amp; Co. in 2013. Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen for Observer Food Monthly    Itamar In a way I couldn\u2019t imagine doing this with anyone else \u2013 a friend or a business partner. You have to be pretty close to make it work. Sarit The mistakes we\u2019ve made have mostly been about dealing with other people. In the beginning, because we usually have different opinions on things, we would deliver conflicting messages [to staff]. We had to learn to have conversations together so both opinions could come out at the same time. Itamar You think, \u201cOh, it\u2019s my restaurant, I\u2019ll do it how I want.\u201d But you need to pause and say, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take it up with her and we\u2019ll see.\u201d With the food, especially, we try to talk to each other before we talk to the kids. Sarit We call the team our kids and a lot of them call us mummy and daddy. It\u2019s a joke but it\u2019s also a serious thing. We do care what\u2019s happening in their private lives, that they\u2019re OK, that they\u2019re healthy. And it\u2019s very hard for us when someone moves on. We have abandonment issues. Itamar They stab us in the heart. Sarit He says to them, \u201cYou were at the top of your life with us, now it all goes downhill.\u201d [Laughs] Itamar In a lot of ways, I think we do have our own family. It\u2019s not the traditional mum, dad, kids and two-thirds of a dog, but it\u2019s not any less of a family. Sarit It\u2019s important to remember we\u2019re in charge. I don\u2019t think you can leave it and see if it becomes some kind of beautiful commune, because it needs channelling, controlling. In a family, the mum and dad ultimately make the decisions that are for the best of the family, whether the others like it or not. Itamar Even if everything goes tits up tomorrow, the important bit stays. We had fun before we opened the restaurant and we\u2019ll have fun after. Sarit And hopefully we\u2019ll find fun things to do in-between. Itamar There\u2019s a lot of talk at the moment about work/life balance. People say you need to draw the line, but it\u2019s quite an artificial separation. If you do something that you find enjoyable and satisfying, then this is your life, your fun time. Sarit The separation is different when you\u2019re in this industry. We can sit in the restaurant and have a nice time, or we can be at home working, testing a recipe, and it\u2019s no less fun. We have this thing where we\u2019ll go on a holiday, and for the first day we don\u2019t want to talk about work, but then your head relaxes and you\u2019ll think, oh, we should change this dish or install acoustic panels or something. Itamar But I think we\u2019re quite good at saying to each other, take the day off.

Less than two weeks ago four of its men and youths were killed in a single day in what Israelis say were two separate attacks by those who died. One was on the outskirts of Hebron, the second at the Gush Etzion junction where three young men \u2013 Muhanad, Ahmad and Alaa Kawasbeh \u2013 were killed, all of them cousins.   Related: Gush Etzion junction \u2013 the West Bank roundabout that became a symbol of escalating violence    Since then three more have died. As remarkable as the over-representation of this one village in the Palestinian death toll of about 150 since the beginning of October are the close relationships between those killed.  The dead are brothers, cousins and friends from a place some locals are now calling the \u201ccapital of the martyrs\u201d. Almost half of the deaths have occurred at a single location \u2013 the Beit Einun junction, where a settler bypass leads to the illegal Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba. The deaths have taken place one after the other, a number during attempted attacks, in a seemingly unstoppable cycle of anger and revenge, which can be traced back to a single event \u2013 the killing of 27-year-old Abdallah Shalaldeh last year during an arrest raid by undercover Israeli soldiers on a Hebron hospital, when he was shot leaving a toilet on a ward. Abdallah\u2019s cousin Mahmoud Shalaldeh, aged 17, was next to die. He was shot on the day of Abdallah\u2019s funeral during a stone-throwing clash with Israeli soldiers. Mahmoud\u2019s brother Khalil was killed two months later during an attempted knife attack on a nearby Israeli checkpoint. It is hard to see at first what makes Saer, with a population of 25,000, different from other large West Bank communities. Located five miles from the flashpoint southern West Bank city of Hebron, the village and its satellites sprawl along road 60, the the territory\u2019s main thoroughfare.   Map of Saer   Its main entrance has been regularly sealed off by Israeli soldiers stopping all traffic. Some residents work in nearby quarries, whose lorries trundle through the village. Others work in agriculture or construction, several thousand as illegal day labourers in Israel. Although Hamas won the municipal elections here in 2005, Saer\u2019s mayor is from Fatah, the political faction of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. Of the 10 residents who died before last week, Hamas claimed five of them on \u201cmartyr\u201d posters, Fatah claimed the other five. At his house, Mohammed, the father of Mahmoud and Khalil, was still greeting mourners last week. A stonemason by trade, he recalled the circumstances of his sons\u2019 deaths. \u201cAfter [their cousin] Abdallah was killed it didn\u2019t just affect the family but all of the young people in Saer. Abdallah was killed on 12 November. But I didn\u2019t see Mahmoud at Abdallah\u2019s funeral. There were so many people there. We missed each other.\u201d     Hospital staff examine the ward where Abdallah Shalaldeh was shot dead last during an Israeli undercover raid in Hebron, an incident many in Saer blame for the cycle of violence. Photograph: Peter Beaumont for the Guardian    As the funeral broke up, Mahmoud headed to one of the locations around the area where youths clash with Israeli security forces. \u201cI heard what had happened after the afternoon prayers. He had gone to the clashes. I saw the body. He was shot from behind as if he was bending over when he was hit. He died the following day. \u201cKhalil was completely changed by his brother\u2019s death. For 54 days he was almost totally silent. When he did speak it was like he was oblivious. He became a mysterious person to us.\u201d Khalil was killed this month on the same day as the three cousins from the Kawasbeh family.  The Israeli military say he took a knife and went to attack soldiers at the nearby Beit Einun checkpoint.  \u201cTwo of my five sons are dead,\u201d Mohammed added. \u201cIt is not normal. They have all been affected by the environment that they are in. But it is not in my hands to do anything about it.\u201d Half a mile away, also in the centre of Saer, another family sits in a mourning tent for the Kawasbeh cousins. According to an Israeli military spokesman the three, dressed in dark clothes, attempted to attack Israeli security forces at the Gush Etzion junction where they were shot and killed.     Ziad Kawasbeh (right), father of Muhanad, one of three cousins from Saer killed by Israeli forces during an alleged attack at the Gush Etzion junction. Photograph: Peter Beaumont for the Guardian    Ziad, the father of Muhanad \u2013 one of the three dead cousins \u2013 sketched out a similar story to the Shalaldeh family. He said another relative was killed a few days before his son and his nephews, although Ziad denies his son was planning an attack. \u201cHe was working and living as a labourer illegally in Tel Aviv,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cAnd he was newly married. If he had wanted to attack someone he had plenty of opportunity in Tel Aviv. If I had discovered he wanted to be a martyr I would have put him in the house and locked the door. \u201cBut you have to understand, Saer is very close. It is like one big family. What happens affects everybody here.\u201d Ziad agreed that each death sets up the risk of another. \u201cPeople are afraid of what their boys will do.\u201d In her office, Samira Khalaikah, a Palestinian Legislative Council member, outlined another reason why Saer has become such a focus of violence. \u201cIt has several key confrontation areas. The village itself borders Route 60 and it is close to Hebron.\u201d She too pointed to the chain of events triggered by the killing of Abdallah Shalaldeh during the hospital raid. Khalaikah supplied another link, one connecting the two families who have lost most members.  \u201cAhmad Younis Kawasbeh, who was killed two days before his three cousins, couldn\u2019t bear the death of his friend Mahmoud Shalaldeh. It all leads back to Abdallah\u2019s death in the hospital.\u201d Khalaikah\u2019s phone rang. A neighbour\u2019s son had just been killed, she said. Her assistant showed us a picture on her mobile phone of a young man lying dead in a trickle of blood, a knife beside his hand.  The streets of Saer were suddenly electrified as people asked for news of the dead man or got in cars to go to the family home. Within minutes it became clear that there had been not one but two deaths at two separate locations. A few hours later the names emerged. One was 23-year-old Mohammed Ahmad Khalil Kawasbeh, the young man in the picture on the mobile phone.   The second, it transpired, was 17-year-old Adnan Hamid al-Mashni, who the Israeli army alleged drove Kawasbeh to the scene of his attempted attack and who was also shot and killed after fleeing the scene.

The resolution was agreed by the EU foreign affairs council on Monday after Greece, one of five countries Israel had hoped would block acceptance of the resolution, backed down following a weekend of wrangling and pressure from Palestinian officials and other European diplomats. The resolution emphasised that EU agreements with Israel applied only to the State of Israel within the pre-1967 border, adding that the \u201cEU must unequivocally and explicitly indicate their inapplicability to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967. This does not constitute a boycott of Israel, which the EU strongly opposes\u201d. Hinting that further measures may be in the pipeline, it continued: \u201cThe EU will continue to closely monitor developments on the ground and their broader implications and will consider further action in order to protect the viability of the two-state solution, which is constantly eroded by new facts on the ground.\u201d The resolution was drawn up amid mounting frustration from a number of European governments over the moribund state of the Israel-Palestine peace process, and is intended to increase pressure on the rightwing coalition government led by Binyamin Netanyahu.   Related: Airbnb lists properties in illegal Israeli settlements    The adoption of the document is the latest diplomatic setback for an increasingly isolated Israel after Netanyahu\u2019s failure to derail the Iran nuclear deal, which came into force over the weekend.  Intended as a follow-up step to the EU\u2019s decision last year to insist that products produced in Israeli settlements were labelled as settlement products, not as Israeli, diplomats involved in the drafting of the language told the Guardian that the resolution was important in underlining the policy of strongly \u201cdifferentiating\u201d between the state of Israel and illegal settlements in the West Bank. Among the countries pushing hardest for the resolution were France, Ireland and Sweden. Ahead of the meeting on Monday of the council, which is required to have a consensus on the resolutions it adopts, Israel had strongly lobbied Greece, Cyprus, Hungary, Bulgaria and Czech Republic.  It had hoped to persuade the five countries to form a bloc to prevent the adoption of the resolution and force a debate of European foreign ministers, a tactic Israel anticipated might weaken any language. According to sources familiar with the conversations, Greece \u2013 which was unhappy with the EU labelling initiative \u2013 was the last holdout before folding under diplomatic pressure on Monday. Speaking at a press conference, Bert Koenders, the Dutch foreign minister, warned against putting the Middle East peace process on the backburner. \u201cThe message is the same,\u201d he said. \u201cThe European Union is concerned about the situation in the Middle East. We call for de-escalation. We think the political horizon is important.\u201d The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said the document, agreed unanimously by the 28 EU foreign ministers, was \u201ca good and common basis for our common position and also our engagement in the Middle East peace process\u201d.  The strongest paragraph of the communique underlined the illegality of Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.  It said: \u201cRecalling that settlements are illegal under international law, constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible, the EU reiterates its strong opposition to Israel\u2019s settlement policy and actions taken in this context, such as building the separation barrier beyond the 1967 line, demolitions and confiscation \u2013 including of EU-funded projects \u2013 evictions, forced transfers including of Bedouins, illegal outposts and restrictions of movement and access.  \u201cIt urges Israel to end all settlement activity and to dismantle the outposts erected since March 2001, in line with prior obligations. Settlement activity in East Jerusalem seriously jeopardises the possibility of Jerusalem serving as the future capital of both states.\u201d   Related: West Bank risks being plunged into chaos in 2016, warn Palestinian officials    Israel fears that the reiteration of the EU\u2019s foreign policy at this time might be used to introduce further punitive European measures against Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank and Golan Heights, which have been repeatedly called for by European diplomats in Israel.  The adoption came as the US ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, sharply criticised its policies in the occupied West Bank on Monday. Speaking at the Institute for National Security Studies conference in Tel Aviv, Shapiro said Israel had two standards for law on the West Bank \u2013 one for Israelis and one for Palestinians.  \u201cToo much Israeli vigilantism in the West Bank goes on unchecked,\u201d he said. Echoing the strong language from the EU, he said a two-state solution was the only way to prevent Israel from turning into a binational state, noting that the US was \u201cconcerned and perplexed\u201d over the Israeli government\u2019s continuing policy on the settlements. Netanyahu\u2019s office quickly responded, saying that Shapiro\u2019s remarks \u201cwere unacceptable and wrong\u201d. It said in a statement: \u201cIsrael enforces the law against Israelis and Palestinians. The Palestinian authority, which continues to incite and refuses to negotiate, is responsible for the freeze in negotiations.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-01-18T19:25:56Z", "title": "EU adopts resolution criticising Israeli settlement activity", "sentences": ["Speaking at the Institute for National Security Studies conference in Tel Aviv, Shapiro said Israel had two standards for law on the West Bank \u2013 one for Israelis and one for Palestinians."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/18/eu-adopts-resolution-criticising-israeli-settlement-activity-occupied-palestinian-territories"}, {"tags": ["Art and design", "Photography", "Culture", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Media", "Gaza", "World news"], "article": "At first it\u2019s so abstract you can barely make sense of it: hundreds of squat little beige boxes, punctuated with little black squares. But the featureless boxes in the photograph are in fact ramshackle dwellings, stretching as far as you can see, in the Balata refugee camp near the West Bank city of Nablus. Look a while longer and the image starts to open up: everywhere, in every direction, are hastily improvised dwellings constructed with little infrastructure, and little regard for human life. What appears visually confusing ends up being morally unfathomable. The photograph, shot by Nir Kafri, appeared in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz in 2001, and it forms the opening salvo of To Whom It May Concern, an insistent, eye-opening exhibition in New York of photojournalism from one of the world\u2019s most important newspapers. Haaretz is Israel\u2019s oldest daily, just shy of a hundred years old. \u201cIt is the very model of a liberal newspaper,\u201d the Guardian affirmed in 2014 \u2013 a bastion of seriousness, scepticism and oppositionality in a country with little time for nuance. Its detractors, inevitably in a region of such angry divisions, decry the paper as far-left or even anti-Israel, but in fact it espouses a disappearing sort of Zionism, one intertwined with liberal values and freedom for all. In a lengthy 2011 profile, the New Yorker editor David Remnick called Haaretz \u201carguably the most important liberal institution\u201d in Israel. But as the country continued its drift to the right, and as oppositions between Israelis and Palestinians hardened further, Haaretz has grown lonelier \u2013 and thus even more vital.     Palestinian family members sit in their home, which was destroyed during Operation Protective Edge (Tsuk Eitan), in al-Tuffah district in Gaza City. Photograph: Ann Paq/Activestill.org    This show opens with more than a dozen front pages of Haaretz, in both its Hebrew and newer English editions, and the photographs above the fold limn a country and region passing through massive upheaval. Yitzhak Rabin is assassinated. Bombs fall on Hebron. Bush comes to town. A child, injured in a skirmish with Israeli soldiers in Khan Yunis, is carried away by a grim-faced relative, his little body collapsed into the elder man\u2019s arms like some awful contemporary piet\u00e0. The front page, as the second intifada intensifies and as the Israeli government moves further and further to the right, becomes a daily showcase of competing fundamentalisms and their horrific effects on citizens \u2013 in Israel and, far more frequently, in Palestine. Above the fold, on the front page of 11 June 2013, appears a sea of young men in the occupied territories: most all of them wear white and gray, but one boy, in a canary-yellow football kit, raises his arms skyward in pride and anger, after the IDF\u2019s attempted assassination of a Hamas leader. Israel\u2019s continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the absurdities and indignities to which Palestinians remain subjected, inform many of the most demanding photographs in this show. As Remnick reported, no mainstream news organization has devoted as much attention as Haaretz \u2013 attention from photographers as much as writers \u2013 to telling the story of daily life in the occupied territories. We see an old woman in a white chador walking along the infinite-seeming security wall, which divides family members of the town of Abu Dis. Children look out over the bombed-out ruins of Gaza City after the 2014 bombardment. In the south of Nablus, a boy bleeds from his head after Israeli settlers threw rocks at his family\u2019s car. Photojournalism can never fully testify to war and suffering, but these images do something we writers struggle to achieve: they take us from the abstract realm of politics and conflict to the reality of bodies in pain.      A protest in Rabin Square in central Tel Aviv calling for the end of the war in Gaza. In the background, city hall is lit to represent the Israeli flag. Photograph: Tomer Appelbaum/Haaretz    But Israel is much more than a place of war, and \u201cthe land\u201d from which Haaretz takes its name is riven by other conflicts too. Political disputes between secular Jews and the ultra-Orthodox play out in the streets, where we see a young man in street clothes remonstrate with two dozen black-clad Haredim. Ethiopian Jews, one of the most disfavored minorities in the state, march against aggressive policing and for economic justice. Then there is the no-holds-barred, back-stabbing arena of Israeli politics, deeply imbricated with dirty money of both local and foreign extraction. We see the leathery Sheldon Adelson, the American billionaire (and new owner of the Las Vegas Review-Journal) sitting on a red velvet seat, beside an empty chair bearing the name tag Benjamin Netanyahu. And in a bitterly ironic photograph shot by Emil Salman in 2014, motorists in Jerusalem step out of their cars and stand silently on the road to observe a minute of silence on Holocaust Memorial Day. In the background, only half-complete and piercing through a brilliantly blue sky are the hideous towers of the Holyland building project. Numerous political figures have been convicted of bribery in connection with Holyland \u2013 among them Ehud Olmert, the former prime minister, who is also pictured here in the dock of the supreme court. The towers stand as their own sort of memorial, for a better Israel than this corrupt and grubby one. A better Israel is what Haaretz has been advocating all these years, of course, and amid the conflict and war are visions of community, justice, and even beauty. Tens of thousands of Israelis flood into Habima Square in Tel Aviv, part of the impressive social justice protests that turn Israel upside down in 2011. Or else we see whole crowds of Palestinians celebrating Eid in the same city \u2013 exceptionally permitted to cross the border from the West Bank to mark the end of Ramadan.

Photograph: Nir Kafri/Haaretz    That photograph, in which hundreds of Palestinians watch the sun set over the Mediterranean for the first time in their lives, sent me back to one of the greatest pieces of journalism I have ever read. An Israeli writer, Ilana Hammerman, headed to the West Bank to see a Palestinian friend \u2013 only she, after all, can cross the internal border. The friend had a teenage relative, and she and her two friends were bored out of their mind in the little West Bank town; they wanted to go to a city, have fun, go shopping, meet boys. So Hammerman, in her car with Israeli number plates, smuggled them through the checkpoint and chauffeured them down to Tel Aviv, where for the first time they hit the Dizengoff Center mall, ate ice cream and finally strode down to Banana Beach, frolicking in the waves just an hour away from their home but totally off limits. It was a wrenchingly beautiful story, and reminds us that individual Israelis and Palestinians are so much more complex, and so much more magnanimous, than the governments and paramilitaries that purport to represent them. The story appeared in Haaretz.

I started earning a living on the beaches of Netanya, near Tel Aviv, taking pictures of young mothers sitting on the beach with their children. I also worked as a kindergarten photographer and a taxi driver. I didn\u2019t have any ambition \u2013 it was nice simply taking pictures of families. I might have followed in the steps of my father, a dentist; or my mother, a concert pianist. But the second world war changed my life. I spent most of it in the Western Desert, moving heavy machinery in a depot near Haifa, and selling cameras to the soldiers from the Middlesex Battalion. My family, who stayed in Vienna, all died in the gas chambers. When I returned to Vienna at the end of 1946, it was a shambles. Now I wanted to show what life was like in the aftermath of the war. I wanted to tell the truth about the pain, death and destruction Europe was dealing with, as it tried to find a way out of the disaster. The mood was: let\u2019s start rebuilding; let\u2019s see how we can create a better world out of what the Nazis and the Soviets left behind.   Related: \u2018The gun was loaded\u2019: photographers on the shots that changed their lives    Vienna was divided into occupation zones: British, French, Soviet, American. Obviously, an occupied country felt occupied, and you didn\u2019t know if your friend at the chancellery who was there last night would still be there the next morning, or would have been sent to Siberia by the Russians. I was drawn to photograph political figures, because they were the people running the show. In 1955, there was talk about a four-power conference where the big players \u2013 the Soviet Union, the US, Britain and France \u2013 would discuss how to make a long-lasting peace. The mood was uplifting, full of hope. For the first time in the history of diplomacy, the Big Four were sitting together and talking \u2013 and the future of the civilised world depended on it. About 30 photographers were at the airport in Geneva, where the conference was held, all waiting for the American President Dwight Eisenhower to arrive and be greeted by Max Petitpierre, the Swiss president. Most of the photographers had flashes and some had newfangled devices where the film was wound on by a motor. I had my Leica and that was all. I looked at them all and thought: \u201cThere is usually some hitch \u2013 when their film is being moved along, that will be when there\u2019s an interesting picture to be taken.\u201d And that is exactly what happened. A beam of light caught Eisenhower, leaving Petitpierre in the shadow. It seems as if I was the only photographer that day who got the picture just right: in other people\u2019s shots, the light was on Eisenhower\u2019s stomach, or his hat was obscuring his face. After the conference came the Austrian state treaty, granting the country independence. Then in 1956, the Hungarian revolution happened \u2013 but it was put down by the Soviets, and the west did nothing. I realised that, although reportage pictures have the power to move the world, they do not have the power to change it.      Magnum photographer Erich Lessing    CV Born: July 1923, Vienna.

Blindspot works by accessing a user\u2019s contacts, allowing them to send text messages, videos, or photos to anyone without the receiver knowing who the message came from. To read the message, a recipient needs to download Blindspot, but would not know who sent it. It has been developed by a company with a number of celebrity investors, including the singers Nicki Minaj and will.i.am and the Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. The app has been downloaded half a million times since its launch, and is being heavily advertised in Israel with billboards showing a smiley face with an eye patch.  Members of the country\u2019s parliament, television pundits and young Israelis have joined in criticism of the app. The controversy has seen an anti-Blindspot video, which depicts a family covering a coffin decorated with the app\u2019s logo, go viral. It bears a similarity to Secret, an app that was closed down after campaigners said it was used to bully people online. The app was developed by the technology company Shellanoo Group, whose chairman, Oded Kobo, described it as \u201cwacky and clever, yet so simple to use\u201d. But it has been dogged by criticism that it is being abused.     An image from the video depicting a family covering a coffin decorated with the app\u2019s logo. Photograph: Anti-Blindspot campaign    Negative reviews have been posted on the iTunes store as part of the campaign to shut the app down. \u201cDELETE FROM THE STORE IMMEDIATELY!!\u201d wrote Shirloveit. \u201cJust think about all those bullies out there, waiting for an opportunity like this to hurt others just for their fun! IT\u2019S TERRIBLE! Do not let them use this app just because you\u2019re making money out of it!!\u201d \u201cPure evil \u2013 don\u2019t let your kids use it,\u201d added Yaniv B. \u201cThis app can ruin lives by anonymously shaming online. Terrible idea, has no benefit whatsoever. Uninstalling...\u201d The campaign comes amid growing pressure against online bullying and abuse on social media. Twitter last year announced new measures against abuse after a leaked internal memo admitted it had failed to tackle the issue. Among those who have weighed into the controversy is Israeli blogger and screenwriter Eli Weissbart, who criticised the app in a widely shared post. \u201cThis cute smiley is an open channel for humiliation, a gaping doorway for evil,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter whether your child is the victim or the victimiser.\u201d Since the app\u2019s launch, complaints have appeared on social media, many apparently from young people saying they had been targeted for abuse. The app also came under fire this week from members of a Knesset committee. During a meeting, Israeli MP Merav Ben Ari said she was concerned that young people would be bullied and that there was even a risk of people killing themselves. On Monday, the technology committee in Israel\u2019s parliament met to discuss the app and a letter was read out from a young person who had suffered from online bullying. Ben Ari said that \u201cduring the two hours we didn\u2019t hear even one thing that was good about this app\u201d. She added: \u201cIf you are going to say something nice, you wouldn\u2019t send it anonymously.\u201d  But David Strauss, a spokesman for Blindspot\u2019s parent company, said anonymity online was \u201csimply an evolution, whether people like it or not\u201d. The issue of suicide is particularly sensitive in Israel at the moment, with memories still fresh of the case of a civil servant who killed himself last summer after being accused of racism on Facebook \u2013 an accusation he denied. Adam Shafir, a reporter on an Israeli technology television show, told Agence France-Presse there had already been cases of bullying. \u201cYou have a lot of sexual harassment \u2013 guys send girls remarks about their bodies, about the things they would like to do to them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then there are specific threats, people saying things like \u2018I will kill you.\u2019 \u201d     An advert for Blindspot in Tel Aviv. Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty    Shafir highlighted the case of a couple who were travelling in Europe when they received a message on Blindspot. \u201cThe wife got messages saying her husband is cheating on her,\u201d he said. \u201cThe man denies he is cheating, but this can destroy marriages.\u201d Shellanoo Group has rejected criticism. \u201cBlindspot is an app for sending anonymous messages that was launched less than a week ago, and has already become the top-ranked app in the Google Play and App Store stores,\u201d the company said in a statement this week. \u201cUsers can send messages to each other from within their contacts. Nevertheless, any user can block any message by pressing a single button. If only we could act that way in real life when someone around us acts inappropriately. \u201cThe messages aren\u2019t public, and we take precautions in the app,\u201d the statement added. \u201cBlindspot isn\u2019t the first anonymous app and certainly not the only one, but it is undoubtedly the most popular.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-01-22T11:10:22Z", "title": "Anonymous messaging app Blindspot heavily criticised  in Israel", "sentences": ["\u201cAnd then there are specific threats, people saying things like \u2018I will kill you.\u2019 \u201d     An advert for Blindspot in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/22/blindspot-anonymous-messaging-app-israel-under-fire"}, {"tags": ["Travel", "Sao Tome and Principe holidays", "Africa holidays", "Greece holidays", "Europe holidays", "India holidays", "Asia", "Canada holidays", "North and Central America holidays", "Cuba holidays", "Germany holidays", "Romania holidays", "Secret Cinema"], "article": "Afua Hirsch on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Principe, Africa At first I felt critical of the many Africans I spoke to who had never heard of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Principe. It is after all an African country, albeit one of the smallest (population 194,000) and remotest \u2013 an archipelago of tiny islands nestled in the watery armpit of west and central Africa, deep in the Atlantic, with Gabon to the east and Nigeria to the north. Then I realised how difficult it was to get there. Back then, in 2002, there was one flight a week from Gabon, and one from Lisbon which ferried the children of Portuguese aristocrats to secretive resorts in pristine bays at the foot of volcanos carpeted in the country\u2019s endless virgin rainforest. I had graduated from university just months before and in my shiny new NGO job chose S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 as the location for an international conference I was organising. But getting hundreds of dignitaries there meant chartering planes, training hotel staff and even having new phone cables laid. I arrived exhausted. My VIP guests were in a strop, not because the plane I\u2019d chartered looked ripe for the scrap heap, but because it had no business class seats. I was not in the mood to fall in love. But I did. I\u2019d never seen volcanoes so alive with forest or the Atlantic such a seductive, sleepy blue. I\u2019ve never felt so close to a history I thought much older \u2013 no African language is spoken in S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, but, rather a creole version of Portuguese. The inhabitants are all descended from slaves, Portuguese outcasts and Jewish children dumped on the islands hundreds of years ago. People lived in the ruins of decayed colonial palaces as if the plantation had collapsed the day before. It felt separated at birth from another part of the world \u2013 the Caribbean or South America \u2013 with its palatial palms and crumbling fa\u00e7ades, ridgeback mountains and Portuguese towns. But it\u2019s Africa all right. Billions of barrels of oil have achieved what natural beauty and human charm never did and placed it firmly on the map. The oil workers have been streaming in since S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and I had our first encounter: I hope people seeking Africa\u2019s greatest beauty will, too.

Photograph: Philippe Renault/Hemis/Corbis    I\u2019ve heard it time and time again. New Brunswick? \u201cOh, I drove through it to get to Nova Scotia.\u201d Acadians? \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Cajuns? \u201cOh\u2026 Cajun cooking\u2026 Music\u2026 Louisiana!\u201d But New Brunswick in eastern Canada is much more than a place to drive through. And its northeastern coast will not just delight but enlighten you about a people who survived a British colonial expulsion from here in 1755 and returned to establish a vibrant culture and proud sense of self. The Acadians are the descendants of the French who colonised the region from the 17th century, and if you visit on 15 August, Acadian national day, you\u2019ll be loudly reminded of that by the tintamarre. At 17.55, on the dot, people dance in the streets, beating pans and blowing horns, to make as much noise as possible to let the world know they\u2019re still here. A dark day in imperial history, when thousands were forced to flee south \u2013 including to Louisiana, where the term Acadian became \u201cCajun\u201d \u2013 is now a vibrant celebration of survival. A drive along the winding shore takes you through a picturesque landscape of simple cottages hugging the coastline and rambling farmhouses set back on rolling green fields (except in the freezing depths of winter, when all is snowy white). Lobster traps and the Acadian flag are ubiquitous \u2013 a tricolour to honour French ancestry, with a bright yellow star, representing the Stella Maris, the star of the sea, that guides sailors in storms. To know even more about this charming corner on the sea, visit the Acadian village, a functioning replica of life through the late 18th to the mid-20th centuries. Inside the original wooden houses of the first Acadian families they are carrying on with daily chores, but are never too busy to warmly welcome visitors.

Photograph: Alamy    The Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe arm of the Danube Delta is gratifyingly hard to reach: by ferry from the river port of Mahmudia, which departs between two and five hours late, laden with essential goods that folk in Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe on the Black Sea shore cannot buy in their village shop. The boat navigates bends in Europe\u2019s mightiest river, past oxbow lakes and through newly dug channels. A small crowd makes its way through the mud to the jetty with donkeys to collect the shopping. There are two cars in Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe: one belongs to the policeman, the other to the government environmental officer. During my first visit in 1995, they had crashed and were being repaired. I frequent Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe thanks to an ornithologist friend from Bucharest. His metier \u2013 along with caviar from local sturgeon \u2013 is the ostensible reason to be there: a wonder of eagles, egrets, vultures, cranes, ibises, cormorants and pelicans. Fishermen weigh their wares on iron scales in a market that has not changed for centuries. They say that when the sea howls it means a life lost in revenge for man\u2019s abuse of the oceans. Sure enough, last time it howled, the bodies of a father and son washed ashore.    I was supposed to catch the dawn boat, but the captain was dancing on the table, drinking vodka    One day the ornithologist took me out on the river in his little boat. And there it was: the howl, a heart-stopping scream, and the river heaved. The ornithologist\u2019s jovial face was suddenly terrified and intense as he gripped the outboard motor to carve a way through the current and driving rain. After 50 minutes of thinking that any of them could be my last, we made it to the bank. On the night they return, the fishermen gather, after a brief visit home, at the only bar in town: a window cut into a brickwork house. Outside which they sit to drink vodka that comes in bottles the size of a standard beer \u2013 that\u2019s the unit per round, and I confess it\u2019s tough going. In keeping with the vulgarisation \u2013 and invasion by tourism \u2013 of anything authentic in Romania (as everywhere else), there is now a Green Village Resort in Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe: some people on TripAdvisor seem to have had horrendous experiences there, which can only be a good thing. On one final night in Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe, the ornithologist and I were supposed to have gone to bed early, to catch the dawn boat back to Mahmudia, but the captain was dancing on the table, drinking vodka, so there didn\u2019t seem to be much hurry. When the ferry did leave, I was as ever sad to leave with it, into the quickening eastern sky and the brave dawn of newly capitalist, tourist-friendly Romania.

Photograph: Heinz Wohner/Getty Images    As a hideaway it could hardly be better named. The island of Hiddensee sits on Germany\u2019s north-eastern tip and is one of the country\u2019s sunniest, windiest locations. Despite being just under 11 miles long and, at its broadest point, only two miles wide, even in the height of summer it is surprisingly easy to find a spot in the dunes or in its expansive heathland to escape the daytrippers who arrive en masse from neighbouring R\u00fcgen. While to English ears at least its name sounds like a clever reference to its remoteness, it is in fact a nod to the legendary Norwegian king, Hedin, who is believed to have fought here. Whether for a love interest or for gold, opinions are divided, but in any case Hedin\u2019s Oe \u2013 or Hedin\u2019s Island as it was named while under Danish rule \u2013 has more or less stuck. In the 1920s the Baltic island was a magnet for intellects and artists. The families of writers Thomas and Heinrich Mann, G\u00fcnter Grass (whose wife was a Hiddenseer), sculptor K\u00e4the Kollwitz and the Freuds were among the regulars, as was Danish film star Asta Nielsen, who had a playful circular holiday home, the karusel. The Freud connection endures to this day thanks to Esther Freud\u2019s 2003 novel The Sea House, which recalls the holidays her great-grandfather Sigmund and his family enjoyed on the island before they and many Hiddensee residents were banned by the Nazis. The family found some sort of solace in the village of Walberswick on the Suffolk coast which, with its grassy sand dunes, large skies and a home they called \u201cHidden House\u201d, reminded them of the beloved Baltic island they were forced to forsake. I\u2019ve been coming here regularly for more than a decade, and it has never lost its appeal as an ideal place for escape. It is car-free, with no golf courses and, at around six hours by train and ferry from Berlin, close enough for a long weekend. Aside from swimming, walking and biking, there are three bookshops, a theatre, some pubs and a tent cinema. Otherwise there\u2019s little more to do than ask locals to teach you how to fish for pieces of amber after a storm, or literally \u201cmilk\u201d the bright-orange buckthorn berries for their vitamin C-rich juice. It continues to be a draw for writers and artists, too. Lutz Seiler\u2019s 2014 novel Kruso, which won the German Book Prize (out in English this year), is set in Hiddensee during the heady days before the fall of the Berlin Wall. It\u2019s a poetic tribute to the island as well as offering an insight into life here during the East German dictatorship for those wanting to flee to the west (Denmark is hardly more than an energetic swim away) as well as those who simply sought internal exile amid the wind and the waves from the every day strains of the GDR.

Photograph: Luke Pyenson    The hills just beyond the outskirts of the Palestinian town of Beit Jala \u2013 Bethlehem\u2019s other half, though never say that to a native \u2013 are a special place. Ancient limestone terraces descend towards Battir and the cool valley of Wadi Refaim, with its fig trees and gazelles. Small apricot orchards hem in the old stone farms that dot the slopes. Just outside the town is where you find Hosh Jasmin, an organic farm and restaurant opened in 2012 by filmmaker, sculptor and restaurateur Mazen Saadeh. Fifteen minutes\u2019 drive from the western edge of Jerusalem, Hosh Jasmin is both circumscribed by \u2013 and defies \u2013 Israel\u2019s continuing occupation of the West Bank. Located in Area C, under Israeli security and administrative control, it is reached \u2013 for us at least \u2013 through the Walajah checkpoint, passing the Israeli settlement of Har Gilo. The Israeli separation wall is visible from Hosh Jasmin in the distance, a snaking line of grey concrete. Despite the reminders, it is a place to escape for a while from the continuing violence and tensions, popular with Palestinians from the neighbouring town, Jerusalemites and internationals. Visiting on a \u201cblue moon\u201d last year, a group of musicians had been assembled. The waiters, encouraging us to stay, suggested if everyone was drunk enough a midnight walk would be initiated. Named for the Syrian-style hosh compounds, tables are set on rough-hewn wooden platforms under the trees, areas designed for sprawling on cushions, although there is a small indoor area for when it rains and a fire pit for the winter chill of the Jerusalem hills. Elsewhere there are hammocks and swing seats. Below is Saadeh\u2019s farm, including olives that Hosh Jasmin presses for oil, fruit trees, hives and rabbit runs and the restaurant\u2019s arak distillery. Its location is a double-edged sword. The lack of building permits for Palestinians in Area C has preserved the area\u2019s rustic feel, and it also means that the accommodation Saadeh provides for those who stay beyond when the fire burns down is a treehouse and several tents. This Christmas those of us in the press corps celebrated lunch outdoors with turkey and Palestinian starters and Taybeh, the Palestinian beer. On other days the food is dictated by the seasons, although there are no actual menus. Specialities include rabbit zarb, a tagine-like dish cooked in an underground oven, Palestinian dumplings and chicken musakhan with flatbread in its rich sauce of onions and sumac served on a flat bread. For me, the best time is the late afternoon and evening, watching the hills bruise purple into night as the fire starts. Then, Hosh Jasmin is a place to forget \u2013 for a while at least \u2013 all of the area\u2019s troubles. Fly to Tel Aviv from London with British Airways from \u00a3304 return (ba.com).

Photograph: Getty Images    The sound of cymbals, drums and song followed us the whole morning, across hillsides of wild iris and through deodar forests, the musicians hidden and the music sometimes thinning to silence but always returning again when mountain paths brought us and the mysterious band back within earshot. We met them at last outside a tea shack on the Jalori Pass, more than 3,000m high, villagers escorting a goddess swathed in gold and scarlet to the Dussehra festival in Kullu town, two days\u2019 walk away. She would be jostled and photographed there by thousands of tourists, but we met her almost alone, our paths crossing at just the right moment.    We asked one man why he had turned down the chance of a lucrative city life. \u2018I missed these mountains,\u2019 he said    It seemed like serendipity but our guide, Prem Singh Bodh, had known more or less when the group would arrive, after decades hiking trails in this corner of north India. Friends got to know him while living in Delhi, and had invited me to join them on a 10-day trip to an area that is little visited by tourists, but full of life and natural beauty. We met pilgrims at ruined hilltop forts that have become windswept temples. Kids raced up to one campsite from the nearest village and convinced us to lose a game of cricket on an impossible slope. Their teacher was a postgraduate with a taste for Victorian literature \u2013 \u201cThackeray, Kipling, Dickens\u201d \u2013 who grew up the other side of a nearby peak. We asked why he turned down the chance of a more lucrative city life after graduating. \u201cI missed these mountains,\u201d he said simply. Between those meetings, we had the forests, fields and temples to ourselves for hours at a time. We slept in tents on high meadows beside a woodland lake and spent a couple of nights in spartan but charming lodges built for colonial administrators more than a century ago. We were camping, but it felt luxurious, with air mattresses, ponies to carry gear so we travelled with just a small day pack, and even a cook. A few bars of coverage would occasionally appear on the phones of people trying to keep in touch with home. But most of us were happy to be out of contact and suspended in time. It was often surprising, always beautiful and entirely special, and because we arranged the trip directly with Bodh\u2019s company, Zingaro, it was a relatively affordable \u00a350 per person per day \u2013 including tents and lodges, food and guides.

Photograph: Matilda Temperley    Five hundred miles north-east of Windhoek, the dusty town of Opuwo is nestled into the edge of Kaokoland\u2019s arid hills. The local inhabitants are bare-breasted, clad in goatskin and covered in ochre. These are the Himba. They live alongside Herero women wearing dresses reminiscent of 19th-century German colonialists with hats shaped to resemble cow horns. Unusual characters arrive in this small trading hub to replenish their supplies at the area\u2019s only garage and supermarket before disappearing back into the surrounding desert.  Opuwo is the entrance to the remarkable Kaokoland that lies to the east. This is an area so empty and vast you can drive for days without seeing another soul. I picked up a local guide in Opuwo and set off in the 4x4 (complete with camping gear and roof tents) I had rented in Windhoek. Within an hour, a sandy riverbed stalled our progress and throughout the day the roads became ever more dubious. It doesn\u2019t take long until you are obliged to stop being precious about your vehicle and surrender to the inevitable punctures, scrapes and scratches and the hundreds of kilometres of unknown terrain that stretch before you. As you drive, red rocks give way to white deserts, plains become mountains and colours evolve with the day.    The fact that I was childless at 33 never failed to cause mirth among the villagers    After two days of driving, we came across the first sign of human habitation and were surprised to see a rusty petrol drum on a rocky outcrop with signs advertising cold drinks and fuel. It turned out the attendant Himba women had nothing to sell and were rather hoping we could give them some food. It was undoubtedly the oddest petrol station I\u2019ve ever seen. The occasional villages we then passed were welcoming, perhaps because the Himba\u2019s ancestral land rights and autonomy are well recognised and the increasing cultural tourism in the area is largely on their terms. When I visited last February, the villages were mainly populated with women and children as the men were with the herds looking for pasture. The villages were full of laughter, most of which was at my expense. The fact that I was childless at 33 never failed to cause mirth. In the first village I camped in, I was given a live chicken that they insisted I leave with. At the next village, I was made to dance out stories. There was something magical in being innocently teased in this matriarchal society. Kaokoland stretches for many hundreds of kilometres from the Hoanib river north to the Kunene river, which is the border with Angola, and one of the least-populated places on earth. In Kaokoland, you cannot fail to marvel at your insignificance. Kaokoland stole my heart on my first foray and I have been looking for an excuse to return ever since.

Photograph: Alamy    Greece has always been about the light. The shadows lie in its luminosity. For years I have tried to swim into the sun, a day\u2019s fading rays made sweeter still by water\u2019s brush. The quest for light can take you places that you might otherwise never know; beaches you might never see. In the summer of 1984, on a whim propelled by adventure, I holidayed on Naxos, crossed it by bike and got into a little cargo ship that took me to a place that at the time seemed so ethereal, so elemental, so remote, it has remained with me ever since. That place was Koufonisia, an isle made up of parts \u2013 upper Koufonisi and lower Koufonisi \u2013 and over the course of a spring and summer I would come to know both. Before the internet, before mass travel, before Greeks got fat on EU funds, upper Koufonisi had a smattering of white, flat-roofed houses, one fish tavern, one meat tavern, one tourist (a French painter), one road and a girdle of virgin beaches, ornamented by turquoise sea. In the spring its was carpeted with poppies \u2013 just as Naxos to its west and Amorgos to its east; and in summer covered by herbs carried on a breeze. But although perfect, it was to be trumped by the discovery of lower Koufonisi: uninhabited (bar the odd shepherd), with even bluer seas, better shorelines and a pure light that began at the end of the cave I swam into with the passing of each day. Several years later I returned to upper Koufonisi, this time making my home a rented villa looking out to sea on the isle\u2019s southern extremity. The water was aquamarine, as seductively translucent as it had been all those summers ago, but it was a world away \u2013 a world discovered by Greeks who had built second homes, Italians who went for the tourist season and beach bars that served cocktails to the dulcet tones of Icelandic composers. Lower Koufonisi had changed, too: its cave no more (thanks to a landslide), its beaches the preserve of the droves who descended from fishing boats now busily crossing the 200m channel that separated the isle from upper Koufonisi. But the light was still there, the sky and sea co-joined by a brilliance that was unbeatable and blue. And, as I had done all those years before, I swam into the sun at the end of the day, backstroking through the flat blue, eyes fixed on the brilliant skies and the rocks they framed, knowing I had arrived where I had begun, in the magic of Greece.

Photograph: Buena Vista Images/Getty Images    \u201cGo to that bar that serves the pi\u00f1a coladas, cross the bridge, then the road to Bacunayagua is on the left.\u201d Those were typical driving directions in Cuba in the early 2000s. Then, it was a country without road signs. The reason was never clear. One theory was that every time a sign was put up it was stolen so that its metal could be turned into car parts. Another was that Fidel Castro, determined that the nation remain on a constant military footing, was convinced that road signage would help invaders. It made travelling a challenge. And arriving especially rewarding. The directions were good enough the first time I went to Bacunayagua in 2005. There were three of us: two Cuban friends, one of whom was a scuba dive instructor, and me. The pi\u00f1a colada stop was memorable. Alongside the road Marco, in a crisp white guayabera shirt, prepared cocktails for thirsty motorists from palm-fresh coconuts, cream and pineapple. He agreed, reluctantly, to go easy on the rum. After that we crossed the spectacular Puente de Bacunayagua, the tallest bridge in Cuba, completed in 1959. A couple of kilometres later, almost hidden by trees, there on the left was an unmarked, steep concrete road. It dived through a forest towards the sea, bringing us to a complex of run-down 1970s bungalows. In front was the clearest water, framed by an elegant peninsula, and a perfect little hidden beach. This particular stretch of coastline was also a notorious pick-up point for the cigarette boats that come from Florida and smuggle Cubans back to the US. A few bored young soldiers were there on watch; they were surprised to see us. The offer of a cold drink turned their frowns into smiles. They kept an eye on the car while we explored the pristine waters below. I returned to Bacunayagua a few weeks ago. A gleaming blue sign now clearly marks that turnoff to the bay. It is as beautiful as ever, but a little noisier. A Cuban family, complete with relatives from Miami, had rented the house the military once occupied. Silence has been replaced by reggaeton. On the way back to Havana, I stopped at the roadside bar. Marco was still there. \u201cEst\u00e1s perdido,\u201d he said to me. That delightful Cuban greeting perhaps best translated as: \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d, offered with equal feeling whether someone hasn\u2019t been seen for a few days or a few years.

We only promote sophisticated transport solutions. Very soon we will have a light rail system.\u2019\u201d Undeterred, the cyclists gave it another try and approached a council official who they knew to be a cyclist himself. \u201cThis time, they were told that cycling was something for European countries. The man said: \u2018Israel is a Middle-Eastern country and Israelis are addicted to their cars or to their camels.\u2019 He didn\u2019t see how it could ever be changed.\u201d  More than 20 years later, the realisation of the Tel Aviv light rail system is still a very long way off. But cycling has definitely become the new mode of transport in the city. Everywhere you go in Tel Aviv, you see people on bikes, and most of them aren\u2019t wearing any special gear. In Israel\u2019s hippest city, cycling is the hippest way to get around. According to city council statistics, about 15% of the inhabitants of central Tel Aviv cycle to work or school. There are many miles of bike lanes, including a breathtaking track along the seafront that connects the northern part of town with the ancient harbour of Jaffa in the south. Five years ago, a successful bike sharing system was launched, which caused bike use to go up by 54% among Tel Avivians. And every year in October the city hosts a huge bicycle event, closing the Ayalon highway and the big boulevards to cars to make way for 30,000 cyclists.  \u201cWe have achieved a lot,\u201d says Avizohar. \u201cBut it still remains a big challenge to break the \u2018car first\u2019 mentality.\u201d     Bicycles on Tel Aviv\u2019s Nachlat Benjamin street in the early 1920s. Photograph: Alamy    A hundred years ago, when Tel Aviv was being built, the bike was a much-used mode of transport in the city. The circumstances for cycling were favourable: the town being flat and compact with temperatures never dropping below zero (although the summer heat could be quite a challenge). And most people simply didn\u2019t have the money to buy a car. But as living standards went up, the car became the dominant mode of transport, causing dreadful traffic jams and notorious parking problems. Avizohar says: \u201cThat\u2019s when people started to think about the bike as a clean, fast, healthy and cheap alternative.\u201d    A senior official of the Ministry of Transport said: \u2018People will die like flies.\u2019 But of course, this never happened  Guido Segal     To attract attention and put pressure on decision-makers, bicycle activists organised critical mass rides every last Friday of the month, meeting at Rabin Square and cycling through the city with placards and decorated bikes. The group grew bigger and bigger and is still active today. A breakthrough came in 1998, when former brigadier general Ron Huldai was elected mayor of Tel Aviv. Huldai promised to build cycle paths during his election campaign and turned out to be genuinely committed to promote the bike as the solution to Tel Aviv\u2019s traffic problems.  \u201cA year after he was elected we started to experiment with bike lanes on the central reservations of the big boulevards,\u201d says architect and urban planner Guido Segal, who has been involved in the planning of the Tel Aviv bicycle infrastructure from the beginning. \u201cIn those days, the central reservations of the boulevards consisted of not much more than sand and trees, and they were quite wide. They could easily be converted into bike lanes. It was the easiest way to start, because cars didn\u2019t have to make way for bikes.\u201d A lot of people were apprehensive about what would happen at the junctions once these bike lanes were in use. \u201cSome even wanted to put fences in front of the bike lanes at junctions,\u201d Segal remembers. \u201cA senior official of the Ministry of Transport said: \u2018People will die like flies.\u2019 But of course, this never happened. The more bicycles you have in a city, the less often accidents occur. Once we had the infrastructure, more and more people wanted to use it. We saw the number of cyclists go up and the number of accidents go down. This convinced decision-makers.\u201d     Around 15% of the inhabitants of central Tel Aviv (plus the odd horse) cycle to work or school. Photograph: Ariel Schalit/AP    Nowadays, Tel Aviv boasts about 85 miles of cycle lanes. And there are new plans to establish a big network of more than 90 miles of cycle paths in the greater Tel Aviv region, to enable commuters to go to work by bike.  It would be a mistake, however, to expect ingenious cycling infrastructure in the style of Amsterdam or Copenhagen when you jump on your bike in the Israeli metropolis.     Some of the Tel Aviv cycle lanes consist of not much more than a painted logo on the pavement       Some of the Tel Aviv cycle lanes consist of not much more than a painted logo on the pavement. Most cycle lanes simply break off at junctions and it\u2019s not always easy to find out where they continue \u2013 if they continue at all. And it\u2019s not unusual to encounter a bus stop or a lottery stand in the middle of your cycle lane.  Cycling through Tel Aviv\u2019s chaotic streets requires resourcefulness and a talent for improvisation \u2013 it\u2019s a constant juggling act to avoid pedestrians, objects that are blocking the way and motorists, some of whom are clearly not aware that bikes are a legal mode of transport. In many streets cyclists and pedestrians share the pavement \u2013 not only because cycle paths are often part of it, but also because the road is considered simply too dangerous for cyclists. Shared pavements combined with robust Israeli street etiquette have resulted in growing friction between pedestrians and cyclists. \u201cThe pavement is for pedestrians. Cyclists who use it should be more gentle,\u201d says Avizohar. \u201cBut being gentle in Israel is an oxymoron.\u201d There has been an evolution in the design of bike lanes in Tel Aviv, says Guido Segal. \u201cWe started with lanes that were used both by cyclists and pedestrians. Then there was a series of colour-coded bike lanes on the pavement. But we are now constructing safe, Dutch-style separated bike paths at street level,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a growing community of cyclists that demands better infrastructure. And we have been learning along the way.\u201d     Sweat factor: a child cycles during a heat-wave in Tel Aviv. Photograph: Ariel Schalit/AP    One such learning moment was the renovation of Ibn Gabirol Street in 2010, the city\u2019s most important artery, connecting the northern Yarkon Park to the southern part of town. The road was narrowed to make space for bikes. But much to the chagrin of the Israel Bicycle Association, no separate bike paths were created. The pavement was simply broadened with dark paving indicating the rather narrow strip allotted to cyclists.  \u201cWe had a big row with the council about it, but we failed to convince them to do it differently,\u201d Avizohar remembers. \u201cBut nowadays everybody recognises that this was a mistake.\u201d The situation in Ibn Gabirol Street has led to fights and accidents between pedestrians and cyclists. In 2014, a 68-year-old woman was hit by a bike when she got off a bus right next to a cycle lane. She hurt her shinbone and is now suing the city of Tel Aviv, arguing that the council encourages the development of a cycling culture, but fails to protect people who simply adhere to the traffic rules. When it comes to cycle paths, Tel Aviv is learning from its mistakes. In 2012, separate bicycle paths at street level were built in Bloch Street, but it was by no means an easy task. Angry residents fiercely protested because some 50 parking places were sacrificed in the process. \u201cThis is Israel: in the weekend we don\u2019t have public transport,\u201d explains Guido Segal. \u201cPeople said we need our cars and we need to be able to park them, but the mayor went ahead with the plan in spite of the protests. I think he was very brave.\u201d   Related: How Groningen invented a cycling template for cities all over the world    Although Tel Aviv is well on its way to developing a serious cycling culture, there are still many problems to tackle. One is the growing use of electric bikes \u2013 including illegal ones that go as fast as 25 miles per hour \u2013 that poses a serious threat to pedestrians. Another is the lack of connectivity. \u201cWhen streets are renovated, bike lanes do get built, but they do not always connect to other bike lanes. We don\u2019t have a continuous network making it easy to get from A to B,\u201d says Avizohar. Many Tel Avivians still refrain from cycling because of the danger posed by unaware motorists and the shortage of good parking places. And then there is what Avizohar describes as \u201cthe sweat factor\u201d: the scorching heat during the endless Tel Aviv summer. \u201cShowers in workplaces really are vital if we want the number of cyclists to go up,\u201d he says. Showers in workplaces are, along with more bicycle infrastructure and bike parking places, among the measures in the Bike bill, devised to encourage cycling in the country. This bill has been under discussion since 2008 but has so far failed to pass. \u201cSome Israeli politicians still need to be convinced that the bike is not the problem but the solution,\u201d says Avizohar. He is, however, hopeful that the bill will this year pass its final reading in the Knesset.  \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we are optimists.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion", "publicationDate": "2016-01-27T08:00:17Z", "title": "Tel Aviv's journey to becoming the hippest cycling city", "sentences": ["When four Israeli cyclists suggested to the Tel Aviv city council in 1994 that it might be a clever idea to promote the bicycle as a new mode of transport, they were met with laughter.", "\u201cThe council official said: \u2018Tel Aviv is a modern city.", "The man said: \u2018Israel is a Middle-Eastern country and Israelis are addicted to their cars or to their camels.\u2019 He didn\u2019t see how it could ever be changed.\u201d  More than 20 years later, the realisation of the Tel Aviv light rail system is still a very long way off.", "Everywhere you go in Tel Aviv, you see people on bikes, and most of them aren\u2019t wearing any special gear.", "According to city council statistics, about 15% of the inhabitants of central Tel Aviv cycle to work or school.", "Five years ago, a successful bike sharing system was launched, which caused bike use to go up by 54% among Tel Avivians.", "\u201cBut it still remains a big challenge to break the \u2018car first\u2019 mentality.\u201d     Bicycles on Tel Aviv\u2019s Nachlat Benjamin street in the early 1920s.", "Photograph: Alamy    A hundred years ago, when Tel Aviv was being built, the bike was a much-used mode of transport in the city.", "A breakthrough came in 1998, when former brigadier general Ron Huldai was elected mayor of Tel Aviv.", "Huldai promised to build cycle paths during his election campaign and turned out to be genuinely committed to promote the bike as the solution to Tel Aviv\u2019s traffic problems.", "\u201cA year after he was elected we started to experiment with bike lanes on the central reservations of the big boulevards,\u201d says architect and urban planner Guido Segal, who has been involved in the planning of the Tel Aviv bicycle infrastructure from the beginning.", "This convinced decision-makers.\u201d     Around 15% of the inhabitants of central Tel Aviv (plus the odd horse) cycle to work or school.", "Photograph: Ariel Schalit/AP    Nowadays, Tel Aviv boasts about 85 miles of cycle lanes.", "And there are new plans to establish a big network of more than 90 miles of cycle paths in the greater Tel Aviv region, to enable commuters to go to work by bike.", "Some of the Tel Aviv cycle lanes consist of not much more than a painted logo on the pavement       Some of the Tel Aviv cycle lanes consist of not much more than a painted logo on the pavement.", "Cycling through Tel Aviv\u2019s chaotic streets requires resourcefulness and a talent for improvisation \u2013 it\u2019s a constant juggling act to avoid pedestrians, objects that are blocking the way and motorists, some of whom are clearly not aware that bikes are a legal mode of transport.", "\u201cBut being gentle in Israel is an oxymoron.\u201d There has been an evolution in the design of bike lanes in Tel Aviv, says Guido Segal.", "And we have been learning along the way.\u201d     Sweat factor: a child cycles during a heat-wave in Tel Aviv.", "She hurt her shinbone and is now suing the city of Tel Aviv, arguing that the council encourages the development of a cycling culture, but fails to protect people who simply adhere to the traffic rules.", "When it comes to cycle paths, Tel Aviv is learning from its mistakes.", "I think he was very brave.\u201d   Related: How Groningen invented a cycling template for cities all over the world    Although Tel Aviv is well on its way to developing a serious cycling culture, there are still many problems to tackle.", "Many Tel Avivians still refrain from cycling because of the danger posed by unaware motorists and the shortage of good parking places.", "And then there is what Avizohar describes as \u201cthe sweat factor\u201d: the scorching heat during the endless Tel Aviv summer."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jan/27/cycling-tel-aviv-israel"}, {"tags": ["Golden State Warriors", "San Antonio Spurs", "Cleveland Cavaliers", "NBA", "US sports", "Basketball", "Sport", "LeBron James", "Stephen Curry"], "article": "It was supposed to be the game of the century. The Golden State Warriors were aiming for the best win-loss record in NBA history. Meanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs had a 13-game winning streak and were on pace to put up the best point differential the league has ever seen. Monday\u2019s game was hyped as a must-watch event: the Warriors\u2019 unstoppable offense against the Spurs\u2019 impossible defense. Well, the Warriors promptly solved that impossible defense, and basketball fans were treated to yet another Warriors blowout. Golden State demolished San Antonio 120-90. There was very little the Spurs could do. Putting Kawhi Leonard, the reigning defensive player of the year, on Steph Curry only briefly slowed him down. Curry scored 37 points in the game, despite sitting for the entire fourth quarter.         Steph Curry is the Road Runner, Kawhi Leonard is Wile E. Coyote.    Even for those who have enjoyed watching the Warriors embarrass opposing teams, Monday\u2019s game was a disappointment. There was no drama, no suspense, no intrigue. Fans were promised a historic clash. Instead, they witnessed the basketball version of the NFC championship game between the Panthers and the Cardinals. (Curry was playing playing the role of Cam Newton, obviously.) Now, this was only one game, and it may end up being just an aberration. The Spurs were playing at Oracle Arena, where the Warriors have yet to lose all season, and without Tim Duncan, who sat out with knee soreness. Although his days as a MVP candidate are firmly in the past, Duncan\u2019s presence would have made a difference, albeit probably not a 30- point one. The two teams next play on 19 March, in San Antonio, with the Spurs potentially at full strength. If the Spurs pull off victory there, or even suffer a close loss, we\u2019ll all go back daydreaming about a seven-game Western Conference finals between the two. But maybe that is wishful thinking. It\u2019s also possible that these Warriors have no rival and will continue to decimate the NBA like an invasive species without a natural predator. This was the second time in two weeks that the Warriors embarrassed one of the teams that supposedly had a shot at knocking them out of the playoffs. Last week, they took on the Cavaliers in what was supposed to be an NBA finals preview. That turned out to be a 34-point road win for the Warriors. That loss spurred a coaching change and questions about whether Cleveland\u2019s LeBron James-Kyrie Irving-Kevin Love super-team was doomed by the Warriors\u2019 mere existence. It\u2019s to the point where the NBA might have a Superman problem on its hands. As many attempted movie adaptations will attest, it\u2019s notoriously difficult to develop engaging stories about Superman, a character so powerful he can do just about anything. It\u2019s difficult to come up with believable scenarios for Superman where there\u2019s any drama or provide him with opponents that represent any realistic danger. Greatness, no matter how impressive, can end up being boring without legitimate conflict. We\u2019re not at that point with the Warriors yet, but Monday night\u2019s win suggests that this rest of this season could end up completely lacking suspense \u2013 unless a team figures out what their Kryptonite could be. Video of the week    Not sure what sport this is but it looks amazing pic.twitter.com/xCqoGR1CI7&mdash; Ben Golliver (@BenGolliver) January 24, 2016    The Phoenix Suns and the Atlanta Hawks couldn\u2019t duplicate this series of ridiculous offensive mistakes if they spent weeks practicing choreography. It\u2019s almost annoying when Kent Bazemore finally makes a shot. How did LeBron carry the Cavaliers this week? I\u2019m not sure if \u201ccarried\u201d is right term for this, but the events of the last week certainly have revealed exactly how much weight LeBron James holds within the organization. It\u2019s widely believed that James was instrumental in his team\u2019s decision to replace head coach David Blatt with assistant Tyronn Lue on Friday.  Publicly, James had said he was surprised by Blatt\u2019s firing, and maybe he didn\u2019t directly request the change, but nobody believes the team would have make such a drastic move if James were against it. Judging by the reports that followed the announcement, the only real surprise that James could have is in the fact that Blatt lasted as long as he did. Quote of the week  If David Blatt\u2019s getting fired, how in the hell do the rest of us have jobs? Because our front offices aren\u2019t quite as crazy as theirs.  \u2013 Detroit Pistons head coach Stan Van Gundy on Blatt\u2019s firing. The Notorious SVG has a point. Under Blatt, the Cavaliers had a 30-11 record and was comfortably at the top of the Eastern Conference standings. Most franchises wouldn\u2019t make a change under these circumstances, but most franchises aren\u2019t run by Dan Gilbert. Of course, Van Gundy, of all people, should realize that basketball teams have no shame when it comes to firing head coaches to placate a superstar player.         The most awkward press conference ever: \u201cStan just said that you wanted him fired.\u201d    Power rankings 1. Golden State Warriors (Last week: 1) It\u2019s not entirely the case that the Warriors don\u2019t have a true rival, it\u2019s just that the team they\u2019re playing against hasn\u2019t existed for nearly 20 years. With their Monday night win, the Warriors improved their record to 41-4, tying the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls for the best start in NBA history. At this point of the season, 72-10 seems like a very possible goal. 2. San Antonio Spurs (2) Before Monday\u2019s loss to the Warriors, there was an argument that the Spurs were actually the best team in the NBA despite their less impressive record. Now? Now it would be easier to defend BoB\u2019s claim that the earth is flat. 3. Oklahoma City Thunder (4) The Thunder had a seven-game win streak going until they lost a blizzard-delayed game against the Nets on Sunday. Maybe the Nets should only play on snow days from here on out. 4. Cleveland Cavaliers (3) Another ripple effect from the Blatt firing? LeBron James is now almost as hated in Israel, where Blatt coached Maccabi Tel Aviv, as he was in Ohio after The Decision. 5. Los Angeles Clippers (5) First, the Clippers steal the Pistons\u2019 move of letting Josh Smith go for nothing. Then comes the news that Blake Griffin will miss significant amount of time after injuring his hand in an \u201cundisclosed team-related incident.\u201d Later rumors emerge that this incident was a fistfight with a member of the equipment staff that began in a restaurant. Other than all that, things have been quiet on the Clipper front. 6. Toronto Raptors (6) Congratulations Toronto, you\u2019re currently in the weird, nebulous position that is \u201csecond best in the Eastern Conference.\u201d Don\u2019t get comfortable: some other team will take your place within the week, if not days. Also, congratulations to Kyle Lowry for rightfully getting voted in as an All-Star Game starter. That\u2019s a much less tenuous achievement. 7. Chicago Bulls (7) Normally, when a team goes through a coaching change, a team is motivated to make sure their next game is a big win. The Bulls would have none of it, solidly beating the Cavaliers on their home floor in the first game of the post-Blatt era, causing their own fans to turn against them. 8. Atlanta Hawks (10) Remember last year, when nearly the entire Hawks\u2019 starting lineup went to the All-Star Game? This year, there\u2019s a good chance Paul Millsap will be their lone representative when the reserves are announced on Thursday. 9. Dallas Mavericks (9) Speaking of the All-Star Game, did you know that Zaza Pachulia was almost voted in as a starter? It\u2019s true, thanks to the efforts of the entire country of Georgia, a Fugee and a Vine celebrity. Also: did you know that Vine celebrities can influence popular voting now and that this is absolutely terrifying on a wide variety of levels? 10. Memphis Grizzlies (8) Grizzlies GM Chris Wallace says he won\u2019t be \u201ccompelled\u201d to make a move before the trade deadline. Translation: he knows they have no shot of beating the Warriors, Spurs or the Thunder in the playoffs. 11. Houston Rockets (14) The Rockets, breaking new ground in their mission to make basketball as painful to watch as possible, intentionally fouled Andre Drummond 21 times during a loss to the Detroit Pistons. 12. Miami Heat (11) \u201cHey, Mr Riley, this is Ray Allen\u2019s lawyer. If you continue to call my client, we will have no other option but to take out that restraining order we\u2019ve talked about.\u201d 13. Detroit Pistons (13) The Spurs\u2019 loss on Monday means that, improbably, the Pistons remain the last team to beat the Warriors.  14. Boston Celtics (16) Anonymous, confidential message to Danny Ainge: \u201cGive Avery Bradley anything and everything he wants, my heart cannot take him leaving. Sincerely, HF.\u201d 15. Indiana Pacers (12) The Pacers lost to the Warriors by a mere 12 points last Friday, which clearly means they\u2019re objectively a better team than both the Spurs and the Cavaliers. 16. Charlotte Hornets (21) Kemba Walker won Eastern Conference player of the week honors and has a small but non-zero chance of making the All-Star Game. All of this is confusing. 17. Sacramento Kings (22) While the Warriors and Spurs were playing what was supposed to be the game of the century, the Kings\u2019 DeMarcus Cousins was busy scoring 56 points against the Hornets. The Hornets still won. 18. New York Knicks (15) In a 97-84 loss to the Hornets, Jeremy Lin scored 26 points against his old team, which served as a reminder of the golden age of Linsanity, back when the Guardian had an entire tag devoted to him. 19. Washington Wizards (18) The Wizards are currently under .500 and out of the playoff picture. Maybe it\u2019s time for a coaching change. Is there anybody that just became available? 20. Orlando Magic (17) The Magic lost their sixth straight game on Monday, an overtime loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. 2016 has been particularly unkind to them. 21. Portland Trail Blazers (20)22.

Previously genes were blamed. But actually it\u2019s to do with our guts. Literally. I spent a week at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Tel Aviv \u2013 home to the project run by Professor Eran Segal and Dr Eran Elinav. So far they have results from 1,000 participants and a waiting list of 4,000. They believe their work could change the way we view diets. We are all unique, down to our own DNA sequence, so why should we respond to food in the same way? It looksas if we don\u2019t.  The plan was to identify my own gut bacteria profile or microbiome and monitor my blood sugar response to food. We now know gut bacteria are extremely significant players within health. Firstly, I was connected to a glucometer attached through the skin, recording my blood sugar levels 24 hours a day for the entire week.  I followed a strict but varied meal schedule, logging eating, sleeping and other activity all week into a specially designed app. I also recorded glucose readings by pricking my finger immediately before and after eating. The aim was to see how different food affected my blood sugar levels compared with others in the study. High sugar readings or spikes lead to weight gain and increased risk of diabetes. At the end of the week my results meeting with Segal changed my life. I was presented with two lists of food created from my results and from an algorithm based on the researchers\u2019 results so far.  One list contained \u201cgreen\u201d food \u2013 those that did not spike my blood sugar levels. The other was a \u201cred\u201d list \u2013 foods that caused spikes and were therefore considered bad for me.  The most shocking revelation was finding that \u201chealthy\u201d food such as grapes, salmon, orange juice and new potatoes all spiked my sugar levels. Then there was my good list \u2013 containing food not present in my cupboard for years. Croissants, chocolate and ice-cream apparently did not spike my blood sugar levels. The chocolate and croissants are wasted on me \u2013 I don\u2019t like them \u2013 but ice-cream was good news. The explanation lies in my gut microbiome profile, obtained via a stool sample. Gut bacteria play a fundamental role in host functions. Their reaction with food goes on to direct physiological pathways and hormonal release around the rest of the body, including energy release and storage, thus affecting our weight.  Mine showed showed an imbalance in the bacteria linked to obesity and development of diabetes.  As part of the research, I undertook to eat only green-list foods. No red foods have since passed my lips. The results have been astonishing. After just three weeks I started to notice the difference. No longer was I feeling tired during the day. I used to blame myself for feeling lazy but it\u2019s more scientific than that.    Related: I had the bacteria in my gut analysed. And this may be the future of medicine    After a blood sugar spike, there is a fall, which is when you feel lethargic and hungry, driving you to eat again. No wonder people get fat. Now I was eating food that produced a more steady sugar response I was no longer having the downs or the hunger pangs. My skin looked better and I lost half a stone. Even more amazingly, my new gut microbiome profile changed. There was a marked decrease in gut bacteria associated with obesity and diabetes. Parts of the world are facing an obesity and diabetes epidemic. Until now a doctor managing pre-diabetic patients would have advised them to eat less and move more. In the future they will instead \u201cprescribe\u201d a diet based on their gut microbiome. Instead of counting calories or banning carbs we will be working with our own gut bacteria to shift the pounds and at the same time protecting ourselves from diabetes.", "publicationDate": "2016-01-28T11:00:14Z", "title": "How dieting will get personal \u2013 and much more effective", "sentences": ["I spent a week at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Tel Aviv \u2013 home to the project run by Professor Eran Segal and Dr Eran Elinav."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/28/gut-bacteria-changed-my-life-dieting-food-blood-sugar-diet"}, {"tags": ["Google", "Tax avoidance", "Business", "Corporate governance", "Technology", "George Osborne", "Politics", "David Cameron", "Technology sector", "Alphabet"], "article": "The furore over Google\u2019s \u00a3130m deal with the UK taxman has triggered outrage among politicians, business figures and tax campaigners.

June 2015 Former Google employee Joanna Shields holds an introductory meeting with the company, weeks after taking up her post as minister for internet safety and security.  July 2015 Google\u2019s lobbying effort with the new government goes up a gear. In a single month the company meets with five ministers: the home secretary, Theresa May, holds bilateral talks; Francis Maude, the minister of state for trade and investment, joins Google at a Tech City event; Lucy Neville-Rolfe, the intellectual property minister, discusses copyright; the international development minister, Grant Shapps, meets with Google Foundation, the firm\u2019s charitable arm, to talk about \u201cinnovation in the not-for-profit sector\u201d; and Justin Tomlinson, minister for disabled people, agrees to an introductory meeting.

Part of Cameron\u2019s Notting Hill set, along with George Osborne and Michael Gove, she had previously worked at the television company Carlton Communications, where Cameron was head of corporate affairs. Whetstone is married to Steve Hilton, who was Cameron\u2019s director of strategy from 2005 until 2012. 2006 Former trade union and government spokesman David John \u201cDJ\u201d Collins, who is a close friend of David Miliband and advised on his failed bid to lead the Labour party, joins Google as its UK and Ireland PR boss. Collins was head of news at the Department for Education and Skills when Miliband was schools secretary. 2006 Google hires the PR agency Portland. Run by Tim Allan, an adviser at No 10 during the early years of the Blair government, Portland\u2019s role is to handle Google\u2019s dispute with publishers over its book scanning project.  2008 Whetstone moves to California to become Google\u2019s global communications chief. She is replaced by Collins. 2011 Cameron\u2019s head of strategic communications, Tim Chatwin, leaves to become senior director of communications at Google. In 2015, he is appointed as the company\u2019s director of communications for the Asia-Pacific region. 2012 Naomi Gummer, an adviser to Hunt while he was in charge of internet policy as culture secretary, emerges as Google\u2019s UK policy adviser. She grabbed headlines after telling a conference about online child safety that it was the responsibility of parents, rather than the law, to protect children from online pornography. Gummer\u2019s Tory pedigree is of the highest rank: her father Peter, the PR boss better known as Lord Chadlington, is president of Cameron\u2019s Witney Conservative association. Her uncle John Gummer was a minister under Margaret Thatcher and John Major. 2013 Jill Hazelbaker, a former adviser to Republican senator John McCain and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, takes over as Google\u2019s European PR boss. 2013 Verity Harding, a political adviser to Nick Clegg while he was deputy prime minister, takes a policy role at Google in London. A month previously, Clegg had raised the issue of Google\u2019s tax affairs with its chairman Eric Schmidt. 2015 Amy Fisher, formerly responsible for Google\u2019s policy communications across Europe before becoming a special adviser to Chris Grayling at the ministry of justice, becomes head of press at Conservative Central Office. 2015 The working peer Joanna Shields, formerly Google\u2019s managing director for Europe, Russia, Middle East and Africa, is appointed UK minister for internet safety and security.", "publicationDate": "2016-01-29T07:00:10Z", "title": "A high-powered network: how Google became embedded in British politics", "sentences": ["November 2015 London mayor Boris Johnson rides a scooter and tries on virtual reality goggles during a visit to Google Campus in Tel Aviv.", "Boris Johnson tries out virtual reality goggles during a visit to the Google offices in Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/29/how-google-became-embedded-british-politics-tax"}, {"tags": ["Dating", "Relationships", "Life and style"], "article": "We\u2019ve all heard of match.com, OKCupid and Tinder.

We need a way to sort through thousands of profiles and put aside the \u201ctime wasters\u201d, says Bradley Mills of Tip Top Dating Services, which manages more than 100 niche dating sites including TallerSingles and ShorterSingles. \u201cOtherwise you get bombarded with people you\u2019re just not interested in.\u201d For those who are picky about hair colour, there\u2019s Redheaddates or dateginger. Moustache-lovers are catered for by stachepassions \u2013 the site is even divided by style, including Walrus, Dali and Pencil. And while Uniformdating.com might sound like it caters to those with a fetish for helmets or tabards, it is in fact for people with busy lives: \u201cWhen you have unsociable shift patterns, a demanding job, or you\u2019re stationed overseas, finding love can be tricky,\u201d the site acknowledges. There are niche dating sites that cater to pretty much every passion you can imagine, including vampires, clowns and Disney lovers \u2013 yes, adult ones. There\u2019s even a site for those who work in the death industry, Dead Meet, started by mortuary worker Carla Valentine. \u201cI noticed people who did similar jobs gravitated towards each other,\u201d Valentine says, \u201can embalmer was dating the mortuary manager, a mortuary technician was dating an undertaker. If you both do the same thing, there are no silences over dinner or shocked expressions when you describe how bad your day was. But sometimes you need to cast the net a bit further than your immediate working circle.\u201d So does it work? Can a passion for beards really form the foundations for lasting love? We tracked down five very particular couples to find out. The beard lovers who met on Bristlr Angela Petrovic, 20, music journalist I was a sceptic. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be able to meet someone online. But I love men with beards, so I thought, why not? I\u2019d been on the site for about three weeks before Connor messaged me. His message said, \u201cHey, you\u2019re really pretty. So what do you do in life?\u201d I thought that was adorable and he looked cute. We talked every day for two weeks on WhatsApp before we met. I wanted to see if it was as easy in person. We ended up meeting for drinks in London. It wasn\u2019t awkward at all, it was like we already knew each other. I saw him again the next day. I had an extra ticket to see The Offspring and took him.    It wasn't awkward at all, it was like we already knew each other. I saw him again the next day  Angela Petrovic     I went to Reading festival, and I missed him the entire time. He offered to pick me up on the Sunday morning. That was the day we had \u201cthe conversation\u201d. He just came out and asked if I could be his, and I said, \u201cYes, of course.\u201d Now we\u2019ve been together for six months. At first I lied to my mum \u2013 I told her that we met at a gig. We told her the truth a couple of months ago. She didn\u2019t care, she absolutely loves him \u2013and she isn\u2019t easy to please at all. She just wanted to know what website it was, because she\u2019s single. I was like, \u201cMum, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d want to use that site\u2026\u201d Connor Jupp, 22, student I joined Bristlr a week before I started speaking to Angela. I saw the site advertised in a newspaper, and I thought it looked more interesting than Tinder, which seemed to attract people who wouldn\u2019t be right for me. I\u2019m quite a hairy bloke, and from experience, even though it\u2019s fashionable to have a beard, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s what a lot of women find attractive. People laugh when we tell them how we met. I saw Angela and I just thought she was gorgeous. Luckily, we clicked as soon as we started talking. For me, romance is always thinking about the other person and putting them ahead of yourself. I just know I would always want Angela to have whatever she wanted. The hikers who met on OutdoorLads     Paul O\u2019Brien, left, and Mark Allan. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    Paul O\u2019Brien, 42, occupational therapy manager I had been living in Leeds, helping my mum who was very ill with cancer. After she died I moved back to London, and I was looking for ways to meet people and make new friends. After a big life change like that, you want to try different things. I\u2019ve always enjoyed walking and I\u2019d heard that OutdoorLads was a friendly and accepting group. I wanted to meet gay men without going to bars, which wasn\u2019t really my scene. My primary objective wasn\u2019t to meet a date. But when I started I thought, \u201cWell, maybe it could happen.\u201d I had tried online dating before. I think this is better because you meet in real life; it\u2019s not only about looks. Walking alongside someone allows you to have a good chat and find things in common without it feeling forced. Mark and I just met by accident, really. I had become a walk leader after about four or five months. Every month there is a social event for people to meet up after work. You still have to have someone leading it, to welcome new people \u2013 and this time that person was me. I remember Mark arriving and thinking, \u201cHe looks nice.\u201d He was standing on his own and I went and spoke to him to make him feel welcome. I was hoping he wouldn\u2019t leave without me getting his number and at the end of the evening I made sure we left at the same time. I gave him a quick peck on a traffic island on the middle of the road and hurried off. Then I messaged him via the site. It was almost adolescent. Our first dates involved a lot of visits to parks and cafes, as well as some walks. I thought, \u201cyesterday you weren\u2019t in my life, today you are\u201d, and was open-minded about seeing where it went. After about three months I remember us having a heart-to-heart on my birthday and we both realised we were keepers. I think the relationship works because we have shared interests and values, we\u2019re best friends and have a laugh. We\u2019re both open to new ideas. We travel a lot, but soon there\u2019ll be fewer holidays and much more walking on blustery weekends in London \u2013 we\u2019re getting a cocker spaniel puppy.    We were splashing around in the sea and I just knew I wanted to be with him. I asked him to get married that evening  Mark Allan     Mark Allan, 42, charity chief executive I was in my late 30s and wanted to meet people by going out and doing stuff, and I\u2019d heard about this organisation for gay men who meet up for walks and social events. It\u2019s not a dating site, it\u2019s about people getting together to do something they like (though lots of couples do meet that way). I didn\u2019t plan to meet someone but it was in the back of my mind. I had done some online dating before, which was fine, but when you meet through a social group, there\u2019s no pressure \u2013 you might just be drawn to someone you happen to like. It\u2019s very hard to get that online.   Related: Scoffing messy food, arguing in public \u2026 the real relationship landmarks | Daisy Buchanan    I had been on a handful of walks by the time I met Paul on a social. Paul had organised it and was being Mr Sociable and introducing himself to everyone. I felt that he was chatting to me more than the others, so had a bit of an inkling that something was going on. We soon went on our first date and realised we have lots in common; we both really like to travel, and we like adventure. In the three years since we met, Paul and I have been all over the world: Japan, Italy, Costa Rica, Europe and the US. After about a year of dating we went on holiday to Israel. We were splashing around in the sea in Tel Aviv and I just knew I wanted to make a serious commitment, that I wanted to be with him. I asked him to get married that evening, and a year later we had a small wedding in London with our family and friends. The sci-fi fans who met on TrekDating     Dawn and Jonathan Bird. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    Dawn Bird, 37, project manager, customer science I\u2019ve always been quirky, so none of my friends was surprised when I met my partner on a sci-fi dating site. I\u2019m not as big a fan of Star Trek as Jon is \u2013 I don\u2019t speak Klingon \u2013 but I love sci-fi in general. I lasted only four days on the site because of the influx of messages I got. Some were really stupid or weird, and I just thought, this is not for me. Jon contacted me on the second day and I liked him because his email seemed genuine. We talked a little about sci-fi, and I told him I had a manual for the Millennium Falcon. Obviously there\u2019s a Star Wars/Star Trek rivalry, so that started a bit of a riot, but he was so passionate about Trek, it made me think: this is an interesting guy. He wasn\u2019t asking me about how I look; there was a genuine connection over something we had in common. Our first call lasted two and a half hours. For me, romance is connection. One time I came home and found Jon had covered the entire hallway in little love notes. He also made me two stop-motion videos with Jelly Babies: one is the story of how we met, the other he made when we were stressed about wedding preparations, saying that we\u2019re still together and in the end we\u2019ll be married. In the video, we walk up the aisle and the Starship Enterprise crashes into the congregation. The two Jelly Babies are still on our mantelpiece, next to our phaser.    I'm not as big a fan of Star Trek as Jon. I don't speak Klingon  Dawn Bird     Jonathan Bird, 35, managing director I set up TrekDating.com on my birthday in 2013. It started as UK only; now it\u2019s in the US, South Africa, New Zealand, Ireland, Canada and Australia, with close to 2.5 million users. Dawn and I were just two people in that bunch. I joined to make sure things were working properly. Dawn joined as her first foray into online dating, and was on it for a total of four days. I was lucky to catch her. We talked online for less than a week before we met in person. We had a phone call first \u2013 I do that as a rule, because if you don\u2019t like their voice, the date will be the worst two hours of your life. We arranged a second date the following weekend, but then we were too excited, so we did something midweek. After date three, everything just fell into place. At our wedding we had a 2ft Lego Starship Enterprise on our sweets table. The tables were named after Star Trek ships and places we\u2019d dated; during the wedding breakfast we heard various orchestral pieces from sci-fi films. We still hold hands all the time. I can\u2019t imagine that will ever end. The music lovers who met on Tastebuds     Isabella Pourtaheri and Daniel Clucas. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    Isabella Pourtaheri, 30, HR business partner I read on Twitter about a new app called Tastebuds.fm that matches people according to their music tastes, and I said, why not? You can see the person\u2019s profile, and next to it is a volume dial; if you have a lot of artists and songs in common (in your Spotify playlists) the volume is full; if it\u2019s just a few it is lower. I think Daniel and I had four out of five bars. I saw his picture and thought he was very cute. Thinking I wouldn\u2019t get a response, I sent him a brief and cool message (looking at it now, it\u2019s embarrassing). Daniel has cute dimples, so I wrote: \u201cDimples for the win. Automatic advantage over other contenders. And how are you this fine, ominous, drizzly day?\u201d Luckily he responded, and we were pen pals for about a month. I sent him songs by Cat Power, Daughter, Conor Maynard, Julia Holter; I was testing the waters to see if his music tastes were as eclectic as mine. When he asked to meet after a week and a half, I wasn\u2019t quite ready. I wanted to be 100% sure. We eventually met; we saw a band we had been matched on, When Saints Go Machine. He could probably see how excited I was to meet him.    I told Daniel that if he wanted to call me his girlfriend, he had to memorise the lyrics to Boyfriend by Justin Bieber  Isabella Pourtaheri     We started meeting up every three days. Two months in, I told Daniel that if he wanted to officially call me his girlfriend, he had to memorise the words to the song Boyfriend by Justin Bieber and sing it to me. He did, and he doesn\u2019t like Bieber very much. I was going to move back to Canada, but we were head over heels and decided to get married six months after meeting. I\u2019m Persian Canadian and have a big family back in Canada, so we decided to do a second, bigger wedding in Canada on the two-year anniversary of our first date. I\u2019ve definitely struck gold. Daniel Clucas, 30, senior aircraft interior designer I joined Tastebuds when someone at work told me about it. After a couple of weeks, Isabella came up in my matches. She writes as if she\u2019s a very posh English girl; her tone is, \u201cOh, what a lovely morning!\u201d For about three of our first four weeks writing to each other I didn\u2019t know she was Canadian, so I was reading all her messages in an upper-class English accent. When she told me she was Canadian, I had to reread every message. There wasn\u2019t any awkwardness when we met. I think it\u2019s impossible to have an awkward moment with Isabella. She\u2019s just like this explosion of energy. The date was on the Friday night and we met up again on the Monday. I remember spending an afternoon at work with Boyfriend by Justin Bieber on repeat. I only managed to learn a few lines but it was enough for Isabella to agree to make it official. Later, we picked every song on the playlist for our wedding; we spent longer compiling playlists than anything else. We always have music on in the house; I have an old vinyl record player that my granny gave us, hundreds of records, and we\u2019re still always sending each other music throughout the day. Being with Isabella has broadened my tastes, but I\u2019m not quite a Belieber yet. The couple who met on GlutenFreeSingles     Pia Strobel and Dale Graff. Photograph: Jessica Lowry for the Guardian     Pia Strobel, 48, hairdresser I looked up a gluten-free restaurant online, and glutenfreesingles.com was advertised at the side of the website. At first I laughed and thought, \u201cThis is just too weird,\u201d but then I thought it would make life a lot easier; you don\u2019t want to be the difficult partner going, \u201cI can\u2019t have this, I can\u2019t go there\u2026\u201d Also, it\u2019s easier to live with somebody who eats the same food. So I joined. There weren\u2019t many men in my area (Connecticut). I saw Dale was in Montana and thought, \u201cHe\u2019s kind of cute,\u201d and sent him a friend request. Two months later, I was picking him up at the airport. We went to my house, had dinner and wine, and stayed up until all hours talking. We dated for six months long-distance before I moved in with him a year and a half ago. I have three kids \u2013 24, 22 and 20; my youngest is in college and was living at home. She said, \u201cMom, you\u2019ve got to do this. I\u2019m old enough not to live at home now \u2013 you go!\u201d One day, I was home for about 45 minutes, trying to do some paperwork before I had to go back to work. I was rushing around and said, \u201cI have to get to the bank,\u201d and he said, \u201cNo, wait! Sit down! Sit right there! I made you something\u201d, and showed me the ring he made. He was down on his knees and I said, \u201cIs this what I think this is?\u201d The wedding will most likely be in a beautiful forest cabin up here in Bozeman, Montana. Then we\u2019ll take a trip to do a little reception with my family in Norway. It will, of course, be gluten-free.    We would start talking on the phone in the evening and only stop because the sun was coming up  Dale Graff     Dale Graff, 47, land surveyor When I tested positive for coeliac disease, my partner at the time seemed burdened by my dietary needs. I joined GlutenFreeSingles in 2012 and gave myself the tagline \u201cI eat asparagus with my fingers\u201d. In November 2013, Pia sent me a friend request. I tried to play it cool and wait three days, but I lasted less than two. We hit it off right away, and had a lot more in common than being gluten-intolerant. We would start talking on the phone in the evening and only hang up because the sun was coming up and we had to go to work. By February, we knew we had to live together. We both felt, \u201cOK: you\u2019re it.\u201d I knew for a while I wanted to marry Pia. Six or seven months before I proposed, I made her engagement ring. I\u2019d been thinking of different ways to propose. I tried it on an ice-fishing trip we took with her friends; you arrive in the dark, and when the sun comes over the mountains in the morning, it turns them pink. I thought that would be romantic. The ring was on my pinkie finger under my glove, but it was bitterly cold, no one was happy, we were all walking around in circles trying to stay warm and we weren\u2019t catching any fish, so we ended up leaving early. I finally proposed a month ago. In the year and a half we\u2019ve been living together, we haven\u2019t had any arguments. For me, romance is that heightened sense of happiness and excitement, waking up every morning and seeing her for the first time and smiling, because it\u2019s really happened. \u2022 To read more articles like this, get your copy of Weekend magazine, free this Saturday with the Guardian.

From flirting with the idea of ending their trophy drought, Fiorentina were daring to think about meeting the parents. But wait. Hold on a minute. Lurking round the corner was a reminder about the danger of looking too far into the future and Fiorentina were unable to regain their poise after Juventus won the second leg 3-0 in Florence. Sevilla thumped them 5-0 on aggregate in the last four of the Europa League, they missed out on a Champions League place after a sequence of poor league results, tiring badly during the season\u2019s final weeks, and that disappointment filtered through to the summer when they fired Vincenzo Montella over a dispute about finances and sold several key players.   Related: Mauricio Pochettino hands new role to Tottenham coach John McDermott    The side who host Tottenham in the first leg of their Europa League last-32 tie on Thursday will have a very different look to the one that beat them at this stage of the competition last year. Not that Fiorentina should be taken lightly. For all that Mauricio Pochettino has transformed Tottenham from callow pretenders to authentic title contenders in the past 12 months, he will be wary of the threat posed by La Viola, who are third in Serie A despite their restrictive budget. Seemingly tasked with making sure the walls were not going to cave in after replacing Montella, Fiorentina have never looked like crumbling under Paulo Sousa. Instead, it was not long before they were proudly showing off their shiny new paint job to the rest of Serie A. They still hogged possession, but they were using the ball more incisively. Yet it has not been hard for Sousa to understand why Montella was so irked by the tools at his disposal. Supporters are unhappy with the board\u2019s low investment in new players and Sousa has occasionally sounded mutinous about the level of backing he receives in the transfer market, particularly when a move for the River Plate defender Emanuel Mammana fell through last month and Fiorentina\u2019s defensive deficiencies were exposed when they lost to Milan without Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez, who was serving a one-match suspension. The response was to sign Yohan Benalouane, who was out of favour at Leicester City. Their frugal approach explains why expectations were low at the start of the season. Stefan Savic, Mario Gomez, Joaqu\u00edn, Juan Vargas and Alberto Aquilani were sold or loaned out, Mohamed Salah decided to join Roma after a productive loan spell with Fiorentina last season and the reaction was mixed when Sousa replaced Montella, who left after losing patience with what he perceived as the club\u2019s lack of ambition. Although Sousa arrived after winning domestic titles over the past two years with Maccabi Tel Aviv and Basel, those achievements were not enough to erase doubts that he was the right man to manage a club who were about to cut their wage bill. Dominating with the two biggest clubs in Israel and Switzerland was hardly conclusive proof Sousa was ready for Italian football, and the Portuguese\u2019s Juventus past meant that he was viewed suspiciously by supporters. By the end of September, however, Fiorentina were top of Serie A for the first time since they had Gabriel Batistuta and Edmundo up front in 1999, Sousa\u2019s canny tactics, some astute work in the transfer market and Juventus\u2019s slow start raising hopes of a first Scudetto since 1969. Nikola Kalinic, the former Blackburn Rovers striker, has scored 11 goals since signing from Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. Josip Ilicic, the Slovenian attacker, has excelled, scoring 12 goals. The experienced Borja Valero offers midfield nous and there is a chance Milan Badelj could return against Tottenham. Badelj has not played since the 3-1 defeat by Lazio on 9 January and a side with a heavy emphasis on creativity has missed his snap in midfield. Inevitably, Juventus have recovered. Fiorentina have had to lower their sights now they are eight points behind the resurgent champions, but their form is improving after they stuttered in January. Although Mario Su\u00e1rez left for Watford in the transfer window, the Porto winger Christian Tello has arrived on loan and Mauro Z\u00e1rate is an unpredictable option from the bench after joining from West Ham United. Z\u00e1rate scored a brilliant, curling winner in the 90th minute against Carpi on 3 February. Fiorentina left it late again last Sunday and, hours after Tottenham ignited their title challenge with their win over Manchester City, there were jubilant scenes at the Stadio Artemio Franchi when Khouma Babacar shattered the resistance of Internazionale\u2019s 10 men by bundling in the winner that helped Sousa\u2019s side strike a potentially decisive blow in the race to qualify for the Champions League.

They don\u2019t just prohibit inter-marriage, but also marriage between Jews whose lineage is considered uncertain. Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that \u201cMen and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family.\u201d And in a recent survey conducted for Valentine\u2019s Day, 84% of the Israeli public agreed. But the religious/political establishment of Israel does not. Those who come to settle in Israel are always Israeli enough to be conscripted into the army, but when it comes to matrimony there have been cases where people are\u00a0asked for photographs of their grandparents so\u00a0that the religious authorities can ascertain from their facial expressions if\u00a0they are Jewish enough. It all goes back to the Hebrew scriptures and the anxiety that foreigners presented an existential threat to the Jewish people. \u201cThey have mingled a holy race with the peoples around them,\u201d complained Ezra, returning from exile in Babylon. \u201cWhen I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat down appalled.\u201d This was over 2,500 years ago, but the same thinking was alive and well in Israel in December when the ministry of education banned Dorit Rabinyan\u2019s novel Borderlife from the school curriculum because, apparently, it encouraged intermarriage. \u201cAdolescents lack a systematic view that includes considerations of maintaining the national-ethnic identity,\u201d said the man from the ministry, echoing Ezra. And crossing the line into overt racism, there are now extreme Jewish nationalists who picket weddings between Jews and Arabs. Thankfully, no one was doing that at my wonderful wedding in Tel Aviv earlier this week, despite the fact that I \u2013 a foreigner and a Christian priest to boot \u2013 was marrying a daughter of Israel. Those who came to the ceremony couldn\u2019t have been more generous and welcoming, as I stamped on the glass and seven blessings were pronounced on us both. OK, the legal bit had been done back in London, but the heavens did not issue any thunderbolts or display any demonstrative signs of disapproval. The only tears were those of joy. Well, Moses married an African woman. Yes, there was some gossip about that \u2013 \u201cMiriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife, for he had married a Cushite.\u201d (Numbers 12:1) \u2013 but God didn\u2019t join in. And Abraham married a non-Jew, Keturah. And Judah married a Canaanite. And Joseph married the daughter of an Egyptian priest. And the kings of Israel took all sorts of foreign brides. And most moving of all is Ruth, a Moabite who married into Judaism: \u201cYour people will be my people and your God, my God.\u201d Many scholars take this to be a not-so-subtle up-yours to the theology of Ezra. Not that any democratic state should lift its polity from the books of religion. Yet in Israel love is often seen as more of a challenge to Jewish identity than persecution itself \u2013 for whereas persecution generally forces people together for support and security, love knows no boundaries. Which is why the real marriage problem for Israeli politics is that Jews in the diaspora, especially in the philosemitic US, frequently \u201cmarry out\u201d, thus creating just the sort of hybridity that the orthodox rabbinate finds impossible to compute, which, in turn, drives an increasing wedge between Israel and its US supporters. It\u2019s traditional in Jewish marriage for\u00a0the husband and wife to sign a sort of prenuptial agreement called a ketubah. Notwithstanding the hybridity of our relationship, in ours we promised to \u201crespect each other\u2019s religious traditions\u201d. Unless Israel allows for such traditions to come together in marriage, it will drift ever further from the values of its friends in the west. @giles_fraser", "publicationDate": "2016-02-18T16:37:15Z", "title": "Think love knows no boundaries?

Eleven years later, when\u00a0I\u00a0boarded TWA\u00a0Flight\u00a0840 on 29 August 1969, I\u00a0was a seasoned traveller who enjoyed flying. The plane was headed for Tel Aviv, but my friend Cathy and I were going to Athens, the second last stop; two friends were joining the flight in Rome. Cathy and I were in first class with only two other passengers when we left Italy. We had noticed the woman who was sat directly behind us while we were on the coach to the plane at Leonardo da Vinci airport. She was very striking, young and glamorous. The other passenger, a\u00a0man, was in the aisle seat of the front row on the opposite side of the\u00a0plane. Not long after we took off,\u00a0the woman moved to the aisle seat just in front of me, and struck up a conversation with the man. We were quite impressed, and thought she seemed sophisticated, chatting up a man she\u00a0didn\u2019t know. Then, as one of the stewardesses, as they were called then, was bringing the captain his lunch, the woman shoved her aside and rushed into the cockpit, rapidly followed by the man. I knew immediately that we\u2019d been hijacked. Cathy couldn\u2019t believe it. The woman, who we later found out was Leila Khaled, announced that the plane had been taken on behalf of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and said that there was one among us who was responsible \u201cfor the killing of Palestinian men, women and children\u201d. Cathy and I were moved to the back of the plane to seats near our friends. People were very shocked, but there was no panic. I\u00a0imagine this was because the crew remained very professional, and most people hadn\u2019t witnessed the\u00a0hijack. Everyone was looking around, wondering who the \u201cone among us\u201d was. It later emerged that the PFLP thought Yitzhak Rabin, then the Israeli ambassador to Washington, was on the flight. He wasn\u2019t. The flight was eerily quiet, just the\u00a0background hum of the plane and at one point a small baby crying. After four hours or so, the cabin manager made an announcement, reassuring us that we had enough fuel. I hadn\u2019t even thought about fuel, so that made me very anxious. The anxiety wasn\u2019t alleviated by discovering that two small Israeli jets were flying on either side of our plane. I was so scared that my knees were knocking, but I honestly didn\u2019t think I was going to die. I figured that the hijackers would put their own self-preservation first and make sure we landed safely. Not everyone felt the same. Cathy was terrified and the woman in front of me said goodbye to her husband, \u201cin\u00a0case we die\u201d. Finally, the crew told us we were making an emergency landing in Damascus and could take one small bag with us. I thought that if I died, it didn\u2019t matter what I took, but if not, I\u2019d need my passport, traveller\u2019s\u00a0cheques and makeup. The\u00a0captain landed the plane smoothly and we were rapidly evacuated. The crew told us to run in the direction of the wind, but it was getting dark and there was no wind, only heat. Behind us, the hijackers threw grenades into the cockpit, destroying it and setting the\u00a0plane alight. The hijackers fired guns at the fuel\u00a0tanks as we ran barefoot though a field of thorns. Amazingly, there wasn\u2019t enough fuel left to detonate. The Syrian authorities sent buses to take us to the University of Damascus for interrogation. As I\u00a0wasn\u2019t American or Israeli, they weren\u2019t too interested in me, and eventually I was reunited with Cathy and our friends.   Related: Experience: I was out at sea when a tsunami struck    The following day, the Syrians gave us shoes and took us to see the Palestinian refugee camps. I hadn\u2019t much love for Khaled, but seeing where a whole generation had grown up homeless made me view things in a\u00a0different light: those camps were a breeding ground for revolutionaries, and understandably so. We finally got to Athens at 3am on Sunday morning, grateful to be alive and determined to make the most of our vacation. I\u00a0still fly, but now insist on sitting near an emergency exit. \u2022 As told to AM Scanlon Do you have an experience to share?

The finding emerges from a study which discovered that on average men earned 20% more than women when they sold identical new products on eBay. The disparity appears to come from a tendency for all buyers - both men and women - to offer less for items put up for auction at the online marketplace when the seller is a woman.  \u201cWe expected to find a gap, but we were surprised at the magnitude, especially because the biggest effect was for new products where women and men are selling exactly the same thing,\u201d said Tamar Kricheli-Katz, a sociologist at Tel Aviv University.   Related: How can we fix unconscious racism? | Nathalia Gjersoe    The results are thought to shed light on the unconscious biases that affect people\u2019s buying behaviour. One possible explanation, raised by the authors, is that people unwittingly assign more value to products owned by men than women, leading potential buyers to bid more. If the study is backed up by further research, it would be one of the first to show with real product data how inequality and discrimination put women at a consistent disadvantage in the online marketplace. Kricheli-Katz and economist Tali Regev analysed US sales of 420 most popular products from the full range of eBay categories between 2009 and 2012. They found that women made up nearly a quarter of vendors in the dataset, and that despite having less selling experience, they enjoyed better reputations as vendors. The disparity in prices paid for goods was evident in used products as well as new, but the gap was far smaller. On average, buyers paid women 97% of the price they paid men for the same secondhand items. The gap may be smaller because the bias against females is nearly offset by buyers having more trust in women\u2019s descriptions of secondhand items, the researchers write in the journal Science Advances. Though eBay vendors do not declare their gender on the site, the researchers ran a separate experiment which showed that sellers\u2019 usernames, and the items they sold, was an accurate guide. \u201cIf I\u2019m selling an iPhone, but also my shoes and a purse, it\u2019ll be relatively easy to identify me as a woman,\u201d said Kricheli-Katz. \u201cAnd the more items I sell, the more accurately people can categorise me.\u201d To test their suspicion that buyers paid less to women than men simply because of their gender, the duo ran an online experiment. They asked people to declare how much they would pay for a $100 Amazon voucher. When the voucher was offered by \u201cBrad\u201d, the bids were higher than when it was offered by \u201cAlison\u201d. The results show that, on average, women fared worse at the online market. But a delve into the data reveals some upsides for female vendors. In certain categories, women typically sold the same items for more than men did. A particular model of Barbie sold for 16% more to women vendors, while pet food, inexplicably, sold for 20% more. On the other hand, men made a whopping 270% more when selling a Nintendo Wii, 30% more on a thermal printer, and 20% more on golf balls. A folding knife sold for 61% less when sold by a woman than a man. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be a woman selling that,\u201d said Regev. All of which leaves the question of what a woman\u2019s to do. One strategy the researchers have heard is for women to adopt a male username on eBay and sell one item at a time to help conceal their gender. But neither Kricheli-Katz nor Regev are fans of that approach. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be living in a world where people hide their gender. It might seem like a good strategy, but we should be reducing this gap in other ways,\u201d said Kricheli-Katz. \u201cA better strategy is for buyers to look for women sellers and to buy from them,\u201d said Regev. \u201cThey can get better prices, but at the same time, more bidding on the women\u2019s products will help to narrow the gap.\u201d Better still, pay the women the same price as male vendors. \u201cWhat we really hope is that by making people more aware of these unconscious biases, maybe over time the gap will narrow,\u201d said Kricheli-Katz. To make matters worse, women typically paid more than men for the products they bought on eBay. In the journal the authors raise questions about other marketplaces where the sex of vendors is never in doubt: \u201cAs a policy, eBay does not explicitly state the gender of its users. Nevertheless, men and women are easily gender-categorised by other users. We suspect that even greater divergences are present in other product markets where gender is always known,\u201d they write.", "publicationDate": "2016-02-19T19:04:05Z", "title": "How can a woman make more on Ebay?

Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy for Syria, initially set 7 March as the target date but said on Tuesday that the talks would now begin two days later \u201cto allow adequate time to address logistical and practical matters\u201d. The Syrian government and opposition have accused each other of breaches since the cessation agreement came into force on Saturday, but international observers have reported a decline in violence and airstrikes. The opposition High Negotiations Committee alleged at least three violations by regime forces on Tuesday and 17 violations the previous day. Russia said it had recorded 15 violations over 24 hours, mostly in Damascus, Aleppo, Homs and Latakia. The ceasefire\u2019s fragility was further underlined when the UK\u2019s Foreign Office revealed that no agreed mechanism had yet been set up to handle complaints of breaches. Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, said the truce provided a \u201cglimmer of hope\u201d for the country. \u201cWe will do our part so that the whole thing works,\u201d he told the German public broadcaster ARD.  Assad offered a wide amnesty to opposition fighters if they agreed to disarm. \u201cThe terrorists have breached the deal from the first day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as the Syrian army are refraining from responding in order to give a chance to sustain the agreement. But in the end there are limits and it all depends on the other side.\u201d De Mistura said he was looking forward to Syrian participants\u2019 \u201cengagement in serious discussions with a view to implementing security council resolution 2254\u201d. That calls for a ceasefire, humanitarian access, elections and a new constitution as a package deal for ending the five-year-long war. It does not, however, address the crucial question of the future of Assad, who the Syrian opposition insists must step down.   Related: Who backs whom in the Syrian conflict    De Mistura convened \u201cproximity\u201d talks with the Syrian parties in Geneva in late January. The two sides did not meet directly, and the effort ended without results after three days.  Opposition negotiators objected to holding any talks while Russia and the Syrian government were escalating attacks on rebel targets and civilian areas. De Mistura made clear he wanted to follow a broad agenda for de-escalating the conflict and then moving to a fully fledged political process.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want discussions in Geneva to become a discussion about infringements or not of the ceasefire, we want them to actually address the core of everything,\u201d he told Reuters. The cessation of hostilities is being policed by a joint US-Russian working group, rather than the UN. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, met the Russian foreign minster, Sergei Lavrov, in Geneva to review progress. A separate working group of the International Syrian Support Group (ISSG) is dealing with the delivery of humanitarian aid to besieged areas. De Mistura said he had had reports from Damascus that many Syrians who were thinking of leaving the country were now rethinking that decision because of the cessation of hostilities, \u201cas fragile and delicate as it is\u201d. In London, the Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood told MPs that the verification process \u201chas yet to be put in place\u201d, adding that there had been numerous breaches and warning that the confidence of rebel groups would be undermined if no action was taken. \u201cWe have received reports of a number of violations, which we have passed to the UN and the International Syria Support Group co-chairs in Geneva. We need swift action to reduce those violations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look to Russia in particular to use its influence with the regime to ensure that the cessation endures and that there are no further violations.\u201d     Labour MP Jo Cox said it was alarming that the Foreign Office had not answered questions. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA    The Labour MP Jo Cox had asked Ellwood to explain whether territory where the Free Syrian Army was operating alongside the Nusra front \u2013 al-Qaida\u2019s Syrian affiliate \u2013 had been excluded from the ceasefire, but she received no reply. Nusra itself is excluded from the ceasefire, along with Isis. Cox said afterwards: \u201cIt is alarming the Foreign Office has no timetable for completion of a verification process, any ideas for how it works or for what sanctions will be imposed for repeated breaches of the ceasefire. We cannot afford to be bystanders leaving it to the Russians.\u201d Russia is monitoring breaches from its airbases in Syria while the US is doing so from Jordan. The two countries have been in contact to prevent conflict between their air forces over Syria in attacks on Isis. But it appears the ceasefire was agreed without a firm agreement on how it was to be enforced. Meanwhile, Israel said on Tuesday that Syrian government forces had used chemical weapons against civilians since the start of the ceasefire.  \u201cThe Syrians used military-grade chemical weapons and lately have been using materials, chlorine, against civilians, including in these very days, after the supposed ceasefire, dropping barrels of chlorine on civilians,\u201d Israel\u2019s defence minister, Moshe Ya\u2019alon, said in a speech to a conference organised by a military and aviation group in Airport City, near Tel Aviv. He did not provide further details.  On Sunday Israel\u2019s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, welcomed the Syria truce efforts but said his country might still carry out attacks in the neighbouring Arab state to thwart any threats to its security.

Imagine a world without supermarket own-brand tahini, where za\u2019atar was just a Scrabble high-score, and parsley came in decorative sprigs rather than great zesty pawfuls. How terribly dull breakfast must have been before the wonderfully exotic-sounding shakshuka entered our national vocabulary. Indeed, Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich, who left the Ottolenghi stable to open up on their own, say their restaurant Honey &amp; Co gets \u201ca surprising number of calls asking if we serve shakshuka\u201d. Though this spicy tomato-and-egg dish has its origins in North Africa, the Israeli duo put its popularity down to the fact that it\u2019s what \u201cmost people conjure up when they think of a Middle Eastern breakfast\u201d. The appeal is no mystery \u2013 for the three people in Britain who haven\u2019t yet succumbed, the key to this very simple one-pot meal is in the name, which pleasingly, means to mix or shake up, depending on the language concerned. The things being mixed, or shaken up are sauteed vegetables, spices and eggs, but which vegetables, which spices, and even the kind of egg, vary wildly according to region, season and the person cooking it. What doesn\u2019t change is the flavour punch this dish packs; just the thing for a weekend brunch, or a satisfying, and satisfyingly cheap supper. Thanks Yotam. The nation owes you one.     Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s version, served with homemade labneh. All photographs: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian.    Tomatoes Tomatoes are the backbone of shakshuka, and almost the only thing all the recipes I try have in common apart from eggs, though they deploy them in different forms. Claudia Roden and Ottolenghi use the fresh variety, and Roden even peels them, while Packer and Srulovich\u2019s Honey &amp; Co Baking Book calls for tomato puree diluted with water. Sally Butcher\u2019s Snackistan calls for a combination of fresh tomatoes, puree and tomato juice, and Doktor Shakshuka, a Tel Aviv institution, allows for the use of fresh or tinned tomatoes, a concession that outrages one reader, who comments below: \u201cNever, never use canned tomatoes in shakshuka! It\u2019s meant to use very ripe or overripe tomatoes that are no longer good for salad.\u201d If you live in climes where ripe or overripe tomatoes are but a distant dream at the moment, then I\u2019d go so far as to recommend the tinned variety however; puree tastes too jammy, and feels too smooth, while even pricey vine tomatoes will inevitably disappoint at this time of year, giving dishes a watery flavour. For those of you reading this in sunnier circumstances, substitute the same weight of roughly chopped fresh fruit; I wouldn\u2019t bother peeling them.     Doktor Shakshuka\u2019s signature dish.    Aromatics The recipes are divided between those who flavour their shakshuka with onion (Roden, Ottolenghi), those who go for garlic (Doktor Shakshuka, Packer and Srulovich) and Butcher, who uses both. This does not seem to be a dish that\u2019s designed to be subtle \u2013 the Honey &amp; Co recipe calls for a whopping 15 cloves of garlic (\u201cthis is no mistake\u201d) \u2013 and I think the two bring different enough things to the party, the onion supplying sweetness, the garlic a keenly savoury note, to justify using them together. Though not in quite such outrageous quantities as Packer and Srulovich, just in case anyone\u2019s thinking of getting on a crowded bus afterwards.     Honey &amp; Co.    Vegetables In truth, shakshuka will happily accommodate just about anything you care to throw at it, Roden noting in her Book of Jewish Food that in Tunisia \u201ca variety of vegetables, from potatoes and broad beans to artichoke hearts and courgettes\u201d are fair game. In Israel, however, \u201cthe version with onions, peppers and tomatoes\u201d is the most popular, though Packer and Srulovich, and Doktor Shakshuka even eschew the peppers. Personally I like the contrast between the sweetness of red and the bitterness of green peppers, but Ottolenghi favours red and yellow, and Roden and Butcher use just one or the other. Butcher also adds diced courgette in her avowedly Tunisian recipe, while Roden suggests adding boiled potatoes as a variant to her version, both of which prove effective for bulking the dish out. (I also rather like the idea of adding aubergine, though none of the recipes suggest it.)     Claudia Roden.    Spices The only spice all the recipes have in common is chilli; from Packer and Srulovich\u2019s smoked paprika and cayenne pepper to Roden\u2019s fresh chilli and Butcher\u2019s harissa, they all pack a bit of punch. Though in general I\u2019m a big fan of smoky flavours, in this case I think ordinary sweet paprika works better \u2013 the smoky sort feels too overpowering for the dish \u2013 while a dash of cayenne adds a cleaner heat. Cumin is another popular choice, and I love the earthy crunch of Ottolenghi\u2019s seeds as opposed to the more common ground stuff. That\u2019s as far as I\u2019m going to go (who wants to be rooting around the back of the spice drawer before noon on a Saturday?) but if you want to add yet more oomph you can go herbaceous and add thyme and bay, like Ottolenghi, or sweet, like Packer and Srulovich and their caraway seeds and cinnamon.     Sally Butcher.    Eggs Not much to say about these, except for the fact that they should be cooked slowly, as Ottolenghi recommends, to keep the yolk as soft as possible, and that, should it all go wrong, you can always scramble them into the dish on the grounds that if Roden suggests it, then it must be OK. Doktor Shakshuka advises breaking the yolks, presumably to help them cook, but as it\u2019s the whites that set first, I don\u2019t see much point. Extras Ottolenghi starts his dish with a generous amount of oil \u2013 it should be rich, but not queasily so given the egg yolk which will also come into play, so I\u2019ve cut this down slightly. He and Packer and Srulovich also sweeten their sauces with a little sugar, and the latter balances it with lemon juice, explaining that it \u201cshould hit all the right notes: sweet, sour, salty and spicy\u201d. Both seem excellent ideas, especially when using tinned tomatoes, though if you\u2019re not, employ your own judgment as to whether your sauce needs either. A handful of soft herbs such as parsley or my preferred coriander adds freshness to the finished dish, as well as looking rather pretty, and you can also sprinkle over crumbled feta or spicy sausage, or dollop on some labneh, as suits your mood and the contents of your fridge. Bread is, of course, the essential accompaniment for mopping up sauce and yolk. Bread and, to my mind, strong dark coffee or a tumbler of spicy red, depending on the time of day. The perfect shakshuka     Felicity Cloake\u2019s perfect shakshuka.

Make 4-8 divots in the sauce and break in the eggs. Season them lightly, turn the heat right down as low as possible, cover and cook for about 10 minutes until they\u2019re just set.

I have seen some good stuff coming out of Tel Aviv, too \u2013 there\u2019s a brand new bowl there. The sport really is spreading, and generating a lot of interest in the most unexpected places. Ethiopia has a good scene and several charitable skateboarding projects. It\u2019s incredible to see these kids experiencing something new \u2013 they are embracing skateboarding and it\u2019s having such a positive effect. We can see that there is another way for them to be active and enjoy themselves other than through the more traditional sports.     Tony Hawk. Photograph: Brian Gove/WireImage    In the US, we feel there is a cool way of skating and we tend to skate in a way that\u2019s considered acceptable. When I work in a place like South Africa [with the Indigo Youth Movement, a worldwide organisation that encourages young people to enjoy sports, including skateboarding] those rules do not exist. They have their own interpretation of skating, which is very fresh. It\u2019s fun to see them take the sport and make it their own style. It gives them self-esteem and helps them in their careers. Just the act of skating can teach so much about self-confidence, self-motivation and meeting your own challenges. As opposed to only participating in team sports, where you are relying on the team or the coach to tell you what to do. That is an important aspect of maturing, but I think the idea that skating is as much a form of self-expression as it is a sport, and an art form is just as important as well.     Skateboarding and youth development in Kimberley, South Africa. Photograph: Nic Bothma/Corbis    There are more women getting into skateboarding than ever. There is a whole competition series for women now \u2013 a division of the X-Games \u2013 so I think that the ratio of men to women involved in skateboarding is becoming more balanced. One place I can\u2019t wait to get back to is Camp Woodward skatepark. There is one in Pennsylvania, but there\u2019s also one we can get to from our home in California. Near Bakersfield, it\u2019s the premier skate facility and training ground, with an abundance of every type of terrain. My kids love it, so it\u2019s fun to make a day of it. My kids actually spend a week\u2019s summer camp up there: it\u2019s really conducive to progressing your skating.     Skating at a graffiti-decorated park in Durban. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    About 15 years ago, I commissioned my own ramp. It\u2019s really a marvel of technology. It was costly but it is the most perfect ramp and that is my happy place, the place where I go to work out new tricks. It\u2019s a private facility, so I don\u2019t have to worry about people watching or crowding me out when I skate. I bring my skateboard wherever I go and if there\u2019s an opportunity to skate, I take it. My trips away aren\u2019t always directed by and for skating: sometimes they involve a tropical island or the snow, which can be fun, too. It all depends on the waves or the powder. My wife and I recently went to the Laucala Island resort in Fiji and that was pretty amazing. There\u2019s surfing nearby and it\u2019s very tropical. We have a place near Mammoth Mountain [in the Sierra Nevada not far from Yosemite in California], and that\u2019s our favourite getaway for snow.     Camp Woodward offers every type of terrain to try out    Skating is in a good place.

The number of 20- to 34-year-olds living at home with their parents increased by 25% between 1996 and 2013 in the UK. Last year, 58% of 20- to 24-year-olds, 21% of 25- to 29-year-olds, and 8% of 30- to 34-year-olds in the UK lived with parents. It\u2019s a similar story in the United States, where one in five people in their 20s and early 30s live with their parents. But when the family home is not an option, where should millennials head to make their money go further? YouthfulCities, a global index founded by consultancy firm Decode, ranked 55 cities on their affordability in 2015, using a range of statistics including, memorably, the number of hours needed to work at the local minimum wage to buy a dozen eggs (Detroit is top for egg affordability). When it comes to rent, Berlin ranks no 1 among the 55 cities despite a 28% rise between 2007 and 2014, and the efforts of some landlords to beat recent rent cap legislation. Even so, according to living index Numbeo, a one-bed apartment in Berlin\u2019s city centre will, on average, set you back \u00a3510 a month, compared with \u00a31,680 in London.     Berlin is the best city for rent. Photograph: Matthias Haker/Getty Images/Flickr RF    In the US, a one-bed apartment in Dallas\u2019s city centre costs an average of \u00a3860 a month; in New York, it is \u00a32,070. Millennials take note: Dallas is now the third fastest growing city in the US, and has a vibrant young community, with 25% of its population in the millennial age bracket, which is unusually high for American cities. On the other side of the world, Japan is surprisingly cheap: Osaka\u2019s low city-centre rental fees of \u00a3410 a month may explain why Airbnb has seen such astronomical interest. The YouthfulCities index maintains it is less affordable than Tokyo, but that appears to be because of higher average costs when dining out, going to the cinema and paying for standing taxi fares.  Johannesburg is one of the most affordable of the sub-saharan African cities on the index: the average cost of renting a one-bed apartment is less than \u00a3263 a month. Despite moving 12 places up on Mercer\u2019s latest cost of living ranking, Johannesburg is still the world\u2019s 16th cheapest city to live in \u2013 and its wider province, Gauteng, is one of the powerhouses that helped South Africa avoid economic collapse last year. Education With fees for three-year undergraduate degrees costing up to \u00a327,000 and maintenance support grants axed, one third of UK-based students aged 16 to 30 now consider undertaking some form of overseas study. But where should they go? Higher education experts QS have compiled a list of the world\u2019s top cities to be a student. The 2016 winner is Paris, which retains its place at the top for the fourth year running thanks to a high concentration of internationally recognised institutions, low tuition fees and strong employer activity.     Students at UCLA. Photograph: Richard T Nowitz/Corbis    In the \u201cstudent mix\u201d category, four Australian cities \u2013 Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide \u2013 are in the top 10, based on their high undergraduate populations and levels of tolerance and social inclusion for their share of the 272,000 international students enrolled in higher education in the country.  Perhaps surpisingly, Tokyo pips both Boston and London for \u201cemployer activity\u201d and Japan\u2019s capital also scored well in terms of desirability for students. This is partly because of its reputation as the safest city in the world. Tokyo\u2019s quality of living is also extremely high, and housing prices relatively low in comparison with the average income. Another report by the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked 35 cities on their education and training prospects. Hong Kong took the top spot as a result of the abundance of financial assistance offered to higher education students, and prevalence of world-class educational institutions. Five US cities (Chicago, LA, Miami, New York and Washington DC) ranked joint second, thanks to a number of city-led youth programmes aimed at providing on-the-job training, internship opportunities and networks for additional educational development.     Hong Kong is a good place for students as has an abundance of financial assistance on offer. Photograph: Jonas Gratzer/LightRocket via Getty Images    For those millennials with European citizenship, a free university education awaits in the Nordic countries. Throughout Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, students from the EU may enrol in a degree without paying a penny, at undergraduate, master\u2019s and PhD level, provided they can cope with the language challenge \u2013 many undergraduate courses are taught only in the native tongue. In Denmark, non-Danish EU students are also eligible for study grants if they work 10 to 12 hours a week alongside their studies. There is a slight catch, however. The cost of living in these Nordic cities is among the highest in the world and international students often struggle to find affordable accommodation.   Employment  Cities such as New York, London and San Francisco are frequently cited as the most desirable places for recent graduates, offering exciting job prospects and a chance to work for some of the world\u2019s biggest companies.  But according to the Accelerating Pathways study, which ranks 35 cities on their available employment opportunities, considering factors such as employment growth, quality of jobs available and the ease of starting a new business, Singapore scores the highest. Millennials studying there have the added benefits of public healthcare, scholarships and educational loans. However, the high cost of living \u2013 the Economist ranks Singapore as the world\u2019s most expensive city \u2013 means more than 60% of young people surveyed there have considered moving abroad for employment or education. Toronto is second in the report, thanks to a number of city-led programmes aimed at improving employment opportunities, with Hong Kong third.     Crossing the Thames to the City, London\u2019s financial district. Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images    Research by the job search engine Adzuna ranks cities based on the number of people applying for each available position. In the UK, Cambridge leads the way with a staggering 10 vacancies for every applicant, followed by Reading, Oxford and Exeter.  For those seeking big bucks, Europe boasts seven of the 12 cities with the world\u2019s highest wages, according to Swiss bank UBS. In Zurich, the average resident takes home more than $41 an hour before tax, with Geneva close behind. But high wages don\u2019t come cheap: the Swiss cities are also among the most expensive to live in. If your key concern is being your own boss, data analytics company CrunchBase has ranked the development of startup culture in global cities. Not surprisingly, San Francisco remains the top pick in a US-dominated list \u2013 but it is diversifying. Tel Aviv comes in at fifth place, thanks to innovative ideas such as The Library. The startup scene is also growing in urban Africa, with initiatives including VC4Africa, PitchForLagos and StartUpGrind nurturing small businesses across the continent.     Tel Aviv, Israel. Photograph: Maremagnum/Getty Images    This startup industry would be nothing without a pool of versatile and fluid workers. In the US alone, 53 million people \u2013 more than a third of the workforce \u2013 are freelance , with 43% of these being millennials. You could even forget setting up life in one place and do as a growing band of \u201cdigital nomads\u201d do: choose your next urban destination based on free Wi-Fi and flat whites. Culture  Culture is disproportionately important to millennials. In 2014, those aged 15-34 made up almost half of all cinema admission in the UK, while in the US, 18-24-year-olds represent almost 20% of regular cinemagoers, despite making up only 10% of the population. Traditionally, millennials have more time to go out and fewer financial responsibilities but, as the cost of living increases, new, cheaper cultural hotspots have emerged.     Lisbon, Portugal. Photograph: Alamy    In Europe, Lisbon has been attracting millennials for some time. Historically, it is one of the cheaper European capital cities (you pay an average of \u00a3345 a month for a one-bed there). But it is the burgeoning arts scene that\u2019s been the real pull for creative millennials. Principe, the Lisbon-based record label, has played a large part in reviving the dance scene in the capital, while its street art was thriving long before Banksy came along. The music scene in Montreal is another a hub of creativity, according to the latest report by the World Cities Cultural Forum (WCCF). The Canadian city has the second highest proportion of people employed in the creative industries (behind London) and the third highest proportion of bars, behind Buenos Aires and Madrid. Another millennial draw is the tax rebates offered by the Quebec Film and Television Council, which has made it a hotspot for Hollywood films including Life of Pi and the blockbuster X-Men, Days of Future Past.     Union Lane in Melbourne, one of the city\u2019s best-known street art sites. Photograph: Julian Smith/AAP    Melbourne has 81 theatres, 256 festivals a year, and 1,448 heritage and historical sites \u2013 behind only Istanbul and Moscow in the latter category (impressive, considering Melbourne is at least 1,400 years younger than the Turkish city). And if that\u2019s not enough, it also possesses the most indoor recreation space per capita, according to the World Council on City Data. Bogot\u00e1, the Colombian capital, rules the cultural roost in South America with at least 243 cinema screens, three major concert halls and 77 museums. There are more than 17.5m cinema admissions to the city\u2019s film screens every year. (To put that into context: the city\u2019s population is half of Istanbul\u2019s and yet the Turkish city\u2019s cinema admission figures trail behind at 16.3m.) The music scene in Bogot\u00e1 also has much to offer: DJs such as Alex Jockey have helped create a hip underground hardcore techno scene. Sometimes, however, the capital isn\u2019t the place to be. Shenzhen city in south-eastern China\u2019s Guangdong province is another unexpected cultural hub, having scored highly in a number of categories in the WCCF\u2019s report: 45% of the city is green space, second only to Sydney and Vienna. It has a vibrant nightlife scene that includes the famous Pepper Club, punk rock club Brown Sugar Jar and lesbian-friendly Xuan Cafe and Bar. And, millennial bookworms take note: it boasts the most public libraries of all the cities mentioned in the report. Mobility In the US, the number of 21- to 34-year-olds buying cars has dropped by 11% since its peak in the mid-1980s, while the UK has seen a 12% decline in the proportion of 17- to 20-year-olds trying for a driving licence since the mid-1990s. So, which cities offer the best option for green-minded and technologically connected \u2013 but cash-strapped \u2013 millennials?  When it comes to public transport, Hong Kong tops the Urban Mobility Index thanks to its efficient transit network, which is used for 55% of all journeys. Stockholm is in second place because of its extensive and eye-catching metro system. Students in Stockholm receive discounts on travel cards, but the Swedish capital still has the most expensive public transport system in the world, based on the price of a ticket for a single 10km journey.     A tram ride in Tallinn, Estonia. Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images    In 2013, Estonia\u2019s capital, Tallinn, became the first city of its size to make public transport free for all residents, while in Boston students have been riding free of charge since the 1970s. Its Five College Bus System ferries students and faculty staff between institutions, residential areas and shops without a single cent changing hands. As one ex-rider points out, the buses have no way to charge passengers, so the wider public can also grab a complimentary ride. When it comes to cycling, Amsterdam and Copenhagen predictably received gold stars for provision and performance, with around half of journeys in both cities made by bike. At 29.7 minutes, the dense Danish capital also has one of the shortest commute times of the top 10 cities \u2013 a breeze compared with the average 44.1 minute slog made by Londoners every weekday.     Bikes in Copenhagen, Denmark. Photograph: Marco Cristofori / Alamy/Alamy    University towns tend to be cycling hubs. In the US, where the share of journeys made by bicycle is about 2% in most cities, the university city of Davis, California, bucks the trend with cycling accounting for 20% of trips. Cambridge, where students account for more than one-third of the population, boasts the highest levels of cycling in the UK, with one in three residents riding to work.  When it comes to car sharing, Helsinki is a contender. The city has ambitious plans to transform transportation by 2025 through a system of \u201cmobility on demand\u201d that pools access to buses, bikes, car-shares and taxis through a smartphone app. In New York there are car-share pick-up points in no fewer than 716 locations. You\u2019re also in luck if you\u2019re a smartphone-owning millennial in Cape Town or Johannesburg, thanks to the launch of Africa\u2019s first car-sharing network Locomute. You may, however, struggle to get out of city boundaries \u2013 New York is the fourth most congested city in the US, and both South African cities top their country\u2019s list for traffic jams.  Diversity For all their faults, millennials are more open-minded and accepting of diversity than their forebears. And this is good for cities. In his seminal paper, which created a \u201cbohemian-gay index\u201d to measure the relationship between diverse, sexually tolerant cities and economic prosperity, urban studies doyen Richard Florida argued that the more tolerant a city was, the more its technological industry and economy thrived. Sweden has long been known as a champion of female equality (last year, it was announced that every 16-year-old in the country would be given a copy of We Should All Be Feminists, by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie). But its cities are pioneering on many fronts: in 2014 Gothenburg received the European commission\u2019s Access City award for its provision, including providing audio buses, travel guides for all disabled residents, and a transport service for people with severe disabilities. It also has a live, public database recording accessibility to the city\u2019s 3,000 public buildings and spaces.     An area known as \u2018gay beach\u2019 in Dolores Park, San Francisco. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    The 2015 Social Progress Index, which measures a nation\u2019s progressive attitudes, ranked Sweden second behind only Norway in terms of personal freedom, choice, tolerance and inclusion. Sweden was also rated best on discrimination and violence against minorities, although its inclusive attitude seems to have dulled in recent months. San Francisco has been home to a bustling gay scene since the end of the second world war, when many homosexual soldiers chose to stay in the city rather than go home after their discharge from military service. Last year, data-driven consultancy firm Gallup reported that the San Francisco, Oakland and Hayward area in California had the highest proportion  (6.2%) of LGBT residents out of all of the metro areas in the US. When it comes to racial diversity, more than half of Toronto\u2019s 1.3 million residents were born outside Canada, according to the city\u2019s most recent National Household Survey.

The Spain international, who was linked with a summer move to PSG this week, has scored 10 goals in 14 appearances under Guus Hiddink but has found life tougher in European competition since moving from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the summer of 2014. The 27-year-old has mustered a solitary goal in 14 Champions League appearances for Chelsea, his only reward coming in September\u2019s trouncing of Maccabi Tel Aviv in the group stage, having previously proved prolific for Atl\u00e9tico in the competition to help the Spanish club to the final two years ago. He managed eight in nine appearances en route to the 2014 final, from which he departed early with a hamstring problem as Atl\u00e9tico lost 4-1 to Real Madrid in extra-time.

While the message was designed to be as humorous as it was provocative, the prospect of confronting Costa has occupied Blanc\u2019s mind in the build-up to Wednesday\u2019ssecond leg, with the PSG manager having made a point of telling his players to keep their cool in south-west London. \u201cThere are two facets to Diego Costa: the player and the man,\u201d said Blanc, whose team had been reduced to 10 men by Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s dismissal in the corresponding tie last season, only to prevail on away goals. \u201cThe player I like very much, a centre-forward who can score a lot of goals, has good movement, who works hard for the team. I\u2019m a big fan of the player. But we also know the man, a man who likes contact, challenges, even provocation at times. That\u2019s part of his game. We saw that last year and he\u2019s a player who always performs like that. He doesn\u2019t just reserve that for matches against PSG. I\u2019ve told my players not to respond.   Related: PSG\u2019s Marco Verratti: \u2018Diego Costa is a good guy but he uses warfare to win games\u2019    \u201cWe have to keep cool in the face of provocation, even if we have Brazilian players across our back-line. But we\u2019ll need all our strengths at our disposal in a tight game. We need to stay with 11 on the field and enjoy a good game, so we can\u2019t respond to any provocation, be it from Diego Costa or anyone else. We were made to pay with that a bit last year and, this year, it could be even more difficult.\u201d Costa, who has been wearing the mask after breaking his nose in an accidental training ground clash with Fikayo Tomori last month, is expected to be fit to feature against the runaway Ligue 1 leaders despite missing Saturday\u2019s draw with Stoke with a tendon problem in his calf. The 27-year-old, as anticipated, did not complete the training session at Cobham on the eve of the tie but Chelsea, who will also have Pedro restored to the squad after hamstring trouble, need him to impress against Thiago Silva and David Luiz. The striker is looking to improve on a personal record of one goal \u2013 against Maccabi Tel Aviv in September \u2013 in 14 Champions League games for the London club, but can at least point to 10 in 14 appearances under Guus Hiddink as evidence of improved form.\u201cHe has behaved very well [for me] and I\u2019m very proud of him and the way he\u2019s playing,\u201d said the interim manager. \u201cHe\u2019s not going over the edge, but he likes to fight in the real way [allowed by] the game, and that\u2019s what we like.

The person killed was later identified as Taylor Force, a Vanderbilt University student, the school in Nashville, Tennessee, confirmed in a statement on Tuesday night. Force had been on a school trip with the Owen Graduate School of Management. \u201cTaylor embarked on this trip to expand his understanding of global entrepreneurship,\u201d the statement read, \u201cand also to share his insights and knowledge with startups in Israel. He exemplified the spirit of discovery, learning and service that is the hallmark of our wonderful Owen community. This horrific act of violence has robbed our Vanderbilt family of a young hopeful life and all of the bright promise that he held for bettering our greater world.\u201d The statement also noted that other Vanderbilt students and staff on the trip were safe. In the spate of attacks on Tuesday evening \u2013 in East Jerusalem, Petah Tikva and Jaffa \u2013 attackers used guns and knives against both Israeli police and passersby. It was one of the worst days of violence in several months of almost daily attacks. They coincided with the arrival in Tel Aviv of Biden on Tuesday for meetings with the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. The US vice-president was reportedly visiting the Peres Centre for Peace, a mile away from where the stabbing took place. Initial accounts of the attacks were confused and contradictory. Biden was kept informed of the unfolding incidents but chose to continue with his schedule. In the worst incident, a Palestinian stabbed three Israelis near Jaffa\u2019s port before attacking three more near a popular restaurant on the city\u2019s promenade. According to reports, victims were stabbed at three locations during the 20-minute attack as the assailant ran several hundred metres along the seafront. Among those seriously injured was the US tourist\u2019s wife. Video footage from the scene appeared to show a man in dark trousers and a grey hooded top running beside a traffic jam, apparently attempting to stab occupants through an open car window. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said four of the wounded in the Jaffa incident had severe injuries. A witness, identified as Yosef, told the Ynet news website: \u201cThe terrorist, who was young and wearing a hoodie, came from the Jaffa port area. Once he was on the boardwalk, he attacked a tourist couple. The woman was stabbed several times, tried to flee, and fell. \u201cThe terrorist then continued to stab the man, and stabbed him in the leg. I was in my car. I ran to him, took the aluminium pylon, and hit the terrorist in the back. He tried to stab me, then he ran.\u201d A second witness added: \u201cI was in my office and I heard screams. I saw a young man wearing a hoodie who was attacking a woman. She was a tourist. There were screams and then a man carrying an aluminium rod ran towards them.\u201d \u201cI heard two guys screaming that there was an attack,\u201d said a woman, who gave her name as Emily. \u201cI ran in the opposite direction and ran into a man who was on the ground in his blood. I covered him with my jacket. He was badly injured and we waited together for the ambulances to come.\u201d The assailant, later identified as a 22-year-old Palestinian man from Qalqiliya, was shot dead by police as he tried to flee towards neighbouring Tel Aviv. Hospital officials later reported that one of those stabbed had died of their injuries. The series of assaults began with an attack on an ultra-orthodox man who was followed into an off-licence in Petah Tikvah and stabbed. The victim and the shop\u2019s owner managed to overpower the attacker, who was reportedly stabbed to death with his own weapon. In another attack shortly afterwards, a gunman opened fire on Israeli police in Salah e-Din Street in East Jerusalem, seriously injuring two officers before he was killed himself. Police later identified the gunman as Fouad Tamimi, 25, from the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Isawiya. The latest attacks come after months of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories in which 183 Palestinians and 28 Israelis have been killed since October. The latests attacks was welcomed by Hamas, although the Islamist group which governs Gaza did not claim direct responsibility. A large number of Palestinians have been killed while carrying out knife, gun or car-ramming attacks, according to Israeli authorities. Others were shot dead by Israeli forces during clashes or demonstrations. The latest incidents of violence prompted political opponents of Netanyahu to criticise the Israeli prime minister\u2019s handling of the months-long crisis. Tzipi Livni, co-leader of the Zionist Union party and a former peace negotiator and foreign minister,, said: \u201cThe terror wave will not subside on its own, the Biden visit is an opportunity to lower the flames.\u201d The US vice-president is scheduled to meet Netanyahu and Abbas on Wednesday. Before Tuesday\u2019s violence, Biden\u2019s visit had been overshadowed by a new blow to the troubled relationship between Barack Obama and Netanyahu. Israeli prime minister\u2019s decision not to accept an invitation for talks with the US president in Washington later this month \u201csurprised\u201d the White House, which first learned of it through news reports. Netanyahu\u2019s office defended the decision, saying he did not want to interfere in US presidential primary elections and caucuses. Obama and Netanyahu\u2019s already testy relationship was worsened by the Israeli prime minister\u2019s forceful opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, including in a speech to the US Congress. But the pair have sought to set aside their disagreements in recent months and work out a new 10-year defence aid package for Israel in an attempt to demonstrate that the ties between the two traditional allies remain strong. The US vice-president \u2019s visit comes with Obama having acknowledged there will be no comprehensive agreement between Israelis and Palestinians before he leaves office in January.", "publicationDate": "2016-03-09T01:02:27Z", "title": "US student dead and at least 13 others injured in attacks across Israel", "sentences": ["They coincided with the arrival in Tel Aviv of Biden on Tuesday for meetings with the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas.", "He was badly injured and we waited together for the ambulances to come.\u201d The assailant, later identified as a 22-year-old Palestinian man from Qalqiliya, was shot dead by police as he tried to flee towards neighbouring Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/08/at-least-10-israelis-stabbed-tel-aviv-israel"}, {"tags": ["Meteorology", "Dubai", "Dubai"], "article": "As if Dubai weren\u2019t hot enough, this Middle Eastern city has inadvertently made itself significantly hotter over the past 14 years, according to a new study.

The city has seen some of the fastest urban growth in the world, expanding by 10% on average every year for the past four decades. So what effect has this had on Dubai\u2019s weather? Emily Elhacham and Pinhas Alpert, from Tel Aviv University in Israel, used satellite and meteorological data to answer this question.\u00a0   Related: World Weatherwatch    They found that the construction of buildings and roads had darkened the previously near-white desert, and greatly reduced the amount of solar radiation reflected back to space.

The results are published in the journal Earth\u2019s Future. To make matters worse, irrigation in the surrounding desert has increased humidity by about 4%, and the blocking effect of the high-rise buildings has decreased wind speeds by about 0.7\u00a0kph, making the extra heat even more uncomfortable.

In contrast, there is very little awareness of Palestinians who are also citizens of Israel. Despite representing a sizeable minority \u2013 20% of Israeli society \u2013 and holding a unique position of deep connections with both, our complexity remains an untold story.    It\u2019s time to embrace more complex identities that struggle with conflicting narratives and embody contradictions    As a native minority living in Israel, we are tossed on the waves of political whim, and given hope only as a charade, as it is dashed before our eyes. This seems to be our fate. In the past month we have experienced a pendulum swing of extremes, from the Israeli government passing an economic plan to inject almost $4bn into Arab society, and narrow some of the most stark disparities; to prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech at the site of a murderous attack in Tel Aviv where he held all of Arab society accountable for the actions of a madman. This is far from an exception, rather the rule itself. Palestinian citizens of Israel are at best a political pawn, more often a forgotten or dismissed entity. Only yesterday, I received a phone call from an Israeli newspaper, asking me to comment on a survey showing that 50% of Israelis are pro-transfer \u2013 moving Arab Israelis from their homes. Meir Kahane\u2019s ideas, outlawed in the 1980s for being too extreme and inhumane, are back on the table. I don\u2019t think this survey reflects reality \u2013 a yes or no question in such a matter is a very simplistic way of treating it \u2013 but it is striking when given that simplistic choice half of Israelis answered yes. As a Palestinian musician and artist living and working in the heart of Israeli society, I am often torn. Between loyalty to my individual passions, my artistic freedom and my national responsibilities. Between integrating into Israeli society, yet remaining true to Palestinian culture and the struggle for equality. When I represented Israel at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2009 together with the Jewish-Israeli singer Noa, the pressure from my Palestinian compatriots to withdraw was overwhelming. And, when I voiced my feelings against the escalation of the Israeli army\u2019s actions within Gaza at the time, I was branded \u201can enemy from within\u201d by Jewish-Israelis. My Facebook feed labels me both a fig leaf for the occupation or a terrorist, depending on which day of the week it is, sometimes both at the same time.         Noa and Mira Awad - There Must Be Another Way    Recently Israel\u2019s minister of arts and culture threatened to withdraw state funding from the only Arabic-speaking theatre in Israel, as the plays were deviating from the Zionist narrative. I voiced my protest, and joined a delegation of Arab and Jewish artists to meet the minister in question at president Reuven Rivlin\u2019s residence and challenge the accusations. Once again, I was hit from both directions, accused of being a \u201cfifth column\u201d by some, for supporting non-Zionist content, and a \u201ccollaborator\u201d by others, for simply agreeing to meet Israeli officials. Within this flux of complexity and criticism, I have a vantage point of both Israeli and Palestinian society, which might enable navigating a road map out of a conflict that is seemingly unending. It is for this reason that my work offers a bridge between the arts and promoting peace. I sit on the board of a major Arab-Jewish NGO, the Abraham Fund Initiatives, symbolically named after the father of both nations, and increasingly find my work providing a backdrop to discourse on conflict mitigation and tolerance building.         Mira Awad sings Bahlawan    Yet these are stormy times, and discussing peace only seems to breed a greater suspicion, as if each side should play its role and radicalise in reaction to the other. As if this needed further complication, broader Arab society in the Middle East refuses to recognise my existence. A glaring illustration has been the refusal of the Arab version of the TV show The Voice to credit my music, which they are currently using for their adverts. The show is no stranger to Palestinian Israelis, and there have been contestants from within the Israeli borders who have performed under the Palestinian flag because their Israeli passports would not allow them entry into Lebanon where the programme is recorded. However, my case is not so simple to solve. Maybe it is my open identification as both Palestinian and Israeli that has created a subconscious justification for the show\u2019s producers to use my music without permission; maybe it\u2019s just that they can \u2013 after all, a Palestinian Israeli appears to be a second-class citizen in every setting. The little solace I find in having my music stolen by the most popular TV show in the Arab world is that the song they chose to use is called Bahlawan, meaning acrobat. It is a song that discusses among other things the complexity of a Palestinian Israeli: \u201cWalking on a tightropeMy arms stretched to the sidesNo guarantee, no shieldAn acrobat with no safety net.\u201d We\u2019re living in complex times, yet our discourse is becoming less sophisticated. It\u2019s time to embrace more complex identities that struggle with conflicting narratives and embody contradictions. I know of no better place to start than the Palestinians who are also Israeli citizens. Hearing our voice could be a linchpin in redefining the Israel-Palestine conflict.

One side claims that raising the bar for minor parties is undemocratic, the other claims that the current voting system allows elections to the upper house to be gamed by grifters and microgroups, and perverts voters\u2019 intentions.  But whether or not we tinker with the voting system to put the kibosh on microparty machinations, it won\u2019t solve our biggest problem in the upper house: the calibre of many of the senators either appointed or elected down the ticket for major parties.  It\u2019s true enough that extremists and cranks show up on the cross-benches. Right now we have a senator, the LDP\u2019s David Lleyonhjelm, who\u2019d like to undo Australia\u2019s popular gun laws, and advocates for an industry whose products are known to kill their customers. In the past, senators like Family First\u2019s Steve Fielding \u2013 elected on Labor preferences \u2013 pressed their dumb luck in a finely-balanced senate to do what they could to impose the values of an evangelical minority on the rest of the nation.    Related: 'Austerity of hope' as Australians lose faith in politics, Liberal strategist Mark Textor says    But members of the religious right and libertarian zealots don\u2019t need to create their own parties in order to park their bums on green leather. They can have much more influence by being elected or appointed as members of the Liberal Party. Take Cory Bernardi. It would be difficult to get a struck match between his social conservatism and former cross-benchers like Fielding or Brian Harradine. He is anti-choice, anti-marriage equality, and was partly responsible for lighting the garbage fire that was the senate inquiry into Halal food. His comparison of same-sex marriage to bestiality was a bit too rich for him to stay, even in Tony Abbott\u2019s cabinet. That hasn\u2019t dented his enthusiasm for defending and giving encouragement to the far right, though: last year he went in to bat for Reclaim Australia, insisting that the racist rallies were nothing of the sort with the old canard that \u201cIslam is an ideology, not a race\u201d.  Bernardi is not just the most reliably reactionary Liberal senator, he is something of an impresario on the right, nurturing the next generation of young fogies with largesse from his Conservative Leadership Foundation. And now one of the alumni of that institution \u2013 James Paterson \u2013 has entered the Senate at the age of just 28.  Age should not disqualify people from representing their state in the senate. Many 28 year olds have a wide range of life experiences, and a mature political outlook to bring to political roles. Yet Paterson\u2019s entire working life has been spent as a cloistered professional ideologue.  After working and interning with some do-nothing conservatives here and in the US, Paterson worked for the bosses at the Victorian Employers\u2019 Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and then struck wingnut welfare gold when he scored a job at libertarian think-tank, the Institute of Public Affairs.  There, he rose to the dizzying heights of deputy executive director, while penning wounded defences of the rich, paeans to Margaret Thatcher, and helping out with masterpieces of political strategy like \u201cBe like Gough: 75 radical ideas to transform Australia\u201d in which he, Chris Berg and John Roskam offered some free advice to the incoming Abbott government.  To the extent that their suggestions were heeded, the authors deserve some credit for ruining Abbott\u2019s prime ministership. As they recommended, Abbott tried tightening up Medicare and repealing section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, thus embarking on the road to ruin.  Paterson\u2019s reward has been an appointment to the senate to replace the retiring Michael Ronaldson. There he will have more latitude than the former PM did to emit ideological brain farts. In his maiden speech this week, he got out of the blocks by proposing the scrapping of the national curriculum, claiming that it was all a sinister effort at leftist indoctrination.  More surprising and amusing was his demand that the Israeli embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. It\u2019s not clear that the Australian senate has much sway in that matter, but bringing it up might earn him a study tour or two.  These matters are remote from the concerns of ordinary Victorians, many of whom will understand the national curriculum as a pragmatic measure aimed at ensuring common standards, and who, on the basis of opinion polling, are more likely to be sympathetic to Palestinians than the Israeli state.   Related: Libertarians aren't our allies in building a progressive Australia | Jason Wilson    It would be more amusing if he were not joining a group of right-wing senators who have been instrumental in frustrating Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s efforts to put a more moderate face on his government. Paterson can\u2019t shift Middle Eastern embassies, but he can play a part in dragging the Liberal party, and our politics, further right.  It may be that senate reform that brings results closer to voters\u2019 desires is a positive move. But the bigger threat to the esteem of the upper house is the machinations of major parties, and their installation of people who don\u2019t really represent anyone except a faction or an ideology, who have little connection with the Australian community, and no apparent desire to do anything except pursue boutique political projects.  Labor, too, has used the senate to reward time-servers and factional warlords. Both parties, increasingly bereft of any substantial connection with the broader community, continue to their own internal dynamics to determine who sits and draws a parliamentary salary.  Real senate reform might require the wholesale transformation of our politics.

When I was four, it started to get dangerous for my parents to continue to live there. The authorities were after my father. This forced us to leave the country in a hurry. To make sure our house help wouldn\u2019t suspect our plans, we made the breakfast table look as if we were ready to eat in the morning. But by time the sun rose, we were gone.   Related: Tell us how you got here    We escaped our house through a hole we dug under the exterior walls the night before. Leaving through the main door would have aroused too much suspicion. A car was waiting to take us away when we crawled out. We left behind our property, all our possessions and wealth. The smuggler was well-paid. He added us to a group of Shia pilgrims who were on their way to a shrine on the Iraqi-Iranian border. The trip lasted five days and was marked by extreme tension and fear.  My parents were in disguise and my brother and I had several pants and shirts on top of each other since we couldn\u2019t carry any luggage \u2013 all our clothes were on our backs. We were forbidden to speak in front of others, so as not to reveal our real identity. We were escaping Jews.    America kept capturing my attention. There were Vietnam protests, human rights demonstrations, hippies and happenings    We managed to enter Iran. My father was held by the Iranian authorities and we had to stay in Tehran for about one year. I remember being fascinated by the wedding of the Shah, which I watched from the window of the hotel. I still see clearly the carriage with white horses in which he was sitting. My parents never spoke about this experience. From Iran we flew legally to Israel, a country that was still \u201cwork in progress\u201d. I went to school there and, after graduating, served in the army for three years. As long as I can remember, I was always interested in the creative process. In 1970, I enrolled into an art school \u2013 the Avni Art Institute in Tel Aviv \u2013 and throughout the four years of my studies I received a scholarship from the America Israel Cultural Foundation.  I didn\u2019t have well-off parents to depend on, the economy in Israel was in deep recession and starting life as a young artist wasn\u2019t easy at all. So when I was offered another modest scholarship from the America Israel Cultural Foundation, I decided to move abroad. I succeeded in bartering with the travel agent for a one-way ticket to London in exchange for a painting of mine. Then I applied to Goldsmiths, an art school in London, and was accepted. In the run-up to my move, America kept capturing my attention: it was always occupying the news. There were anti-Vietnam war protests, human rights demonstrations, hippies and happenings all over the place and the art world was at its peak. In the last minute, I ditched London and resolved to move to the United States instead. America was the Mecca of freedom. Its daring culture was just the right medicine for a 27-year-old art student hungry for adventure. With a one-way ticket and a very limited budget, I chose the west coast.  The hippy culture in California excited me, so I chose to live in the Bay Area. I ended up in Berkeley. It wasn\u2019t easy arriving without real connections, barely a few months worth of money and the feeling that my English wasn\u2019t good enough. The only thing that I could depend on was my art. If it would be received well, then I would be too.  It was difficult getting by as an art student, so I worked in between my school hours as a handy man, giving art classes to amateur artists and I had a job to take care of a warehouse space in Berkeley. I lived in that warehouse too, which was occupied by other artists and musicians. I graduated in 1974 from the University of San Francisco with a master\u2019s degree, and I was invited to exhibit a one-man show in New York. I had a few art shows in the Bay Area that contributed to me building up my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and a small fund to help me out on my return. I saved the money in a safe deposit in a bank in Israel.  When the time came to make the big decision about whether I should stay in America or return to Israel, my father informed me that I had been one of the victims of the most famous safe deposit bank robberies in the history of Israel. All my money was gone. That made my decision easier. Once I came to New York City with my first show, I never left. In 1979 I received my citizenship on the basis of being an artist who contributes to the culture of America. In 1980 I got married to Tsipi, a graduate student from New York University. We have a son Yori, who is 29 years old. In 2016, it was announced that my work will be added to the Library of Congress as part of a cultural legacy project, which will preserve it for generations of Americans to come.  America made me understand the importance of my heritage, my roots and the journey that brought me here. My art bears the footprints of the cultures that have crossed my life. Forty years later, I am still here.   Open contributions: How did you get to the US?

Her strained vocals are perhaps not surprising, considering her recent schedule. Between shooting the Wonder Woman film in London and hopping between Los Angeles (for meetings) and Tel Aviv (her home town), she is drawing to the end of a mammoth world press tour for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Gadot makes her Diana Prince/Wonder Woman debut in the film, appearing in just a handful of scenes. The film has had mixed reviews. Gadot has not. The Guardian hailed her as the \u201cbest thing in the movie\u201d; Forbes said that \u201cwe only get enough Wonder Woman to leave us wanting more\u201d; and the entertainment website The Wrap said it was she alone who \u201cinjects some real vitality into the sludgy, superhero sameness\u201d. The praise, in part, is because Wonder Woman is not objectified or in need of saving. There are no love scenes and, while she might appear seductive opposite Ben Affleck\u2019s Bruce Wayne/Batman, she trumps him at every opportunity, kicking the bad guys into touch with assistance from her signature lasso. She\u2019s now a few months into shooting Wonder Woman, the original story of how Princess Diana Prince became the titular warrior goddess. The internet was buzzing about the film when an official picture was released showing House of Cards\u2019 Robin Wright in full military garb as Diana\u2019s warrior aunt. Director Patty Jenkins excitedly tweeted that \u201clots of great, diverse characters\u201d were to come. It will be the first time a female superhero has ever been given her own standalone film. Gadot will go on to repeat her role in the next two DC Comics epic instalments: parts one and two of The Justice League. It was being a role model that made Gadot, who will be 31 next month, so thrilled to play the part, despite its six-year commitment. \u201cI loved the idea of portraying this strong woman. She\u2019s all about love, equality, truth, compassion and justice \u2013 but she has an edge,\u201d says Gadot. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me that men, women, boys and girls can relate to her, especially my own daughter. I want her to see that women can be superheroes too. I want her to believe that everything is possible,\u201d said Gadot of four-year-old Alma, whose father is Gadot\u2019s husband, Israeli property developer Yaron Varsano. Batman v Superman\u2019s director, Zack Snyder, cast Gadot in 2013, since when she\u2019s risen from relative obscurity to the brink of global celebrity. Between 2009 and 2015 she played the motorcycling badass Gisele in four of the Fast and Furious films, her first Hollywood job, in which she performed several of her own stunts. Before going into acting, she was a model \u2013 at 18 she won the Miss Israel contest \u2013 and served two years before that as a combat trainer in the Israeli Defence Force. How many Hollywood actresses have earned both a military badge and a tiara? \u201cI didn\u2019t fight, but I kept soldiers in shape,\u201d she says. \u201cThe army makes you disciplined, but the only resemblance I can find between that experience and the one of shooting a movie is the physicality and the intensity. The training I did for the army and as Wonder Woman were very demanding.\u201d     Gadot at a photocall for Batman v Superman. Photograph: Action Press/REX/Shutterstock    She says she had a \u201cvery happy, very active\u201d upbringing in Rosh HaAyin, where she favoured tennis and dodgeball over nail varnish or ponies. \u201cIsraeli women are tough. We know when to speak up,\u201d she says. Actresses \u201cspeaking up\u201d is big news in Hollywood these days. Ever since Patricia Arquette won best supporting actress at the 2015 Oscars and used her acceptance speech to address unequal pay in Hollywood, gender disparity has been a hot topic. Cheered on in the audience by Meryl Streep, Arquette announced that it was \u201ctime for equal rights for women\u201d. In 2014 Sony emails had been hacked to reveal that Jennifer Lawrence was paid significantly less for her lead role in American Hustle than her male co-stars. Last October she wrote an essay expressing anger with herself for not negotiating hard enough on pay. Gadot\u2019s view? \u201cThere is still a lot of room for many more women to come into the industry, not just as actresses but as producers, writers and directors,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we\u2019re in an interesting era for women and the topic is gaining momentum, but there is a long way to go.\u201d Does she think it\u2019s important that young actresses like Lawrence are speaking up about inequality? \u201cOf course. It seems the perfect time to bring back Wonder Woman. There are so many great comic book heroes for men; I\u2019m glad more women are being represented.\u201d Currently shooting in London, Wonder Woman will show a very different side to Diana Prince. \u201cWe travel back 100 years,\u201d Gadot explains. \u201cShe\u2019s this young idealist who doesn\u2019t understand the complexities of men and life, and who becomes the experienced, super-confident grown-up woman we see in BvS.\u201d Forget the 1970s TV version played by Lynda Carter, Gadot is bringing something different. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to Lynda about it,\u201d she says. \u201cI have a lot of respect for what she did, but we have a very different vision. We\u2019re going back to the original story, where Diana is not American; she\u2019s from Themyscira, just like in the comics.\u201d Apart from an upcoming drama called Criminal and the comedy Keeping Up with the Joneses, all Gadot\u2019s other roles are on hold. \u201cDiana is my life now,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been shooting for so long she\u2019s becoming me and I\u2019m becoming her.

Renee Rabinowitz, 81, is being supported by the Israel Religious Action Center, which has campaigned against ultra-Orthodox efforts to enforce the segregation of men and women and to have images of women removed from public hoardings. Almost 7,500 emails have been sent by members of the public to El Al objecting to requests made to women passengers to change seats. Rabinowitz, a Jew who attends synagogue and keeps a kosher home, told the Guardian: \u201cThe man had no other reason to complain than my gender \u2013 and that\u2019s unlawful discrimination. It\u2019s no different than if a person of another religion had said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to sit next to a Jew.\u2019 And I don\u2019t believe El Al would move a person in those circumstance.\u201d On 2 December last year, Rabinowitz settled into her business class seat on an El Al flight from New York to Tel Aviv following a visit to the US to see family. Her seat was one of a pair separated by a screen. Shortly before the plane doors closed, a passenger who had been allocated the window seat next to Rabinowitz boarded. The middle-aged man, who was wearing ultra-Orthodox garb, called a flight attendant and spoke to him in Hebrew. Rabinowitz said the flight attendant then offered Rabinowitz what he described as a better seat, one of the central row of three nearer the first class cabin. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand. It wasn\u2019t a better seat,\u201d she said.     An El Al jet. The company denies it discriminates based on gender. Photograph: David Silverman/Getty Images    She said she initially declined to move, but the flight attendant pressed her further and as the plane was close to taking off, she felt she had no alternative. Using her walking stick, Rabinowitz followed him to the front of the business class section. \u201cI asked the flight attendant point blank if the man sitting next to me had asked me to be moved, and unabashedly he said yes. I then went back to the man and said: \u2018I\u2019m an 81-year-old woman, what\u2019s your problem?\u2019 \u201cHe started to tell me it was forbidden by the Torah. I interrupted him to say the Torah says nothing about a man sitting next to a woman. He conceded I was right, but said there was a general principle that a person should not put himself in a dangerous situation. \u201cI had to do some quick thinking. He was wrong, but we had an 11-hour flight ahead of us. It\u2019s not so pleasant to be sitting with a person who would rather you weren\u2019t there. So I decided to move.\u201d After the plane landed at Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion airport, as Rabinowitz waited on board for wheelchair assistance, the captain emerged from the cockpit. She told him what had happened, and said she felt insulted for being asked to move simply because of her gender. \u201cHe said it was not up to the staff, but was company policy,\u201d said Rabinowitz. Back home in Jerusalem, Rabinowitz attended a public meeting at which Anat Hoffman, IRAC\u2019s executive director, spoke about the organisation\u2019s successful campaign to end gender segregation on Israel\u2019s public buses at the demand of the ultra-Orthodox. Since IRAC won a court case on the issue, buses carry prominent notices informing passengers they may sit where they wish.     Ultra-Orthodox Jewish men walk in a street in Jerusalem. Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cAnat said they wanted to launch a similar action in the air. Afterwards I told her what had happened to me,\u201d said Rabinowitz. Hoffman said: \u201cWe kept hearing from women, both Israelis and tourists, that they had been asked to move seats on planes. We were looking for a good case to take up, and then Renee walked in. She\u2019s 81, and a Holocaust survivor \u2013 and she was humiliated by Israel\u2019s national airline.\u201d Rabinowitz and IRAC are seeking 50,000 shekels (\u00a39,200) in damages and wants EL Al to publish clear staff guidelines \u201cconcerning their obligation to act in an egalitarian manner, including emphasising to the company\u2019s aircrews that they must defend women\u2019s rights to sit in their allocated seat, and clarifying to flight attendants that they may not acquiesce to requests by passengers wishing to change places purely for reasons of gender\u201d. IRAC is awaiting El Al\u2019s formal statement of defence, which must be submitted within 30 days of the lawsuit being filed. But in a letter to Rabinowitz\u2019s lawyer, the company insisted there was no gender discrimination on El Al flights. It said it had investigated the incident, and found that the flight attendant had dealt with Rabinowitz politely and sensitively, making it clear that Rabinowitz was not obliged to move. As a gesture of goodwill, El Al offered Rabinowitz a $200 (\u00a3140) voucher towards her next flight. \u201cThe money is not the important issue here, it\u2019s the principle,\u201d said Rabinowitz. Since she and her late husband, a rabbi, moved to Israel from the US in 2000, she said she has regularly taken El Al flights to visit members of her family.   Related: UK subjected survivors of Nazis to oppressive questioning, files show    Rabinowitz was born in Belgium, but her family was forced to flee the Nazis in 1941. They went first to Cuba, and then to the US. After marrying and having children, Rabinowitz resumed her education, eventually completing a PhD in educational psychology. She later studied law and practised as a lawyer before retiring 16 years ago. \u201cI\u2019m not generally a crusader. This just happened and it was very disturbing and very demeaning,\u201d she said. Hoffman described El Al\u2019s acquiescence to demands to move women passengers as \u201cone more way that ultra-Orthodox extremists get away with demands that have nothing to do with Judaism.

Nikolic, a former soldier, described his own experience in a \u201chighly charged\u201d situation 25 years ago when, as a UN peacekeeper, he helped an Israeli woman recover her children from their father. \u201cShe was what I can only describe as a desperate mother who had gone back to Lebanon for a holiday with the Lebanese father of her children ... and suddenly and unexpectedly that became a permanent situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were able to provide assistance with the embassy and local authorities to get that woman back together with her children. So I can understand the difficulties that often confront women in western countries that perhaps enter into a marriage and then end up in these situations. \u201cIt was a diabolically difficult situation for her. She was just distraught. Her embassy in Tel Aviv had done what it could and I guess in desperation she had entered the country trying to see if she couldn\u2019t reconnect with her children.\u201d Nikolic said he did not think he had acted outside of the UN rules of engagement in assisting in the snatching ploy.

But there is no forgetting the remarkable whole fried cauliflower that is currently being served at Ambleside\u2019s Lake Road Kitchen. A key dish on the restaurant\u2019s tasting menu, it looks less like a cauliflower and more like a blackened asteroid that has crash-landed through the kitchen ceiling. Were that not dramatic enough, it arrives with a large, wooden-handled knife so that you can carve open its contrasting white curds, which are served with pressed Scandinavian viili yoghurt and citrusy threads of pine. The flavour is incredible. The cauliflower is cooked whole in a tight pan so that it first steams as water is driven off and then, as the butter foams up, it effectively deep-fries, so that its exterior develops unusually meaty, caramelised flavours. The leaves, in particular, are transformed into awesome crispy shards: rich, salty, deeply savoury, like vegetarian crackling.     Cauliflower sales have been in steep decline, but, roasted, fried or baked, it is now a rising star in many restaurants. Photograph: Alamy    \u201cThe challenge was to give a vegetarian that satisfying, meaty sensation a carnivore gets when they eat a piece of perfectly cooked meat,\u201d says chef-owner James Cross. \u201cWe wanted that salinity you get around the outside of a well-seasoned steak and the contrast between the crust and that delicious creamy, tender curd texture you get inside a cauliflower. You can cut steaks from a cauliflower, but, for me, it\u2019s all about showcasing the cauliflower in a hearty, generous way. Putting the whole thing down in front of guests has as much impact as an 800g c\u00f4te de boeuf would.\u201d As a dish, that cauli symbolises a remarkable change in this humble brassica\u2019s fortunes. From 2000 to 2010, cauliflower sales plummeted by 35% as this sulphurous culprit, featuring mostly in endless, soggy Sunday roasts, was shunned by young shoppers. Today, cauliflower could not be hipper. It is the cover-star of April\u2019s Olive Magazine and many restaurants are elevating it to a centrepiece ingredient. It is, for instance, served roasted with lobster butter at the two-Michelin star Ledbury or dressed with romesco sauce at Ox Club in Leeds. Berber &amp; Q\u2019s whole barbecued cauliflower, dusted with shawarma spices and slathered in pine nuts and tahini sauce, is a cult classic among London foodies. Something similar is happening in the US too, where New York\u2019s Aldo Sohm serves a baked cauliflower with roast chicken salt and New Orleans\u2019 Domenica famously pairs it with whipped goat\u2019s cheese.   Related: The 10 best cauliflower recipes    At the same time, cauliflower has been embraced by the Deliciously Ella brigade as a low-carb, wheat-free, low GI, paleo-friendly food. It contains just 23 calories and 4g of carbs per 100g and it can be fashioned into grilled steaks, couscous, rice and even \u201cflour\u201d to use in ersatz pizza bases. After crowdfunding \u00a3700,000, a long-life, quick-cook Cauli Rice product was recently launched in UK supermarkets and, after years of decline and stagnation, overall UK cauliflower sales are up by 4%. \u201cIt\u2019s trending [in restaurants] and in America, so there\u2019s some cross-pollination,\u201d says Richard Mowbray, vice-chair of the Brassica Growers Association. \u201cIt\u2019s on the back of it being a healthy thing, too. People who want a low-calorie alternative to rice are looking at cauliflower.\u201d The cauli\u2019s flexibility is old news to Britain\u2019s best chefs. Last year in G2, Neil Rankin featured whole \u201cdirty\u201d cauliflower cooked straight on chemical-free barbecue coals. Two years ago, the Dairy\u2019s Robin Gill was extolling its virtues in magazine interviews. \u201cIf you roast it for a long time, it can go very sweet; raw it\u2019s quite nutty. It\u2019s so diverse,\u201d he told me in 2014. Meanwhile, independently of one another, two Israelis, Yotam Ottolenghi and the celebrity chef Eyal Shani, have played a significant role in repopularising the cauliflower. In 2009, Ottolenghi pleaded its case on an edition of Radio 4\u2019s The Food Programme and he has kept up his campaign ever since. Likewise, Shani has served whole, wood-roasted cauliflowers in his restaurants in Tel Aviv and Paris for a decade. In a recent Haaretz newspaper article (How an Israeli chef\u2019s cauliflower recipe took over the world), Shani was credited with inspiring the current whole-roasted cauli trend and, if indirectly, Alon Shaya\u2019s version at Domenica.     Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s roasted cauliflower gigli with pine nuts and currants. Photograph: Colin Campbell for the Guardian    In truth, cooking cauliflowers whole is commonplace in the Middle East (as Shani told Haaretz, he got the idea from his business partner\u2019s mum). Stosie Madi, chef-owner at Lancashire\u2019s Parkers Arms, grew up in West Africa where her Lebanese father and his Maronite Christian family instilled in her a deep respect for cauliflower. Friday lunchtimes invariably featured deep-fried cauliflower with fish and, during Lent, it became a main-course dish in itself. Madi\u2019s mother would fry off crumbled cauliflower in butter (\u201cThe secret is the butter. If you\u2019re frugal with it, you don\u2019t get that meaty taste\u201d), and then layer that with rice and caramelised onions in a kind of pilaf. She would also simultaneously roast (quickly at a high heat, so it remains firm) a butter, cumin and sea salt-smothered cauliflower, to serve in lieu of meat: \u201cCauliflower is very sweet and has lovely dark caramel notes when you roast it.\u201d   Related: Cauli gosh: Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s cauliflower recipes    It is a dish that Madi herself serves at the Parkers Arms with rice and toasted nuts.

Close observers of New York politics and the place within it of the city\u2019s prominent Jewish population were astonished that Sanders spoke openly and directly about the plight of Palestinians in Gaza while criticizing Israel and its prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, for responding disproportionately to Hamas provocations. Never before had such an outspoken pro-Palestinian message been delivered from the presidential campaign stage. During the debate, Sanders did not describe himself as a secular Jew but he did allude strongly to his heritage by saying that he spent \u201cmany months of my life when I was a kid in Israel\u201d. He was also careful to describe himself as \u201c100% pro-Israel\u201d. But what was unprecedented about his intervention was that he broke the unwritten rule that has held firm in US presidential races for decades: that candidates emphasize their commitment to supporting Israel while maintaining virtual silence over the Palestinian side of the Middle Eastern equation.  Sanders tore that convention apart by talking at length about the plight of the Palestinians in Gaza, where unemployment stands around 40% and where there is a landscape of \u201cdecimated houses, decimated healthcare, decimated schools. I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people.\u201d It was an extraordinary moment in presidential politics, said Chemi Shalev, US editor and correspondent of the Haaretz newspaper. It is extremely rare for presidential candidates to express sympathy for Palestinians, and the two individuals who came closest in recent times \u2013 Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Barack Obama in 2008 \u2013 still went nowhere near where Sanders did in talking directly about it on the campaign trail. \u201cCarter and Obama were much more careful, speaking about the need for peace as an imperative for Israeli security rather than as a matter of justice for the Palestinian people,\u201d Shalev said. Clinton, by contrast, remained true to the presidential rulebook, refusing to engage with the Palestinian issue. Her remarks, more conventionally, stuck to expressing sympathy for Israelis living under the burden of Hamas terrorism. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist attacks, rockets coming at you. You have to defend yourself,\u201d she said.           Clinton v Sanders: bruising debate ahead of New York primary.    The Clinton campaign clearly sees Sanders\u2019 overt support for the Palestinians as a potential electoral bonus coming just five days before the critical New York primary on 19 April, in which she is hoping to make her lead over her rival unassailable. Before the debate, held in a former navy yard in Brooklyn, had even ended on Thursday, her press team had circulated a memo to reporters headlined: Hillary Clinton and Israel: A 30-year record of friendship, leadership and strength. On a national and international level, Sanders\u2019 remarks are likely to reverberate for some time in that they arguably shifted the parameters of the public discussion. Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of the pro-Israel and pro-peace lobby group J Street, said it was an \u201cextraordinarily important moment in American politics. There is now an honest debate for about the first time on a national political stage, and that is important for American foreign policy and for the state of Israel.\u201d More immediately though is the question of how Sanders\u2019 comments will play on next Tuesday\u2019s vital election. It is hard to overestimate the role that Jews and the Israel-Palestine question play in New York politics: the city is after all the second largest urban collection of Jews in the world outside Tel Aviv, though its Jewish population has declined from more than 2 million people in the 1960s to about 1.2 million people today. On the other hand, there have been seismic movements within the American Jewish community in terms of its relationship to the Middle East over the past decade, brought about by the drawn-out nature of the conflict, disillusionment with Netanyahu\u2019s government and a dilution of the role played by Israel as a commanding issue. A J Street poll conducted in 2014 found that Jewish support for the Democratic party remained rock solid at 69%, but Israel ranked 10th on a list of 14 issues that had motivated voters of which the economy and healthcare were supreme. There has also been a shift towards a younger generation of New York Jews who are more open to seeing the Middle East crisis as a double-sided conflict in which the Palestinian case should be given due prominence. It is possible that Sanders was making a play for that demographic, as well as appealing to the left wing of the Democratic party that has a strong pro-Palestinian tradition. But seasoned analysts of New York Jewish politics underlined the political risk that such a stance involves for Sanders. Mitchell Moss, a professor of New York University who has written extensively on the role of the Jewish community in the city\u2019s politics, said that he expected the senator for Vermont\u2019s remarks to give Clinton a bounce. \u201cThe New York primary is a closed contest that only registered Democrats can participate in. Many younger Jewish New Yorkers aren\u2019t registered at all, and that makes Sanders\u2019 comments self-destructive as they could drive the older Jews who will turn out to vote further into Hillary Clinton\u2019s camp,\u201d Moss said. Against that, Sanders may be calculating that New York also has a growing Muslim population that today stands at well above half a million. For Linda Sarsour, co-founder of the Muslim Democratic Club of New York and a surrogate for Sanders, the candidate\u2019s remarks on Thursday night demonstrated that America is changing. At 36, Sarsour, a Palestinian American, said that it was \u201cthe furthest that any presidential candidate has gone in my lifetime. To hear the Brooklyn crowd cheering in the debate room showed me that the United States is moving towards the realization that the Palestinian people must be treated with respect.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-04-15T18:07:13Z", "title": "Candidates spar over Israel and fate of Palestinians in Democratic debate", "sentences": ["It is hard to overestimate the role that Jews and the Israel-Palestine question play in New York politics: the city is after all the second largest urban collection of Jews in the world outside Tel Aviv, though its Jewish population has declined from more than 2 million people in the 1960s to about 1.2 million people today."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/15/sanders-clinton-brooklyn-debate-israel-palestine-comments"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "Israeli police are investigating claims of massive theft from the world\u2019s leading diamond exchange, amid reports that at least a dozen dealers may be facing bankruptcy over the affair. According to initial reports, the value of the diamonds and cash involved in the alleged fraudulent activity at the Israel World Diamond Exchange in Ramat Gan, east of Tel Aviv, could amount to up to $65m (\u00a345m). A well established diamond dealer, Hanan Abramovich, allegedly acted as a middle man and failed to deliver cash and promised diamonds to other dealers.  He appeared in court on Wednesday to have his arrest extended for two days on suspicion of fraud worth millions of dollars, according to court reports. He claims business problems not criminality are behind the complaints. The Israel Diamond Exchange was established in the late 1960s and is now the largest diamond trading centre in the world. Its buildings cover 80,000 sq metres and house approximately 1,050 diamond companies. It accounts for the import of $5bn in rough diamonds annually \u2013 around 40% of global rough diamond production. Israel\u2019s diamond trade is valued at $10bn annually. The exchange\u2019s management said the investigation had been launched after a number of dealers complained they were owed tens of millions of dollars for goods sold to Abramovich\u2019s company. Eli Avidar, the managing director, said: \u201cThe diamond exchange\u2019s management will show zero tolerance to those who hurt other members of the exchange.

When we contacted him several days ago he said people would have money in the bank tomorrow. At the exchange, people believe that this is a fraud and he is hiding diamonds and money somewhere.\u201d Abramovich\u2019s lawyer, Avihai Vardi, denied to the same publication that the money and diamonds had been stolen and insisted his client\u2019s business had simply failed.

In a part of the world where agriculture was first practised, they found crops that could survive even if watered only by the occasional rain storm. But a form of farming that informed both Palestinian culture and identity \u2013 seeping into the language, songs and sayings \u2013 has increasingly come under threat from a combination of factors, including manmade climate change, the incursion onto Palestinian land by Israeli settlement, and agricultural companies\u2019 marketing of hybrid varieties to farmers. Now, however, an initiative is being launched to save Palestine\u2019s agricultural plant heritage, with a seed bank dedicated to preserving traditional varieties used by farmers for generations \u2013 before they vanish for ever. The Palestine Heirloom Seed Library \u2013 to be formally launched in June \u2013 is part of an effort both to educate Palestinians about traditional forms of agriculture in the Holy Land, which are in danger of being forgotten, and about the culture associated with them. It joins a seed bank established by the Union of Agricultural Work Committees in 2008 to help increase the income of smaller farms in Palestine and save and document seed examples. The seed library will preserve \u201cheirloom\u201d varieties particularly adapted to the West Bank. Supported by the Qattan Foundation, the project is the brainchild of Vivien Sansour, who studied and worked abroad before returning to the West Bank city of Beit Jala. She was inspired to launch the library after her experiences in Mexico and after working with farmers in the West Bank city of Jenin. \u201cI was away from Palestine for a long time,\u201d said Sansour. \u201cWhile I was away, what I remembered were the smells and tastes. When I came back, I realised that what I remembered was under threat and disappearing. \u201cThat threat came from several things. From agri-companies pushing certain varieties and farming methods and from climate change. Places, too, where people would forage for edible plants \u2013 like the akub thistle \u2013 have come under threat because of issues like the spread of Israeli settlements. \u201cI realised that what was also under threat was something deeper \u2013 the connection to a sense of cultural identity. The songs women would sing in the fields. Phrases, even the words we use. So it is about preserving the local biodiversity, but it is also about the importance to Palestinian culture of traditional agricultural methods.\u201d    I realised that what was also under threat was something deeper \u2013 the connection to a sense of cultural identity  Vivien Sansour     Typical for many Palestinian villagers were allotment-syle garden plots, known in Arabic as \u201cpieces of paradise\u201d, and the traditional multi-crop planting season known as ba\u2019al. \u201cThey are vegetables and herbs you plant at the end of the spring rains and usually before St George\u2019s Day. The varieties were ones that became adapted over the years to work well in the West Bank\u2019s climate and soil,\u201d said Sansour. The project, she hopes, will preserve strains including cucumber, marrow and watermelon, once famous throughout the region, that are in danger of dying out. \u201cThere is a kind of huge watermelon, known as jadu\u2019i, that was grown in the northern West Bank. Before 1948, it was exported around the region. It was famous in places like Syria. It has almost disappeared. One of the most exciting discoveries so far is that we found some seeds for it. They are seven years old, so we need to see if they are viable.\u201d Part of the project \u2013 which Sansour hopes will eventually be housed in a new science centre, the Qattan Foundation, in Ramallah \u2013 has seen teachers being trained in a pilot project to reintroduce students to old agricultural practices. One of these is Inam Owianah, who teaches 12to15-year-olds. \u201cI am a science teacher,\u201d she said. \u201cPart of the curriculum is the growing cycle. I was invited to a workshop of the seed library. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even sure what an heirloom variety was. And then I understood! It wasn\u2019t just about the seeds, but about an intimate connection to our heritage. And the students started to understand that civilisation is not just about buildings but about a way of life. It was why my grandmother would save the best aubergines and courgettes for seeds for the next year,\u201d said Owianah. \u201cI started asking my students to ask their grandparents and parents about the stories and sayings associated with the plants.\u201d On Sansour\u2019s patch on the outskirts of the village of Battir, next to the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv railway line where she will plant her own ba\u2019al varieties in the coming days, fennel, mallow, chard and mint are growing wild.

While the discussion in Britain about antisemitism and the limits of acceptable criticism of Israel is important, Israelis and Palestinians continue to kill and wound each other. The preoccupation with ignorant and offensive statements and Facebook posts of Labour politicians won\u2019t stop anyone\u2019s suffering in the Holy Land. Perhaps part of the reason we\u2019ve become so focused on how we talk about Israel-Palestine is because people no longer know what to do about it. The two-state solution \u2013 the creation of two separate countries divided by a border roughly along the 1949 armistice lines (with some territorial adjustments) \u2013 has long been regarded by diplomats and experts, and for the last two decades by a majority of Israelis and Palestinians, as the best way to resolve the conflict. But it now appears to be in serious jeopardy. Much of the Israeli government adamantly opposes it, and prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s support for it is rhetorical at best. The Palestinian leadership, split between Fatah and Hamas, is bitterly divided on the issue. Israeli and Palestinian public support is gradually declining. The possible demise of the two-state solution has led to growing interest in a one-state solution. This approach proposes full equality for all the Palestinians now living under Israeli control, with full civil rights, including national voting rights. However, a single, democratic, civic or binational state is highly unlikely to emerge in the foreseeable future. Most Israelis and Palestinians want their own state, to fulfil their collective desires for national self-determination. A single state is likely to generate a relentless competition for power and control, which could easily turn deadly. Further, given Israel\u2019s superior economic and military power, a single state is more likely to become a Jewish ethnocracy than the secular democracy that its leftwing proponents envisage. To a certain extent, this is already the case today, as Israel in effect rules over the West Bank and East Jerusalem and, according to a UN commission, has \u201ceffective control\u201d over Gaza too. With both two-state and one-state solutions seemingly impossible, it is easy to fall into despair. We believe this is dangerous. Such despair fosters passivity and perpetuates the status quo. And the violence is a brutal reminder that the status quo is deadly for Israelis and Palestinians alike. Moreover, despair is rooted in the mistaken notion that there are no other options. But there is another way. It combines elements of both one-state and two-state solutions. It is a confederal approach, proposing two sovereign states, with an open border between them, freedom of movement and residency, and some limited shared governance. Call it the two-state solution 2.0. The 1967 ceasefire lines would be the basis for a border, but a different kind of border, not today\u2019s 9m concrete wall, but one aimed at allowing people on both sides to cross freely, to visit their holy places, to work, shop, socialise \u2013 in short, to\u00a0breathe.     An Israeli border policewoman stands guard in Jerusalem\u2019s old city. Photograph: Ronen Zvulun/Reuters    In addition to proposing an open border, another key distinction between this approach and the traditional two-state solution is the idea of de-linking citizenship and residency. While each state would decide its own citizenship policies, including laws of return, citizens of one state could be permitted to live as residents in the other (as in the European Union), with each state setting limits on the number of non-citizens granted residency. This would open up a new way of addressing the intractable issue of Palestinian refugees. Israeli Jews adamantly oppose the right of return of Palestinian refugees to Israel proper because they view it as bringing about the end of Israel\u2019s Jewish majority; Palestinians just as resolutely insist on it \u2013 indeed it has become the symbolic centrepiece of their national struggle. These maximalist positions have been among the main reasons why negotiations have failed. In a confederal approach, however, Palestinian refugees who wish to return could live in Israel as residents, but would exercise their full citizenship rights, such as voting in national elections, in Palestine. De-linking citizenship and residency also helps address the thorny problem of Jewish settlers, who number more than half a million in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Under a traditional two-state solution, even if Israel were allowed to annex some large settlement blocs, it would still have to remove tens of thousands of settlers, possibly up to 100,000, many of them messianic religious Zionists. Some would fiercely resist evacuation and might even employ violence. In a confederate model, by contrast, Jewish settlers could live as Israeli citizens in a Palestinian state, as long as they were law-abiding residents; and the Palestinians would not have to give up large chunks of territory since they would have sovereignty over the settlements. The future of Jerusalem is another problem that has always torpedoed peace talks. A division of Jerusalem has theoretically been on the table since the Camp David negotiations in July 2000, but it is very uncertain whether this is feasible in practice. There are now nearly a quarter of a million Jews living in East Jerusalem who would have to move. Many Palestinians stand to lose their jobs and their livelihoods. Instead, a confederal approach envisions a united Jerusalem as the shared capital of two states. Municipal affairs would be run by a joint authority representing and serving Israeli and Palestinian communities in ways that it has never done since 1967, with holy sites managed by religious authorities and international bodies to ensure access for all.

Photograph: Alamy    A final significant difference between the traditional two-state solution and a confederation is the idea of establishing some joint institutions and legal mechanisms to facilitate cooperation between the two states, not only in security matters but also in areas such as economic development and management of shared resources (water, for example). This would help promote economic equality and prosperity, instead of fostering conditions for state failure if a new Palestinian state was simply left to fend for itself. Close security cooperation would be essential. But it would take place between two independent states, unlike today\u2019s security cooperation, where the Palestinian Authority is widely perceived by Palestinians to be acting as the contractor of a foreign military ruler. To be sure, a confederal approach would pose major challenges. Palestinians may strongly object to Jewish settlers remaining in their midst and Israeli Jews would be likely to resist the idea of allowing Palestinian refugees to return to the country, even as non-citizen residents. How could security truly be ensured with freedom of movement between states? And how exactly would a shared Jerusalem be governed? What if an economic union caused the less developed Palestinian economy to drag down Israel\u2019s stronger economy, rather than boosting Palestine\u2019s growth? Notwithstanding these challenges, we believe that a confederal approach to resolving the conflict is probably better than the alternatives. It would be fairer and more democratic than any likely one-state outcome and would avoid some of the biggest problems that have prevented the traditional two-state solution. However far-fetched it may appear, it is the most realistic approach because it accommodates the demands of Israelis and Palestinians for national self-determination and also accepts the fact that they have become too intermingled and too interdependent to separate from each other, however much they wish to. Anyone truly concerned about the future for Palestinians and Israelis should seriously consider the potential of this\u00a0approach.

It\u2019s a very cerebral painting, because he was trying to create a sense of perfect static balance. It must have taken an awfully long time. My photograph was\u00a0an act of destruction, taken at an unthinkable speed. I decided to use a\u00a0pomegranate, instead of a quince, because a pomegranate would explode\u00a0like a grenade. I took it after a long period in Ukraine, photographing the landscapes my grandfather-in-law would have seen when he survived the Holocaust. Soon after, my son was born. I was travelling a\u00a0lot, and I think I became more introverted. This image came from a need to produce a moment of destruction that\u00a0would also be a moment\u00a0of creation. The bullet was captured at 1,600\u00a0frames per second, a speed we cannot perceive with the naked eye. So\u00a0the image requires a suspension of disbelief. In my photography, I try to explore the relationship between the virtual and the real, the physical and the metaphysical. All my work has a direct connection with my upbringing in Israel, and\u00a0this idea within the Jewish diaspora of a\u00a0utopian place we can never quite obtain \u2013 the return to a place that doesn\u2019t really have any material presence in the world, and that\u00a0can\u00a0never be realised. I left Israel when I was 21, in 1988. I\u2019ve lived in the UK for 28 years. My position changed \u2013 from an Israeli who lived in Israel to\u00a0someone who chooses to live outside Israel. I went from living there\u00a0to looking back and reflecting. I\u00a0began to ask what it meant to live in\u00a0such a place. But, in Britain, I\u00a0was suddenly a foreigner, an outsider. A lot of people in\u00a0Israel see it as very important to take\u00a0a side, to say \u201cI\u2019m here\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m there\u201d. I want to explore the liminal spaces in between. Photography has the\u00a0ability to create something new and unique \u2013 a fusion of the two. I looked at the paper this morning. There was a picture of a bus full of people, blown up in Jerusalem. My daughter saw it, and was mesmerised. She wanted to see more. Violence can be grotesque, but also incredibly, intensely attractive. I wanted this image to be similarly hypnotic.

Built in 1874, it is home to Jerusalem\u2019s Haredi or ultra-orthodox community \u2013 though that description is sometimes used as a term of abuse. The word Haredi is taken from the book of Isaiah and refers to those who tremble before God. A bit like the Quakers. The Haredi regard themselves as no-compromise, Torah-faithful Jews, living out the word of God as best they can, until the coming of the messiah. The people who live here wear long black frock coats and broad-rimmed hats. Posters put up at the various entrances to the area demand modesty from visitors: long dresses and sleeves. Another poster declares: \u201cNo entry to Zionists\u201d. Mea Shearim is home to some of the most fervently anti-Zionist Jews in the world. Addressing the whole leftwing antisemitism/anti-Zionism elision, Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi of the UK, wrote recently in the Telegraph that Zionism \u201cis a noble and integral part of Judaism\u201d and that anyone suggesting otherwise is being \u201cdeeply insulting\u201d to the Jewish community. There is a problem here. Where does this leave many of the Haredim? Haredi theology began as a reaction to the 18th century Jewish enlightenment, the Haskalah, a movement that aimed at the modernisation of Jewish culture in Europe. Whereas the Haskalah wanted to end Jewish segregation and encourage greater engagement with modern ideas and secular society, traditionalists saw this as a threat to Jewish religious identity. Thus the Haredim stuck resolutely to their traditional clothes and ways. They would chat in Yiddish and only pray in Hebrew, too holy a language for social intercourse. And when the secular movement of modern Zionism started to take shape, they opposed this too: only God could bring about the new Israel, they argued. Trying to pre-empt God\u2019s action through secular nationalism was a heresy. Judaism is fundamentally a religious community, they argued, and modern notions of race and nationhood are alien to it. Thus, for many Haredim, the state of Israel remains almost sacrilegious. It\u2019s not so long ago that even the chief rabbis of the UK thought something similar. In 1898, Mirvis\u2019s predecessor, Chief Rabbi Naftali Hermann Adler, gave a sermon in which he condemned modern Zionism as usurping God\u2019s role: \u201cI look at this movement and worry with my heart, since I see it as opposed to the Torah of Hashem.\u201d (Hashem meaning \u201cthe name\u201d \u2013 that is, God\u2019s name.) Compared with what others were saying, this is mild stuff indeed. Yes, after a long and heated debate, mainstream orthodox Judaism was won round to the modern version of Zionism and now celebrates it enthusiastically. But the idea that those who oppose it are being \u201cdeeply insulting to the Jewish community\u201d does rather depend on which Jewish community you mean. Chief Rabbi Adler\u2019s successors might have changed their mind, but many deeply traditional Jewish communities have not. And these communities are growing. Currently the Haredim make up roughly 10% of the Israeli population. Given the current birth rate of about six children per Haredi mother, some predict they will make up 25% of the population within a few decades. And a significant proportion of these are somewhere on a scale from indifferent to downright hostile to the state of Israel, and refuse to serve in its army. Last year a uniformed IDF officer was pelted with stones, eggs and nappies in Mea Shearim. Often dismissed as \u201cextremists\u201d, these Jews don\u2019t fit with the neat secular narrative into which the Israeli government continues to woo them through education and army membership. But by refusing assimilation, the Haredim deliberately eschew the racy hi-tech Israel of those jogging on the Tel Aviv seafront. Personally, I admire their stubborn resistance to secular homogenised modernity and omnipresent capitalism, its companion. Furthermore, whatever else one may say about the Haredim, their anti-Zionism isn\u2019t antisemitism. They stick to older, pre-Enlightenment promises about Zion. And why shouldn\u2019t they?

They run a blog, sell an online fitness course and, at the end of last year, signed a deal with Penguin Random House to write a book, which the pair predict will become \u201cthe vegan bible for years to come\u201d. They swear and they brag; they are the self-proclaimed leaders of an \u201carmy of fit, sexy, vegan soldiers\u201d.

Related: Felicity Cloake: my week as a vegan    Phil became a vegetarian first after seeing a video of animals at a factory farm, then went vegan about eight years ago. Matt used to be anti-vegan until he discovered fitness. \u201cI was one of the people who, when somebody talked about veganism, would start making bacon jokes,\u201d he says, when I speak to the brothers over Skype. \u201cThat was me.\u201d They launched their Vegan Bros brand a year and a half ago, and have attracted a lot of attention. \u201cWe wanted to get across the message that vegan eating isn\u2019t some niche thing any more,\u201d says Phil. \u201cWe\u2019ve entered the age of the new vegan. There used to be these stereotypes about vegans. It was considered maybe more feminine or hippy.\u201d Things are different today, they say \u2013 they have vegan friends who are police officers, military personnel, investment bankers and airline pilots. \u201cAthletes are becoming vegan,\u201d says Phil.     The Vegan Bros    It is certainly true that the number of vegans is growing. According to new research by Ipsos Mori, commissioned by the Vegan Society, there are 542,000 vegans in Britain \u2013 the previous estimate, from 2006, was just 150,000. \u201cThis is an increase of more than 350% over the decade, although much of it, we suspect, has taken place over the past couple of years,\u201d says Jimmy Pierson, a spokesman for the Vegan Society. Another estimated 500,000 vegetarians are considering going vegan, so we could be looking at more than a million British vegans before long. There are other indications that more people are shunning animal-derived products. Google searches for \u201cvegan\u201d have doubled since 2011, while the market in animal-free food and drink is growing \u2013 according to the research company Mintel, the number of products launched in the UK marked \u201csuitable for vegans\u201d grew by 134% between 2012 and 2015. Vegan dishes used to be restricted to wholefood cafes, but now Wetherspoon pubs have recently launched a vegan menu, while Pret a Manger has seen sales of its vegetarian options soar, and is introducing two new vegan specials every month over the summer.     A vegan fair near Tel Aviv, Israel. Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cIt has never been easier to be vegan,\u201d says Pierson. \u201cThe availability of vegan food has improved significantly, with more products now stocked in mainstream supermarkets which had, in the past, been available only in specialist health-food stores. We are seeing free-from shelves expanding, and dairy-free alternatives to milk increasing their market share. Cast your mind back a year or so \u2013 the landscape looked very different.\u201d Food tech companies, such as the vegan firm Hampton Creek, which launched no-egg mayonnaise, have attracted huge investment.   Related: Felicity Cloake: my week as a vegan    What is pushing the trend? Campaigns to get people to drop meat and animal products for a specific period of time \u2013 Meat-Free Mondays or Veganuary \u2013 have been a relatively comfortable introduction to veganism for many people. Social media has helped raise awareness of some of the atrocities of factory farming and many people are concerned about the environmental impact of eating meat. The global production of meat and dairy produces more greenhouse gas emissions than transport, and a recent study found that a widespread adoption of a vegetarian or vegan diet would dramatically cut emissions related to agriculture and food production \u2013 by 63% if we went vegetarian, and 70% if vegan. On his podcast earlier this year, the atheist thinker and neuroscientist Sam Harris recalled a conversation he\u2019d had with the psychologist Paul Bloom on the subject of what will horrify our descendants when they look back at the 21st century. \u201cOn both of our shortlists was the horrorshow of factory farming,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither of us could defend it, both of us participated in this machinery of death, and we both admitted that it was only because it was out of sight and out of mind that we were able to do so.\u201d Harris became a vegetarian and says he is \u201can aspiring vegan\u201d. The implication is that anyone who believes in reason and rationality, when faced with the evidence \u2013 on animal welfare, environmental impact and human health \u2013 should become vegan. But the vegan movement hasn\u2019t been helped by its image; it has been \u201chijacked\u201d, as a Salon piece by psychiatrist (and vegan) Steven Stankevicius put it, \u201cby misinformed hippies, in the same way that meditation has been stained by a similar trend of idiocy. Both have been strangled between pseudo-spiritualism and pseudo-science, and almost entirely obscured from the view of rational-thinking people in the process.\u201d     A vegan fair in Berlin. Photograph: Carsten Koall/Getty Images    Alongside this is the unstoppable rise of the wellness bloggers and \u201ceat clean\u201d enthusiasts, who seem to view eating mostly plants primarily as a route to health and glowing Instagram selfies, rather than for ethical reasons (a well-planned vegan diet brings a lower risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers, but then lots of vegans still love crisps, chips and vegan cake, and don\u2019t get enough essential nutrients). They don\u2019t tend to call themselves vegan, instead referring to their diets as \u201cplant-based\u201d, and have given up meat and dairy in the same way they shun gluten; role models include super-blogger Ella Woodward and Gwyneth Paltrow.  Beyonc\u00e9, who reportedly eats a mostly plant-based diet, and husband Jay Z own shares in a vegan delivery service. \u201cThe image of veganism is undergoing the most radical change in its history, shedding tired old stereotypes,\u201d says Pierson. \u201cPeople now associate veganism with health, fitness and wellbeing, when the opposite was perhaps true a decade ago.\u201d A recent piece in Men\u2019s Journal highlighted how many Ultimate Fighting Champion fighters have gone vegan. \u201cWho\u2019s the real caveman here?\u201d Nate Diaz asked the magazine, referring to disdainful comments about his meat-free diet. \u201cWho\u2019s the real beast? [Eating predominantly raw and vegan] is more savvy and animalistic than anything. If anything, meat\u2019s gonna slow you down.\u201d     A woman with a vegan burger. Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images    Not everyone within the vegan movement is pleased with these developments, drawing a distinction between \u201cplant-based\u201d eaters and vegans. \u201cYou can eat nothing but arugula [rocket] for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but if you then throw on a pair of leather shoes and head to SeaWorld, you\u2019re not a vegan,\u201d writes Eva Lampert on the Ecorazzi site. Many people believe the emerging hypermasculine image of veganism, and its language of dominance and power, is at odds with the diet\u2019s values of compassion. How do the Vegan Bros, who have been accused of misogyny, feel about this kind of criticism? They shrug it off. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to reach these other types of people [who aren\u2019t natural converts to the vegan movement],\u201d says Phil. \u201cAnd we\u2019re reaching them effectively,\u201d says Matt. \u201cI have a really good friend who grew up on a cattle farm and now he\u2019s mostly vegan.\u201d Their argument is that the type of person who might be attracted by the Vegan Bros\u2019 punchy, profane style won\u2019t necessarily be won over by more academic, ethical (even sanctimonious) discussions about veganism.

Lieberman, a former nightclub bouncer from Moldova with little military experience, has advocated for policies including the bombing of Egypt\u2019s Aswan dam, the toppling of the Palestinian Authority, the introduction of the death penalty for terrorism as well as the transfer of Israeli Arabs into the Palestinian territories.   Related: Baptisms and belonging: Eritreans gather in Tel Aviv's makeshift churches \u2013 in pictures    While the appointment is subject to coalition negotiations \u2013 and could theoretically fall through \u2013 by Thursday morning an agreement seemed increasingly likely, and it could come as early as Thursday evening. The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, is attempting to enlarge his precarious coalition, which has a majority of one. Initially he offered a deal to the centrist Zionist Union, headed by Isaac Herzog, then he reversed course with his offer to Lieberman and his hard-right Yisrael Beiteinu party. Some Israeli reports suggested Tony Blair had been among figures trying to intercede in a deal to bring Herzog into the coalition. For his part, Herzog said Netanyahu was faced with \u201ca historic choice\u201d to \u201ceither embark on a journey of war and funerals\u201d with Lieberman or choose a path of \u201chope for all [Israeli] citizens\u201d. With Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts in a deep freeze, Lieberman\u2019s addition to the government would push any hopes of reviving talks further into the distance. Netanyahu is already facing criticism from his closest allies, the US and key European countries for not doing more to revive talks.  The appointment would be all the more bizarre given that only a month ago Netanyahu described Lieberman as a lazy amateur and \u201ca petty prattler\u201d who was not fit to be a military analyst. As news of the deal with Lieberman emerged, Israeli politicians from across the spectrum expressed surprise \u2013 although the move was welcomed by national religious figures who celebrated the prospect of Israel\u2019s most rightwing cabinet. The offer of the defence ministry to Lieberman follows recent tension between Netanyahu and other rightwingers and the Israeli military\u2019s general staff, in which the incumbent defence minister, Moshe Ya\u2019alon, sided with senior military officers. It is unclear what Ya\u2019alon\u2019s role would be if Lieberman were made defence minister. Although he did not address the issue directly, Ya\u2019alon directed scathing remarks about the direction Israel was heading in under Netanyahu\u2019s leadership. Speaking at a youth seminar in Tel Aviv, he said he had been surprised of late at a \u201closs of moral compass on basic questions\u201d in Israeli society, adding: \u201cWe need to steer the country in accordance with one\u2019s conscious and not whichever way the wind is blowing.\u201d Ya\u2019alon and Netanyahu have clashed in recent days over the role of the military in public discourse. A senior general infuriated Netanyahu this month when he compared the atmosphere in Israel to Nazi-era Germany, while Ya\u2019alon backed the general\u2019s right to express his views. In March, military leaders criticised a soldier who was caught on video fatally shooting a wounded Palestinian attacker in the head. The soldier is now on trial for manslaughter. While Ya\u2019alon has backed the military, hardliners including Lieberman have backed the soldier. Netanyahu, for his part, called the soldier\u2019s family to express sympathy. Leading the charge against the Lieberman appointment on Thursday morning was Benny Begin, an MP from Netanyahu\u2019s party and son of the former rightwing prime minister Menachim Begin. Speaking on Israeli radio he denounced the move as \u201cirresponsible\u201d, having earlier describing it as \u201cdelusional\u201d. The move by Netanyahu has surprised many political commentators, both because the prime minister would be bringing into his cabinet a fierce political rival who split with him after the 2014 Gaza war \u2013 when Lieberman was foreign minister \u2013 and because it would break with the longstanding tradition of having a former senior military figure in the role. The choice also attracted criticism in headlines across the mainstream Israeli media. The leftwing newspaper Haaretz\u2019s main leader opined: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu making a more reckless and irresponsible decision than appointing Avigdor Lieberman defence minister. \u201cFor the second time since the last election, Netanyahu had to choose between the Zionist Union and the extreme right, and once again he chose to veer right and establish an ideological, racist coalition that aims to entrench the occupation, expand the settlements in the territories, oppress the Arab minority and undermine Israeli democracy.\u201d Writing in Yedioth Ahronoth, Nahum Barnea was equally damning. \u201cInstead of presenting to the world, in advance of the serious diplomatic challenges that lie ahead of us in the autumn, a more moderate government, Netanyahu is presenting to the world the most extreme government ever to have served here. That is what the members of the government itself say about it, not just its adversaries.\u201d An instant poll published by the news site Walla found that many Israelis shared similar doubts about Lieberman\u2019s suitability, with 50% saying Yaalon should remain as defence minister, and only 29% saying Lieberman was a suitable replacement. Lieberman, 57, rose to prominence as the engineer of Netanyahu\u2019s successful run for prime minister in 1996, and he later became Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff. He is a powerful behind-the-scenes mover who lives in a West Bank settlement.  In the past, Lieberman has pushed for legislative proposals that critics said were discriminatory against Israel\u2019s Arab minority, including a failed attempt to require that Israelis sign a loyalty oath or have their citizenship revoked. He has expressed scepticism over pursuing peace with the Palestinians, and is now pushing a proposal to impose the death penalty against Arabs convicted of acts of terrorism.  Lieberman\u2019s tough stances have long stoked controversy. As a cabinet minister last decade he called for the bombing of Palestinian gas stations, banks and commercial centres. He said the former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak could \u201cgo to hell\u201d. He also led a recent parliamentary drive to exclude Arab parties from running for election, a move that was overturned by Israel\u2019s supreme court.", "publicationDate": "2016-05-19T12:08:56Z", "title": "Israeli PM asks Avigdor Lieberman to be defence minister in shock move", "sentences": ["Related: Baptisms and belonging: Eritreans gather in Tel Aviv's makeshift churches \u2013 in pictures    While the appointment is subject to coalition negotiations \u2013 and could theoretically fall through \u2013 by Thursday morning an agreement seemed increasingly likely, and it could come as early as Thursday evening.", "Speaking at a youth seminar in Tel Aviv, he said he had been surprised of late at a \u201closs of moral compass on basic questions\u201d in Israeli society, adding: \u201cWe need to steer the country in accordance with one\u2019s conscious and not whichever way the wind is blowing.\u201d Ya\u2019alon and Netanyahu have clashed in recent days over the role of the military in public discourse."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/israeli-pm-asks-avigdor-lieberman-to-be-defence-minister-shock-move"}, {"tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture"], "article": "1: Found London\u2019s Foundling Hospital is a great institution of the Enlightenment.

This privately financed city project in the heart of occupied West Bank symbolises both a possible future for the beleaguered Palestinian people and a microcosm of the obstacles they face. That it has got this far in a place under military rule for almost half a century, and in the teeth of obstruction, controversy and criticism, is a testament to the vision of its founder and driving force, Basher al-Masri. Civil engineer Jaradat is one of a team of young women professionals helping to build Rawabi. She has also made this $1.2bn (\u00a3825m) paean to contemporary urban planning her home, countering a long tradition which dictates that Palestinian women stay with their parents until they marry, after which they move in with their in-laws.

Rawabi: new, modern, clean, high spec and hi-tech. Both represent a break with the past, but their potential is mired in the cyclical violence and political obduracy characteristic of this part of the world. Our tour of Rawabi \u2013 Arabic for \u201chills\u201d \u2013 takes us through the first two city neighbourhoods to be completed since construction began in 2012. Seven hundred apartments have been sold, with the first residents moving in last autumn. Eventually, Rawabi will have a population of 25,000 in the core high-rise city, which could rise to 40,000 with future expansion. The city is an urban planner\u2019s dream, and the antithesis of the noisy, rubbish-strewn chaos of most Palestinian towns. The apartments have spectacular views over the biblical landscape of the West Bank. Birds of prey soar through the golden evening light. From the highest spots, it is possible to see the Mediterranean glinting beyond the Tel Aviv skyline, 25 miles away. Residential blocks are connected by landscaped walkways, communal gardens and squares, with vehicles restricted to outer roads and underground car parks. Power and telecommunications are delivered by underground fibre-optic cables. Children\u2019s play areas, outdoor gym equipment and benches are scattered through each neighbourhood. The apartments are finished to a high specification, with modern kitchens, integral appliances, tiled floors, recessed lighting and communal stores to keep garbage out of sight. Heating and air conditioning is delivered from a central source. Each flat has a balcony or terrace; there are 100 variations of design.     Rawabi\u2019s 12,000-seater amphitheatre. Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images    The smallest two-bedroom apartments sell for about $65,000. A four-bedroom apartment could cost up to $150,000. A few top-of-the-range penthouse units have higher prices, but in general they are about 25% cheaper than comparable properties in nearby Ramallah, the overcrowded \u2013 and hence overpriced \u2013 economic and political hub of the West Bank. Rawabi\u2019s commercial centre has retail spaces, cafes and restaurants awaiting occupancy. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to convince international brands, like Mango and Zara, to open here,\u201d says Jaradat, noting that, as yet, there are no global chains in the West Bank. The blueprint includes copious office space, a creche, a seven-screen cinema, a convention centre and a hotel.    Rawabi sends a message to the international community. We are not what they are led to believe, a bunch of terrorists  Bashar al-Masri     Several mosques and a church will provide worship space for the population. An industrial zone is situated on the city\u2019s outskirts. One school is built, and another is planned. In a slick marketing centre, potential buyers can inspect scale models of the project, view a 3D promotional movie and consult representatives of Arab banks on finance options. And then there is Rawabi\u2019s jewel: a vast, stunning 12,000-seat outdoor amphitheatre built into the hillside. Here, it is hoped, international artists will perform to audiences attracted to Rawabi from all over the West Bank and beyond. A soccer stadium, water park, all-terrain recreation vehicles, an overhead zipline \u2013 all add up to an ambitious plan to make Rawabi a desirable place to live and a popular destination to visit. But \u2013 especially here \u2013 not everything goes according to plan.     Palestinian-American developer Bashar al-Masri. Photograph: Uriel Sinai/Getty Images    Since Bashar al-Masri embarked on the Rawabi project in 2007, it has consumed every waking moment. \u201cI have a lot more grey hair. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve taken a single day of vacation. Maybe one. One single day. I never turn my mobile off. There have been many happy moments, but also many frustrating moments. It has not been an easy journey.\u201d The Palestinian-American businessman talks of his new city with passion. \u201cThis project sends a clear message. Despite all the obstacles the [Israeli] occupation puts in our way, we are determined to improve our lives and have our own state. \u201cThis is a mega-project, designed first for Palestinians. People stand on the top of the hill here and say: \u2018Wow! This is for us?\u2019 They see other places \u2013 in Dubai, Israel, the UK, America \u2013 on the internet, and now they see it in our own land, built by our own engineers and labourers. It brings national pride \u2013 yes we can, yes we can make a difference, despite all the misery. \u201cAnd Rawabi also sends a message to the international community. We are not what they are led to believe, a bunch of terrorists. We are ready to build our state. Here is the proof.\u201d Ghost town In 2012, ground was broken. By the middle of 2013, 600 apartments had been sold off-plan and another 8,000 people had registered as potential buyers. A year later, the first properties were finished and phase two was well under construction. But by early 2015, Rawabi was a ghost town and Masri was contemplating bankruptcy.     A finalised neighbourhood in the new Palestinian city of Rawabi. Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images    The issue that drove him and his mega-project to the edge of disaster was water. Masri spent two years trying to secure a dependable and adequate supply. Without it, Rawabi was dead. Israel took control of West Bank water resources almost 50 years ago, when its occupation of Palestinian territories began. Under the Oslo Accords, signed in 1993, a Joint Water Committee (JWC) between Israel and the newly created Palestinian Authority (PA) was set up. The PA allocates water supply within the West Bank, but the amount of water supplied is determined by Israel. Any water deal for Rawabi needed to be agreed by the JWC. But the PA was mostly refusing to deal with the body in protest at the vastly favourable supply of water to Israeli settlements compared to Palestinian towns. Rawabi was dry. \u201cIt was a super-critical two years,\u201d says Masri. \u201cWe were ready to deliver apartments, and we needed $100m from buyers waiting to move in. But we couldn\u2019t move forward.\u201d Construction slowed and hundreds of buyers pulled out. \u201cI really thought we would go bankrupt.\u201d In desperation, Masri appealed to his friends in international business and politics to intervene. One who advocated on behalf of Rawabi was former British prime minister Tony Blair, who would resign as Middle East envoy a few months later. \u201cBlair was a supporter of Rawabi. He\u2019s been here several times, he\u2019s helped clear [political] obstacles,\u201d says Masri.     Tony Blair plants an olive tree at Rawabi in June 2010. Photograph: Abbas Momani/AFP/Getty Images    The water deal came through in March 2015. \u201cWe were allocated a quota of 300 cubic metres a day. Now, we\u2019re already at the top of the quota, and we need more. But all Palestinian cities have water problems, all are asking for more water,\u201d says Masri. Water was not the only problem. Rawabi is situated in Area A, the 18% of the West Bank that is under Palestinian control. But access to the city lies through Area C, the 60% that is under full Israeli control. Masri had to negotiate for permission to build a road on which trucks could deliver construction materials and cars and buses carry Rawabi workers \u2013 and, eventually, give Rawabi residents access to the rest of the West Bank. \u201cIt was discussed at the White House, with [UN secretary-general] Ban Ki-moon, with everyone. Finally we started digging, putting facts on the ground with this road. Eventually, in 2012, with a lot of international pressure, they gave us a temporary permit for the road, But every year it has to be renewed, or they could close the road,\u201d says Masri. \u201cWe want to make the road permanent, we want to widen it and extend it. We\u2019ve been back and forth for a long time. But I\u2019m hopeful it will be approved in the near future.\u201d     An architect model of Rawabi. Photograph: Abbas Momani/AFP/Getty Images    The delays took their toll. \u201cBefore, for every unit I had 10 possible buyers. It became hard to find any.\u201d The project is now three years behind schedule and has a funding shortfall of at least $150m, says Masri. But the setbacks and difficulties go beyond the road and water delays. \u201cTo my knowledge, not another city in the world has been financed completely privately \u2013 every single thing from A-Z: sewage, water, schools, telecoms, electricity, roads, religious places. Everything is paid for by us, and we\u2019re not happy with that,\u201d says Masri. In 2008, Masri signed a private-public partnership agreement with the PA, under which the latter would fund the city\u2019s basic infrastructure to the tune of about $140m. \u201cI\u2019ve had nothing since then. The PA\u2019s priorities should be not just politics and security but also the economy. I understand they are financially broke but they could have delivered more than moral support.\u201d The PA does not even provide a police presence in the embryonic city. \u201cThey agreed to open a police station five months ago, but they need Israeli permission. Nothing has happened. We wait. Until then, I am the police chief of this city.\u201d At the very least, he says, the PA could have directed international donors to Rawabi. The project was announced just before a conference in Paris in December 2007, at which billions of dollars in aid was pledged to boost the Palestinian economy and state-building projects. \u201cI thought they\u2019d be all over us,\u201d says Masri. \u201cI\u2019m worried that the donor community remains focused on a welfare society in Palestine. But we need to generate long-lasting jobs rather than wait on handouts every month. We don\u2019t want to rely on philanthropy.\u201d Immunity to occupation Masri, 55, was born and raised in Nablus, a major commercial centre of the West Bank and a city which reputedly produced more suicide bombers than any other during the violent years of the second intifada, or uprising. He is a member of one of Palestine\u2019s best-known and wealthiest families; his uncle Munib al-Masri is a prominent businessman and philanthropist, sometimes called the Godfather of Palestine. After studying and working abroad, mainly in the US, Bashar al-Masri returned to the West Bank in the mid-90s at a time when hopes for a lasting settlement to the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict were high following the signing of the Oslo Accords.    I want to convince Google and Microsoft to create jobs here. We could be a centre of outsourcing. Why not?  Bashar al-Masri     But Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem continued, Israeli settlements within the Palestinian territories multiplied, and the prospects of a Palestinian state receded. Masri launched a newspaper and built a successful business \u2013 and thought hard about how to breathe life into the dying Palestinian economy. Slowly his dream of a new city, a new beginning, began to take shape. He drew on the expertise of international planners and architects to flesh out his vision, and secured funding from Qatar to augment his own massive investment. He bought the hilltop site as a deliberate riposte to Israeli settlers who sought out commanding positions for their burgeoning colonies (Palestinian towns and villages are usually found on valley slopes). Key to Masri\u2019s dream was a sustainable city, attracting investment and jobs to the West Bank. His ambition was to lure hi-tech and service industries to the empty office spaces above Rawabi\u2019s shopping mall, where they could take advantage of a relatively low-cost but highly educated and tech-minded young workforce.     A display living room in an apartment in Rawabi. Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images    The advantage of telecommunications, he says, is its \u201cimmunity to occupation\u201d. It does not need to overcome the hurdles of checkpoints and closures, import and export bans, and the vagaries of the Israeli civil and military authorities which control much of the West Bank. \u201cI want to convince Google and Microsoft to create jobs here. We could be a centre of outsourcing. Why not? That would be our Marshall Plan.\u201d Rawabi has many critics. Some Palestinians have belittled it as a vanity project for Masri. Some say the cost of housing is way beyond the reach of most Palestinians, for whom a long-term mortgage is impossible. Some worry that the concept of small units for nuclear families or solo dwellers challenges traditional social norms whereby extended families live grouped together, providing mutual care for the old and the young. And some accuse Masri of cosying up to Israel in order to get his project off the ground. These critics say Rawabi risks \u201cnormalising\u201d the Israeli occupation of the West Bank by embarking on such a major venture ahead of securing a Palestinian state. Some say his dealings with the Israeli authorities amount to \u201cwhitewashing\u201d or \u201ccollaboration\u201d. It is true that Masri has negotiated with Israel over the water supply and the road, and that much of the construction materials used to build Rawabi came from Israeli suppliers. But he shrugs off the criticism. \u201cThey\u2019re entitled to to their opinion. A lot of things they accuse me of are not true. I don\u2019t see dealing with Israeli companies as wrong \u2013 it\u2019s almost impossible not to deal with Israel. 99.9% of Palestinian homes are built with Israeli cement. You got to any Palestinian shop, and people are buying Israeli ice cream.\u201d \u201cSome people say Rawabi sugarcoats the occupation. I disagree. Rawabi is being built despite the occupation. We expose the occupation by our battle for basic things like water and a road.\u201d     Rawabi resident Mai Alzarou and her nine-month old daughter. Photograph: Harriet Sherwood for the Guardian    He describes some of his critics as \u201ccappuccino leftists\u201d. \u201cWho decides what to boycott and what not to boycott? It\u2019s okay to study at Tel Aviv university but not to buy Israeli cement?\u201d (This is a dig at Omar Barghouti, a founder of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, who was a student at the institution.) But, Masri concedes, anti-Israel slogans have resonance at a time \u201cwhen Palestinians are being killed in cold blood\u201d. Between October 2015 and March this year, 30 Israelis and two Americans died in a wave of stabbings, shootings and car-rammings by Palestinians. Over the same period, more than 200 Palestinians were killed, the majority while allegedly carrying out attacks. The violence has had an impact on Rawabi, says Masri. \u201cYou can\u2019t market nice new homes in a climate when people are being killed, when there are closures and demolitions [of Palestinian homes by security forces].\u201d    The patterns of Palestinian society are changing  Mai Alzarou     It has also been a setback for Masri\u2019s ambitions to attract tech companies to Rawabi. Despite his overtures, no international businesses have committed to locating in the city. \u201cWe\u2019re struggling,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe did Rawabi the awkward way \u2013 we built a city, then invited [businesses] to come. The norm is to first create jobs, then build a city around them.\u201d But, typically for Masri, he is undeterred. \u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be able to do it. All over the world we have friends who are mesmerised by Rawabi. For the first time they see, hear, read, watch the Palestinian people doing something positive. The international community is on our side, not against us.\u201d In the meantime, the development of Rawabi itself has created thousands of jobs \u2013 and, unusually, almost half its workforce is female. This was deliberate. \u201cWomen are equally qualified and super-hardworking. We wanted to empower women in the workplace.\u201d Masri is the father of two daughters in their early 20s. \u201cI see how women can be at a disadvantage, and when the economy is bad, women get the worst part of it. Here, we are trying to build a civilisation, and that requires equality.\u201d More pragmatically, he adds: \u201cAnd young people buying a home here usually need two salaries.\u201d   Related: The story of cities, part 1: how Alexandria laid foundations for the modern world    Mai Alzarou and her family are typical of Rawabi residents. Alzarou, 25, an English teacher, her salesman husband and nine-month-old daughter moved to the city from Bethlehem last autumn. Their three-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment was on sale for $120,000, but the Alzarous took advantage of a \u201crent-to-buy\u201d scheme. They are paying $500 a month in rent for two-and-a-half years, and then will pay off the balance with a combination of savings and mortgage. \u201cIn Palestine we usually live in extended families. But not all young people think this is the best way. We wanted our own apartment with new neighbours,\u201d she said. According to Jaradat, typical buyers are in their 30s with young families, with both husband and wife working outside the home in the private sector, well-educated and looking for a new lifestyle among other young families. Among the first 700 families, 10% are Christian compared to 3% in the overall population. \u201cThe patterns of Palestinian society are changing,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I bought my apartment, my family didn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s not part of our culture, but I\u2019m glad we\u2019re changing that.\u201d How far and how deep the changes go is not known. Is Rawabi a momentous trailblazer or a colossal folly? Masri has no doubt, but others are watching cautiously. \u201cMy vision is not just Rawabi,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is not about real estate, this is about change at the grassroots, it\u2019s about empowerment. Rawabi is a pilot project that will start a domino effect. The only question is when.\u201d Does your city have a little-known story that made a major impact on its development?

Later, he stresses that concocting new drugs is a discovery process not an inventive one: \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly as intentional as most people think. The only aspects of a novel molecule I can control are its chemical structure and its legality. But there is no scientific method for predicting what effect it will have on the human body or mind or brain, and whether it will have any effect at all.\u201d  Zee tests every new concoction on himself. \u201cIt\u2019s part of my working routine \u2013 not part of my private life,\u201d he says. \u201cI make molecule after molecule then try them without prejudice. You have to keep an open mind.\u201d He claims to try one or two new compounds a week. Isn\u2019t it dangerous, putting himself forward as a human guinea pig?     \u2018It\u2019s a lot less dangerous than it seems\u2019 \u2026 Dr Zee working on new chemical compounds. Photograph: BBC    \u201cIt\u2019s a lot less dangerous than it seems,\u201d he says. \u201cThat said, I have a great deal of knowledge that allows me to disqualify potential dangers. I strongly discourage blind self-experimentation without a very deep scientific background. DO NOT try this at home!\u201d  Given that Zee is clearly a capable scientist \u2013 he claims to have three degrees in mathematics and previous experience working on the Human Genome Project in Tel Aviv \u2013 isn\u2019t there something more beneficial he could do with his skills? He believes his work has positive effects outside of helping people get high: \u201cA number of substances I have discovered are being investigated for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s, post-traumatic stress disorder and smoking cessation,\u201d he says. \u201cA rather exciting molecule I recently stumbled on feels, in small doses, like alcohol. I have done the necessary toxicological studies and shown it to be much less harmful than alcohol. I am working diligently to develop this compound as a cure for alcoholism and overconsumption.\u201d So is Zee a force for good, a freedom fighter mocking our draconian and self-defeating drug laws? Or is he a brainier version of your average drug dealer, feeding off the misery and despair of addicts?      \u2018A strange workplace\u2019 \u2026 Dr Zee in his lab in Amsterdam. Photograph: BBC    In the documentary, we see head shop owners readying chemicals in cement mixers \u2013 a heavily regulated industry this is not, and the long-term effects on users are still largely unknown. As for the short-term ones: deaths from legal highs have doubled in the last five years, with hospital admissions rising by 56% over the 2009-2012 period. Last week, five men in Rochdale collapsed after taking legal highs called Annihilation and Cherry Bomb.  Documentary director Tom Costello says he met Dr Zee in his laboratory on an industrial estate in Amsterdam \u2013 \u201ca strange workplace: there are bags of white powders on every desk and in every drawer, boards full of strange chemical symbols, and a Breaking Bad-style lab set up where the drugs are cooked up into trays of huge crystals.\u201d He was convinced by Zee\u2019s claims that he wanted to make drug-taking safer and take the trade out of criminals\u2019 hands. \u201cBut however convincing I found his arguments, I was surprised by how little he knew about how his drugs were being sold and taken in Britain,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s used the UK as a petri-dish for an experiment which has had real consequences \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 on the streets of the UK.\u201d I ask Zee how he feels about people being harmed by taking his drugs? His response is well-formed, with something of a politician\u2019s detachment. \u201cI am saddened by stories of people caught in addictive loops and by stories of people that have incurred any sort of harm from any drug,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cI adhere to my commitment to toxicologically test anything I promote for market, and have data attesting to the safety of my discoveries. Also, keep in mind that tolerance does not occur for substances I have promoted. That said, I\u2019d like to find a way for everyone in society, and society itself, to have a beneficial relationship with psychoactives.\u201d     Peter, who runs the Gypsy Kings head shop. Photograph: Christian Cargill/BBC/Pulse Films    Watching the documentary, you do wonder if Zee \u2013 who has \u201cnever met anybody addicted to my drugs. I\u2019ve never come face to face with it\u201d \u2013 is too far removed from his consumers. Whether it\u2019s weed substitute Spice or cocaine-mimicking Rush, users repeatedly stress that the highs are far greater than the thing they\u2019re supposed to ape. The longterm effects can be equally grim too \u2013 we see Glen, 31, whose life has revolved around Spice since he moved on from weed, or Phil, a homeless addict since his teens who ditched illegal drugs for the pleasures of shooting up \u00a340 worth of Magic Crystals in a nearby church every day. These people are clearly trapped in a cycle of addiction \u2013 though you could easily argue that they would be regardless of their chosen substance\u2019s easy availability.  In the documentary, drugs minister Karen Bradley say: \u201cIt\u2019s causing anti-social behaviour, it\u2019s causing harm to young people and communities want to see these head shops close down.\u201d     Phil, who ditched illegal drugs in favour of Magic Crystals. Photograph: Christian Cargill/BBC/Pulse Film    Yet there are counter-arguments. The legal highs business is an \u00a382m industry in the UK, with all the resultant tax income and job creation that brings \u2013 closing that down won\u2019t stop people taking drugs, but it will send a lot of users back to the illegal market.  Zee tells me that \u201csimilar to the way gay rights or freedom of religion are things our societies were opposed to in the past and are proud of upholding today, so we will be proud of upholding cognitive liberty tomorrow\u201d. For all this moral talk, you suspect part of him does get a kick out of finding ways to annoy the establishment, who he says place him under \u201cclose scrutiny\u201d despite his transparent \u2013 and legal \u2013 working methods. Which brings us back to the methspresso machine, Zee\u2019s latest attempt to make recreational drugs within the boundaries of UK law. Using his invention, Zee hopes to sell non-psychoactive substances that people can convert into a psychoactive substance at home (the re-purposed coffee maker will heat the substance in hydrochloric acid for six hours, before converting the resultant brown liquid into powder form \u2013 instead of a coffee dripping out, you get drugs). \u201cI have solved all the major hurdles and have proven feasibility,\u201d he says, when I ask where the project is currently at. \u201cNow, I must work through a sea of tiny details.\u201d As if it needed saying, he adds: \u201cBut I persevere.\u201d  \u2022 The Last Days of Legal Highs is on BBC Three on Wednesday from 6pm.

Malka Leifer fled Australia in 2008 after the allegations were first raised, and her alleged victims have been fighting since then for her return to Victoria to face the justice system.  On Thursday, the Jerusalem district court judge Amnon Cohen declared Leifer unfit to face an extradition trial after receiving a report from Leifer\u2019s psychiatrist.  Cohen also lifted Leifer\u2019s home detention and ordered that she receive outpatient treatment from a psychiatrist once a month, a process the court heard could go on for a decade. Only once that treatment was completed could the possibility of an extradition trial again be raised before a committee, the court heard. A survivor of abuse within Australia\u2019s Yeshivah centres, Manny Waks, now lives in Israel and has been supporting Leifer\u2019s alleged victims in Australia, providing them with updates from the court. He said Cohen\u2019s ruling risked re-traumatising her alleged victims, and could have the consequence of deterring others from coming forward.   Related: Manny Waks: I'm the 'troublemaker' who blew the whistle on Jewish abuse scandal     He told Guardian Australia that the alleged victims he spoke to said they felt \u201ccompletely let down by Israel\u2019s legal system, and there is certainly a lot of anger and outrage\u201d. He questioned the judgment, and said he believed there were alternative options Cohen could have considered if he believed Leifer was unfit to face the court. \u201cIf someone is unable to stand trial for medical reasons, then they need to be provided the best medical care so they can face justice as soon as possible, and I just can\u2019t see how monthly visits to a psychiatrist will achieve that,\u201d Waks said.  \u201cShe should be institutionalised, looked after so that she can recuperate quickly, and then face trial or at the very least, face an extradition hearing as soon as possible.\u201d  The prosecution had also raised doubts about the validity of Leifer\u2019s medical claims throughout the case, concerns that Cohen at times seemed to agree with. Waks said he feared Israel was \u201cbecoming a safe haven\u201d for alleged paedophiles, with Leifer not the first case he was aware of where victims had felt let down.   Related: Melbourne Orthodox Jewish school ordered to pay $1.1m to abuse victim    \u201cI am aware of another case where the trial that has been going on for a year and half, whereas in Australia it might go for a week or a month, and the young victims are being repeatedly cross-examined. It is just endless trauma for them,\u201d he said. \u201cI spoke to another victim from the US, whose alleged perpetrator escaped to Israel and when he went to the police here, police put him in the same room as his perpetrator and basically re-traumatised him. While there is some good work going on here to help victims, these examples show Israel\u2019s justice system has a long way to go.\u201d  Waks said he believed the Australian government and embassy had done all they could to see Leifer face justice, including offering medical assistance to enable her to get well enough to face the court. He hoped they would continue to put pressure on Israel. An ambassador with the Australian embassy in Tel Aviv , Dave Sharma, told the ABC they were studying the judgment closely. The prosecution has been given 72 hours to return to dispute the decision on lifting Leifer\u2019s house arrest. \u201cWe are committed to seeing this woman extradited to Australia to face these very serious child sex abuse charges,\u201d Sharma told the ABC. \u201cWe are determined to be patient and persevere to this end with the view to seeing her extradited.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-06-03T02:19:57Z", "title": "Former Australian principal accused of child sex abuse avoids extradition", "sentences": ["An ambassador with the Australian embassy in Tel Aviv , Dave Sharma, told the ABC they were studying the judgment closely."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/03/adass-israel-girls-school-malka-leifer-former-australian-principal-accused-of-child-sex-abuse-avoids-extradition"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Palestinian territories", "Benjamin Netanyahu"], "article": "The boys file in first: noisy Jewish teenagers in kippahs, students at Jerusalem\u2019s Himmelfarb high school.

It needs to be addressed by leaders, by members of Knesset who were chosen by the people. \u201cAt this point, we have to base the existence of the state of Israel on a Jewish state, and a democratic one. We have to hold on to and strengthen the Zionist dream, which often causes friction with those citizens who are not Zionist.\u201d The event at the Himmelfarb school, part of an initiative by Rivlin to build bridges between Israel\u2019s communities, stands in sharp contrast to the current atmosphere in Israel, where those whose voices are loudest seem more interested in emphasising separation and nationalism. That has fuelled fears of a widening division between Israel\u2019s Jews and Arabs as Israel has moved ever further to the right since Binyamin Netanyahu was returned for his second spell as prime minister in 2009 \u2013 a period marked by a heightened political rhetoric against Israeli Arabs.

Photograph: Peter Beaumont for the Observer    This trend has been highlighted in recent months by polls, comments and initiatives by rightwing politicians on issues as diverse as whether Arab medical staff should work in Israeli maternity wards, on housing and even who is acceptable as a teacher. Most stark were the findings earlier this year by the US Pew Research Centre in its report, Israel\u2019s Religiously Divided Society. The bleakest sections of this depiction of the multiple social divisions in Israeli society were those dealing with relations between Israeli Arabs \u2013 who are a 20% minority in Israel, or 1.4 million out of a population of 8.5 million \u2013 and Jews. Among its headlines were the claims that 79% of Jews questioned believed that they should get preferential treatment, with the same survey finding that nearly half of Israeli Jews agreed to some degree that Arabs should be expelled or transferred from Israel \u2013 with roughly one in five Jewish adults strongly agreeing. It has been underscored by a growing and vocal anxiety \u2013 even among some figures on Israel\u2019s right \u2013 over trends in society and democracy, as Israel\u2019s politics have become more nationalist, not least after Netanyahu brought the ultra-nationalist Avigdor Lieberman into his coalition as defence minister. The reality is that even before Lieberman\u2019s return to Netanyahu\u2019s newly configured government \u2013 the most rightwing in Israel\u2019s history \u2013 a series of initiatives by rightwing ministers had focused attention on issues of race and identity. Among them have been a new 500-page civics textbook \u2013 To Be Citizens in Israel \u2013 produced under Bennett\u2019s watch in May, which has been accused of largely editing out Israeli Arabs and their experiences. \u201cThe book\u2019s message is impossible to mistake,\u201d argued a Haaretz editorial condemning it after it was unveiled. \u201cJewish identity, as expressed in the state\u2019s definition of itself and in the public sphere, takes priority over civic identity. This mainly reflects the views of an orthodox, conservative, rightwing strain of Judaism. \u201cThe text contains no model of shared life between Jews and Arabs. The Jews\u2019 rights are clear; the Arabs\u2019 place is restricted; and the walls separating them are only raised even higher. The racism that is ripping Israeli society apart receives almost no mention.\u201d     Israel police detain an Israeli Arab during clashes in Nazareth in October. Photograph: Baz Ratner/Reuters    The furore over the book \u2013 which superseded one that rightwing parties such as Bennett\u2019s complained was too critical of the state \u2013 has not been an isolated incident. In December, Bennett\u2019s ministry removed a book, Dorit Rabinyan\u2019s Borderlife, that depicted a love story between an Israeli woman and a Palestinian man, from the curriculum of Israeli secular state schools. A proposed amendment to Israel\u2019s basic law \u2013 effectively its constitution \u2013 that would make it possible for the Knesset to expel members, has also been criticised by Israeli Arab parties, who believe it was aimed at reducing their representation. Outside the realm of political rhetoric, another factor has been at work \u2013 a deep sense of mutual anxiety and suspicion fuelled, in part, by the recent wave of violence between Palestinians and Israelis that began last autumn and whose influence has leached into communal relations in Israel. In the most recent incident, video emerged of five off-duty Israeli police officers, out of uniform, savagely beating an Israeli Arab supermarket worker in Tel Aviv after he queried why one was asking for his ID. The question that remains open, however, is how much politicians\u2019 talk of separation reflects reality and how much it simply mirrors the increased prominence of rightwing nationalist politics in Israel, as the country has been moving to the right. And behind that question lies a more fundamental one \u2013 how toxic the politics of identity and division, opportunist and populist as they sometimes are, might prove to Israel\u2019s democracy. While Israel is far from alone in experiencing the rise of rightwing populism \u2013 it is also being witnessed in the US and Europe \u2013 what makes it different is the context of the long Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories that has persisted since 1967. Indeed, it is precisely the shared sense of identity and history and family ties between Israeli Arabs and Palestinians in the occupied territories \u2013 unsurprising because they were the same people in pre-Israel British Mandate Palestine \u2013 that for some on the Israeli right makes Israeli Arabs seem \u201csuspect\u201d. Dahlia Scheindlin, a pollster and political analyst, says she and her colleagues started noticing a far more overt discourse about the issue in 2009 and have only recently tried to quantify what it means. \u201cI think this is more visible, in part, because it has been legitimised by the current politics. You started seeing more rhetoric around race and ethnicity when Lieberman began emerging as a political force after 2006, when he ran with his own party,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was talking about his population exchange plan [to transfer Israeli Arabs into a future Palestine]. Even then it was clear he felt it was legitimate to target Arabs in Israel. Later he would be talking about no citizenship without loyalty. He was very, very explicit and comfortable on that platform. And as Lieberman started to advance legislation around that, Likud [Netanyahu\u2019s party] got scared. All societies have a latent xenophobia. Lieberman tapped into it.\u201d     Israeli youths holding mock guns relive the battle for Jerusalem during the six day war in 1967. Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPA    And Lieberman\u2019s message \u2013 perhaps beyond even the divisive legislation that his party championed \u2013 was no more clearly expressed than in a television debate during last year\u2019s elections when he attacked Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Joint Arab List in the Knesset, and one of the most prominent critics of discrimination against Israeli Arabs. \u201cWhy did you come to this studio and not to a studio in Gaza?\u201d Lieberman railed at him. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you standing for election in Ramallah [the main city in the occupied Palestinian territories] rather than in the Israeli Knesset? Why are you even here? You\u2019re not wanted here.\u201d The sense of a growing division on both sides, experts say, has also worked in counterintuitive ways. One hope was that the slow emergence of a new and better-off Israeli Arab middle class might lead to more social mobility and integration. Instead, there is some evidence that the opposite has happened, with new spending power concentrating in gyms and malls, for instance, in Israeli Arab towns and neighbourhoods, reinforcing the separation. But not everyone is convinced that the growing incidence of xenophobic discourse \u2013 not least on social media on both sides \u2013 and the recent evidence of a move to rightwing nationalist policies are necessarily embraced by a majority of Israelis. Sammy Smooha, an anthropologist and sociologist at Haifa University, who has long studied attitudes in Israel via his Index of Arab-Jewish Relations in Israel, points out that despite an April poll suggesting that 49% of Jews would not want an Arab living in their apartment building, some 90% of Israeli Arabs live in Israeli Arab towns and neighbourhoods anyway. He adds, too, that the most visible and strongly expressed views are confined to the nationalist ends of the spectrum, among both Jews and Israeli citizens of Palestinian origin. \u201cI have spent years trying to understand what is going on in the middle, among the silent majority. There is a willingness there on the part of Jews to accommodate Arabs in schools and neighbourhoods,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Arabs express a willingness to be accommodated in Jewish towns. There is a big gap between attitudes and reality of separation. Is it getting worse over the years? Yes, to some extent I can see that in my surveys for the past 13 years there is less willingness, but still there is still a large willingness. \u201cThere is more public expression of hostility on both sides \u2013 yes.\u201d Paradoxically, on the Israeli Arab side, both Smooha and Scheindlin argue that that has been encouraged by the emergence of a better-educated and wealthier group in Israeli Arab society who are far more willing to speak out about discrimination. Smooha echoes the question asked by 16-year-old Ba\u2019ara Isa in the Himmelfarb school. \u201cIn the west, there is a civic nationalism that creates an entity \u2013 say the French people or the American people \u2013 an idea of people-hood regardless of religion and ethnicity, where all citizens have a common stake. In Israel, that does not exist. There is no civic nation in Israel. Arabs are attached to an Arab national idea and Jews to the Jewish nation.\u201d He agrees with Scheindlin on the influence of Israel\u2019s ever more right-leaning politics. \u201cThe current state of the political dialogue is very influential and it is very animating.\u201d What he is less certain about is how far \u2013 and in what direction \u2013 that rhetoric is actually carrying Israelis.And for his part, Israel\u2019s President Rivlin \u2013 a rightwing politician and member of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, under whose auspices the event at the Himmelfarb school took place \u2013 has bluntly dramatised what he sees as the \u201cgrowing\u201d problem. Speaking last year at an event to encourage Israel\u2019s biggest companies to employ more Israeli Arabs in managerial positions, he asked: \u201cHow many of us Jews know colleagues at work who are Arab? How many of us have true friends who are Arab? How many of us know the agenda of the Arab public, or the differences dividing their society? \u201cA huge gap has grown over the years between two societies that live next to each other and with each other, and yet are blind to each other \u2026 We must admit the painful truth: namely, that for the majority of Jewish-Israeli society, the Arab public occupies a blind spot.\u201d After Rivlin and Bennett had left the Himmelfarb school, Bara\u2019a Isa\u2019s headteacher, Shireen Natur, remained in the playground with some of her girls for photographs. She hopes that initiatives like Rivlin\u2019s will crack some of the ice. \u201cWe are separated. We are really divided. There is racism on both sides. The problem is when you don\u2019t know the other and you are afraid, separation is the result. \u201cYou know I used to be a Hebrew teacher. For 14 years.

That song is \u201cbased on a personal relationship I had \u2013 a few, actually \u2013 that I thought was never going end \u2026 but these things do, regardless of how many counselling sessions you go to, or how many self-help books you read\u201d. Another track, I Can\u2019t Hear God Anymore, is \u201ca metaphor for someone who I had a spiritual connection with, in terms of music. That relationship came to an end, and I haven\u2019t had that connection with anybody else\u201d.            The Christian missionary influence was strong in Papua New Guinea; Ngaiire\u2019s grandfather was a preacher. \u201cI basically grew up in church,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t practice as much now. It was confusing for me, trying to find out where I fit in today\u2019s world, with what my parents had taught me.\u201d When her father\u2019s scholarship in New Zealand ran out, the family moved back to their homeland. Ngaiire recalls one morning, in 1994, running up the hallway of their Rabaul home, thinking the tremors shaking the house were fun. A volcano was about to erupt. \u201cMy dad was like: \u2018We\u2019ve got to get out of here\u2019. So we went to my grandmother\u2019s house overnight, woke up and there was ash coming out of the sky,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe borrowed a car and drove out of the city. There were loads of people getting out, carrying what they could. Two hours later, the volcano mushroomed into the sky. We were like: fuck, faster!  \u201cAnother one erupted in the direction we were heading. We thought: \u2018What the hell do we do?\u2019 Some people turned back. Surprisingly, only two people died \u2013 only because people were very connected to the land, so they were attuned to what was happening. \u201cOurs was an old colonial house, so it had no chance. All our childhood photos were gone. We didn\u2019t have insurance. We went from one refugee camp to the next for three months.             \u201cWe were in the bush with no electricity, no running water, no contact with the outside world. At that time, my parents had split up, and my mother was working on the mainland [in Lae]. She was panicking: \u2018Where are my children?\u2019 \u201cShe sent a message through talkback radio, and one of my uncles heard it. She sent a chartered airplane to come pick us up.\u201d It was only when Ngaiire came to Australia, settling in Lismore at age 16, that she understood Australian society was different for women. In Papua New Guinea, she had been raised to understand that looking people in the eye was disrespectful. Women in her homeland were not allowed to speak up so much, she explains. Observing other teenagers in Australia taught her that eye contact was about respect and confidence. Indeed, check the glint in her eye in the Once video, or the clip of her performing a cover of Tame Impala\u2019s The Less I Know in the Triple J studio, and you\u2019d think she was now an extrovert. But you\u2019d be wrong. \u201cI\u2019m a total introvert,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI can go days without seeing anyone. I intentionally book a room for myself, apart from the band, so I can have my own time.\u201d  \u2022 Blastoma is released on 10 June on Maximilion Brown; Ngaiire\u2019s Australian tour kicks off at Perisher Valley, New South Wales, on 10 June", "publicationDate": "2016-06-07T02:09:04Z", "title": "Australian singer Ngaiire on surviving bullying, volcanoes and childhood cancer", "sentences": ["For the third single, House on a Rock, Ngaiire shot a new video in an apartment in Tel Aviv, a city that is \u201crustic and rundown, and a beautiful setting\u201d."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/07/australian-singer-ngaiire-on-surviving-bullying-volcanoes-and-childhood-cancer"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Four people have been killed and six wounded in a shooting attack at a popular retail complex in central Tel Aviv near Israel\u2019s defence ministry. The shooting on Wednesday evening took place around the Sarona complex, an area with shops and restaurants close to the Israeli military\u2019s main headquarters. According to initial reports, two gunmen were involved, one firing inside the Sarona complex itself and the other in an adjacent street. Police later said the two gunmen were two Palestinians from the same family in the Hebron area of the occupied West Bank. Officials said both gunmen were shot, apprehended and disarmed by security forces.  Security footage showed the pair, dressed in suit and tie and posing as customers at a restaurant, suddenly pull out automatic weapons and open fire, shooting one man point blank, as other diners fled.   Police said the assailants killed four people in the 9.30pm assault and that six were wounded, several of whom were described as being in a serious condition. Although details were sparse it appears shots were initially fired at people walking in the street near a restaurant and then in an adjoining street. Yechiel Miller, a volunteer medic with United Hatzalah, related from the scene of the attack: \u201cWhen I arrived at the scene I saw a woman who was unconscious and not breathing and in critical condition. We began resuscitation efforts. We also treated numerous other individuals who suffered gunshot wounds and wounds from shrapnel.\u201d The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who has just returned from a meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow, went straight to the Kirya \u2013 the Israeli military\u2019s headquarters close to the Sarona complex \u2013 to be briefed on the incident. According to witnesses, the two gunmen, dressed smartly in dark suits and ties, arrived at the Max Brenner restaurant and ordered food before launching their attack. Avraham Liber was sitting in Max Brenner when the attack started. \u201cMe and a couple of friends were sitting at the restaurant here just having some ice cream when we heard the shots. I was sitting in the direction so I could see the shooter. I saw him. It looked like he was sitting in a chair at the cafe and he had a rifle in his hand. He was just shooting point blank at people. He didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d   Related: Homemade guns used in Palestinian attacks on Israelis    Photographs released after the shootings showed one of the weapons used: what appeared to be a locally made \u201cCarl Gustav\u201d submachine gun, which has increasingly become a feature in Palestinian shooting attacks in recent months. Video footage of the incident showed what appeared to be a policeman or security guard firing a pistol towards one of the suspected attackers. One witness, Tomer, described a minute of panic and shooting to the Israeli website Ynet. \u201cWe were sitting outside and a round of bullets [were fired]. Everyone started running. This is not like a normal terror attack. The shots were fired for at least a minute. There was a panic, and we were asked to go inside the building.\u201d Meital Sassi told Channel 10 TV she was out with her family celebrating her son\u2019s birthday when she heard shots and \u201cimmediately understood it was a terror attack\u201d. \u201cWe ran like lightning with the baby and the stroller \u2026 I yelled at people who didn\u2019t understand what was happening to run,\u201d she said.

Video footage and witness accounts described the bloody scene on Wednesday evening, with families and friends dining at restaurants, as the dead were named. Those who died came from Tel Aviv and its surrounding towns and from the Negev. Nave, a mother of four from Tel Aviv, Ido Ben Ari from Ramat Gan, Michael Feige, 58, a professor of sociology and anthropology at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Mila Mishayev, 32, from Ashkelon. Mishayev, the youngest of the victims, was waiting in the restaurant for her fiance when the attack took place. In one video, the attackers \u2013 named by Palestinian media as Muhammad and Khalid Muhamra \u2013 can be seeing sitting in dark suits and white shirts at a table in the popular Max Brenner restaurant, where they had reportedly ordered drinks and chocolate brownies, before standing up suddenly and firing at close range at fellow diners.   Related: Four dead in Tel Aviv market shooting    Ben Ari, 41, a father of two, was in the neighbouring Benedict restaurant when he was shot and his wife reportedly also wounded. He was a manager at Coca-Cola in Israel. One of the wounded, Asaf Bar, was dining with his girlfriend in Max Brenner when he was shot in the head twice. \u201cHe spoke to us, he can move all his limbs,\u201d Bar\u2019s father Avner told Israeli media. \u201cOne bullet remains in his head and the other was removed.\u201d  Israel\u2019s Channel 10 aired CCTV footage from inside the restaurant showing two men in suits shooting at diners as they run away from their tables. One of the attackers shoots a man on the ground and waves a knife before running out. Other footage showed scenes of panic as people fled from where they were eating; one witness described some diners seeking safety in a restaurant refrigerator.           People flee shooting in Tel Aviv    The attack, it appears, lasted a minute before one of the assailants was shot by a security guard while the other was arrested by police. The attack was welcomed by Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza. The restaurant\u2019s manager told the Ynet news website what he recalled: \u201cI was sitting in the restaurant and they were acting like any regular customer.   \u201cThey had bags and they ordered something to eat. Suddenly they pulled guns out and starting firing. They didn\u2019t shout anything. The two of them simply took the guns out and opened fire.\u201d Yosef Jibrin, a barman at Max Brenner, commented to Ynet on initial reports that the men may have disguised themselves as observant Jews. \u201cThey didn\u2019t look like ultra-Orthodox people. When the shooting began people tried to flee into our kitchen. I also fled and then I returned to the restaurant to see if there were any more people. I saw wounded people on the floor and helped one of them until a paramedic arrived.\u201d     Israeli policemen arrest a suspect man shortly after the shooting attack. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    The shooting \u2013 in the first week of Ramadan \u2013 occurred when Israelis were getting used to a recent and marked drop in the recent months of violence and in one of the softest of targets \u2013 in a restaurant in an area of restored buildings popular with both residents and tourists and soldiers from the nearby military headquarters. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, met his defence minister and security leaders shortly after the attack and then travelled to the scene. \u201cWe discussed a range of offensive and defensive steps which we shall take in order to act against this phenomenon,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office quoted the premier as saying. \u201cThere will be intensive action by the police, the army and other security services, not just to catch every accomplice to this murder but also to prevent further incidents.\u201d However in the aftermath of the shooting Tel Aviv\u2019s mayor Ron Huldai struck a markedly different tone on Thursday - and stoked controversy - by linking the continuing violence to Israel\u2019s occupation of the Palestinian territories. Speaking to Army Radio he said: \u201cWe might be the only country in the world where another nation is under occupation without civil rights (....) You can\u2019t hold people in a situation of occupation and hope they\u2019ll reach the conclusion everything is alright.\u201d For his part Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement that he rejected all attacks on civilians. \u201cThe presidency has repeatedly rejected all operations against civilians from any party, no matter what the justification.\u201d \u201cThe realization of a just peace, and creating a positive climate, that is what will lead to the lowering of tension and violence in the region,\u201d the statement continues. Israel on Thursday suspended most of 83,000 special permits for Palestinians to visit Israel during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and beefed up police patrols in Tel Aviv. Israel considers the Ramadan permits a goodwill gesture toward Palestinians. The Ramadan permits were also suspended for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, including permits to visit relatives in Israel, travel abroad and attend prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. The shooting drew international condemnation, with the US calling it a \u201chorrific terrorist attack\u201d and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton condeming it as \u201cheinous\u201d.  The UN\u2019s special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Nickolay Mladenov, said: \u201cAll must reject violence and say no to terror.\u201d   Related: US student dead and at least 13 others injured in attacks across Israel    He added in a statement: \u201cI am also shocked to see Hamas welcome the terror attack. Leaders must stand against violence and the incitement that fuels it, not condone it.\u201d  Police identified at least one of the weapons used as a home-made automatic weapon, known locally as a Carl Gustav, or \u201cCarlo\u201d, the use of which has become increasingly prominent in recent attacks.  Many attacks in the wave of violence that began last autumn have been in east Jerusalem or the West Bank, territories Israel seized from Jordan in the 1967 war and which the Palestinians want for their future state. But Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s most cosmopolitan city, has not been spared. A member of Israel\u2019s Arab minority went on a shooting rampage on New Year\u2019s Day, killing three people.

Bird, who is 34, is a writer and radio presenter, and 31-year-old Naughton had spent 10 years making her way up in music management to work for Coldplay. They had beliefs and ideals, and had gone on the odd march, but they weren\u2019t activists. Political engagement did not go much beyond putting up an opinionated Facebook post. Then the refugee crisis began to encroach on the holiday headlines and, like a lot of people, they both wondered how they might help. Bird noticed that her old acting teacher, a Zen monk named Tom Radcliffe, had posted on Facebook saying he was going to raise \u00a31,000, get in his car and drive to the refugee camp in Calais. She and Naughton offered to help. At a lunch with their mutual friend, the TV presenter and author Dawn O\u2019Porter, the three women decided to start a hashtag #HelpCalais, with the aim of getting enough money and clothes together via Twitter to take a van to France.    If people hadn\u2019t helped my dad, I kind of wouldn\u2019t be here, so I had to help in some way    With their Twitter followers, social media savvy and background in promotion, it wasn\u2019t difficult to reach out to a few thousand people. Still, they weren\u2019t prepared for just how quickly things would escalate. Naughton would soon quit her job and both women would be scrambling to exploit their celebrity contacts. But most surprising of all, they would find themselves ahead of all the established charities and agencies, at the forefront of the momentous task of feeding, housing and looking after tens of thousands of refugees across Europe. In the first few days of their appeal, so many donations arrived that they had to find storage space, which the company Big Yellow donated for free. Then Dani Lawrence turned up, also wanting to help. A 43-year-old mother of three who runs an import company with her husband, she told me she had personal reasons for coming on board. As she, Naughton and Bird made one of their regular Eurostar trips to Calais last week, Lawrence explained her motivation: \u201cMy father\u2019s Moroccan, and he left when he was 17 in a boat to a refugee camp in Gibraltar, and then a bigger one in Marseille.\u201d Eyes watery with emotion, she continues: \u201cHe left without family, papers or passport. So the images of refugees in the summer resonated with me. If people hadn\u2019t helped my dad, I kind of wouldn\u2019t be here, so I had to help in some way.\u201d     The first Help Refugees aid lorry leaves the UK last September.    Bird\u2019s sister, who lives in Tel Aviv, became supply manager, setting up an Amazon wish list so that anyone who wanted to donate could order a tent, sleeping bag or any other essential for the homeless and dispossessed. A week after they started, the image of three-year-old Syrian Alan Kurdi flashed around the world, showing his body washed up on a Turkish beach after his family\u2019s dinghy capsized en route for Greece. The three women were deeply affected by the photograph. They were not alone. Bird\u2019s sister in Israel called her to say that there was a glitch with the Amazon wish list. \u201cShe said, \u2018I keep putting on 100 pairs of boots, 200 sleeping bags, 300 tents, and they keep disappearing\u2019,\u201d recalls Bird. \u201cI had a go, and suddenly we realised that they were disappearing because people were buying them.\u201d They got a call from Big Yellow asking how many volunteers they had. The answer was six. They were told they were going to need many more: 7,000 packages had arrived in a day, and would continue to come at a similar rate for the next five weeks. Again the women used social media to drum up support, and hundreds of volunteers turned up, from out-of-work actors to concerned grandmothers. They needed to be fed, so the women used their persuasive powers, and Domino\u2019s Pizza and Nando\u2019s did the rest. They now had 15 storage rooms. What had started out as a goodwill gesture had turned into an industrial process. They had to learn about transportation, distribution, palletising. Enter a prison logistics officer named Ash, eager to help. \u201cWe had all this stuff and no way of shifting it,\u201d says Lawrence. \u201cSo we went to Calais for the night, all four of us in my car.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d says Naughton. \u201cWe actually thought we might get there and there would be a large, you know, UNHCR or Red Cross camp, and there would be a warehouse.\u201d \u201cBut there was nothing,\u201d says Lawrence. \u201cNo warehouse. No big organisations. No structure. Just a load of amazing people, working there on the ground.\u201d At this stage, most people would have congratulated themselves for their good deed and beat a hasty retreat home. But two encounters made them want to redouble their efforts. The first was with a remarkable woman called Liz Clegg, a former firefighter from Glastonbury who was organising food and aid at the camp. She had seen well-intentioned people come and go without really improving the situation. She was sceptical about the group, who were calling themselves Help Calais at the time. They had to prove they were committed if she was going to work with them.     Dani Lawrence, Lliana Bird and Josie Naughton photographed in the refugee camp at Calais last week.

He said, \u2018My parents smuggled me out, and I went from Turkey to Lesbos on a boat that started sinking.\u2019 The people smugglers attempted to keep the boat afloat by throwing off all the unaccompanied boys to drown. And the boy said: \u2018I realised what was happening so I linked my arm with the boy next to me, who was also without family, and I said: We\u2019re brothers, we\u2019re brothers, they won\u2019t throw us off.\u2019\u201d Lawrence pauses, welling up again. Having survived the journey, the boy was now alone in Calais. \u201cI said, \u2018What do you mean you\u2019re on your own?\u2019 He said, \u2018I\u2019m on my own.\u2019 I was thinking, how can he be living on his own? I have a 14-year-old. \u2018What can I bring you?\u2019 I asked. And he looked me in the eyes, full of tears, and said \u2018I don\u2019t want anything. Just bring me my mum.\u2019 I broke down. We all broke down. That was the moment we realised we couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d Ten months on, and Help Refugees, as they\u2019re now called, has 26 projects going on across Europe. It has raised \u00a32m and another \u00a31m worth of goods and services, with close to zero overheads. At times it has been feeding 20,000 people a day. It has recruited the support of well-known figures including Benedict Cumberbatch, Lena Dunham, Elizabeth Gilbert, Jude Law, Tom Stoppard and Juliet Stevenson. It has built 1,500 solid structure shelters at the camp in Calais, going where other major charities fear to tread, and in the process saving countless lives.    We worked around my kitchen table. I\u2019d take the children to school then work with the team    How these three women \u2013 with no real charitable experience \u2013 turned themselves within a few months into one of the most effective humanitarian response organisations anywhere on the continent is a story not only of exceptional dedication and determination but also of a new kind of rapid mobilisation based on social media and grassroots action. As good as their word to Clegg, they returned to Calais on 15 September to open a warehouse. The speed of these amateurs put many professional charities to shame. For various reasons, political and structural, the major NGOs were not set up to react to a migration crisis in Europe. As the camp outside Calais, nicknamed the \u201cJungle\u201d, was not legally recognised, it presented bureaucratic problems for longstanding agencies. But the women had their own problems. How do you run an empty warehouse? Lawrence found herself in a DIY superstore on the outskirts of Calais, looking for shelving materials for storage. A stranger asked what she was doing. She told him, and he said he\u2019d pay for the shelves, which came to \u00a3900. He\u2019d raised \u00a35,000 in Ireland, and didn\u2019t know what to do with the cash. The women are full of anecdotes like this, featuring moments of crisis when ordinary people proved to be extraordinary. They needed someone to stay in Calais for a week to look after the warehouse. Their friend, Philli Boyle, offered to do it. She ended up staying nine months. Another friend, Nico Stevens, who was just 24, moved out to France to deal with volunteers and arrange shelter allocation. What the women quickly recognised was that the volunteers needed to be supported, empowered and organised. Back in London, they were putting in 18-hour days around their jobs. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an office,\u201d says Lawrence. \u201cWe worked around my kitchen table. I\u2019d take the children to school then work with the team, leave them working, then get the kids, and then they\u2019d eat with my kids. The kids understood, and my husband has been incredibly supportive.\u201d They were, Lawrence says, \u201cthe accidental charity\u201d. She says she\u2019ll always put her children first, but has effectively given up working on her business. By January, Naughton realised she had to give up her job, too. \u201cIt was a huge decision, but I was obsessed with doing this.\u201d She acknowledges that, being single and living alone, she finds it hard to know when to stop work. \u201cI struggle with that. Basically, I don\u2019t see my friends or family any more. This is completely my calling. There will have to be a time when balance comes back. I hesitate to say this, because the situation is so awful, but I\u2019m more fulfilled now than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d     Help Refugees volunteers sorting donated tents at the warehouse in Calais. Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Observer    All the women have at times felt overwhelmed by the workload and responsibility but have drawn encouragement from each other and inspiration from the volunteers, and the refugees themselves. Bird not only works as a DJ and writes for the Huffington Post, she is also writing a book on weird science. \u201cThe way to deal with it is to work seven days a week, sometimes up until 3am. There have been moments when we\u2019ve all felt like walking away but we\u2019ve pulled each other through it. Working with your best friends makes it easier. I couldn\u2019t have done it without them, and the support of my partner.\u201d She lives with Noel Fielding, the comedian best known for The Mighty Boosh. He jokes that since she started Help Refugees, she\u2019s taken to dressing like Bob Geldof. But, like the other two, she\u2019s keen to crush the idea that she\u2019s a saint. She speaks for them all: \u201cEvery time I feel exhausted I remember how hard the incredible teams on the ground work, how much they\u2019ve sacrificed to be there, and I remember the refugees themselves, how they\u2019ve lost everything, how resilient and strong they are, how my life is a bed of roses compared to theirs, and that being able to work is actually a privilege.\u201d    Dignity also counts. People are deserving of our help but also our respect. That\u2019s at our core    In Calais, on the forecourt of two large warehouses, 24-year-old Hettie Colquhoun is giving the morning briefing to 50 volunteers, nearly all in their 20s. First the group does limbering up exercises, then they hear the day\u2019s plans \u2013 and the news that many migrants have been arriving in recent days. People are selected to do particular tasks, and Colquhoun finishes with an inspirational speech, telling the crowd that they represent the best of the human spirit. She\u2019s not wrong. From a distance, it all looks a bit Glastonbury, a colourful scene of festival chic, but there\u2019s no empty posing about Colquhoun or the people she\u2019s addressing. They\u2019re motivated, hardworking and fiercely conscientious. On an earlier visit, the playwright Tom Stoppard was so impressed by Colquhoun, he said she should become prime minister. Another young woman \u2013 Help Refugees cannot be accused of being male-dominated \u2013 22-year old Melissa Colak reminds the group that it\u2019s the start of Ramadan, and extra sensitivity should be displayed: they shouldn\u2019t eat publicly or play music, and Colak also tells them the most appropriate greeting to use. Bird tells me that Help Refugees has two abiding principles. \u201cAlways find out from the volunteers on the ground and the refugees themselves. Don\u2019t think you know best. And the second thing is that although providing the essentials of humanitarian aid is so important, dignity also really counts, and that can be overlooked. People are deserving of our help but also our respect. That\u2019s at our core.\u201d Colak and 25-year-old Cecile Burton show me around the warehouses. They are stacked with tents, backpacks, shoes and mountains of clothes. There\u2019s a shortage of men\u2019s shoes, says Burton, because donors tend to think only of women and children and assume that men can fend for themselves. \u201cBut they still need shoes,\u201d she says. Most of the volunteers come and go under their own steam, but some stick around, and there is a core, of which Burton and Colquhoun are part, whose accommodation and living expenses are paid by Help Refugees. Seventy per cent of the donations come from Britain. After a while, Help Refugees realised that Amazon wish lists were not ideal. There was difficulty getting the supplies palletised and over to France, so Bird tasked her sister with finding an alternative. \u201cShe finally found this guy called Paul, who\u2019s been absolutely amazing,\u201d says Bird. \u201cHe runs this small campsite equipment company called Leisure Fayre and they put us on the home page of their website. It says Buy a Gift for a Refugee. It has all the goods we need.\u201d Each week Leisure Fayre fills up a big van of goods that the public has donated through its website and sends it all, free of charge, over to Calais.     Volunteers prepare meals for 2,000 in the Help Refugees kitchen. Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Observer    As we walk into the kitchens, at the front of the warehouse, where hot meals for 2,000 are produced, the Rolling Stones\u2019 Gimme Shelter is playing. Never has a song title seemed more appropriate. But for all its sprawling collections of goods and hectic activity, the warehouse is a refuge of calm, a place where like-minded souls can get on with some of the essential logistics of humanitarian aid. The real action, of course, takes place in the Jungle. There have been several camps around Calais since the French government closed down the Sangatte migrant reception facility in 2002. The authorities have raided and dismantled them over the years, only for another to spring up almost immediately. The current main encampment lies on charmless wasteland to the east of the town, just beyond the perimeter road. You enter beneath a graffiti-covered flyover with a Banksy artwork depicting Steve Jobs, the son of a Syrian migrant, carrying an Apple computer and a bin bag of possessions. Around it, someone has sprayed \u201cLondon Calling\u201d and next to that \u201cNobody deserves to live this way\u201d. Standing guard are several police kitted out in Robocop-style riot gear.    Tuesday is shoes day, Wednesday is jackets, Fridays trousers    There\u2019s a clearing with a football pitch, a row of jerry-built shops, makeshift mosques, a couple of churches, a school, washing facilities, portable toilets, and 1,500 tightly packed wooden shelters, all built by volunteers working under the Help Refugees umbrella, where 5,188 refugees and migrants from Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere live while they attempt to reach the UK. That precise figure comes from the meticulous censuses that Help Refugees conduct each month to track the camp\u2019s makeup and population, and to counter the French authorities\u2019 tendency to underestimate numbers. There is also within the camp a fenced-off area of large white residential containers run by the French, to which Help Refugees has no access. Movement is restricted within this area and there is a strict curfew, but in many respects it\u2019s a safer and cleaner environment than the surrounding shanty town. Each day Help Refugees, which provides welcome packs of sleeping bags and other essentials to new arrivals, distributes specific goods to three sites on the camp. Tuesday is shoes day, Wednesday is jackets, Fridays trousers. But now, after a recent fire, they\u2019re trying to work out how to replace the shelters that were destroyed. A 23-year-old graduate in French and philosophy with the wonderful name Liv Long is overseeing the rebuilding. I suggest that her degree subjects, while not necessarily the ideal preparation for working out how to house refugees, must have come in handy in Calais. \u201cWell,\u201d she says, surveying the scorched land where the shelters were destroyed, \u201cI haven\u2019t had much use for the French.\u201d The French authorities won\u2019t allow any more building so it can be difficult to get the constructions into the camp. For the moment, Help Refugees have deployed tents, which are not ideal, especially when it rains. And here you reach the central paradox of the camp. No one wants it to exist, not Help Refugees, not the British or French authorities, not even the people that live there. They would like to see it disappear \u2013 but for different reasons. It\u2019s the human suffering that concerns the women behind Help Refugees. And to alleviate it neither Bird nor Naughton have been shy in using their connections. When Liz Clegg announced that she needed a double-decker bus for a women and children\u2019s centre, the actor Juliet Stevenson, brought to the camp by Help Refugees, made sure that one arrived within 12 days. Clegg and her daughter, Inca Sorrell, look out for the Jungle\u2019s 420 unaccompanied children. One of Clegg\u2019s initiatives that Help Refugees financed was to give every child a mobile phone with credit. Just how vital that step proved to be was witnessed by Naughton when she accompanied Clegg and Sorrell in March to the Women in the World Conference in New York. Naughton recalls: \u201cInca got a text message from Ahmed, who was seven years old.\u201d The message read: \u201cI ned halp darivar no stap car no oksijan in the car no signal iam in the cantenar. Iam no jokan valla.\u201d Sorrell instantly worked out that this meant: \u201cI need help. The driver won\u2019t stop the car. No oxygen in the car. No signal. I\u2019m in a container. I am not joking. I swear to God.\u201d She called the Afghan boy and spoke to him, while Naughton contacted the Help Refugees office in London. They called the police, who traced the phone to a motorway service station in Leicestershire. In a sealed lorry, they found Ahmed and 14 adults hidden in the airless container. That\u2019s 15 lives saved by Help Refugees money, and there have been plenty more. Last October the Moira refugee camp in Lesbos was overrun by new arrivals, with some 5,000 people under the care of half a dozen volunteers. The situation was dire, with disease breaking out, so Help Refugees put out a message for doctors and medics, offering to pay for flights and accommodation if they could commit to more than a week. They managed to fund 30 doctors, one of whom, Dr Linda, called Naughton and, shocked by the conditions she found, told her that she had a month before children started dying. \u201cThat day Josie rang me,\u201d says Bird, \u201cand told me what Dr Linda had said. She was crying a lot. We thought, it\u2019s not right that we\u2019re the ones dealing with this. We didn\u2019t know what to do, so I wrote an article for the Huffington Post and they put it on the front page in the UK and the US. The title was \u201cThe Children\u2019s Feet Are Rotting You Guys Have One Month and Then All These People Will Be Dead.\u201d The response was immediate. \u201cWe got \u00a380,000 in one week,\u201d says Bird. It also opened the way to an ongoing relationship between Lawrence and an American woman called Amy Olrick, who is part of a group called the Compassion Collective, which features writers like Elizabeth Gilbert of Eat Pray Love fame and Cheryl Strayed, who wrote Wild. During a 48-hour fundraising drive, which involved Lena Dunham and Reese Witherspoon, they raised $1m for Help Refugees. The money has been put to active use, feeding and clothing refugees across the islands of Chios, Samos, Kos, Lesbos and on the Greek mainland too. At one point they were serving 20,000 meals a day in all the camps they worked in. They\u2019re supplying mosquito repellant and baby milk to mothers in the Greek camps, which are run by the Greek military, and they have employed an organisation called the Green Helmets to build floors for the military tents, which are on gravel and open to snakes and scorpions. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be doing that,\u201d says Naughton. \u201cA larger organisation should be doing it. If they came along and said we want to floor all the tents in the camps, that would be brilliant.\u201d We eat lunch in an Afghan restaurant in the Jungle and make our way back to Britain. Our trip home is effortless, but for the people we leave behind it is an impossible journey that they dream every night of making. On the train the women tell me more about their plans, while constantly reminding me that they are simply facilitators, and it\u2019s the volunteers on the ground who really make the difference \u2013 and the refugees who really matter. That\u2019s true, of course, but the fact remains that they have stepped into a massive void where few governments or established NGOs are prepared to go. They\u2019ve fed the hungry and housed the homeless, and there are people living now thanks to them who would otherwise be dead.     Jack Steadman, taking a camp census, jokes with (left to right) Dani Lawrence, Lliana Bird and Josie Naughton. Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Observer    They knew very little about charity, fundraising or organising humanitarian aid when they started, but they never let that stop them. Instead of waiting for someone else better qualified and more experienced to do the job, they got on with it. And when doors were closed, they just pushed harder. I ask them as the train pulls into St Pancras, London, what they would say if Oxfam came along and said they\u2019d take over the operation. \u201cGreat,\u201d says Lawrence. \u201cWe\u2019d say \u2018fantastic!\u2019\u201d says Naughton. Bird looks more pensive. She says that she\u2019s heard from that charity that they would indeed like to partner with Help Refugees. \u201cBut I don\u2019t agree that we\u2019d let them take over everything. Not being a charity that\u2019s been around for 75 years, not having the name that they have \u2013 it comes with great knowledge but they have a lot to lose, so they have to do things a certain way. If we can work together with them, and they can help us with their knowledge and support network, that would be best.\u201d Whatever agreements the European Union reaches with Turkey, and whatever unfolds in Syria, Libya and beyond, the refugee and migration crisis is not going away anytime soon. That\u2019s something we all have to think about. The good news is that the inspiring women from Help Refugees look like they\u2019re going to be sticking around for a while too. Moved to action: other grassroots responses Migrant Offshore Aid Station (Moas)Appalled by the lack of response to the hundreds of refugees who drowned at sea near the Italian island of Lampedusa in 2013, American millionaire entrepreneur Christopher Catrambone and his Italian wife, Regina, founded the Malta-based Moas in 2014 after converting a 40-foot Canadian fishing boat into the Mediterranean\u2019s first private search-and-rescue vessel. The couple have ploughed millions of their own money \u2013 made through providing insurance in conflict zones \u2013 into the charity, which has in its first two years rescued nearly 12,000 people at sea. Project Amal ou SalamTranslated as \u2018Project Hope and Peace\u2019, this organisation aims to instil in Syria\u2019s schoolchildren the same happiness and hope that its founder, Syrian-born Canadian Nousha Kabawat, felt growing up in peacetime Syria. Through workshops, summer camps and a permanent school in Jordan, since 2013 the project has affected the lives of more than 5,000 children in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. Lighthouse ReliefFounded in Lesbos in 2015 by a small group of multinational volunteers concerned by the lack of aid on offer to the increasing number of refugees arriving on the island, the organisation now operates in camps across Greece and is registered in Sweden.

They are corralled up the Via Dolorosa, via the trinket shops, and into the church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Orthodox monks have regular punch-ups over who gets to sweep the floor. Well-fed Americans gather around their floppy Bibles by the trickle of the Jordan river. The braver ones are even shepherded over the separation barrier into Palestine and make their way to Bethlehem, mostly ignoring the local Arab Christians. They generally go in groups, with fannypacks and rightwing tour guides and sweaty overdressed clergy. This is the religious Disneyland of much Christianity in Israel.   Related: Protests in Israel staged by asylum seekers from Africa    But hidden away there is another Christianity here. Levanda Street is in downtown Tel Aviv, by the bus station. This is the immigrant part of town, known disparagingly by some as South Sudan. Of course, you could say that all of Tel Aviv is the immigrant part of town. It was founded for precisely that purpose. But these immigrants are not Jews from Europe but Muslims and Christians from Africa who have sought safety by making the perilous journey through the Sinai, escaping genocide in Darfur and persecution in Eritrea. Many disappear in the dangerous and hostile desert. Their experience is that of a modern-day Exodus, tracing a similar route to the one that Jews themselves travelled when they sought the safety of the promised land. Yet despite this, many Israelis do not feel any sense of solidarity with them. \u201cA cancer in our body\u201d was how Likud politician Miri Regev described them. And over half of Israel agreed with her. The churches of Levanda Street are about as different as you could imagine from the magnificent 4th-century piles of stone that Constantine commissioned in Jerusalem and Bethlehem. They are hidden in anonymous-looking office blocks \u2013 down an unmarked alley, in a nondescript entrance, up four flights of dark dirty stairs, tentatively through a metal door. Once inside, the weight of sound smashes you in the face. Three main singers, all women, two men as back-up, a guitar, drums and synthesiser. All they do is play and sing. That\u2019s the whole service. The room is sweltering hot and full of white plastic garden chairs. Fans rotate in the ceiling. Bored kids play on their phones. Their parents sing hallelujah and clap their hands. No one here has any money. One man, who looks to me like the pastor, stands in the corner and sways with his eyes closed. Some speak in tongues, others in French. This room is full of Christians from Ivory Coast. Next door, another church is setting up for the Eritreans. The startup energy is overwhelming.     African asylum seekers in a park in Tel Aviv, February 2014. Photograph: Oliver Weiken/EPA    Israel is one of the few places in the Middle East that guarantee freedom of religion. Yes, there was the desecration of Christian sites by the Israeli army in 1949 but Israel\u2019s first foreign minister, Moshe Sharaett, described this as a \u201cdisgraceful page full of filth\u201d in its history. And in the past few years extremist settlers have been vandalising and burning churches \u2013 but they have been arrested and charged. So it\u2019s not the state\u2019s attitude to the Levanda Street Christians as Christians per se that\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s the state\u2019s attitude towards them as non-Jewish asylum seekers. At the bus station, I meet up with Mutasim Ali, who runs an advice centre for African refugees. He tells me that as legitimate refugees the state cannot deport them. Instead, the government is \u201cmaking conditions so hopeless that asylum seekers feel they have no choice but to leave\u201d. Officially classed as \u201cinfiltrators\u201d, they are subject to daily racism and harassment, being taken to the miserable Holot detention centre in the Negev, for no other reason, he says, than to \u201cbreak your spirit\u201d and \u201cstop you integrating into Israeli society\u201d. Some are offered cash sums of up to $3,500 to get on a flight to Rwanda or Uganda and basically bugger off. All of which is massively disappointing from the government of a country that inspired the first international agreement protecting the rights of refugees. For it was the international failure to come to the aid of European Jews during the Holocaust that led to the UN human rights convention in 1951. Given this, Israel should have a softer heart for those who are now escaping genocide in Africa. @giles_fraser", "publicationDate": "2016-06-16T16:27:16Z", "title": "You\u2019d think that Israel, of all places, would respect its refugees | Giles Fraser", "sentences": ["Levanda Street is in downtown Tel Aviv, by the bus station.", "Of course, you could say that all of Tel Aviv is the immigrant part of town.", "African asylum seekers in a park in Tel Aviv, February 2014."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2016/jun/16/youd-think-that-israel-of-all-places-would-respect-its-refugees"}, {"tags": ["Charlotte Gainsbourg", "Edgar Degas", "Nina Simone", "Budapest holidays", "Art", "Documentary", "Documentary", "Fiction", "Art and design", "Film", "Television", "Books", "Culture"], "article": "The daughter of the English actor and singer Jane Birkin and the French musician Serge Gainsbourg, Charlotte Gainsbourg was born in London in 1971 and raised in Paris.

Photograph: Andrew Toth/Getty Images    I loved this exhibition. It was Degas\u2019s monotypes \u2013 a very interesting process of printing \u2013 mostly of women, prostitutes, who were willing to pose for him. But it could become very abstract, with the repetition; he was interested not in the drawing as a result but in the accumulation in his work of the same subject. It was very modern for his time. Then you have the other part \u2013 it\u2019s very hard when you know that someone was such a horrible person in real life, and such an antisemite. It\u2019s hard to avoid thinking about it and focus on the art. It\u2019s the same with so many other people, like C\u00e9line.

I knew all her songs, I just didn\u2019t know her life. I didn\u2019t know the background, the upbringing, and the fact she was a concert pianist. And that she went into singing really out of the blue, because a guy said: \u201cIf you want to continue in this piano-bar you\u2019ll have to sing.\u201d And so she forced herself. The documentary is very well made and you can just get into this very strange persona. She was not only likable, there was something so strong about her, and so desperate that you can hear it. Now I have a different perspective when I listen to her.      3 | Fiction  Les Choses by Georges Perec  I\u2019ve just finished a book by Perec [Things: A Story of the Sixties].

He was very original. This one is a tiny book; it could nearly be an essay. But it does live with me so that means something. It was written in the 1960s and it\u2019s about a young couple who struggle through life not understanding what their desires are. It\u2019s talking about a different time, but I think the perspective on the book nowadays is interesting: with our society of owning stuff, it does have a real resonance. 4 | Place  The Rudas Turkish baths, Budapest      The Rudas baths, Budapest: \u2018The light is from another time.\u2019 Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo    I stayed in Budapest for a month for work and I had this obsession with Turkish baths. This place is very old fashioned. Four days in the week it\u2019s only for men, and you have one day when women can go \u2013 you can see all these different shapes and bodies and it\u2019s so beautiful. You go from tepid water to warm to boiling hot, then you have the hamam where you can\u2019t even move, it\u2019s so hot. And then you go into glacial, icy temperatures. For me it was thrilling \u2013 to go through those extremes just blows your mind. It\u2019s a nice place to think and even go through my lines.

I\u2019m very into cookbooks, and this was my big discovery of the month. From the book I\u2019ve done a fish stew with couscous, fried onion rice, and poached pears with cardamom pods.

Outside the London pubs were buzzing at the end of a summer day. But there was music in Arabic, chatter in Hebrew and fond farewells from students from the front lines of the world\u2019s most intractable conflict.  In the 12 years since the launch of the Olive Tree scholarship programme 58 Palestinians and Israelis have graduated from City University \u2013 their degree studies supplemented by dialogue, interaction and debate. On top of the routine challenges of student life they have had to deal with terrible distractions: two days earlier Palestinian gunmen had shot dead four Israelis in the heart of Tel Aviv and the entire occupied West Bank was sealed off.   Other low points were three wars over Gaza (the last one, in 2014, killed 2,100 Palestinians, many of them civilians, and 66 Israeli soldiers) and another between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Yet throughout them the students attended classes together, shared apartments and reached out across the Middle Eastern divide in a unique environment that \u2013 most agree - enabled them to better understand the conflict that has shaped their lives. Back home most would probably never have met. \u201cThe programme provided us with a special space that neither Israeli nor Palestinian could experience in the region,\u201d was the conclusion of Stav Shaffir, who graduated from City in sociology and journalism 2009 and is now a celebrated social activist and the youngest member of the Knesset in Jerusalem.  Ahmed, born to Palestinian refugee parents in Libya and raised in Nablus, studied engineering in the first cohort, and, like several other former students, has been able to stay on in London. He is certain he benefitted from being able to talk to the enemy. \u201cEveryone was able to listen to each other,\u201d he says. \u201cI gained a tremendous amount of knowledge, though I still don\u2019t know how to resolve the conflict.\u201d He remains good friends with Gilad, who runs a Tel Aviv radio station. \u201cThe Olive Tree changed my life,\u201d the Israeli says, joking that the worst problem with Ahmed and a second Palestinian flatmate was that they were both heavy smokers and wouldn\u2019t do the washing up. \u201cWe were all radicalised - in a good way: that means relying on politics in a way that can make an impact.\u201d  Many argue that the real value of the experience was prolonged exposure to the other side - not the fleeting, inevitably charged encounters of brief dialogues run by well-meaning intermediaries. There is little talk of solutions: \u201cIt\u2019s not about peace, too simple, too sure/ It\u2019s about journey and depth and the will to endure\u201d - goes a poem penned in the programme\u2019s honour.  Haneen, graduating with a politics degree this summer, is a Palestinian citizen of Israel who speaks fluent Hebrew. So for this 22 year-old the chief novelty was meeting not Jews but fellow Palestinians from Gaza, shut off from their compatriots by a decade long-blockade that has helped keep Hamas in power. \u201cIf all Israelis were like my classmates things would be easier,\u201d she reflects. \u201cBut what\u2019s happening back home is so deadly it\u2019s not going to be solved any time soon.\u201d  On the Palestinian side, where there is often fierce opposition to any kind of \u201cnormalisation\u201d with Israel or Israelis, most prefer not to give their full names. Adel, from southern Gaza, has not even told his family he is on the programme. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t understand. Maybe I will tell them \u2013 after the next war. Now I just feel more sorry for both peoples.\u201d  Niztan, the Israeli who compered the farewell event, felt she had more in common with Palestinians \u2013 food and slang - than the Brits she encountered, she said during an earlier discussion. Bahaa, from Bethlehem, now a presenter with an Arabic TV channel in London, agreed. \u201cIt gave me chance to talk to the other, the enemy. We have more things in common than disliking English weather.\u201d  The party was doubly poignant because the entire programme, not just another academic year, is now ending due to rising costs and increased calls on philanthropic giving. Work will continue on a research project on conflict resolution in general.  And it brought thoughtful reflections as well as expressions of gratitude to the conveners, Rosemary Hollis, a professor of politics, and Damian Gorman, a writer from Northern Ireland who applied some of the province\u2019s lessons to the even harsher conditions of the holy land. Hollis talked about how hard it is to explain exactly what the programme has achieved. But she had a simple summary: \u201cIf you can get enemies to learn from each other \u2013 not to agree- that can be valuable.\u201d Gilad\u2019s personal moment of truth came during the Israeli army\u2019s Operation Cast Lead in Gaza in 2009, when he refused to report for reserve duty with his army unit, mobilised to put an end to Hamas rocket fire. \u201cHow could I take part in this butchery when the relatives of the people I know and call my friends are there on the other side?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the lasting effect of Olive Tree: it was a humanising project, one that continues to counter the ongoing dehumanisation of the other side that has proved so effective in recent years.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-06-20T12:09:07Z", "title": "Understanding, but no peace for Palestinian and Israeli students in UK", "sentences": ["On top of the routine challenges of student life they have had to deal with terrible distractions: two days earlier Palestinian gunmen had shot dead four Israelis in the heart of Tel Aviv and the entire occupied West Bank was sealed off.", "\u201cI gained a tremendous amount of knowledge, though I still don\u2019t know how to resolve the conflict.\u201d He remains good friends with Gilad, who runs a Tel Aviv radio station."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2016/jun/20/understanding-but-no-peace-for-palestinian-and-israeli-students-in-uk"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Ehud Barak", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "On 4 July 1976, the day the US celebrated its 200th birthday, an Israeli expat took a phone call that would change his life. A student in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he went by the name Ben Nitay, an Americanised shortening of the original, the better to fit into the land where he hoped to forge a business career and build a life. On the phone was his younger brother, calling with grave news. It concerned their older brother Yonatan, or Yoni. As children, they had idolised him; he was the one who led their games, who, they felt, had raised them. Then 30 years old, ruggedly handsome and newly installed as the head of Israel\u2019s elite Sayeret Matkal commando unit, Yoni had, in the early hours of that day, led a raid to rescue more than 100 Israeli hostages held at Entebbe, Uganda. Word had just come that the operation had been an astonishing success and the hostages were free. But the leader on the ground \u2013 Yoni \u2013 had been killed in action. Their brother was dead. And so, while the people around him watched marching bands and held street parties to mark America\u2019s bicentennial, and while the world marvelled at the sheer audacity of a military raid that defied all odds, Ben Nitay \u2013 born Binyamin Netanyahu \u2013 made the seven-hour drive to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where his father was teaching. The 26-year-old was determined to break the news to his parents himself.     Yoni Netanyahu. Photograph: Wikipedia    \u201cI walked up the path leading to their house which had a big window in the front,\u201d he recalls 40 years later, sitting in the office of the Israeli prime minister which has been his, on and off, for 10 of the last 20 years. \u201cI could see my father pacing back and forth. And all of a sudden he turned his head and saw me. He had a look of surprise, but he immediately understood and let out a sharp cry. And then I walked in.\u201d Netanyahu pauses as he relives the moment. \u201cThis was even harder than Yoni\u2019s death: telling my father and mother.\u201d The family flew in virtual silence from the US to Israel for the funeral of the son and brother who had already been garlanded as a military hero and was now about to enter the national mythology. The Netanyahu name would take its place in the Israeli pantheon and, in the process, open up a path that would take young Binyamin to the top of Israeli politics \u2013 a path that began in Entebbe.    He opened the cockpit door to find a hijacker armed with a\u00a0revolver and a hand grenade    The career of Netanyahu is the most visible legacy of that July day four decades ago, but the impact of Entebbe would be felt in countless other ways, too. With its extraordinary cast of characters \u2013 including a trio of future Israeli prime ministers as well as the gargantuan, volatile Ugandan dictator Idi Amin \u2013 Entebbe would alter the calculus in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, changing the way Israel saw itself and was seen by others. It would come to seem a high watermark in global attitudes to the country, perhaps the last time Israel was viewed with admiration rather than suspicion or hostility. Entebbe would become a byword for military daring, the subject of three blockbuster movies, taught and studied by armies around the world \u2013 including by the architects of the raid that captured and killed Osama bin Laden. A raid that lasted a total of 99 minutes would live on for decades. *** It began on Sunday 27 June with a routine Air France flight from Tel Aviv to Paris, carrying 247 passengers and 12 crew. The plane made a planned stop in Athens, but within a few minutes of takeoff from Greece, trouble struck. \u201cWe heard shouting coming from the cabin,\u201d the plane\u2019s captain, Michel Bacos, now 92, recalls. He sent his chief engineer to find out what was going on. \u201cHe opened the cockpit door and found himself face to face with Wilfried B\u00f6se, armed with a revolver and a hand grenade.\u201d     Hijacker Wilfried B\u00f6se. Photograph: AP    B\u00f6se and his female comrade were part of a German faction known as Revolutionary Cells, or RZ, one of several urban guerrilla groups active in the era of the Baader-Meinhof gang. They had teamed up with two members of a breakaway faction of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Together, the four had boarded flight 139 at Athens, where security was notoriously lax. B\u00f6se shoved his way into the cockpit, threw out the co-pilot and, grabbing the microphone, announced that the plane would now be called Haifa 1, taking its name from the city in the north of the country the passengers called Israel and the hijackers called Palestine. Their demand was the release of 53 prisoners held in five different countries. Even before they heard the announcement, in a heavy German accent, some of the passengers knew something was up. At the back of the plane, Sara Davidson \u2013 a nervous flyer anyway \u2013 had anxiously clocked the air stewardess emerging from the first class cabin, her face a ghostly white. This was meant to be the holiday of a lifetime, a trip to America to celebrate the bar mitzvah of her 13-year-old son Benny. But now Sara turned to her husband, a navigator with the Israeli air force, and told him she feared they\u2019d been hijacked. It wasn\u2019t such an outlandish thought. At that time, hijackings were frequent, a staple of nightly news bulletins. In 1972, there was one hijacking a month. For Palestinians, they had been a favoured tactic since the late 1960s, initially targeting jets of the Israeli national airline, El Al. Besides the ritual demands for the release of prisoners, hijackings were seen as a swift and powerful way to win publicity for what was then the emerging cause of Palestinian independence. Still, Sara\u2019s husband laughed off her suggestion: \u201cYou and your frightening ideas. Everything is OK.\u201d A minute later it was clear who was right. Following B\u00f6se\u2019s orders, Bacos flew the plane to Benghazi, Libya. \u201cHe warned me not to break the landing gear: we\u2019d need to be able to take off again.\u201d The Libyan stop was brief, just long enough for a British-born woman, Patricia Martel, to pretend she was having a miscarriage and get herself released from the plane. She had emigrated to Israel a few years earlier and was newly married; her mother had just died and she was en route to Manchester to visit her father. Not only was the miscarriage a fake, Martel wasn\u2019t even pregnant. But she was a nurse \u2013 and a good actor. Bacos was ordered to take off again. He asked B\u00f6se where: \u201cHe says, \u2018It\u2019s none of your business.\u2019\u201d The plane flew for hours, long enough for Benny to lie on the floor and sleep. \u201cSo many hours we flew and flew, and we didn\u2019t know where to,\u201d Sara Davidson told me. The passengers tried to guess. Was their destination Siberia? China?    One general began turning an enormous globe slowly before asking a colleague, 'Are you sure you know where Entebbe is?'    Eventually the plane touched down. Davidson and the others were allowed to open the window shutters and there on the tarmac stood the instantly recognisable, internationally notorious figure of Idi Amin, in camouflage battle fatigues. Only then did they realise that they were in Uganda. They were escorted off the plane and into the old terminal building of Entebbe airport. They were no longer passengers. Now they were hostages. *** Back in Israel, military planners were trying to assemble what they knew \u2013 which was not much. At his desk in military intelligence sat the officer in charge of planning for missions of this kind, the former elite commando, and future prime minister, Ehud Barak. He had direct experience of rescue operations but this situation was infinitely more complex, chiefly because of the location. The military brass gathered in a Tel Aviv conference room, adorned by an enormous globe. One general began turning it slowly before asking a colleague, \u201cAre you really sure you know where Entebbe is?\u201d As Barak told me recently in his office in Tel Aviv, \u201cWe were in total blindness.\u201d They worked through the night, assembling fragments of information. In the preceding years, Israel had forged alliances with several African states, Uganda among them. Amin himself had received military training from the Israelis; fighting for space among the medals on his enormous chest were the wings of the Israeli air force.     Idi Amin talks to hostages. Photograph: AP    The officers who had trained Amin came in to be debriefed. They offered the nugget that he coveted the Nobel peace prize. Someone attempted to pass the message to Kampala that if Amin brokered a peaceful resolution of the crisis, the Nobel might be his. Meanwhile, an engineer at an Israeli company that had tendered to build the new terminal at Entebbe airport came forward: he happened to have, stashed in his desk drawer, the plans of the old building in which the passengers were now held hostage. Barak and his team soon spread out the blueprints, studying the target. Originally, they imagined their sole adversary would be the four hijackers (information on whom had been helpfully provided by Martel, the woman who had faked a miscarriage). But it was now clear Entebbe had not been chosen by accident: Amin and his regime were colluding with the hijackers. Israel\u2019s plans adjusted accordingly. Barak\u2019s team flirted with the idea of parachuting Israeli Navy SEALs into Lake Victoria: they could make the subsequent journey on rubber dinghies. \u201cWe even thought about taking a speedboat from neighbouring Kenya,\u201d Barak told me, but Mossad, Israel\u2019s intelligence agency, warned that the Kenyans, while prepared to cooperate tacitly, would not agree to \u201csuch explicit participation\u201d. Round and round they went. Barak was clear that if they could not come up with good military options, then the Israeli government \u2013 despite its professed policy of \u201cno talking to terrorists\u201d \u2013 would be forced to negotiate for the hostages\u2019 release. For the Davidsons and the others, every minute felt like a week, every day like a lifetime. Herded together and frightened, speaking only in whispers, they were watched over at gunpoint. And then, on the fifth day, came the separation. The hijackers, in a plan agreed with Amin, divided Israelis from non-Israelis, gathering the former in the transit hall, the latter elsewhere. The non-Israeli group were soon released and flown to Paris. But included in the group kept behind were some Jews who were not Israeli. \u201cThere were two couples, religious Jews, and they had no Israeli passports,\u201d Davidson recalls. \u201cThey were crying and shouting that they are not Israelis \u2013 it didn\u2019t help them. The [hijackers] just pushed them to the other room, which we called the Israeli room.\u201d Some remembered this process differently, but to Sara and others, it seemed as if the hijackers were dividing people not by citizenship, but by ethnicity. The fact that these orders were issued in German accents stirred a painful memory. \u201cSelection,\u201d Sara Davidson says now, using the word deployed by the Nazis at the death camps, as they divided those who would live from those who would die. Among the hostages were Holocaust survivors, people with \u201cnumbers on their hands\u201d, as Davidson puts it. And here they were, being selected by a German woman and a German man. \u201cIt was very frightening.\u201d   Related: The Arab-Israeli conflict    Now it was just 94 hostages and a dozen crew. Bacos and his team were offered freedom, but refused it: they felt it was their duty to stay with their passengers. Time slowed to a crawl. The adults tried to distract the children with bottle tops and cigarette cartons turned into toys; they\u2019d also work shifts, cleaning up or stretching out the food to make it last, and assembling a library of the books they had imagined reading on the flight. They slept \u201can hour or two, lights on all night, a lot of mosquitoes and flies,\u201d Davidson says. \u201cThe smell was terrible. No clothes to change into. No water.\u201d As for Benny, \u201cI was living on an hour-by-hour basis, finding friends, trying to read, to play, to sleep. You get used to being a hostage. As a 13-year-old, you simply adjust.\u201d His greatest horror were the daily visits of Amin and his entourage, when the dictator would address the hostages. Sometimes posing as their protector, sometimes as a mediator, he would deliver long monologues, never allowing the hostages to speak. His sheer size was terrifying to the children. Benny would cower at the back, looking at Amin\u2019s son and wife and aides. \u201cThey\u2019re all in the shade when you\u2019re standing close to Idi Amin: he\u2019s simply gigantic.\u201d *** Back in Tel Aviv, a plan was forming. The Israelis heard that Amin was due to spend the weekend on a diplomatic trip out of Uganda. That provided an opening. If Israel could somehow fly four huge Hercules transporters the 2,500 miles to Uganda, one of those could land and disgorge a motorcade of vehicles dressed up to look as if they were the dictator and his party returning from Mauritius. The call went out for a rare Mercedes limousine, like Amin\u2019s. They found one \u2013 but it was the wrong colour. Hurriedly, the Israelis sprayed it black.     Soldiers in a black Mercedes used in the raid. Photograph: Courtesy of Ministry of Defence Photo Archive/IDF    By Saturday night, the team was assembled, led by Yoni Netanyahu. They went through the plan again and again, preparing for every contingency. The four Hercules would be accompanied by two Boeing 707 jets, one to serve as a command post, the other as a field hospital \u2013 to treat what they anticipated would be many injured. On Saturday afternoon a force of more than 200 Israeli soldiers took off, bound for Entebbe. To avoid radar, they flew extraordinarily low \u2013 at one point no more than 35ft off the ground. It was extremely bumpy, inducing intense vomiting in those on board. The flight took eight hours. In the dead of night, Entebbe came into view. The designated runway was unlit; the planes would have to land in the dark. The first aircraft landed and out came the Mercedes. It headed straight for the terminal building. All was going to plan. It seemed the troops would retain their most precious advantage: the element of surprise. But then a Ugandan soldier appeared, raising his rifle. Netanyahu\u2019s deputy, Muki Betzer, who had previously lived in Uganda for four months, was untroubled: he thought the guard would wave them through. But Netanyahu made an instant decision. He and another commando fired at the soldier with their silenced pistols and the man fell. But then he sat back up, prompting another Israeli to shoot \u2013 this time with an unsilenced weapon. Another Ugandan returned fire with a Kalashnikov. \u201cAnd that\u2019s it, disaster,\u201d Betzer says now, his memory of that night as sharp 40 years on, he insists, as if it were yesterday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been found out. The element of surprise has been lost.\u201d There was a firefight, Israelis and Ugandans shooting at each other. Netanyahu and Betzer ordered the Mercedes to stop \u2013 not in the place they had planned \u2013 and they jumped out and ran to the terminal building. The commando teams, who had been carefully assigned to different entrance points, were now \u201cmixed up\u201d. And all Betzer could think of was a botched rescue effort two years earlier, in the Israeli town of Ma\u2019alot \u2013 where Palestinian hostage-takers ended up killing 25 of their captives, including 22 children. But somehow they made it in time: the hijackers had not had the chance to open fire on the hostages. As the commandos burst into the terminal building, one hijacker was killed instantly. Betzer saw two more as he entered: \u201cWe shot them and killed them.\u201d Meanwhile a fellow soldier on a megaphone shouted in Hebrew and English: \u201cLie down, don\u2019t get up. The army is here, the army is here.\u201d *** Sara Davidson remembers it very differently. Saturday night had been particularly fearful. Sunday was the deadline, a word that, with its blunt first syllable, terrified Benny. If no prisoners had been released by then, the hijackers would start killing the hostages. Several people had been taken ill and the night was hot. Some of their captors were outside, sitting on chairs and sofas. Her husband was trying to read, her sons trying to sleep. Suddenly they heard gunfire. \u201cWe were sure this is the deadline and this is the end of us.\u201d Her husband sent them to hide in the bathrooms. He took one son to one toilet, she took Benny to the other and curled herself around him. \u201cI was just hoping they will kill me and that maybe I can save him. And during these terrible noises, smells and shouting and shooting, I heard him saying [the ancient Jewish prayer] Shema Yisrael. And listen, we are not religious people, and he didn\u2019t remember the prayer, he invented his own words: \u2018I want to be alive, I don\u2019t want to be killed.\u2019\u201d And then she lifted her head a little and there, standing in the doorway, was an Israeli soldier, dressed in camouflage. He was talking to her in Hebrew. \u201cAnd he said, in a very calm voice, \u2018Listen guys, we\u2019ve come to take you home.\u2019\u201d     \u2018I was hoping they would kill me and maybe I could save him\u2019: hostages Sara Davidson and her son Benny. Photograph: Michal Rubin for the Guardian    Once they were sure the shooting was over, leaving all the hijackers and at least 20 Ugandan soldiers dead, the Israelis shepherded the hostages into the waiting Hercules planes. They took off, bound for Nairobi. On board were 102 hostages and crew; four were either dead or missing. Among them was the commander, Yonatan Netanyahu. Once the rescue had been completed, Betzer had got on the radio to report that their mission had been successful. He heard nothing but static. Eventually a radio operator came across to say: \u201cYoni\u2019s down, Yoni\u2019s down.\u201d He had been shot within minutes of the first Hercules landing. A medic tried to treat him close to the terminal building, eventually handing him over to the commander of the medical unit, Dr Ephraim Sneh \u2013 another future Israeli cabinet minister. Around 25 minutes after the planes had first touched down, Netanyahu died in Sneh\u2019s arms. Now, at the front of the plane, a stretcher carried his body. When Ehud Barak, who had been handling the Kenyan end of the operation, climbed aboard the Hercules in Nairobi, he was struck by the mood on board. The hostages were \u201cebullient\u201d: this was just one hour after their liberation. But, he told me, \u201cThe fighters were far from happy. They were very tired, more than anything else. And sad.\u201d He approached Netanyahu\u2019s body. \u201cHis face was white. He was a handsome young man. I put my hand on his forehead: it was still warm. It was just an hour after he had died. It was kind of a serene face, not expressing any kind of suffering.\u201d Soon the phone would ring in the home of the young man then called Ben Nitay. *** Shortly after the hostages were home, what had been Operation Thunderbolt was renamed Operation Yonatan, in his memory. The family helped organise conferences in his honour and set up a Jonathan Institute, with branches in Israel and the US. The British journalist Max Hastings was commissioned to write a biography, Yoni, with the family\u2019s cooperation. The slain hero of Entebbe was becoming a national icon.     The hostages return to Tel Aviv. Photograph: Courtesy of Ministry of Defence Photo Archive/IDF    Binyamin would speak at these conferences and run the institute in the US, setting out his view of how the west should defeat terrorism, focusing on states he believed enabled terror \u2013 as Uganda had enabled the hijackers of flight 139. He began to drift away from the planned career in business and marketing, and into politics and diplomacy. With his US-accented English and telegenic looks, he fast caught the notice of Israel\u2019s ruling circles and in 1982 was made No 2 in Israel\u2019s Washington embassy. Within 14 years, he was prime minister. Netanyahu himself readily admits it all began at Entebbe. \u201cTotally,\u201d he told me in Jerusalem. \u201cIt changed my life and steered it to its present course.\u201d Some say he has taken advantage of his experience. When I spoke to the Haaretz columnist and historian Tom Segev, he said, \u201cHe is exploiting the history of his family, he is exploiting the story of his brother, he is exploiting a very shocking experience he had.\u201d But even Segev is at pains to stress that there is nothing artificial about the prime minister\u2019s pain: the two brothers were close, Binyamin\u2019s grief genuine. Others, including some who were there, believe Yoni\u2019s role in the rescue has been exaggerated, with his fateful decision in that short journey to the old terminal \u2013 opening fire when he did \u2013 conveniently overlooked. There has been a war of the memoirs, with Betzer\u2019s version in one corner, a book by the youngest Netanyahu brother, Iddo, in the other. When Hastings probed this controversy, he recalls now, he was warned off, including by Barak. \u201cHe said, \u201c\u2018You are dealing here with the heritage of the state of Israel, with one of our national heroes. At your peril do you walk on his grave.\u2019\u201d     Binyamin Netanyahu at his brother\u2019s grave. Photograph: Ahikam Seri/AP    The presence in the prime minister\u2019s office of Yoni Netanyahu\u2019s brother is only the most current and tangible legacy of Entebbe. In 1976, Israeli self-confidence was low. The country had been rocked by the surprise attack of the Yom Kippur war in 1973, which had felt like a brush with collective catastrophe. It had also watched, powerless, as 11 of its athletes had been held hostage, then killed at the Olympic games in Munich in 1972. Entebbe felt like an antidote, if not a redemption. Inevitably, it had a direct impact on the Palestinians. Several factions had already moved away from hijacking, but after Entebbe that tactic was never tried again. Earlier this year, I met Leila Khaled in Amman, Jordan, who gained global notoriety for hijacking both a TWA flight to Tel Aviv in 1969 and an El Al plane to New York a year later. She told me what mattered was never the means but the ends: to present the Palestinian cause to the world. \u201cWe were obliged to do it. It\u2019s not because we liked to, but because we didn\u2019t have the capacity to impose ourselves on the world. We have no land: it\u2019s occupied. We have no state: we are refugees\u2026 We had to ring the bell in a different way.\u201d But Entebbe changed the tactical calculus. From then on, Palestinians had to reckon on the possibility that Israel might travel halfway across the world to free its people, if that\u2019s what it took. Hijackings were abandoned, then, a few years later, the Palestine Liberation Organisation renounced \u201cthe armed struggle\u201d. Entebbe had helped establish the notion that Israel\u2019s reach was simply too long for it to be defeated militarily.    When it came to audacious missions, with stealth flights and the element of surprise, Entebbe seemed the best precedent    In Uganda, Amin\u2019s humiliation would lead to his overthrow less than three years later. Further afield, the raid would be taught at military colleges, including Sandhurst, as the model special forces operation. In 1980, when 52 US embassy staff in Tehran were held hostage, Jimmy Carter asked to see Shimon Peres \u2013 who had been defence minister during Entebbe (and was played by Burt Lancaster in one of the three movies) to ask his advice. Carter was planning an Entebbe-style rescue mission of his own. Peres told me: \u201c[Carter] said, \u2018If you were me, what would be your opinion?\u2019 I said, \u2018Fly. You don\u2019t have a choice.\u2019 Well, it was a catastrophe, as you know.\u201d The botched raid on Iran was a humiliation for the US president, aborted amid mechanical failures and a midair collision before America\u2019s aircraft got anywhere near the US hostages. Eight US servicemen lost their lives; Carter\u2019s standing never recovered. But that very failure fed the myth of Entebbe: it suggested that Israel had managed a feat that was beyond the capacity of even the mighty US. As late as 2011, when the US military planned its operation to capture and kill Osama bin Laden, the man in charge was Admiral William McRaven, author of a detailed study of the raid on Entebbe. When it came to audacious missions \u2013 involving stealth flights over vast distances, maintaining the element of surprise till the last moment \u2013 Entebbe still seemed the best precedent. There is perhaps a more subtle legacy, too. A year after Entebbe, Israel took the diplomatic path, engaging in direct negotiations \u2013 which led to an eventual peace treaty \u2013 with Egypt. Even so, the outrageous success of Operation Thunderbolt planted a thought among some on the Israeli right that proved hard to shift: the belief that there were few problems to which there was not a military solution, that the unglamorous business of compromise could be avoided, so long as the men in uniform were sufficiently creative, courageous or crazy to think of an alternative. Few Israeli politicians would admit they might be prone to an Entebbe syndrome, but that is often how it looks. It also helps account for the most noticeable change since July 1976. The admiration triggered by Entebbe soon gave way to worldwide opposition to Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon, to the wars that have come regularly since and, of course, to the entrenchment of the Israeli occupation. In the four decades that have passed, Entebbe and the feelings it stirred have come to feel very far away. But not for the people involved and those they left behind. Not for Israel\u2019s prime minister, who recalls the loss of his brother as \u201clike somebody amputated your arms and legs and you\u2019re never going to be whole again\u201d. Not for Benny Davidson, who says of Entebbe, \u201cI left as a child of 13, and I came back as a mature young man.\u201d And not for his mother Sara, now 81 years old, who still has tears in her eyes as she remembers the moment she and her child were saved and who says, 40 years on: \u201cThe whole thing is still inside me.\u201d \u2022 One Day In Entebbe, presented by Jonathan Freedland, is on BBC Radio 4 at 8pm on 28 June and 5pm on 3 July.", "publicationDate": "2016-06-25T10:00:11Z", "title": "'We thought this would be the end of us': the raid on Entebbe, 40 years on", "sentences": ["*** It began on Sunday 27 June with a routine Air France flight from Tel Aviv to Paris, carrying 247 passengers and 12 crew.", "The military brass gathered in a Tel Aviv conference room, adorned by an enormous globe.", "One general began turning it slowly before asking a colleague, \u201cAre you really sure you know where Entebbe is?\u201d As Barak told me recently in his office in Tel Aviv, \u201cWe were in total blindness.\u201d They worked through the night, assembling fragments of information.", "\u201cThey\u2019re all in the shade when you\u2019re standing close to Idi Amin: he\u2019s simply gigantic.\u201d *** Back in Tel Aviv, a plan was forming.", "The hostages return to Tel Aviv.", "Earlier this year, I met Leila Khaled in Amman, Jordan, who gained global notoriety for hijacking both a TWA flight to Tel Aviv in 1969 and an El Al plane to New York a year later."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/25/entebbe-raid-40-years-on-israel-palestine-binyamin-netanyahu-jonathan-freedland"}, {"tags": ["Technology startups", "Restaurants", "Internet", "Business", "Technology", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Deliveroo"], "article": "Last weekend, with a certain amount of trepidation, I made a booking with a website called EatAbout, whose tagline invites you to \u201cenjoy private meals in the home of a chef\u201d. Conceived last October by two young Swedes living in London, the website launched in January with the intention of \u201cdemocratising eating out\u201d and making \u201cgood food accessible to everyone\u201d by cutting out many of the costs associated with running a restaurant. Despite a deep and abiding love of the traditional restaurant-going experience, I was curious enough about the concept to give it a try. First, I scan a map of London for hosts \u2013 EatAbout currently has 30 chefs in its network, all within the M25 \u2013 and settle upon Carine O, whose food incorporates influences from France and her native Cameroon. Then, out of five options, I pick a three-course menu called \u201cFish BBQ My Way\u201d, priced at \u00a377 for two. Once I\u2019ve chosen a time and submitted my card details, Carine gets in touch to ask whether we\u2019d prefer mackerel or sea bass and then offers some friendly advice on wine (EatAbout invites guests to bring their own). The next day, bottle in hand and with the meal already paid for, we arrive at Carine\u2019s home in south London ready for some barbecued fish.    Upbeat West African music is playing as we enter and the enticing aroma of barbecue wafts in from the back garden    This idea of turning up at a complete stranger\u2019s house and paying them to cook you dinner isn\u2019t a complete novelty. Supper clubs have been around since the 1930s and the concept has blossomed in the UK over the past decade, aided by the rise of social media. At their best, supper clubs create an intimate and casual alternative to restaurants while avoiding many of the common pitfalls associated with eating out, such as queuing, table-turning and bills spiralling out of control under the influence of (heavily marked-up) alcohol. As supper clubs became a global phenomenon, entrepreneurs in the tech world began to exploit their popularity by creating platforms that connected hosts with customers, aiming to do for dining what Airbnb has done for accommodation. While some, such as GrubWithUs and Kitchen.ly, have come and gone, others have taken off in a big way \u2013 EatWith, founded in Tel Aviv in 2010, now advertises hosts in 150 cities worldwide. A newcomer on the scene, EatAbout offers a small but significant twist on the formula. \u201cIf you book with other websites you end up eating with strangers,\u201d says the site\u2019s 25-year-old co-founder Felix Br\u00e5berg. \u201cOn EatAbout, we only do private events. If you think about the last time you went to a restaurant, you probably didn\u2019t go with complete strangers, you probably had some sort of connection with the people you were sitting with. That\u2019s how we\u2019re different from supper clubs and that\u2019s where we think the future lies.\u201d To encourage diners to book in larger groups, Br\u00e5berg and his co-founder, Philip K\u00e4llberg, have introduced a variable pricing scheme: \u201cthe more people you are, the cheaper the price per person\u201d. This makes financial sense for the host, who will always prefer a full house, and for EatAbout, which takes a 10% cut of the total payment. It also alleviates the potential awkwardness of being served by a stranger in their own home. Luckily for us (my wife and I are paying an extra \u00a32.75 each for the privilege of dining \u00e0 deux, compared with a group of six), Carine immediately puts us at our ease. Upbeat West African music is playing on the stereo as we enter and the enticing aroma of barbecue wafts in from the back garden. Our host pours us glasses of our own wine (EatAbout doesn\u2019t charge corkage) and for the first time since making the booking, I feel my scepticism about this whole set-up starting to seep away.     Carine O barbecuing mackerel in her garden. Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Observer    Given their capacity for taking experiences like this and scaling them up, it\u2019s no surprise that websites such as EatAbout have been attracting wary glances from the restaurant business. In recent years, tech companies have been merrily disrupting the worlds of music, publishing, retail, hotels and taxis, to name just a few, by creating cheaper, more efficient and easier-to-use alternatives that can have a devastating effect on the existing industry. So far, restaurants have escaped relatively unscathed; in fact, turnover in the UK sector went up by 39% between 2010 and 2015, proving that restaurants are robust in the face of recession as well as digital encroachment. But this has only made tech entrepreneurs more eager to get in on the action. It may be too early to compare social dining platforms such as EatAbout with genuine disrupters such as Airbnb and Uber. \u201cUnlike hotels, which have a captive market, in that everyone visiting a city needs a place to stay, restaurants exist for the neighbourhood they inhabit, for their people,\u201d says the chef Jackson Boxer, who runs the restaurant at Brunswick House in Vauxhall, south London. \u201cI think there are lots of fabulous things about the supper club model, but these sites are filling a niche. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re a threat.\u201d    In restaurants, it\u2019s all about logistics. There\u2019s not much space for creativity and after six months you get bored  Carine O     Not everyone in the industry shares his confidence. In Paris, the restaurateurs\u2019 union Synhorcat has appealed to the French government to crack down on \u201cunderground restaurants\u201d, arguing that bistros and brasseries operating on very thin margins risk being put out of business. \u201cIn the space of three years Airbnb has tripled its presence in Paris, to the point that there are now 50,000 flats advertised on its website,\u201d Synhorcat\u2019s president, Didier Chenet, told the BBC last October. \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t do something to stop the underground restaurants, it will be the same disaster.\u201d Competition is coming from other angles, too, enabled by smartphone ubiquity and the rise of apps. With its promise to bring you restaurant-quality food at home, Deliveroo is growing 25% month on month and is now available in more than 70 countries worldwide. Along with other tech-powered delivery companies such as Supper and UberEATS, which recently launched in the US and in London, Deliveroo is encouraging people to buy in rather than venture out, though it still relies on restaurants to prepare the food in the first place. One smart innovation is the model being developed by another London-based site called DishNextDoor. Instead of sourcing meals from restaurants or takeaways, it links you up with talented cooks in your neighbourhood who do everything from their home kitchens. You browse the website for tempting dishes nearby, arrange a collection time (it could be as little as 20 minutes after the order is placed) and pick up a freshly cooked meal from your neighbour\u2019s door. The site was created by three colleagues at a consultancy in Soho. \u201cWe were working long days and never had time to cook, so we were resorting to eating bad food,\u201d says co-founder Bob Conwell. \u201cThe penny-drop moment was seeing Joel [Ng, another co-founder] with a delicious Malaysian curry that his mum, Nancy, had made. We figured, there are probably a lot of Nancys out there who are great in the kitchen and have a little extra time on their hands.\u201d A fourth founder joined from Net-A-Porter in May 2015, they launched the site in January and are now expanding outwards from north-east London. To be accepted on to the platform, prospective cooks need to receive food hygiene training, have their kitchen approved by the council and, finally, convince Conwell and his team that their cooking is up to scratch. Out of nearly 100 cooks on Dish Next Door\u2019s network, I choose Dorothee, who lives a mile away and cooks me a very tasty tarragon chicken with garlic rice and salad for \u00a38 a portion. She used to run a well-regarded bistro called Bouchon Fourchette in Hackney but sold it last October after becoming pregnant. Now, with a baby to care for, she enjoys the flexibility of DishNextDoor. \u201cYou can cook whatever and whenever you want,\u201d she says when we meet on her doorstep. \u201cAnd it\u2019s nice to know you\u2019re cooking for your neighbours.\u201d     UberEATS, which has just launched in London. Photograph: Ubereats    Dorothee spends around four evenings a week making meals for DishNextDoor, which takes a 20% cut. \u201cOn average, I\u2019ll cook four portions and sell three out of four. If I don\u2019t sell out, we eat the leftovers tomorrow.\u201d It\u2019s unlikely to make her a fortune, but one of the main rewards for Dorothee is job satisfaction. \u201cI just really love cooking for people,\u201d she says. One challenge for DishNextDoor, and any ambitious food delivery company, is wowing diners within the constraints imposed by transportation. The kind of intricate, sculptural dishes you find in Michelin-starred restaurants would make no sense if they have to be delivered, nor would a perfectly cooked steak, however sophisticated the packaging. It\u2019s simple, hearty dishes such as Dorothee\u2019s chicken and rice or the delicious Keralan pork curry I order from a DishNextDoor cook named Justin a few days later that work best when shuttled from one place to another in a white cardboard box.   Related: Former London supper club enters world's best restaurant list    These limitations don\u2019t apply at restaurants or private dining clubs. At Carine\u2019s house, we begin with barbecued flat peaches served with charred cabbage, slivers of radish and a wild blackberry vinaigrette \u2013 a brilliant dish. The main course comes on rectangles of slate almost as wide as the table: whole mackerel with deep-fried plantain, grilled corn, homemade hot sauce and fingers of watermelon to cool the chilli burn. For pudding, we get mango and lime sorbet with a coconut ball and a bracing shot of ginger juice on the side. Carine has no experience in professional kitchens \u2013 she picked up her skills from family members and joined EatAbout after being made redundant from her IT job last year \u2013 and she has very little desire to open a restaurant. \u201cI don\u2019t really fancy it,\u201d she says. \u201cIn restaurants, it\u2019s all about logistics. There\u2019s not much space for creativity and after six months you get bored.\u201d Instead, she is developing an online platform called Inspiring Chefs, which will offer cookery lessons as well as meals and she has plans to market her fiery hot sauce. Meanwhile, she\u2019s happy catering to groups at home whenever she feels like it \u2013 she hosts via EatAbout \u201cat least twice a month\u201d. Br\u00e5berg agrees with Carine\u2019s assessment of working in restaurants and estimates than nearly half of the hosts on his network are trained chefs who no longer work in professional kitchens. He is also critical of the customer experience. \u201cWhen you go to a restaurant, a large percentage of what you pay goes towards rent, waiting staff, facilities and so forth. With EatAbout, you\u2019re going straight to the chef and getting a really good meal for a cheaper price. Also you pay in advance and it\u2019s BYOB, so you don\u2019t get any nasty surprises with the bill.\u201d Whereas Bob Conwell of DishNextDoor believes that restaurants can happily co-exist with this new breed of online dining services, Br\u00e5berg is adamant that his company represents serious competition. \u201cWe want to be an alternative to a restaurant,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to take a piece of their market share. So consumers will think, \u2018Either I\u2019ll go to a restaurant or I\u2019ll book an EatAbout experience\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s the same thought process as booking Airbnb.\u201d     Carine\u2019s mackerel with green sauce served with watermelon and deep-fried plantains. Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Observer    Over at Brunswick House, Boxer acknowledges that online dining services have some advantages over restaurants, including greater creative freedom and lower costs, but he strongly contests the idea that they pose a direct threat. \u201cRestaurants have a very different role to fulfil: they\u2019re open to everyone, they create a shared space. The best ones have that wonderful quality of being able to create a sort of personal intimacy within a crowd, so that even in a bustling room of people you still feel very special and alone with the people at your table. I think great restaurants achieve that in a way that can\u2019t be replicated within people\u2019s homes.\u201d Despite initial misgivings about booking on EatAbout, I leave Carine\u2019s house feeling enriched by the experience. It\u2019s not always fun to have a chef hovering nearby while you sample their creations, but in this case we\u2019re happy to see how unfamiliar dishes are prepared and hear the story behind Carine\u2019s cooking. I certainly wouldn\u2019t rule out using EatAbout again. If I wanted to celebrate a birthday, for example, I\u2019d much rather be hosted by someone like Carine, with the bill already settled, than book a private dining room. But will I eat out in restaurants any less as a result? I doubt it. Despite their many downsides, I\u2019m too addicted to the buzz of restaurants and sometimes I\u2019d much rather sit among strangers in a public space than know everybody in the room. Whether online dining services will have an impact upon the restaurant sector as they evolve is a different question, however. Not everyone shares my sentimental attachment to restaurant going and as any hotelier or taxi driver will readily tell you it never pays to underestimate the disruptive power of the internet.

The victim, Hallel Yaffa Ariel was a US citizen, according to the Department of State. She died shortly after sustaining wounds to her upper torso.  According to early reports, Israeli civilian security officers arrived at her house in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, next to the Palestinian city of Hebron, shortly after the attack and broke down the door.  One officer was stabbed and seriously injured before another shot the perpetrator dead. Palestinian officials named the assailant as Mohammed Tarayreh, 17, from the nearby village of Bani Na\u2019im.     The Israeli military released a photograph showing Hallel Yaffa Ariel\u2019s blood-stained bedroom. Photograph: @IDFSpokesperson/Twitter    Malachi Levinger, chair of Kiryat Arba\u2019s council, told Army Radio that the perpetrator had climbed over the settlement\u2019s security fence. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, called on both the Palestinian leadership and all \u201cenlightened nations\u201d to condemn the killing.  \u201cThe horrifying murder of a young girl in her bed underscores the bloodlust and inhumanity of the incitement-driven terrorists that we are facing,\u201d he said. Netanyahu agreed at an emergency meeting with his defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, to close off Bani Na\u2019im to all but humanitarian and medical traffic. It was thought likely that the assailant\u2019s family home would be destroyed, a tactic that remains controversial in Israel.  The victim was a cousin of the far-right Israeli minister Uri Ariel, who said Israel would make every effort to build up settlements in the West Bank.  Adnan Tarayreh, a cousin of the assailant, suggested that Tarayreh \u2013 who had dropped out of school and was working in a bakery \u2013 may have been influenced by a recent incident in which another relative had been shot dead in a car that had rammed into Israelis in Kiryat Arba. Later on Thursday, a Palestinian man stabbed two Israelis in the coastal city of Netanya, wounding one seriously, before he was shot dead.  Police said the perpetrator was from Tulkarem, a Palestinian town about 12 miles from Netanya, on the other side of the \u201cgreen line\u201d separating the West Bank from Israel.  The victims of the attack, which took place close to the city\u2019s open air market, were said to be an ultra-orthodox man in his 40s and a woman in her 30s.

The spate of violent incidents appeared to have abated in recent weeks, though Palestinian gunmen killed four Israelis this month in Tel Aviv\u2019s busy Sarona market. In Jerusalem, tensions have risen at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount site holy to Jews and Muslims, with Palestinians throwing rocks, one of which lightly injured a 73-year-old Israeli woman. The violence started after police broke with the practice of recent years by allowing in non-Muslim visitors including tourists during Ramadan, after a relatively calm first 10 days of the holy month. Police have reimposed the visitor ban until Ramadan ends next week.  In separate incidents in the West Bank, five people were killed and at least 16 injured in two overnight intra-Palestinian shootings. Palestinian police said that in one of the incidents a gunman attacked the home of a police officer in the city of Nablus.

After an Israeli band played on the shore of Lake Victoria, the prime minister stood in silence with the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, as a relative of one of the hostages lit a memorial flame.  Three hostages, 45 Ugandan soldiers and all the hijackers were killed during the rescue. Among the dead were Yonatan, or Yoni as he was known, who had been newly installed as the head of Israel\u2019s elite Sayeret Matkal commando unit and planned and took part in the raid. The Ugandan dictator Idi Amin had warmly welcomed the hijack of Air France Flight 139 from Tel Aviv by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and two Germans.    Related: 'We thought this would be the end of us': the raid on Entebbe, 40 years on    While many of the hostages were freed by the hijackers, Israelis and non-Israeli Jews were taken off the aircraft and held under armed guard in an old terminal building, later stormed by Israeli special forces.  On the first day of an African tour, Netanyahu said the rescue on 3 July 1976 had \u201cchanged the course\u201d of his life and that \u201cinternational terrorism suffered a stinging defeat\u201d. He said: \u201cThis is a deeply moving day for me. Forty years ago, they landed in the dead of night in a country led by a brutal dictator who gave refuge to terrorists. Today, we landed in broad daylight in a friendly country led by a president who fights terrorists.\u201d The raid was a humiliation for Amin, who was deposed three years later with the help of Tanzanian and Ugandan exile forces, one of which was led by Museveni. Netanyahu, who will also visit Kenya, Rwanda and Ethiopia, is hoping to establish a new partnership with the region, building on a common goal of defeating jihadi terrorism. He hopes to achieve closer commercial ties, including the sale of Israeli weapons and security expertise, and will be seeking a more supportive role by African nations, most of whom have consistently backed Palestinian bids for statehood in the UN general assembly. The run-up to the trip has not been entirely free of controversy. While many Ugandans do not, in hindsight, see the Entebbe raid as a disaster because of their hatred of Amin, Moses Ali, Uganda\u2019s deputy prime minister, who served under Amin, suggested that its people should be \u201cmourning their dead ones\u201d rather than merely celebrating an \u201cIsraeli victory\u201d.   Related: Obama hails Elie Wiesel as 'conscience of the world' amid leaders' tributes    In Israel, the anniversary has revived longstanding disputes over whether sufficient credit for the raid was given to others beside Yonatan Netanyahu. And while his role is acknowledged as heroic, some, including his second in command Muky Betser, have suggested that his unit did not need to shoot at two Ugandan soldiers, thus unwittingly starting a firefight.  Some critics of Netanyahu urged him not to exploit the raid. An editorial in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Monday said that, despite the expected success of the diplomatic and economic contacts, \u201cit\u2019s hard to shake off the impression that the entire trip would not be taking place were it not for Netanyahu\u2019s desire \u2026 to conduct a ceremony in the old Entebbe airport.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-07-04T17:36:25Z", "title": "Binyamin Netanyahu visits scene of brother's 1976 Entebbe airport death", "sentences": ["The Ugandan dictator Idi Amin had warmly welcomed the hijack of Air France Flight 139 from Tel Aviv by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and two Germans."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/04/binyamin-netanyahu-israel-entebbe-airport-uganda"}, {"tags": ["Cities", "Indigenous peoples", "World news", "Canada", "Arctic", "Americas"], "article": "As her car winds along one of Iqaluit\u2019s few roads, Alethea Arnaquq-Baril points to one of the few buildings that dot the treeless tundra. It\u2019s a weathered, wooden house on the shores of Frobisher Bay. Its white peeling paint facade is punctuated with a red door and the words \u201cHudson\u2019s Bay Company\u201d.  It was at this former trading point, Arnaquq-Baril says, that an incident occurred that helps explain how so many Inuit \u2013 the northern indigenous people who make up the bulk of Canada\u2019s Arctic population \u2013 went from their nomadic lifestyles to settling in this unlikely city, in one of the planet\u2019s harshest climates. A friend\u2019s grandfather had stopped in at the trading post, leaving his dogs and sled outside with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). As he haggled inside, gunshots rang out. He ran outside to find his dogs dead. \u201cHe tried to tell the RCMP that his family was across the bay and now he had no way of getting to them,\u201d she says. The man\u2019s story is common: many Inuit say they were trapped in permanent settlements after their dogs, their only means of transport, were killed by police. The RCMP claims some dogs were lawfully destroyed over concerns about public health and safety; many Inuit say it was to urbanise them.  And yet minutes later, we come to a very different example of how Inuit coexist with southerners. A modest grey building, raised on stilts like most others in the city, but with a tall minaret topped with a white crescent moon \u2013 all that identifies it as one of the world\u2019s northernmost mosques, built to serve Iqaluit\u2019s 100-strong Muslim community. Last year, Muslim leaders presented Inuit elders with a freshly slaughtered lamb. \u201cThey wanted to show that in their culture, too, sharing food is really important,\u201d says Arnaquq-Baril. But they were quick to stress the difference between the lamb and Inuit staples, such as seal meat, caribou and arctic char. \u201cThey told them, \u2018Do not eat this raw. You have to cook this meat,\u2019\u201d she laughs.     Iqaluit\u2019s population is now only about 50% Inuit, and English has replaced Inuktitut as the city\u2019s de facto language. Photograph: Stephan Savoia/AP    This is life in Canada\u2019s youngest and fastest-growing capital city: a diverse mix of cultures, piled atop an Inuit civilisation that stretches back millennia. Nearly two decades after Iqaluit stepped into the limelight as the capital of Nunavut, Canada\u2019s newest territory, its residents \u2013 many of whom were forcibly pushed into an urban lifestyle that sharply contrasted with their own traditions and cultures \u2013 continue to grapple with a key question: how do you carve out a modern city that pays tribute to ancient traditions?  \u201cThere\u2019s an extreme amount of intergenerational trauma that the next generation has inherited through their ancestors,\u201d says Malaya Qaunirq Chapman, a 27-year-old tour guide in Iqaluit. \u201cNow it\u2019s the decision of, \u2018Do I live out the traditions of my ancestors, or do I live out the modern lifestyle that we are forced to conform to?\u2019 And how do you meet in the middle, and how do you make the two work together? How do you belong?\u201d    Nunavut was not created so that southern Canadians could find high-paying jobs  Anubha Momin     Hints of this tension are strewn about town, from the intricate Inuit sculptures that sit among the city\u2019s crop of space-age fibreglass buildings \u2013 built without windows at the height of the 1970s oil crisis to save on heating costs \u2013 to the igloo-shaped Anglican cathedral. Iqaluit shot to national prominence in 1995 after it was chosen by referendum to become the capital of Nunavut. The territory, finally formed in 1999, gave Inuit in the region self-rule and control over their institutions. It made Iqaluit the political, cultural and economic hub of a bold Canadian endeavour in indigenous self-government. Amid some of the highest unemployment, suicide and poverty rates in the country, Inuit leaders envisioned Iqaluit as a place from which \u201cmade in Nunavut\u201d strategies could counter decades of top-down, western European approaches. Some 17 years later, says the mayor, Madeleine Redfern, it\u2019s still a work in progress. \u201cI think sometimes we get a little bit stuck. We keep doing things the way that they\u2019ve been done in the south. We could have Nunavut be as culturally distinct as Quebec is to the rest of English Canada, but from an Inuit perspective. It\u2019s all up to us.\u201d She points to an initial promise by the territorial government to have Inuktitut, the principal language spoken by Inuit in the territory, as the working language of government by 2020 \u2013 a radical reversal of the Canadian government\u2019s persecution of the language and its dialects decades earlier. \u201cThat clearly is not going to happen,\u201d she says. Since it became a capital, Iqaluit\u2019s population has soared from some 3,000 people \u2013 most of them Inuit \u2013 to around 8,000, about 50% of them Inuit. While Inuktitut is spoken by three-quarters of Inuit, English has become the de facto language of Iqaluit. Redfern says knowledge of Inuktitut is eroding quickly: \u201cIt\u2019s happening from one generation to the next.\u201d      In the Iqaluit region the summer sun sets around midnight, only to rise a few hours later, and temperatures rise to a balmy 10C. Photograph: Ashifa Kassam for the Guardian    Overshadowing all this is the immense task of running a city at the whims of the Arctic. During winter, temperatures in Iqaluit regularly drop below -50C with windchill, while darkness reigns for months. On this year\u2019s summer solstice, the sun set around midnight only to rise a few hours later, and temperatures rose to a balmy 10C \u2013 prompting all but tourists (and myself) to wander around in T-shirts. To make matters more difficult, Iqaluit is the only capital city in Canada with no road or reliable ship connections to other parts of the country. For much of the year, all supplies must be flown in, sending the cost of living skyrocketing. In Iqaluit, two litres of milk can cost around C$6.50. A one-litre bottle of Coca-Cola goes for $10.   Related: Arctic Ramadan: fasting in land of midnight sun comes with a challenge    Three or four times a year, depending on ice conditions in Frobisher Bay, a sealift boats in bulk supplies. In recent years, an estimated 300 cars have arrived in the city every year this way, as well as furniture and building materials for new homes. As little can get into Iqaluit, little can get out. The city\u2019s sprawling open-air dump sits near the causeway, piled with everything from household garbage to plastic pop bottles and discarded construction materials. As Iqaluit marked the longest day of the year, fire crews worked overtime to battle a blaze in the landfill. Some wondered if this was a repeat of the 2014 inferno, an unstable fire raging in a four-storey mountain of rubbish that the locals dubbed \u201cDumpcano\u201d. As a weary authority struggled to keep up with a city whose population has more than doubled, climate change began to set in. Iqaluit is built on permafrost, with most buildings perched on stilts to avoid any heat transfer between the home and frozen ground; many sewage and water pipes are buried in the frozen ground. Warming temperatures are now shifting the active layers of the permafrost, leading to costly breaks in the pipes. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough,\u201d says Redfern, who estimates that $1bn of the community\u2019s assets are now at risk. \u201cWe need everyone to really understand that climate change is more than changing ice conditions and polar bears.\u201d *** A traditional campsite and fishing base used by Inuit for thousands of years \u2013 the word \u201cIqaluit\u201d means place of many fish \u2013 the origins of the first permanent settlement in the area can be traced to an American air base, built in 1941 to provide a stopover and refuelling site for aircraft travelling across the Atlantic during the second world war.     Malaya Qaunirq Chapman and 87-year-old Inuapik Sagiatuk, whose family was ordered by the government to settle in Iqaluit. Photograph: Ashifa Kassam for the Guardian    Iqaluit\u2019s population climbed steadily in the 1950s as construction workers and military personnel were brought to construct a Distant Early Warning line, a network of radar stations that turned Iqaluit into an outpost against potential Soviet intrusions. Some Inuit began to move into the community, hoping to take advantage of the economic opportunities being created by more than 5,000 American personnel. Others were forced to move into the settlement. The Canadian government was convinced that Inuit needed to be formally educated and integrated into the wage economy. \u201cLots of us \u2013 adults and children \u2013 were brought here to populate this area,\u201d says 87-year-old Inuapik Sagiatuk, who was a young girl when her family was ordered by the government to settle in the community. \u201cThere was not one building. There were army tents lined up along the shore.\u201d By 1975, most of the area\u2019s Inuit \u2013 celebrated around the world for their specialised and extensive knowledge that enabled generations to live off the land and thrive in one of the world\u2019s toughest climates \u2013 had been moved into crowded, poorly planned communities and forced to adapt to a western European way of life. It was a jarring change, but the turbulent times were eased somewhat by the rich culture, says Sagiatuk. She now worries about what\u2019s in store for future generations. \u201cI worry they will forget how to be Inuit and lose their traditional language. Since lots of people from around the world have come here in great numbers, the Inuit way of life has changed drastically,\u201d she says through a translator. Her comments hint at the tensions that underlie life in Iqaluit. The capital was conceived to be an exception among Canadian cities. But today a wide chasm exists between the city\u2019s Inuit residents and the thousands who flood into the city from around the world, seemingly reinforcing the very notion of southern dominance that Nunavut was meant to combat.     In 2015, the median age of the Nunavut territory hadn\u2019t yet eclipsed 25. The Arctic is young. Photograph: Leyland Cecco for the Guardian    While Iqaluit-specific figures are hard to come by, 2014 figures for Nunavut put the median income for non-Inuit residents at $86,600 a year, while for Inuit it stood at $19,900. The unemployment rate for Inuit across the territory hovers around 20%. University graduates are in high demand by the various levels of government, despite high school graduation rates of 57%. The resulting overstock of high-paying jobs and ample opportunities attract a large number of transient residents from across Canada. Many of them simply float through life in Iqaluit as though on a permanent vacation, says Anubha Momin, a transplant from Toronto who arrived in Iqaluit four years ago. \u201cThey\u2019re not rooted, they\u2019re not integrated and they don\u2019t want to be.\u201d Catapulted into positions of authority, some southerners scarcely understand the distinctive history of the population they are now serving, says Momin. She cites social media posts that complain of being \u201ctrapped\u201d in Iqaluit or describe trips home as a return to civilisation. \u201cIt\u2019s not right, especially for a place that is so dear to people and that a people fought for,\u201d she says. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t what Nunavut was created for. Nunavut was not created so that southern Canadians could find high-paying jobs.\u201d    Do I live out the traditions of my ancestors, or do I live out the modern lifestyle we are forced to conform to?  Malaya Qaunirq Chapman     Other non-Inuit blend seamlessly into the fabric of the city, their plans for a short-term stay stretching to decades as they embrace the city\u2019s singular culture and learn to echo the Inuit\u2019s deep reverence for the land around them. They\u2019re part of a community that gives Iqaluit its charming, small-town feel, even as it battles social issues on a big-city scale. Home to just 30,000 people, Nunavut sees more than 1,000 suicide attempts each year. A 2011 report averaged the suicide rate across the territory at 63.9 suicides per 100,000 people, making it one of the highest in the world. Rates of domestic violence rank among the highest in the country, while a 2014 report revealed 40% of Inuit adults in Nunavut had experienced severe sexual abuse as children. Filmmaker Arnaquq-Baril points to recent history to explain why a people, known around the world for their resilience, are now faltering. \u201cThere are just so many horrible things that happened within a 20 to 30-year period,\u201d she says.  Starting in the 1950s, the slaughter of hundreds \u2013 if not thousands \u2013 of dogs left many Inuit with few options but to settle into permanent communities. Others were forcibly relocated north by a Canadian government keen to claim sovereignty over the high reaches of the Arctic. Some Inuit were also sent away to residential schools, described by a recent truth commission as a church-run tool of cultural genocide, rife with abuse.     Activists protest the seal hunt at the Canadian embassy in Tel Aviv. Photograph: Ariel Schalit/AP    Much like other aboriginal peoples across North America, Inuit were left reeling, says Arnaquq-Baril. \u201cBut we\u2019re doing it in one of the harshest climates on the planet with the fewest economic options.\u201d The sealskin industry became an anchor during the traumatic upheaval: many Inuit found solace in a return to the culture of their ancestors, and a solution to their hunger and limited incomes. \u201cIt kind of became a stable source of income that allowed us to transition from a semi-nomadic lifestyle into sedentary community lives.\u201d The brief respite was soon shattered, however, by the anti-sealing campaigns of animal rights activists. Sealskin bans were passed in the US and EU; Arnaquq-Baril\u2019s latest and critically acclaimed film Angry Inuk explores the devastating effect these bans have had on the Inuit. A 1983 ban on sealskins, passed by what was then the European Community, led to the collapse of the market. In Nunavut, poverty became the new normal, the already high suicide rates soared and some seven out of 10 Inuit children were left going to school hungry. Inuit men, in particular, were left scarred by the collapse of the industry. \u201cOur men are really struggling \u2026 It was so recent that all of our men were hunters, that it\u2019s part of a young Inuk man\u2019s identity that you\u2019re supposed to be a hunter,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating when the organisations that are putting us in this position live in some of the richest parts of the world, with the richest farmland in the world, and the easiest temperatures to live in \u2013 those are the people running the campaigns that affect us.\u201d Much of what happens today in Iqaluit and Nunavut is now in the hands of animal activists who live a world away, she says, echoing the tumultuous decades when life in Iqaluit was governed by distant dictates, issued by those with little understanding of Inuit culture or the challenges they face.    Related: Welcome to the new Toronto: the most fascinatingly boring city in the world    Glimmers of hope come from the many in Iqaluit who are beginning to fight back, cultivating an Inuit voice that builds on the work of previous generations to seize on the opportunities offered by the territory\u2019s groundbreaking experiment. Some of the solutions conceived are practical, such as the Inuit\u2019s challenge of the EU sealskin ban, the launch of the city\u2019s first Inuktitut-language daycare, or the push for a performing arts centre in Iqaluit to bolster the resurgence of once-persecuted Inuit arts such as throat singing, drum dancing and storytelling.

Columbus, Ohio, to Georgia. Parents. Friends. Colleagues. Grandparents. Short stops in familiar locales after a whirlwind first half of the year. A hello here, a goodbye there, as he attempts to cram in as many close ones before the itinerary takes him back to the Middle East. The 26-year-old Knoxville native has barely had a rest since December 2014, and this is it: flitting between states before pre-season training starts back in Tel Aviv on 5 July. It\u2019s been an intriguing 18 months for a striker who was until recently a seldom-seen figure. Indeed, given his job description, his goals even less so. A bit-part player at Columbus Crew, there was little tangible evidence, on paper at least, for what was to come. In 2015, he made just one start and a number of substitute appearances, contributing a single goal for the Black and Gold. Previous campaigns, too, portrayed a similar level of return. Then there was January. And, of all soccer outposts, Israel. The scene was set. Schoenfeld, fresh from a Florida vacation with teammates and the offer of a contract renewal from Columbus on the table, rolls up in the Holy Land at lowly Maccabi Netanya. The Israeli footballing public is bemused. The goalscoring stats, it seems, don\u2019t lie \u2013 four MLS seasons, 51 appearances, 14 starts, five goals. Who is this impostor? Just 18 minutes into his career in Israel, after emerging off the bench for his first appearance, the eyes of several of Netanya\u2019s rivals start to turn in his direction. But for what? Still there are no goals. Netanya lost. Yet barely given time to blink, before he has even acclimated to a new league and new country, he is purchased by Hapoel Tel Aviv, one of the most successful clubs in the Israeli Premier League. They see something. On the outside, the befuddlement persists. Before heading for Hapoel there were another 90 minutes for Netanya, and still no sign of Schoenfeld on the scoresheet. So goes the superficial eye. He wasn\u2019t to go without a goal for long. The first came in a baptism of fire, his debut, the Tel Aviv derby. From there to the end of the season in May, Schoenfeld went on a minor goalscoring blitz. He managed eight goals in 12 games by the close. \u201cCrazy,\u201d remarks Schoenfeld. \u201cAfter 18 minutes. Unheard of.\u201d His quick transfer from Netanya, he explains, owed to a need for cash at the club in the face of financial difficulties. But there had been a few suitors. In addition to Hapoel, bitter city rivals Maccabi Tel Aviv were also among those interested in getting him to put pen to paper. Eventual league champions Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva inquired. In the end, he went with Hapoel Tel Aviv under the belief he\u2019d have a greater chance of starting every week. From one vantage point, all bizarre perhaps. Schoenfeld, a lanky striker at 6ft 4in, understands the initial wariness among local fans and media. His record did not look great. But, sprightly and direct, he offers an alternative angle with which to view his sudden rise to prominence. \u201cI found form,\u201d he tells the Guardian. \u201cAs a striker, once you have confidence and you feel comfortable somewhere, it\u2019s no pressure. And I think the goal I scored in the derby changed everything. Because obviously there was a lot of questions of me coming in there. I knew the fans didn\u2019t really understand: \u2018How could a player who only scored one goal last year come in, why would we buy him?\u2019 But I think if you knew the situation at Columbus with me, it was because I\u2019m playing behind the best forward in the league [Kei Kamara], who\u2019s a freak of nature. \u201cI think I was ready to play. I feel like I developed a lot last year. I just needed the minutes. If you look at my records, I didn\u2019t really start much. Probably less than 10 starts in the league. Even last year, I had one start for 90 minutes. I had a total of 220 minutes \u2013 total. That was it. And one of those games was for 90. So if you take that out it\u2019s 130 minutes over 17 games, about five minutes of a game left. You run around for five minutes, so I think it was tough. I understand why there would be concerns but I feel like once I get in training and people can see what I offer, it changes things.\u201d The goal in the derby against Maccabi Tel Aviv \u2013 a club Schoenfeld knocked back and for which there is no love lost among the Hapoel faithful \u2013 was a watershed moment. The media took notice. In a press conference after the Tel Aviv derby he was asked if he\u2019d paid much heed to the more negative press coverage that came before, to which he tersely responded with a stoic visage: \u201cWell I can\u2019t read Hebrew so it helps me keep away from that stuff.\u201d In the same post-game press conference, he was then asked if his joining Hapoel might effectively rob Maccabi of the title. Schoenfeld was cute, telling the reporter he was focused on Hapoel\u2019s struggle near the Israeli Premier League basement. The record shall state Maccabi missed out on the title and Hapoel survived. Still, that easy ability to deflect is not unusual in modern sports players schooled in the art of public relations. But there\u2019s a breeziness in Schoenfeld that might speak to the chains in Columbus from which he was freed. He referred to the man who stood in his way at Crew, Kamara, as the best striker in MLS. Few would disagree he had a job on his hands wrestling a starting spot from the prolific Sierra Leonean. At Hapoel, he himself quickly became something of a similar focal point in attack. He credits his athleticism as an asset in a more technically adept local scene to the one he was used to in the US. Such was his form, his name has been mentioned in connection with an Israeli national team call-up. American-born, Schoenfeld comes from a Reform Jewish family. He went to Israel through the state\u2019s right of return law for those of Jewish ancestry. He continues to pass through the citizenship process, currently possessing a temporary passport. To play for Israel, there may be Fifa hurdles to surmount, too, because he didn\u2019t obtain his citizenship through a blood relation. He is in no hurry but welcomes the prospect of turning out for the country. Which raises the question: with the kind of form he showed last season, and were it to continue, what if the US national team set-up came calling? \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d Schoenfeld answers. \u201cObviously if you ask me on the street, what is your nationality? I\u2019d tell you I\u2019m an American. I identify myself as an American. But if it happens and it comes down to it, it\u2019s a very tough decision. Both offer completely different things.\u201d He has a similar posture toward his club level future, perhaps mindful of the vicissitudes of soccer. He is happy at Hapoel. There\u2019s the Columbus experience. He has also absorbed a different side of life. Israeli culture. Tel Aviv city life. On another plain, religious devotion in Jerusalem, an awakening moment for him. On another again, on a road trip for an away game, Israeli border life near Lebanon. Not to mention, Schoenfeld is tired. His agent knows the script. \u201cI\u2019ve left it at last time we spoke about everything. I was, \u2018Look, I want to take time to vacation. I want to clear my head, it\u2019s been a long run.\u2019 Because I haven\u2019t had a break since December of 2014. Because in MLS you had these mini-camps before the season. So by the end of the year, I was mentally fried, my body was fried. When I come back from vacation, we\u2019ll see what\u2019s going on, we\u2019ll start evaluating next season. I plan on staying.

Related: Zero Days review \u2013 a disturbing portrait of malware as the future of war    Zero Days is a thorough look at the Stuxnet worm, a computer virus created by branches of the CIA and Mossad to cripple an Iranian nuclear plant that was (probably) doing more than creating civilian energy resources. There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s fascinating about this story: from how the virus got into the relevant networks, to what it actually did when it got there, to how it was discovered (and whose fault that was) and the fact that no one in the United States or Israel has ever acknowledged its existence. At its debut at the Berlin film festival the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw called Gibney\u2019s latest film \u201cintriguing and disturbing\u201d in his four-star review. Gibney has concluded that the sovereign nations of this pale blue dot had better work hard on some sort of cyber-nonproliferation treaty if we want to make it much further into this new century. \u201cThe danger is that it seems innocent,\u201d Gibney said after a recent screening in New York. \u201cCommand and control machinery were never intended to be integrated with the internet in such a way,\u201d he said, referring to the fact that the Stuxnet worm didn\u2019t just clog up a bunch of email accounts, it caused actual machinery to spin out of control until they were destroyed. Part of his research involved talking to agency moles (whose identity the film weaves into one composite character) and Zero Days explains how the US has another cyberweapon ready to launch at Iran called Nitro Zeus that would essentially knock out all civic infrastructure. That isn\u2019t just cable television, it\u2019s hospitals and transport. \u201c\u2018We\u2019ve got a power plant, let\u2019s hook it up to the internet to make it more convenient, but without thinking about problems 10 or 20 years hence,\u2019\u201d Gibney mused, consider the way all industrialised nations are threatened by the new age of cyberwarfare. Gibney, a classic iconoclast, is eager to show how the US and Israel are mostly to blame for this. \u201cStuxnet was the first cyberweapon to cross the boundary from the cyber realm to physical realm. Iran hadn\u2019t even contemplated the possibility. At first, their engineers thought they had screwed up.\u201d As the film goes on, it shows how Washington and Tel Aviv didn\u2019t exactly see eye to eye, and the Israeli agency\u2019s desire to push for increased destruction was what eventually gave the game away. According to Zero Days, the Bush administration agreed to create Stuxnet as a form of Israeli appeasement. Without some sort of programme, the Netanyahu administration was likely to bomb the nuclear facility at Natanz. \u201cObama inherited the programme and, as with drones, cranked it up,\u201d Gibney said. As most of Gibney\u2019s sources are on the US side, the film doesn\u2019t paint a rosy picture of Israel\u2019s espionage tactics. \u201cAny criticism of Israel gets blowback,\u201d Gibney said, \u201cbut this is an important object lesson in how that alliance can be problematic, especially when sharing military technology.\u201d After all his research, Gibney is concerned about the future. He cited the recent Iran deal as a ray of hope (as does the composited character of American informants) but is cautiously eyeing Russia\u2019s use of cyberweapons in Ukraine and the US\u2019s current engagements with Isis: \u201cThis is the first time the US has admitted to using cyber. They are talking about changing text, so when you send an email instead of saying, \u2018I love you,\u2019 it says, \u2018I hate you and I will kill you.\u2019\u201d It may somewhat harmless at first (especially if it is deployed against Isis) but an attack that could lead to critical physical damage might be considered an act of war. Then there\u2019s also the issue of attribution. \u201cHow long were we arguing if the Sony hack was from North Korea?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe need to get to where we\u2019re at with nuclear or chemical weapons with cyber. There are no agreements on their use.\u201d Zero Days is a cold, two-hour, sky-is-falling case designed to make everyone agree.   Zero Days is in cinemas and on VOD in the US.

The elderly statesman was speaking at the 40th anniversary celebrations of the raid on Entebbe, during which Israeli commandos freed hostages who had been taken by Palestinian and German terrorists from a flight from Tel Aviv. It was supposed to be an event that bonded Israel with Uganda, but to onlookers\u2019 consternation Museveni continually referred to Israel as Palestine in his rambling speech. Given that the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, his wife and dignitaries were present, this error was unexpected, particularly as Netanyahu\u2019s brother Yonatan was killed in the raid. Museveni told Netanyahu: \u201cI want to thank him for turning this sad story 40 years ago into yet another instrument of bonding the holy land of Israel-Palestine, with the heartland Uganda in particular, and Africa in general.\u201d This was startling enough, but those who thought Museveni\u2019s speech would return to the normal world would be disappointed; he had only just started. \u201cThe sad event, 40 years ago, turned to another bond linking Palestine to Africa. I say this is yet another bond between Africa and Palestine because there were earlier bondage events,\u201d he pronounced. At this point, cameras covering the event focused on Netanyahu, who looked on impassively. Museveni continued on his strange theme, outlining his own version of the nativity story before going on to describe King Herod as \u201ca bad gentleman or something like that\u201d. Later in his speech, the Ugandan president called for unity between Israel and Palestine and offered to mediate between the two. \u201cI have never mediated in the issue of Palestine, but if you invited me I would give very clear ideas in a very short time,\u201d he announced. Then Museveni praised the Jews for avoiding what he called the British nonsense. \u201cYou know our British friends are fond of, er ... sometimes doing all sorts of nonsensical actions,\u201d he added. Finally Museveni revealed his dislike for long international meetings and confessed that he sleeps during many of them. For his part, Netanyahu has said his country\u2019s raid on Entebbe \u201cchanged the course\u201d of his life. \u201cInternational terrorism suffered a stinging defeat,\u201d he said of the 1976 rescue mission. The Entebbe raid is viewed as a seminal event in Israeli history and is widely seen as one of the country\u2019s greatest military successes. Museveni\u2019s words have gone viral, with thousands poking fun at the president, forcing his press secretary, Don Wanyama, to attempt some nifty damage limitation on Facebook. \u201cNow, I have heard the president\u2019s reference to the geographical space that was Palestine before the state of Israel took root in 1948 caused some unnecessary excitement, engineered by some elements, who probably didn\u2019t like the president\u2019s hard truths on the two-state model,\u201d states Wanyama. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what leadership calls for, saying things as they are.\u201d Museveni critics have not been so forgiving, however. \u201cThe day Israel was referred to as state of Palestine by Uganda\u2019s dictator Museveni,\u201d said vocal Museveni opponent, Frederick Womakuyu. \u201cMuseveni will soon read a love letter in parliament as his speech.\u201d Israelis have been equally scornful. One radio broadcaster is said to have cut off the speech with the words \u201cWe\u2019ve heard enough\u201d, while others have complained that Netanyahu\u2019s trip was a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. For its part, the Jerusalem Post likened Museveni to a Ugandan Donald Trump \u2013 except that Trump is seeking election while Museveni has clung to power for 30 years. In fact, Museveni\u2019s tenure may be coming to an end. Uganda\u2019s constitution states that a president must be under 75, which means he will be too old at the next elections in 2021.

A cardiologist and a team of three specialist cardiovascular nurses stand over her.

She has been a nurse at the hospital for 20 years and now runs the catheterisation lab in the intensive cardiac care unit. The Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital sits on what was an Arab village that was cleared when the Israeli army attacked it in 1948 and the Arab residents fled. Today the hospital is a rare island of calm where Jews, Israeli Arabs and some Palestinian staff work together to treat patients.  Outside, there is a sea of distrust and growing violence between Israelis and Palestinians, with divisive political rhetoric on the rise and the loudest voices pushing for nationalism and more division. Next door to the lab is the cardiology ward, where Rashad Rizeq, 32, a Palestinian from Ramallah, has been selected for a residency. Rizeq studied for seven years at Cairo University in Egypt and spent three years working in public hospitals in Ramallah. His grandmother died 10 years ago aged 65 after a heart attack because there was no interventional cardiology treatment in the Palestinian territories. He has vowed to take what he learns back to Palestinian public hospitals, which still have few cardiology facilities.

This is hard and frustrating, I have to leave the house by 4am, to reach the hospital by 7am, and sometimes I don\u2019t get home until 8pm,\u201d says Rizeq. Sometimes he spends up to three hours travelling each way from Ramallah to the hospital on the south-western side of Jerusalem. He has been given permission by Israel to work and use his Palestinian-registered car. \u201cTravelling on Israeli transport didn\u2019t work \u2013 if my wife called me on the telephone I would speak in Arabic,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople got tense.

Lotan started his medical career just a month before the Yom Kippur war in 1973. He had been discharged but when the war broke out he returned to the army to try to reclaim Mount Hermon from the Syrians. \u201cThe Yom Kippur war was the biggest trauma that I think the Israelis have had. In my case it established a lot of what I think,\u201d Lotan says. \u201cI feel we have to find a solution \u2013 at the end of the day young people are killed for nothing, in the name of nothing.\u201d He says he has treated many Palestinians who have carried out attacks inside Israel.

If I was walking down the street and I had an argument with an Arab, I would never see him again. There is no dialogue, I stand in my position and he stands in his. But here, at the school, there\u2019s a process. I think we need to create a new perspective, a new narrative about how we want to see each other. It happens slowly and it\u2019s stronger when it doesn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d Aloni says.     A poster at the school.

The FA is keen to talk to both Allardyce, who left Sunderland\u2019s training camp in Austria on Monday night, and J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, the USA coach, about the vacancy created following Roy Hodgson\u2019s resignation, but have been encouraged by the 61\u2011year\u2011old\u2019s apparent enthusiasm for helping them to polish the next in line. Sunderland insisted that Allardyce\u2019s early departure concerned ongoing discussions over potential transfers, with one source stating it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. The club had earlier remained resolutely silent in the face of mounting speculation on Monday. While formal contact between manager, club and the FA is still to be established, Allardyce has made no secret of his desire to coach his country and was desperately disappointed to lose out to Steve McClaren when the pair competed for the post a decade ago.

While suggestions that his Wearside deal includes an escape clause designed to facilitate an easy exit should England come calling have been dismissed by club sources, the relative brevity of his current agreement indicates that compensation would not be an insurmountable issue for the FA. Although Allardyce enjoys a good relationship with Ellis Short, Sunderland\u2019s American owner, he seems deeply frustrated by the club\u2019s failure to make a single signing so far this summer. It appeared Martin Bain, Sunderland\u2019s new chief executive who began work on 1\u00a0July after arriving from Maccabi Tel Aviv, had made a breakthrough last week when Davide Santon seemed to be on the brink of joining from Internazionale only for negotiations to break down at the last moment. \u201cWe want to improve the squad with two, three or four players as quickly as we can,\u201d Allardyce told Sunderland\u2019s website. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to work in the market shrewdly and to get the best value for money we possibly can. Hopefully the fans will be a little bit patient but I have to admit myself that my patience is wearing thin \u2013 very, very thin indeed.\u201d Allardyce, anxious to sign the West Ham United striker Diafra Sakho, is understood to be angry about the failure to solve a problem position at left-back by signing Santon and described the \u00a33m move\u2019s collapse as \u201ca huge disappointment\u201d. If such travails should encourage Martin Glenn, Dan Ashworth and David Gill \u2013 the FA\u2019s chief executive, technical director and vice-chairman respectively \u2013 in their pursuit of Allardyce they will be more interested in his consistent championing of young English coaches over the years. Even so, the FA continues to talk to a number of potential candidates and interested parties which are likely to include Bournemouth\u2019s Eddie Howe and Steve Bruce. Although they are still to make contact with either Hull\u2019s manager or his club Bruce - currently at a pre-season training camp in Portugal - was delighted to be mentioned in dispatches. \u201cIt\u2019s highly flattering and, whether or not it goes any further than that, I\u2019m honoured to be linked with it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the pinnacle isn\u2019t it?

The news prompted incredulity in stunned global capitals, with few finding anything good to say about Britain\u2019s new top diplomat. Some even wondered whether the story was a joke. This hostile view has several explanations. In his colourful career as a newspaper columnist Johnson has offended a large number of world leaders. They include the US president, Barack Obama, and his likely successor, Hillary Clinton, as well as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.    Related: Who's who in Theresa May's new cabinet    But additionally, and perhaps more seriously, Johnson is widely viewed as inherently untrustworthy. In Brussels, and in other EU capitals, he is seen as the man whose lies, opportunism and vaunting ego brought about Britain\u2019s disastrous EU exit. This anger is genuine. And unlikely to dissipate quickly. On Thursday France\u2019s foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, summed up what most of unhappy continental Europe felt, declaring: \u201cHe [Johnson] lied a lot to the British. Now, he is the one with his back against the wall.\u201d  The problem, in Ayrault\u2019s damning view, was that France needed a UK partner who was \u201cclear, credible and reliable\u201d and \u201cwith whom I can negotiate\u201d. This was not Johnson, he made clear. Much of the rest of the world agrees, with Johnson regarded as a new and unnecessary problem. United States   US map   In the US, the official reaction was one of carefully restrained laughter. When State Department spokesman Mark Toner heard the news, he struggled to keep a straight face \u2013 a broad smile breaking out more than once \u2013 before saying the US \u201clooked forward\u201d to working with Johnson.            State Department spokesman smiles at news of Boris Johnson\u2019s appointment    In the run-up to Brexit, the former mayor of London had sharply criticised Obama. Johnson was accused of dogwhistle racism when he said in an article for the Sun in April that the \u201cpart-Kenyan\u201d US president\u2019s \u201cancestral dislike of the British empire\u201d had led him to remove a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office. Obama said in reply to Johnson that he voluntarily had a bust of Churchill outside his private office on the White House\u2019s second floor \u201cso that I see it every day \u2013 including on weekends when I\u2019m going into that office to watch a basketball game\u201d. Johnson likened Hillary Clinton to \u201ca sadistic nurse in a mental hospital\u201d. Germany   Germany map   The chancellor, Angela Merkel, refrained from commenting on the new head of the Foreign Office. \u201cI believe it is our task to work closely with governments in allied countries. The world has enough problems for us to progress in our foreign policy cooperation with Great Britain as we have always done,\u201d she told reporters. Ralf Stegner, deputy chairman of the Social Democratic party, Merkel\u2019s junior coalition partner, said: \u201cMay looks weaker after such a choice of personnel.\u201d Johnson had not come across as an exemplary diplomat in the past, Stegner said. \u201cNow he is negotiating Brexit. Enjoy the trip!\u201d Simone Peter, co-leader of the Green party, likened Johnson\u2019s appointment to \u201ctrusting the cat to keep the cream\u201d. Green party parliamentary co-leader Anton Hofreiter said appointing Johnson was \u201ca very bad sign for the leaving process and raises doubts over the competency of the new prime minister\u201d.  The Brussels correspondent of German public broadcaster ZDF, Anne Gellinek, said that Johnson was \u201cproperly, properly hated\u201d and seen as \u201cthe head of a campaign of lies\u201d in the EU\u2019s headquarters. ZDF\u2019s Berlin correspondent, Nicole Diekmann, tweeted: \u201cSo, Boris Johnson, foreign minister.

Boris Johnson a liar with his back against the wall, says French foreign minister \u2013 video    Johnson speaks fluent French with an accent, which he calls his own \u201cbarbarian form of French\u201d learned when he was a Brussels correspondent. He has often been to France to promote his books on Churchill or London, which have been translated into French and sold well. He easily holds court on French radio in French, and as London mayor conducted meetings with Paris politicians in French. But he is best known for what has been seen as his relentless \u201cFrench-bashing\u201d and endless quest for hammy punchlines at the expense of France. Le Monde warned after his appointment: \u201cHis talent for theatrics is well known, but it remains to be seen how much talent he has in international diplomacy.\u201d China   China map   The world\u2019s second largest economy was scratching its head as it woke up to the news that Johnson \u2013 or \u201cBao Li Si\u201d as he is known in Chinese \u2013 had been made foreign secretary. In China Johnson is seen more as a celebrity than a serious politician. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d one baffled Chinese commentator wrote on a popular WeChat group dedicated to life in Britain. \u201cForeign secretary Boris is going to hog the global headlines,\u201d the writer predicted, adding: \u201cDoes Auntie May think he is a mascot? I can hardly bear to watch it unfold on [state broadcaster] CCTV.\u201d   Related: Will Boris Johnson go on writing his Daily Telegraph column?    Weibo, China\u2019s answer to Twitter, also erupted in a bout of Borisology, with many observers focusing on the former London mayor\u2019s hair rather than his foreign policy experience. \u201cJust from looking at Boris Johnson you can tell that British hairdressing is not doing so well,\u201d quipped one. \u201cHe\u2019s so funny!\u201d said another. But one less enthusiastic Weibo user asked: \u201cWhat are they doing? Boris will be in charge of diplomacy???\u201d There was also bewilderment at Johnson\u2019s appointment in Beijing\u2019s diplomatic circles. During his last trip to China in 2013, the loquacious London mayor bamboozled Chinese interpreters with his use of words such as polymorphous and joked about his Bullingdon Club days to a senior Communist party leader. \u201cThe idea of having Boris Johnson as foreign secretary never even entered my mind,\u201d admitted one senior western diplomat. The diplomat, who keeps one eye on Westminster politics, described Johnson\u2019s appointment as a risky move that had the potential to backfire badly. \u201cBut sometimes a bit of charisma helps give you more visibility. Let\u2019s see if he is more pragmatic and less of a performer in his new job.\u201d In the hours after Johnson\u2019s unveiling, British residents of the Chinese capital were bombarded with sarcastic messages from fellow expats. \u201cWhat is happening to your country?\u201d read one provocation sent to the Guardian. Another, less diplomatic dispatch sent to a functionary of the British embassy said simply: \u201cYour new boss is a plonker.\u201d Middle East   Middle East graphic   Middle Eastern governments are maintaining a diplomatic silence on the appointment, but given Johnson\u2019s record there will be anxiety in various quarters across the region. Syria\u2019s western-backed opposition has suffered a blow, commented the influential Palestinian journalist Abdel-Bari Atwan, since Johnson\u2019s call for \u201cdoing business\u201d with Bashar al-Assad contradicts current British policy that the president must step down. Johnson\u2019s focus on the dangers of Isis has led him to call for fighting alongside Assad and Vladimir Putin \u2013 a position which will do little to address the root causes of the five-year war. Britain is an active member of the International Syria Support Group but in recent months the Foreign Office has become increasingly concerned about the convergence of views between the US and Russia. \u201cI think Boris will approach Syria from a fresh perspective,\u201d said one opposition adviser. \u201cOnce the dust settles, leaders will be keen to demonstrate the UK\u2019s continued role in the world, precisely to offset the notion of a post-Brexit decline in power.\u201d Palestinians seeking to increase pressure on Israel dislike Johnson\u2019s hostility to the Boycott Disinvestment and Sanctions movement, which he described as consisting of \u201ccorduroy-jacketed lefty academics\u201d on a visit to the region while mayor of London. On Thursday, the Times of Israel called him \u201ca decidedly pro-Israel politician\u201d. Supporters of Israel praised him on social media for holding to that position. Pro-Palestinians showed him posing with Israeli soldiers. Egypt \u2013 where evidence of government repression is mounting \u2013 as well as Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, will be watching carefully to see if Johnson maintains the government\u2019s firm commitment to trade and defence sales while remaining only mildly and generally privately critical of human rights abuses and lack of political freedoms. UK support for the Saudi-led-coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen is another highly sensitive issue, where government policy faces increasingly close scrutiny. Overall, the UK\u2019s economic plight makes it less likely that anything will be done to jeopardise trade and investment from the Gulf. \u201cBoris Johnson could sell sand to Arabs,\u201d commented one Twitter user. \u201cWhich will probably be our main export now.\u201d Al-Sharq al-Awsat, the influential pan-Arabic newspaper, headlined its coverage with European criticism of Johnson\u2019s appointment. Iran   Iran map   Boris Johnson remains largely an unknown figure in Tehran but when he was asked as a mayoral candidate in 2008 which country he always wanted to visit, he said: \u201cIran. I am a sucker for sun-bleached ruins and ancient edifices and think I could happily spend a week picking through Persepolis.\u201d All eyes in Iran will be on Johnson\u2019s approach towards last year\u2019s landmark nuclear deal with the west, with some news websites recycling his 2006 article for the Telegraph in which he appears to suggest that the west should not panic if Iran gets a nuclear bomb, though his preference would have been for the Israelis to have bombed Iranian nuclear facilities.  \u201cIn an ideal world, the Israelis would fly to Iran and repeat their magnificent success at Osirak in 1986 [see footnote], where they bombed Saddam\u2019s nuclear capacity in its desert cradle,\u201d he wrote in the Telegraph.   My despairing feeling is that, in the case of Iran, we should admit that it\u2019s checkmate, as they say in Persian. The Iranians are one day going to possess a nuclear bomb; there is almost certainly nothing we can do about it; all our blustering and threats are pointless. Indeed, if all else fails, there may even be a case for giving the Iranians the bomb \u2013 that\u2019s right: maybe it is time for the Americans to take control themselves of this unstoppable programme.  Although sanctions were officially lifted in January, Iran is facing huge challenges in reconnecting its economy to the global market, mostly because European banks are still reluctant to handle Iranian payments. Iran has been in talks with London to find a way to resolve that issue.  Examining Johnson\u2019s past comments on Iran and the Middle East, Khordad, an Iranian news website, concluded that Johnson appeared to be an inexperienced foreign secretary. \u201cHis harsh statements against the Islamic Republic and Hezbollah, his tendencies towards Israel and business cooperations with Saudi Arabia and Arab countries show that his appointment would not benefit Tehran-London ties \u2013 it will please those in Riyadh and Tel Aviv.\u201d Spain   Spain map   Having been without a government since last December, many in Spain have regarded the speed and treachery of the Tory party\u2019s governmental reformation with awe. However, the news that Johnson would be at the helm of Britain\u2019s foreign policy still came as a shock \u2013 despite the fact that Spain appears to be one of the few countries to have escaped his waspish judgment. La Vanguardia\u2019s London correspondent, Rafael Ramos, charitably suggested that Johnson had been given the job in the hope that he would use his \u201cwit and charm in Brussels \u2013 which he criticises so much\u201d. But he also pointed out that it was unclear whether Johnson was really a Eurosceptic or not.  Idafe Mart\u00edn, Brussels correspondent for three big Latin American papers, was a little more direct, tweeting: \u201cBoris Johnson as foreign secretary.

He wrote the limerick in May after the Spectator magazine asked for entries to protest against Erdo\u011fan\u2019s attempts to prosecute a comedian in Germany. The poem also suggested Erdo\u011fan had sex with a goat. Daily Sabah, a newspaper with close ties to the ruling AKP government, described Johnson as \u201canti-Turkey\u201d and a Eurosceptic whose appointment \u201craises questions about the future of Britain\u2019s international relations\u201d. The newspaper highlighted comments by Johnson that expressed support for the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK), a designated terrorist organisation fighting an insurgency against the Turkish government. It also pointed to his Telegraph column praising the Syrian president, Assad, for his troops\u2019 victory in removing Islamic State from the ancient city of Palmyra. Turkey\u2019s presidency issued a calm response to the appointment. \u201cTurkey\u2019s relationship with the United Kingdom goes beyond personalities,\u201d said a Turkish official. \u201cWe expect Mr Johnson to act in a professional and cordial manner in his new capacity. We have no reason to doubt that the United Kingdom will continue to treat PKK as what it is \u2013 a terrorist organisation.\u201d Africa   Africa map   Commentators across Africa have been rereading Johnson\u2019s comments about the continent and wondering what it means for British diplomacy.  \u201cWhile Johnson\u2019s gaffes and snide remarks span the globe, he may be uniquely unfit for diplomatic dealings in Africa,\u201d news website Quartz Africa wrote, referencing a 2002 article describing Commonwealth members on the continent as \u201cflag-waving piccaninnies\u201d and describing \u201cwatermelon\u201d smiles. (Johnson later apologised for the comments.) One radio station in South Africa said the \u201cracist comments\u201d would be a problem in the future. \u201cAt some point he will have to deal with the African Union and his track record does not bode well for international relations,\u201d warned a post on the website of Cape Talk, in Cape Town. The host of one show apologised repeatedly to his audience when reading quotes from Johnson\u2019s earlier writings. Dr Jakkie Cilliers, of the Institute for Security Studies and a respected analyst in South Africa, told the station he did not think the appointment was \u201ca wise decision\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly not someone who inspires confidence \u2026 as some of [these] quotes reflect quite adequately. We are really seeing the end of empire for the UK. British influence has already dramatically shrunk over last 10 years particularly in Africa and this trend will sharpen.\u201d The appointment will also be watched closely in Zimbabwe. Johnson has been fiercely critical of President Mugabe\u2019s rule, calling lavish celebrations for his 91st birthday \u201cnauseating\u201d and blaming the veteran leader for impoverishing the country. A Kenyan government spokesman reacted cautiously, saying \u201cwe look at policy more than personality\u201d. The spokesman added: \u201cWe do not expect any radical change in policy in the UK\u2019s dealings with Kenya.\u201d  There were more pointed comments from Uganda, which referred back to previous remarks from Johnson on colonialism. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s opinion that countries like Uganda would be better off as colonies is inconsequential,\u201d said Ofwono Opondo, a government spokesman. \u201cWe would be more concerned if the US or Russia appointed someone like Boris.

Considering this was a Saturday night dominated by the news that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho would be replacing Louis van Gaal at Manchester United, it looked as if the Wearsiders had something to hide.   Related: David Moyes and Sunderland look the right fit for Premier League stability    If such timing was all about a desire not to rake up memories of his predecessor, Margaret Byrne, and her springtime resignation in the wake of the Adam Johnson child abuse case, Bain has since adopted a resolutely low profile. He has said nothing publicly following his installation on 1 July, during which time he has been confronted by unexpected drama. Instead of a gentle transition from life at Maccabi Tel Aviv, Bain quickly found himself powerless to prevent Sam Allardyce defecting to coach England. He cannot have envisaged spending part of his first month haggling over compensation for the outgoing manager with the Football Association before eventually brokering a \u00a33m compromise \u2013 around \u00a31m more than the governing body had hoped to pay \u2013 between a fuming Ellis Short, Sunderland\u2019s American owner, and the governing body. Allardyce\u2019s exit also left him helming the search for Sunderland\u2019s seventh manager in five years and helping identify \u2013 and swiftly secure \u2013 a fellow Glaswegian, David Moyes, with the former Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad coach installed on Saturday morning. Yet, even before the FA came calling, trouble was brewing on Wearside. Not only had Allardyce complained that \u201cmy patience is wearing thin \u2013 very, very thin indeed\u201d when none of the three or four swift signings he had wanted were made but Ryan Sachs, the club secretary, suddenly stepped down with no explanation offered to the media. If club secretaries can come and go without calamitous consequences Sunderland\u2019s failure to make a transfer breakthrough represents a genuine concern, particularly as Allardyce was adamant that, without strengthening, the team would be destined for yet another relegation struggle. It does not help that 35 miles down the road at Middlesbrough, Aitor Karanka has recruited virtually an entire XI of new players. Undeterred, Short \u2013 whose similarly cautious transfer market approach this time last summer dismayed Allardyce\u2019s predecessor Dick Advocaat \u2013 can only hope Bain replicates his success in Tel Aviv. During a two-year stint the 48-year-old oversaw one of the most successful periods in the club\u2019s history while also helping Israel\u2019s leading clubs negotiate an unprecedentedly lucrative television deal. An earlier stint in Scotland, as CEO at Rangers, proved somewhat more turbulent for a former Glasgow University student who supplemented his grant by working as a male model before abridging his undergraduate days and emigrating, briefly, to Africa.     Sam Allardyce complained in the final days of his time at Sunderland over a lack of signings this summer. \u2018My patience is wearing thin \u2013 very, very thin indeed,\u2019 he said. Photograph: Steven Paston/PA    \u201cI\u2019d left to start a new life in South Africa before completing my degree course,\u201d Bain has recalled. \u201cBut I contracted malaria and returned to Scotland to recover. \u201cWhen I was fully fit again I attempted to enter the world of publishing by producing a marketing magazine but that venture went belly up. Then I became an accounts manager with a company who were handling a sponsorship involving Rangers.\u201d Bain did such a good job that Rangers offered him a position in the commercial department at Ibrox. During his rise to chief executive he gained a reputation for driving hard bargains while also joking that the pressures of football life in Glasgow explained his premature baldness. Things became seriously stressful when, in 2011, David Murray sold Rangers to its majority shareholder Craig Whyte. Bain had raised serious concerns about the takeover and attempted to block the sale. He was later suspended by Whyte and departed before later suing for damages, alleging a breach of contract following the takeover \u2013 a lawsuit he dropped in 2012. After a three-year sabbatical from football during he was head-hunted by Mitch Goldhar, Maccabi\u2019s Canadian owner. Two years in Israel, in which he swapped his stiff British suits for considerably more casual attire, proved thoroughly restorative. On the pitch Maccabi secured a domestic treble in 2015 and Champions League qualification, while off it Bain earned plaudits for strong commercial growth. With Sunderland having recorded a series of worrying losses in recent years, Short seeks a similarly transformative performance on Wearside. It is high time a vicious circle of annual relegation battles and whopping debts was broken. Part of the healing process will need to involve Bain improving communication with supporters and the media, a sphere in which Byrne \u2013 who very rarely gave interviews or spoke in public \u2013 proved an enormous disappointment. The days when the former chairman Niall Quinn invited fans to accompany him on a \u201cmagic carpet ride\u201d feel a distant memory at a time when many supporters feel increasingly disconnected from the club. Encouragingly Bain\u2019s mantra at Maccabi was all about \u201cfan engagement\u201d with \u201cinteraction\u201d between club and local community carefully nurtured as supporters were encouraged to \u201cbuy into the badge\u201d.     Martin Bain oversaw one of the most successful periods in Maccabi Tel Aviv\u2019s history and helped Israel\u2019s leading clubs negotiate an unprecedentedly lucrative television deal. Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images    Bain was the subject of unfounded Rangers-related bung allegations in a French newspaper which claimed in 2006 that he had used \u00a3150,000 deposited in his Monaco bank account by a Serbian football agent to buy a \u00a3300,000 holiday home near Cannes. Lawyers described the accusations as \u201csheer hogwash\u201d and David Murray defended Bain to the hilt. Rangers\u2019 then owner explained that the cash received by Bain from the agent Ranko Stojic in fact related to the purchase of a property from the former Manchester City defender Laurent Charvet. Murray said of Bain: \u201cAt no time has he acted illegally or improperly.\u201d Bain, meanwhile, adopted a strong stance in the fight against sectarianism in the Glasgow area, taking the bold step of criticising Rangers\u2019 fans in certain instances. A comparable blend of diplomacy and sometimes brutal honesty will be required at a club at times bedevilled by internecine internal politics during Byrne\u2019s watch.

It showed a man who, quite literally, could not believe his luck. It showed a man talking absolute gibberish. Yet, with his eyes barely visible, what with the breadth of the smile pushing his considerable cheeks upwards, his unmistakable turnip filling the 5:3 screen, his broad shoulders reduced to a shuddering giggle, it is impossible not to \u2018get that smile\u2019 and smile with him. In looking and talking down the barrel of the camera, even raising a chubby finger through the fourth wall, you feel as though he is talking directly to you. And maybe this is his charm. Maybe it was this that seduced his wife Lynne, Sunderland\u2019s layabouts and the FA\u2019s layabouts suits into getting on board with him. Perhaps it is this that England\u2019s association football players will bleed, sweat and cry for.   Related: Sam Allardyce: far too early to say if Wayne Rooney will remain England captain    The Fiver is on board with Sam all right. It wouldn\u2019t have been a shock to see him, The People\u2019s Champ, one eyebrow raised and one elbow dangerously dangling below his shoulder, enter his first press conference as England manager on Monday and demand the waiting press pack take a whiff of his culinary output. But he didn\u2019t. After taking the weekend to calm down, Sam appeared only slightly more composed than on Friday, this time doing his utmost to keep a straight face. \u201cIt were 10 years since I was last interviewed and to sit here is a huge thrill for me. I think I fit the chair, I hope I do,\u201d Allardyce mused, his legendary buttocks now perched firmly on luxurious snakeskin upholstery. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got the experience to challenge the England team and challenge myself. Managing five Premier League teams has given me huge experience.\u201d Asked whether Wayne Rooney would remain as captain, he sensibly answered: \u201cI\u2019m going to leave that until I meet all the players and get all the staff together,\u201d before conceding that his style is \u201cpragmatic.\u201d But then the sensible mask of seriousness slipped. The corner of his mouth curled upwards and out came a laugh so hearty that international managers, some thousands of miles away, felt a sudden chill in the air. In a scene not dissimilar from England\u2019s unofficial Dizzee Rascal and James Corden World Cup song in 2010, Sam concluded with the line that every person in post-Brexit England wanted to hear: \u201cI\u2019m tough enough. So bring it on lads!\u201d Yes you are, Sam. And The Fiver will follow you to the ends of the earth, or even Russia, to prove it. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThe couple said he was really nice and friendly, and more than happy to have photos taken with them, which made their day with them being such big Reds fans.

The first - \u201cBright spots among the world\u2019s coral reefs\u201d was produced by 39 scientists led by Professor Josh Cinner of James Cook University in Australia and drew on data from 6000 reef surveys from all over the world. Cinner et al concluded that those reefs that were sustainably managed had a much better chance of withstanding bleaching impacts related to global warming and periodic climate events like El Ni\u00f1o. The second however suggested remote coral reefs not subject to human stressors like overfishing or pollution were faring no better than those close to populated areas and that ecosystems management made no real difference to the overall health of reefs. So which is right?   \u201cCoral reef degradation is not correlated with local human population density,\u201d by Professor John Bruno and co-author Abel Valdivia of the University of North Carolina was published on 20 July. It suggests that contrary to prevailing scientific opinion, local pressures do not act synchronously with global stressors (most notably warming) and that their impact on reefs is negligible. According to Valdivia \u201cWidespread arguments that coral reef degradation is mostly caused by local factors are unsupported. We found the problem is better explained by global impacts such as climate change.\u201d  This is controversial because it throws into question the efficacy of current marine conservation strategies that attempt to mitigate human impacts and the \u201cwidespread argument that human-dominated reefs can be made more resilient to global stressors.\u201d The overriding message is a simple one according to the report\u2019s author &amp; lead researcher John Bruno - it \u201cillustrates the far-reaching effects of global warming and the immediate need for drastic and sustained cuts in carbon emissions to help restore the health of coral reefs.\u201d  The first report - published in June - identified 35 \u201cdark spots\u201d where coral reefs were suffering the greatest degradation and 15 \u201cbright spots\u201d that were, if not flourishing, certainly faring better than most. Many of these bright spots are in the Coral Triangle in countries like Indonesia, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea.  Like Bruno &amp; Valdivia, Cinner et al found that remote reefs did not necessarily fare better than those close to high population densities. What they did find though is that bright spots tend to be in locations where local communities have ancestral systems of reef tenure that protect fishing grounds from outsiders (such as West Papua in eastern Indonesia and some Pacific countries). The paper found that far from over-harvesting their reefs, these communities were acting as custodians.  \u201cBright spots are characterized by strong sociocultural institutions such as customary taboos and marine tenure, high levels of local engagement in management, high dependence on marine resources, and beneficial environmental conditions such as deep-water refuge,\u201d the report concludes.  The apparent contradictions here are partly due to each report analysing different types of data. According to Bruno \u201cCinner et al was about spatial patterns in fish populations while we asked how coral and macroalgal cover are related to human population density.\u201d Put simply, one was looking at fish, the other at coral cover.  Still, the question remains, is local management of the kind highlighted by Cinner et al having a real impact on the health of reef ecosystems? Says Bruno, \u201cAlthough I doubt most coral bright spots are bright because of local management, I do agree that... we should throw all our conservation dollars at them to keep them that way as long as possible.\u201d The problem is in how each of these reports is interpreted. Cinner et al imply that sustainable management means healthy reefs - even though they are harvested by local populations. A positive message for conservationists and the local programmes they support. Bruno\u2019s point however seems to be that all of this is academic in the face of climate change, lulling us into a dangerous and altogether unjustifiable sense of security. If we fail to drastically reduce the volume of CO2 entering the atmosphere, coral reefs everywhere will bleach and die, however well they are being managed.  But while Bruno &amp; Valdivia frame their argument very carefully, it is possible that unscrupulous policy makers could seize upon their study to justify continued exploitation of marine resources, claiming that it makes no difference to the bigger picture. Professor Avigdor Abelson of Tel Aviv University who works on restoration ecology such as building artificial reefs fears it \u201cmay lead to undesirable consequences of accelerated coral reef degradation.\u201d   Both reports are right. The danger is that they will be misinterpreted.

Zakaria Bulhan, 19, has been charged with murdering the 64-year-old woman and attempting to murder five other people in the central London assault on Wednesday night. Bulhan, who wore a plain grey tracksuit, was asked to confirm his name, address and date of birth but kept one hand over his mouth, making his responses almost inaudible to the court. The court heard that he declined representation at the hearing, shaking his head when asked if he wanted to see the duty solicitor.  The suspect held his head in his hands as the six charges were confirmed. He is accused of murdering US citizen Darlene Horton, who was due to fly back to America a day later, and the attempted murder of two other women and three men. They were named as Lillie Selletin, Yovel Lewronski, Martin Hoenisch, David Imber and Bernard Hepplewhite.  One of the male victims, who suffered a stab wound to his stomach, remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition. The other four were all discharged on Thursday after being treated for their injuries. He is also charged with the attempted murder of Martin Hoenisch, Lillie Selletin, David Imber, Bernard Hepplewhite and Yovel Lewronski, who were all injured in the same attack.  Bulhan is a Norwegian national of Somali origin who moved to the UK in 2002 and lives in Wandsworth, south London, with his mother, brother and sister. He will appear at the Old Bailey on Tuesday.  Hoenisch is understood to be the American man injured in the attack. In the early hours of Friday morning, the Las Vegas resident posted on Facebook: \u201cThanks to everybody for reaching.

Anyway thanks to everyone for reaching out, we\u2019re still very saddened about the woman who was killed. Very unreal experience.\u201d Hepplewhite is thought to be the British man who remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition after being stabbed in the stomach in the attack.

The country\u2019s interior minister, Aryeh Deri, and the public security minister, Gilad Erdan, announced the move on Sunday. The taskforce will attempt to locate hundreds of activists already in Israel and deny entry to others trying get in. Israel has a long history of denying entry to those it says are damaging to its interests, but the latest proposal marks a new escalation against the BDS movement and activists. According to reports in the Israeli media a number of as yet unnamed groups active in Palestine have already been listed.  Since Israeli naval forces intercepted the Mavi Marmara protest flotilla in 2010, killing nine people, the so-called delegitimisation department of the Israeli military intelligence research division has routinely monitored the activities of groups abroad (\u00a3).  Since an attempted \u201cFlytilla\u201d \u2013 an attempted mass arrival by air that followed the Mavi Marmara incident \u2013 Israel has increased its efforts to prevent entry by activists, using a range of tactics. Foreign campaigners with the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) and other groups have long been a prominent feature of the protest landscape in Palestine, attending demonstrations, visiting flashpoint locations and working on volunteer projects. Many, including ISM volunteers, come on tourist visas but stay for prolonged periods.     Palestinians walk past a sign painted on a wall in Bethlehem last year calling for a boycott of Israeli products. Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images    A key focus in recent years has been BDS \u2013 a Palestinian-led international movement that seeks to introduce sanctions against Israel \u2013 which Israeli politicians often accuse of being antisemitic and of \u201cdelegitimising\u201d Israel. A joint statement by the two ministers accused activists of going to Palestine to \u201cagitate the local residents against the security forces and disrupt their activity\u201d. \u201cThe battle of the boycott organisations against Israel begins with the people who come to sabotage inside Israel,\u201d Deri said. \u201cIt is our duty to do everything possible to weaken the boycott.\u201d  Erdan said: \u201cBoycott activists must not be allowed to enter Israel.\u201d The latest moves reflect the deep sense of confusion and panic within Israel\u2019s government over BDS, a movement it routinely dismisses as a failure while also denouncing it as a powerful threat and devoting significant financial and diplomatic resources to countering it.  The latest Israeli moves were condemned by Abdulrahman Abunahel, a BDS spokesman. \u201cDeporting BDS activists in order to silence them and undermine their principled support for Palestinian human rights is not only anti-democratic; it is yet another incident of Israel shooting itself in the foot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, we expect such acts of heightened repression to boost support for boycotting Israel back in these activists\u2019 home countries. \u201cThis latest weapon in the intensifying Israeli legal, espionage and propaganda war against the BDS movement for Palestinian rights is a strong indicator of how desperate and irrational Israel\u2019s regime of occupation, settler-colonialism and apartheid has become in its futile attempts to hinder the impressive growth of the BDS movement around the world.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 9 August 2016 to remove a reference to Tel Aviv which was mistakenly introduced during the editing process.", "publicationDate": "2016-08-08T12:05:53Z", "title": "Israel to crack down further on foreign pro-Palestinian activists", "sentences": ["\u201cThis latest weapon in the intensifying Israeli legal, espionage and propaganda war against the BDS movement for Palestinian rights is a strong indicator of how desperate and irrational Israel\u2019s regime of occupation, settler-colonialism and apartheid has become in its futile attempts to hinder the impressive growth of the BDS movement around the world.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 9 August 2016 to remove a reference to Tel Aviv which was mistakenly introduced during the editing process."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/08/israel-to-crack-down-further-on-foreign-pro-palestinian-activists"}, {"tags": ["Islam", "Air transport", "Flights", "UK news", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "Airline industry", "World news", "Religion", "Travel", "US news"], "article": "On March 26 this year, Hasan Aldewachi was on his way back from a science conference in Vienna, and looking forward to seeing his family. As he took his seat on the flight to Gatwick, he sent his wife a text message to let her know the plane was delayed. A woman sitting across the aisle got up and left her seat. Moments later the police arrived. The Iraqi-born Sheffield Hallam student was asked to leave the plane and held for four hours. After his phone was confiscated, he was left at the airport with no onward ticket or refund. The reason? His message was in Arabic. Aldewachi\u2019s story is just one example of the dangers of what has become known as \u201cflying while Muslim\u201d; the tongue-in-cheek term for the discrimination many Muslim passengers feel they have faced at airports since 9/11. It can range from extra questions from airport staff, to formal searches by police, to secondary security screenings and visa problems when visiting America. Sometimes it feels like every Muslim has a tale to tell.     Faizah Shaheen \u2026 reading about Syria. Photograph: Twitter    Two weeks ago, a Muslim couple celebrating their wedding anniversary were removed from a flight from France to the US. A crew member allegedly complained that Nazia Ali, 34, who wears a headscarf, was using her phone, and her husband Faisal was sweating. The flight attendant allegedly also complained that the couple used the word \u201cAllah\u201d. The airline in question subsequently said it was \u201cdeeply committed to treating all of our customers with respect\u201d. Other examples this summer include NHS mental-health worker Faizah Shaheen who was on her way back from her honeymoon when she was detained and questioned by police under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. Cabin crew on her outbound flight said they had spotted her reading a book about Syria. Shaheen said she was left in tears by the experience. Thomson airlines said: \u201cOur crew are trained to report any concerns they may have as a precaution.\u201d The stories that hit the headlines are often those similar to Aldewachi\u2019s or Shaheen\u2019s \u2013 where normal behaviour by Muslim passengers is seen as suspicious. More prevalent, but less reported, are the day-to-day stories of innocent passengers who feel they are under suspicion solely because of their religion. Equality and civil liberties groups warn that the net is now being thrown so wide that it is stigmatising and alienating thousands of Muslims. This, many argue, could make our time in the air less safe by sowing seeds of division. Even high-profile Muslims cannot escape. England cricketer Moeen Ali, Cat Stevens, music producer Naughty Boy and comedian Adil Ray have all complained of discriminatory treatment at airports. This month, Four Lions actor and rapper Riz Ahmed released a single called T5, about the problems he faces on flights. Aldewachi, who has lived in the UK since 2010, is still shaken by his experience. \u201cEveryone was looking at me and assuming I had done something wrong. This is not vigilance. This is stereotyping,\u201d he says. He has received no apology from the Austrian police \u2013 and says that apart from being told that a female passenger had reported seeing \u201csomething related to Isis\u201d \u2013 he was given no further explanation. The biomedical scientist finally received an apology and refund from easyJet after his story was reported in a newspaper. Aldewachi thinks the focus on terrorism in the media hasn\u2019t helped. \u201cPeople who know me are astonished. I am calm and quiet \u2013 they can\u2019t understand why anyone would look at me and be afraid. \u201cTo compare it to something in my field, it\u2019s like swine flu. Everyone thought they had it because they heard so much about it.\u201d Khairuldeen Makhzoomi can sympathise. In April, the 26-year-old was on his way back to his university in California when he phoned his uncle in Iraq to tell him he had been invited to a formal dinner at which Ban Ki-moon would be present \u2013 he even asked the UN secretary general a question. A woman in front of him reported him and Makhzoomi was asked to leave the plane, confronted by police officers, and had his bag searched in front of other passengers. The politics student says the airline manager told him he should have known it was a security risk to \u201cspeak that language\u201d. However, the airline, Southwest, released a statement saying it was the content of his words that was \u201cperceived to be threatening,\u201d not his use of Arabic. In March, a London DJ, Mehary Yemane-Tesfagiorgis, was removed from a flight from Rome because a passenger said they didn\u2019t feel safe travelling with him. Yemane-Tesfagiorgis, who is black, said he was a victim of racial profiling.     Music producer Naughty Boy. Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris for the Guardian    Fellow Londoner, Laolu Opebiyi, a Nigerian-born Christian, was asked to leave a plane after another passenger saw a prayer group message on his phone, labelled \u201cIsi\u201d (an acronym for \u201ciron sharpens iron\u201d, a Biblical quotation). Earlier this month Guido Menzio, a University of Pennsylvania economics professor who has \u201ccurly, dark hair\u201d, was expelled from a plane in the US after the equations he was writing alarmed a female passenger.

A friend recounted being prevented from boarding and questioned by secruity officials. A Guardian editor was stopped and questioned four out of the seven times he travelled to the US, including being asked about attending training camps in the Middle East. A relative of mine, who lives in the UK, and has both US and UK passports, is stopped on \u201c80% of my trips to, or within, the US \u2013 and I travel there about five or six times a year\u201d. It began soon after 9/11 on a layover in Minnesota. A police officer asked him to confirm his name and then to accompany him for questioning. \u201cWhen I asked him what it was about, he said the pilot had said I had been belligerent on the flight. I immediately switched to being as American as possible. I said something like, \u2018Yo, dude, that\u2019s totally ridiculous. I didn\u2019t speak to anyone.\u2019 I said he seemed like a nice guy, but this was racist profiling. When I said that, he apologised and said his boss had told him to check me out.\u201d Now he arrives early for flights in the US to factor in the extra security screening. \u201cOnce, they told me it was a \u2018random\u2019 selection and when I asked what it was based on, they said: \u2018Name, age, ethnicity.\u2019     \u2018Do not speak foreign.\u2019 Illustration: Son of Alan/Folio    \u201cIn Turkey, I was told I had the same name as a terrorist\u2019s son, and that the US shares their watchlist with them. \u201cI always put up a fight because the way they treat you is terrible. My view is that I am practically a boy scout. If I don\u2019t say something, who will?\u201d Hugh Handeyside, from the American Civil Liberties Union [ACLU], explains that repeatedly having \u201cSSSS\u201d (secondary security screening selection) printed on your boarding pass is a \u201cstrong indication\u201d your name has made it to a subset of the US government\u2019s sprawling terrorism watchlist. Sometimes it is enough to have a name similar to someone who is on the list. The database is believed to contain hundreds of thousands of names, and the secrecy surrounding it is intensely controversial. In April the Council of American Islamic Relations\u2019 [Cair] Michigan branch launched a class action on behalf of the \u201cthousands of innocent Americans who were wrongfully designated as \u2018known or suspected terrorists\u2019 without due process\u201d, and another lawsuit seeking a \u201cdeclaration that the watchlist is unconstitutional\u201d. Handeyside says that lawsuits by the ACLU have revealed that travel to a particular country in a particular year have been given as reasons for inclusion on a different subset of the watchlist \u2013 the no-fly list. In 2014, leaked details showed that those of Muslim descent were disproportionately represented on the list; while New York had the most watchlisted people, the second was Dearborne, a small city in Michigan. As Handeyside points out, Dearborne is \u201cthe centre of the highest concentration of people of Arab descent outside the Middle East\u201d. The use of algorithms to determine who required extra screening renders the system even more opaque. The attorney, who spent two years working for the CIA, says the huge numbers involved mean the watchlists are not making us safer. \u201cIt increases the size of the haystack \u2013 if there is a needle in there it is so much harder to find \u2026 it immeasurably increases the white noise.\u201d   Related: The 'No Fly List' operates in secret, and its power to exclude is vast | Jeffrey Kahn    For cases of mistaken identity, there is a redress system. Cair says even this is wrapped in secrecy and the only way to find out if you have been successful is by flying again. Campaigners say few Muslims are willing to complain officially about their treatment at airports. The stigma of being accused of being a terrorist, even if the accusations are unwarranted, can be enough to silence many. Others fear a backlash from the authorities. Handeyside says those who easily dismiss such experiences don\u2019t always realise the toll it can take. \u201cWe can\u2019t underestimate how stigmatising and unpleasant it is to have to go through this every single time \u2013 to have everyone looking at you and thinking you are a terrorist.\u201d Imam Ajmal Masroor, was so incensed by his own treatment at an airport that he set up a website to collate other people\u2019s stories. Having travelling to and from the States several times in 2015, he was stopped by US Embassy officials at the airport in December and abruptly told his business visa had been revoked. Masroor, 44, who says he has received death threats for speaking out against terrorism in the past, explains he was eventually told the problem was someone on his Facebook page, \u201cbut I have 30,000 followers so I don\u2019t know who that is\u201d. And despite a letter from the State Department saying the revocation was an error, he says visits to the US embassy have not rectified the situation. One politician trying to discover the scale of the problem is the MP Stella Creasy. She has been asking questions about US Homeland Security issues after a family of 11 from her Walthamstow constituency were stopped at the airport as they made their way to Disneyland. The family lost $13,340 by missing their flights, which they were told would not be refunded. The trauma is, of course, impossible to quantify. \u201cTheir Esta visa was revoked. The kids were crying. They had to give back everything they had bought from duty free \u2013 it was horrible. Why not tell them before they get to the airport?\u201d     \u2018Allow extra time to clear security.\u2019 Illustration: Son of Alan/Folio    When she heard similar stories from other constituents she asked questions in parliament, but was told no figures about how many UK citizens are barred from visiting the US are kept. While UK authorities publish stop-and-search data, broken down by ethnicity, the US is less transparent. \u201cThere is confirmation that Homeland Security officials are working out of Manchester, Gatwick and Heathrow airports, but under what auspices is unclear,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we have the data, we can either allay fears or do something about it. But the government doesn\u2019t know, and that should worry us.\u201d Now she is hoping to launch a legal case challenging the government over the lack of figuresm, insisting it is a failure of their public sector equality duty. \u201cNo one is suggesting that there should not be checks. It\u2019s the lack of information and scrutiny that is the problem.\u201d A US embassy spokesperson stressed that religion, faith, or spiritual beliefs were not determining factors about admissibility into the US. US Customs and Border Protection confirmed it did not disclose the percentage of travellers selected for secondary inspection or breakdown their figures by ethnicity. However, a spokesperson said the numbers were \u201calmost insignificant\u201d compared with the volume of travellers arriving from the UK every day.     SNP MSP Humza Yousaf with party leader Nicola Sturgeon Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA    While the UK may keep figures for stop and searches at airports, that doesn\u2019t mean there are no problems. In 2012 Glasgow airport faced a boycott from Muslim passengers, who said they were fed up with being harassed by counter-terrorism officers. A year earlier, the Scottish MSP Humza Yousaf revealed he had been been stopped under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. It wasn\u2019t the first time he was stopped. Under the original legislation of this stop-and-search law act, anyone entering or leaving the UK could be held for up to nine hours with no grounds for suspicion needed. At its peak in 2009/10, 85,000 travellers a year were stopped and ethnic minorities were 42 times more likely to be stopped than white passengers. Yousaf said his frequent stops illustrated that they were based on skin colour, not intelligence information. In 2014, after strong criticism, there was a change in the law referring to schedule 7 stops. The presence of a solicitor was required and the maximum detention time was reduced to six hours. It led to a dramatic drop in those stopped. The latest available data shows a considerably lower number \u2013 in 2015, a fall of 21% on the previous year. David Anderson, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, says this, in part, is down to an increased focus on data and behavioural analysis and a \u201creduced reliance on intuitive stops\u201d. Anderson does not believe the statistics show schedule 7 powers are being used in a racially discriminatory manner, although he acknowledges the stops cause \u201cconsiderable irritation for travellers of all ethnicities\u201d while \u201carrest rates remain very low indeed by the standards of stop and search\u201d. Five supreme court judges reviewed his analysis and while four agreed, one believed \u201cschedule 7 not only permits direct discrimination; it is entirely at odds with the notion of an enlightened pluralistic society\u201d.     \u2018Text with care.\u2019 Illustration: Son of Alan/Folio    This year, the government published new guidance pointing out that the decision to stop someone should not be arbitrary, and ethnicity and religion should only be considered significant in association with \u201cfactors which show a connection with the threat from terrorism\u201d. According to analysis of the 2015 figures by Faith Matters, a community-cohesion organisation, \u201cnon-whites are at least 37 times as likely as a white person to be detained at a port or airport. Asians are almost 80 times as likely as a white person to be detained at an airport or port.\u201d Along with anecdotal evidence, this, they say, shows a \u201csignificant level of profiling that demands urgent action to ensure that British citizens and non-UK nationals visiting Britain are treated equally.\u201d Stefano Bonino, a criminologist at Northumbria University recently, interviewed 39 Scottish Muslims. He found while most had positive stories of \u201crelative local harmony\u201d, his interviewees\u2019 experience of airports created real feelings of alienation, social inequality, \u201canger and humiliation\u201d. Philip Baum, author of Violence in the Skies, says racial profiling is unhelpful, but says there should be more behavioural analysis at airports than we have currently. \u201cEven if an attack is being carried out under Isis or al-Qaeda that doesn\u2019t mean it will be someone carrying it out who \u2018looks\u2019 Muslim. The classic case was the Anne Marie Murphy case in 1986, who was stopped from boarding a flight to Tel Aviv \u2013 of 1986. She was white, female and pregnant \u2013 not a stereotypical image of a terrorist.\u201d Murphy was found to be unwittingly carrying explosives in her luggage \u2013 placed there by her Jordanian fianc\u00e9, Nezar Hindawi, who was jailed for 45 years. Baum suggests that the widespread belief that Muslims will be targeted could in turn change their behaviour. \u201cThere is a lot of paranoia and sometimes people can be affected by that \u2013 they act suspiciously because they think they will be picked on.\u201d While the fear of terrorism at airports means that many people are willing to put up with more intrusive security procedures, the discriminatory experiences at airports that many Muslims recount risks creating divisions and resentment. For Bonino the consequences are clear. \u201cGrievance based jihadi propaganda can use things like this. When you want Muslims to work with the authorities to counter violent extremism on the ground, it\u2019s not helpful for people to think they are targeted by the authorities themselves.\u201d Know your rights The Council of American Islamic Relations guide to your rights \u2022 A customs agent has the right to stop, detain and search every person and item. \u2022 Screeners have the authority to conduct a further search of you or your bags. \u2022 A pilot has the right to refuse to fly a passenger they believe is a threat to the safety of the flight.

Carter officials were infuriated by Kissinger\u2019s attendance at the 1978 World Cup in Argentina as the personal guest of dictator Jorge Videla, the general who oversaw the forced disappearance of up to 30,000 opponents of the military regime. At the time, Kissinger was no longer in office after Carter defeated Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential election, but the documents reveal that US diplomats feared his praise for Argentina\u2019s crackdown would encourage further bloodshed. During his years as secretary of state, Kissinger had encouraged Argentina\u2019s military junta to stamp out \u201cterrorism\u201d. In contrast, Carter and Zbigniew Brzezinski, his national security adviser, made human rights a cornerstone of US foreign policy and were exerting pressure on Argentina\u2019s military regime by withholding loans and sales of military equipment. The newly declassifed cables show how Kissinger lauded Videla and other officials for their methods during his 1978 visit. \u201cHis praise for the Argentine government in its campaign against terrorism was the music the Argentine government was longing to hear,\u201d says one of the documents.

Photograph: Handout    Another diplomatic cable describes how, during a lunch with Videla, \u201cKissinger applauded Argentina\u2019s efforts in combatting terrorism\u201d and lamented that \u201cit was unfortunate many Americans thought Argentina was a soft drink. He said this indicated that Americans are not aware of Argentine history nor of its struggle against terrorism.\u201d Kissinger even held a private meeting with Videla without the presence of the US ambassador to Buenos Aires, Ra\u00fal Castro, at which human rights and Carter\u2019s foreign policy were discussed. \u201cVidela prearranged it so Kissinger and the interpreter would meet with him privately half an hour before ambassador\u2019s arrival,\u201d one cable shows. In another off-the-record meeting with the Argentinian Council of International Relations (CARI) \u2013 a group of conservative and highly influential Argentinian diplomats \u2013 Kissinger went even further, stating that \u201cin his opinion the government of Argentina had done an outstanding job in wiping out terrorist forces\u201d. US ambassador Castro was shocked by Kissinger\u2019s behaviour. \u201cMy only concern is that Kissinger\u2019s repeated high praise for Argentina\u2019s action in wiping out terrorism ... may have gone to some considerable extent to his hosts\u2019 heads,\u201d the ambassador said in a lengthy cable to Washington. \u201cThere is some danger that Argentines may use Kissinger\u2019s laudatory statements as justification for hardening their human rights stance.\u201d     A memorandum from US ambassador Castro. Photograph: Handout    Officials in Washington were furious. \u201c[Kissinger\u2019s] praise for the Argentine government in its campaign against terrorism was the music the Argentine government was longing to hear,\u201d National Security Council official Robert Pastor wrote in a summary of Kissinger\u2019s visit for Brzezinski. \u201cWhat concerns me is his apparent desire to speak out against the Carter administration\u2019s human rights policy,\u201d Pastor fumed. The newly released documents show that at one stage the Carter administration considered asking Pope John Paul II to intervene with Argentina\u2019s military rulers. A lengthy September 1980 cable marked \u201cconfidential\u201d said that \u201cthe Church and the Pope have far more influence here than the US government and can be the most effective advocates of a full return to the rule of law\u201d. The cable \u2013 to US officials in Rome \u2013 says that \u201cthe Vatican may be the most effective advocate\u201d before the Argentinian authorities, for whom \u201cdisappearance is still the standard tactic\u201d. The documents do not reveal if US diplomats did approach the Vatican, and the exact role of the Catholic church during those dark years remains an issue of debate: many reports indicate that priests were present during torture sessions. It was not until 2000 that the Argentinian Catholic church finally apologized for turning a blind eye to the repression.   Related: How an Argentinian man learned his 'father' may have killed his real parents    The cables also give a frightening picture of the delusional antisemitism prevalent among Argentina\u2019s generals, who were convinced that Brzezinski (a Polish-born Catholic) headed a worldwide Jewish conspiracy against Argentina. To fight against this perceived conspiracy, the regime kidnapped the successful Jewish newspaper publisher Jacobo Timerman. Thanks largely to strong pressure from the Carter administration, Timerman was finally freed, although he was stripped of his Argentinian citizenship and expelled to Israel, where he spoke to US diplomats about the torture he had endured. \u201cTimerman said that the main focus of questioning during his imprisonment was his role as the Argentine \u2018leader\u2019 of an alleged world Zionist conspiracy,\u201d states a declassified cable from the US embassy in Tel Aviv. Another report from Pastor to Brzezinski \u2013 headed \u201cYou don\u2019t look Jewish\u201d \u2013 relates incredulously how Timerman told US diplomats that \u201cmuch of the Argentine military believe that a world-wide Jewish conspiracy is at the heart of the terrorist problem in Argentina, and that you (Brzezinski) are at the head of that conspiracy\u201d. When Timerman pointed out to his captors that Brzezinski was Catholic, they told him it was simply a ruse, Pastor wrote. \u201cThey \u2018know\u2019 you are Jewish because they studied the New York City phone book and found that a number of \u2018Brzezinskis\u2019 had Jewish first names!\u201d he wrote.

The Moyes mantra is all about stability and \u201cthe long haul\u201d but there was a moment during his first full day in charge when he feared the worst. Sunderland were flying from Newcastle to Geneva en route to a pre-season training camp at Evian in eastern France late last month when their chartered aircraft developed a fault. \u201cIt sounded like we were going over a cattle grid in the sky,\u201d said Moyes. \u201cI thought: \u2018Here we go.\u2019 As a new manager you want things to be smooth on your first day but this was frightening. I wouldn\u2019t laugh it off. The crew said they\u2019d had to shut one engine down and we needed to make an emergency landing at Manchester. It was scary and it seemed to take ages and ages to get down. My first day in charge and I was looking for my parachute.\u201d   Sunderland's recent finishes   The former Preston, Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad manager can only hope the incident does not serve as a portent for his time on Wearside, but readily concedes he is confronting \u201ca monstrous challenge\u201d. Sam Allardyce, newly departed to coach England, performed a minor miracle in keeping Sunderland in the Premier League last season and Moyes knows he must break the cycle of repeated seat-of-the-pants escapes from the Championship. \u201cOtherwise we will fall off the cliff,\u201d he has said. A good start would help, with the man dubbed the \u201cMoyes-siah\u201d by Sunderland fans keen to eradicate the team\u2019s habit of failing to win a league game during August. Registering such a victory in the season\u2019s opening month is something they have neglected to do for the past five years and partly explains why so many managers have come unstuck at the Stadium of Light. Moyes hopes to use Everton \u2013 a club he slowly but surely rebuilt over 11 years \u2013 as his template for breathing new life into Sunderland but first he needs to sign some players. And fast. \u201cWe need competition for places,\u201d he has warned. \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t have that.\u201d He can only pray that Everton\u2019s concerted pursuit of Lamine Kon\u00e9 \u2013 excellent at centre-half since arriving from L\u2019Orient last January \u2013 proves forlorn. The hiatus provoked by the Football Assocation\u2019s slow pursuit of Allardyce created a transfer limbo on Wearside. By the time Moyes was installed Martin Bain, the new chief executive hired from Maccabi Tel Aviv as Margaret Byrne\u2019s successor, was still to preside over his first signing. He has since overseen the recruitment of Papy Djilobodji, a Senegal centre-half, for \u00a38m from Chelsea, where he failed to make an impact before being loaned to Werder Bremen for the second half of last season, but several more faces are required.   Sunderland record last season   At least Bain has been rather more successful when it comes to offloading dead wood, with Steven Fletcher, Ola Toivonen, Adam Matthews, Emmanuel Giaccherini (although many Sunderland fans felt the Italy international should have been given another chance), Wes Brown, Santiago Vergini, Danny Graham and Will Buckley either sold, released or moved on. Sunderland have bought badly in recent years, signing a bewildering amount of often ineffective players. Allardyce promised to change that narrative and now Moyes, who would ideally prefer to buy British, must take up the baton. With the midfielder Yann M\u2019Vila \u2013 admired by the Scot \u2013 and the right-back DeAndre Yedlin having returned to Rubin Kazan and Tottenham respectively following season-long loans, Moyes\u2019s squad is weaker than the Allardyce ensemble which finished narrowly ahead of Newcastle United in the race to avoid relegation.   Related: David Moyes: if I have to win ugly I'll do it \u2026 then improve the ugly bit    Tellingly, the latter had been disappointed by the apparent skinniness of his Wearside transfer budget. It made for a certain frostiness and it seemed indicative when the Sunderland statement confirming Allardyce\u2019s departure did not wish the outgoing manager luck with England or thank him for rescuing them last season. Perhaps that omission emphasises just how badly Big Sam\u2019s relationship with Ellis Short, the owner, had deteriorated. Short has poured tens of million of pounds into the club \u2013 often on underachieving players \u2013 in the near decade since buying Sunderland. Unfortunately all that this generosity has yielded is a series of balance sheets revealing such heavy losses that Moyes\u2019s spending will need to be fairly circumspect. So far, so gloomy but, strangely enough, the portents arguably seem rather better for this owner/manager relationship than any other in the Short era. After all the American financier made several forlorn attempts to recruit Moyes before finally getting his man. For his part, Moyes says Short reminds him of Everton\u2019s Bill Kenwright and is confident they can forge a similar bond. Given Sunderland\u2019s magnificently appointed stadium, state of the art training ground and regular 45,000-plus crowds the manager believes the potential is even greater than at Goodison. The 53-year-old is similarly confident he can debunk the theories harboured by certain predecessors \u2013 most notably Gus Poyet \u2013 that top players are reluctant to live in this corner of England. Moyes believes the problem of attracting people to Sunderland has nothing to do with geography \u2013 and, contrary to much received wisdom, the north-east of England really is a fantastic place to live \u2013 but the recent chronic instability of the region\u2019s football clubs.     David Moyes takes the reins at Sunderland. Photograph: Scott Heppell/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cPeople want to come and play for good teams \u2013 they want to play for coaches they trust,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t want clubs to be changing managers every six months. Stable clubs attract better players. If we can achieve stability at Sunderland I\u2019m sure good players will want to come here.\u201d Allardyce signed three excellent professionals in the anchoring midfielder Jan Kirchoff, Kon\u00e9 and the winger Wahbi Khazri last January and those three promise to be cornerstones of the side once more, provided Kon\u00e9 stays. So, too, does Jermain Defoe and Moyes can only trust that the former England striker continues defying the advancing years as he keeps dodging defenders. Although Defoe devoted the latter half of last season to proving that he can, contrary to popular opinion, most definitely operate as a lone striker he needs support. Moyes knows the signing of at least one more striker is imperative if Sunderland are to survive let along prosper. He could also do with Jack Rodwell finally showing some of the promise he displayed when, mentored by Moyes, the young midfielder or centre-half burst into Everton\u2019s first team as a 16-year-old. Sunderland\u2019s manager has challenged Rodwell to \u201cstep up to the plate\u201d and promised \u201cto whip Jack harder than any other player, because I know what he\u2019s capable of\u201d. Rodwell\u2019s career has been mainly about woeful underachievement since he arrived from Manchester City for \u00a310m. His reunion with Moyes and its repercussions promise to serve as an intriguing subplot. If it helps the Scot\u2019s cause that some promising youngsters finally look to be on the point of emerging from Sunderland\u2019s academy \u2013 and Moyes is particularly excited by the 17-year-old Swedish attacker Joel Asoro \u2013 Sunderland\u2019s senior players are delighted their manager is happy to keep Robbie Stockdale as first-team coach.   Related: Papy Djilobodji joins Sunderland for \u00a38m as David Moyes makes first move    The former Middlesbrough defender was plucked from the academy by Allardyce, who believes Stockdale possesses the potential to become \u201ca real star\u201d, and promoted to his present position where the 36-year-old swiftly impressed Defoe and friends. If Stockdale\u2019s career trajectory is firmly in the ascendant, Moyes could be seen as having taken a step down following recent setbacks at Manchester United \u2013 where, sacked after 10 months he believes he was treated \u201cunfairly\u201d \u2013 and Sociedad. Although Moyes\u2019s struggles to learn Spanish hardly enhanced his chances in that latter posting, Wearside looks to be very much his natural habitat. Sunderland has been home to far too many \u201cfire-fighter\u201d managers knee-jerking from one short-term fix to another in recent years but Moyes trusts this will be the season he is allowed to start to build a long-term legacy. \u201cWe need to change from just bobbing along at the bottom of the league,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t always just buy players just to stay up. We have to bring in players for the longer term who will maybe take six months to make an impact but are right for our journey.

It is only the occasional signal to his colleagues that confirms Kutiman is the diminutive figure shielded behind a bank of keyboards to the right.

Kutiman \u2013 born Ophir Kutiel, or Kuti to his friends \u2013 has never hogged the spotlight. Though he retains a room in the country\u2019s capital, three years ago he moved to a kibbutz a 40-minute drive inland from Sderot, the town nearest to today\u2019s concert. \u201cI was feeling that I\u2019m choking in the city,\u201d he explains. \u201cI always wanted to live in nature, with calm, nice people.

We love you! Let\u2019s do a selfie!\u2019, that\u2019s where it becomes weird. It\u2019s really easy to become a celebrity in Israel. You just go to a few right places, and you go to this TV show, and that\u2019s terrible for me. I just want to go to the supermarket and be nobody. I really hope it\u2019s just a buzz.\u201d Kutiman is best known for his Thru You projects, in which he painstakingly edits together snippets of YouTube performances by amateur solo musicians to create new songs. The first series won him a place in Time magazine\u2019s list of The Fifty Best Inventions of 2009 \u2013 \u201cnext to a missile and some Aids cure,\u201d he laughs disbelievingly \u2013 but his only appearance in the series was in a dimly lit webcam video. A second \u201cofficial\u201d album, 6am, is out now, as is a heart-warming documentary, Presenting Princess Shaw, which follows an aspiring, unsigned New Orleans vocalist, Samantha Montgomery after she was secretly selected to front one of Kutiman\u2019s productions for 2014\u2019s ThruYou Too.   Related: Kutiman: 6am review \u2013 a scuzzy desert epic    Thru You Too\u2019s track Give It Up \u2013 its melody originally written and performed a cappella \u2013 matched Montgomery\u2019s gritty, soulful voice (and the accompanying phone camera footage) to an arrangement featuring a youthful saxophonist, a balding guitarist, a bespectacled drummer, and a six-year-old pianist (Alma Deutscher, now recognised as a child prodigy). None was formally alerted to their involvement, but Kutiman spurned YouTube\u2019s monetisation service, and each was credited via the original link. When the web spread the news \u2013 MySpace led to Kutiman\u2019s first 2006 album \u2013 no one objected, and the track went viral. The documentary has now received more than 2.7m hits, and one of the film\u2019s most unforgettable, moments captures Montgomery\u2019s joyous reaction when she first hears it. Recently, Kutiman reluctantly joined Montgomery to attend international screenings, and they have also collaborated on new songs, but the producer\u2019s biggest concern remains his prospective loss of privacy. Depicted (not entirely accurately) as a lonely, enigmatic presence throughout the film \u2013 eating alone in the kibbutz\u2019s dining hall, partially hidden behind a screen as Montgomery bathes in the film\u2019s climactic applause \u2013 he is now potentially a victim of its success. Kutiman was born in Jerusalem in 1982, but after a brief spell in Haifa, moved aged six to the quiet community of Zichron Yaacov, where his parents worked as professors. \u201cThey don\u2019t know who Bob Marley is,\u201d he jokes, so he discovered music through a piano-owning neighbour who offered lessons, though he quit after a few years. At 12, his horizons broadened when his parents took a sabbatical in Canada.         Kutiman-Thru-you - 01 - Mother of All Funk Chords    \u201cI went to a public school, and they had this amazing music room, and you had to play an instrument. I chose saxophone. Then I think music started kicking in again, and in after-hours I wanted to play the drums. This reminded me that I know how to play piano a little, and then piano wasn\u2019t cool enough. Guitar was cool. So I taught myself guitar.\u201d In his late teens, Kutiman relocated to Tel Aviv to study jazz at Rimon music college (\u201cthe Israeli Berklee\u201d), but it was a convenience store job that provided his greatest epiphany. \u201cThere was this college radio there, and it played trip-hop and jungle and stuff. I remember Amon Tobin, DJ Shadow, R2D2, Massive Attack \u2026 I was blown away. I couldn\u2019t understand what I was listening to.\u201d Soon he was performing in a jam band, Ani Kuku \u2013 Hebrew for \u201cI\u2019m nuts\u201d \u2013 and friendship with another musician and producer, Sabbo, led him to work with a local star, Haim Laroz. \u201cHe was God for me,\u201d Kutiman declares. When Laroz encouraged the two to visit Jamaica, they took his advice. The trip proved uncomfortably eye-opening. \u201cWe thought we were going to land and someone was going to bring us a spliff,\u201d Kutiman says, \u201cbut we found ourselves on a farm with just a laptop.\u201d   Related: Fela Kuti \u2013 10 of the best    Nonetheless, Kutiman says, \u201cIt really made me. The guy that came from Jamaica and the guy who went to Jamaica is not the same guy.\u201d A meeting with Stephen and Damien Marley may have coloured his perspective, but it was the working methods he developed that really shaped his future: lacking a single instrument, he and Sabbo began cutting and pasting their old recordings. The technique not only gave birth to the Thru You projects, but also to his own, albeit limited, Kutiman releases, on which the multi-instrumentalist loops his own performances, building tracks up before inviting string players and singers to add the final touches. The results are further indebted to a box of albums Sabbo once gave him. \u201cEvery one was a masterpiece,\u201d Kutiman grins. \u201cI take out a CD: \u2018Par-lia-ment! Looks cool!\u2019 I take out another: Lonnie Liston Smith, Jimmy Smith \u2026 All the good music of the world that I wasn\u2019t aware of!\u201d Arguably the most significant records were by Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti \u2013 a massive influence on last year\u2019s Space Cassava EP \u2013 and David Axelrod, the 60s producer beloved of DJ Shadow whose production style shapes Kutiman\u2019s two albums. On the exhilarating 6am, he creates a modern amalgam of African flavoured psychedelic rock that nods historically to exotica, soul, breakbeat and jazz while recalling the diverse likes of contemporaries such as Cinematic Orchestra, Air and Antibalas. As bats emerge from beneath his home\u2019s eaves, zipping into the darkness beyond his porch, Kutiman considers the possibility that his new album might jeopardise his quiet life. In contrast to many of the YouTubers in whose work he regularly immerses himself, he remains circumspect. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that,\u201d he laughs humbly. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, it\u2019s psychedelic, but how big can it get? I just want to enjoy playing with my friends.

She had chilling memories of how she and her fellow Jewish classmates had to give the Nazi salute to the F\u00fchrer\u2019s portrait and listen to antisemitic songs. Her parents, Albert Rosenberg and Kaethe Ehrenstein, split up when she was young. In order to find a place of safety, Kaethe took her mother and daughter to Palestine, then under the British mandate. Pat was only 12, but she was soon helping her mother run a boarding house in Tel Aviv. Albert, a British citizen, had managed to escape from Germany too. A metallurgist, he worked in munitions in Oxford during the second world war and later ran a hotel in Knaresborough, North Yorkshire. Pat joined the British Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) in the early 1940s and served in Cairo, where she met Glasgow-born Lieutenant Hugh McCubbin. Romance blossomed as he serenaded her on the banks of the Nile. They were married in 1946 and the wedding reception was held at her father\u2019s hotel. The couple had three sons, Norman, Richard and me. In 1958 the family moved to Africa, where Hugh became finance director with the Kenya Farmers\u2019 Association. Then he took up a post with the UN\u2019s World Food Programme, settling first in Lesotho and then Taiwan, where Hugh died, aged only 60. Widowed relatively young after such a happy marriage, Pat had to rebuild her life. She moved, with Kaethe, to Oxford, where Norman and Richard were at university. There she devoted herself to family life. Everyone loved her warmth, her hospitality, her sage advice, her humour and her celebrated apple cake.

The Blizzard is a quarterly football journal available from www.theblizzard.co.uk on a pay-what-you-like basis in print and digital formats. On 28 December 2015 I watched the game between Hapoel Beer Sheva, my team, and Hapoel Raanana at the Turner Stadium in Beersheba, in the south of Israel. After 90 minutes I knew three things: this was my favourite place in Israel, that Hapoel Beer Sheva could win the title after 40 years and that my mother, Yael Adar, wouldn\u2019t be alive by then. Talk about the best of times, the worst of times. For me, Beersheba born and bred, although I\u2019ve lived in the UK for the last 16 years, it was the fulfilment of a dream. Turner has replaced the old Wasermil Stadium after 50 years of suffering. Wasermil was a clutter of low cement stands, far away from the pitch and, near the halfway line where the best seats would usually be, two gaping holes. Four huge pylons stood in the middle of the stands, giving the look and feel of a refugee camp, and made Wasermil the worst stadium in Israel\u2019s top league. Spread over a huge area, it took more time to walk around it than the Emirates Stadium (I should know \u2013 I had to run around it in high school), but with a capacity of only 14,000, was a block to the club\u2019s growth.   Related: The footballer trapped in 'The House of the Beautiful Sleeping Athlete'    Turner Stadium is located at the edge of town, looking north to the Negev Desert. It is a jewel box of a 16,000-seat stadium, inspired by Vitesse Arnhem\u2019s GelreDome. It was inaugurated at the second home game of the season and after that became a bastion. \u201cIt is something special,\u201d Doron, my twin brother, a season-ticket holder along with his son, told me. \u201cFor the first time since you left, you are missing something great here.\u201d He wasn\u2019t exaggerating. Turner is a compact and intimate stadium with the feel of a tight arena, perfect sightlines and, for the first time in Israel, a proper kop at the south end. Full for every game with fans wearing red, it was a bit of a shock for me. The difference from the old to the new stadium, from the worst to the best, from a stadium that drove fans away to one that instantly became a home couldn\u2019t have been greater. I was supposed to visit it for the first time on my usual winter trip to Israel, but rushed home earlier when my mother fell ill and had to undergo brain surgery. When I visited her, recovering in the local hospital later, she knew that we had won. The medical staff in the operating theatre spoke about the game as they were making the final preparations. That\u2019s how it works here. The mayor is an ex-player, his driver also used to play for the team and a previous mayor had a son playing for the club. Hapoel Beer Sheva is a club that has a city and an entire region behind it and after 40 years it has risen from the dust.     Unloved home: Hapoel Beer Sheva\u2019s former ground, the Wasermil Stadium, which they left behind the for the new Turner Stadium in 2015. \u2018We moved from the worst stadium to the best.\u2019 Photograph: EuroFootball/Getty Images    Hapoel Beer Sheva won successive championships in 1975 and 1976, won the cup in 1997 and since then they have been mismanaged, relegated twice, avoiding a third drop only on the last day of the season in 2012 and 2013. In 2014 and 2015 the club improved dramatically and gave Maccabi Tel Aviv, the champions for the previous three years, a run for their huge money before fizzling out in the latter stages of the season, finishing second and third. This season the challenge was more substantial. The squad was better and deeper, the new manager, Barak Bachar, a promising choice and the stadium a fortress. The turning point was in the summer of 2007 when Alona Barkat became the first woman to own and run a football club in Israel. The club was then playing in the second tier and owned by a local businessman. Crumbling under debts and poor results, and with the fans increasingly bitter, Beer Sheva were facing disaster. Barkat, the wife of a wealthy high-tech entrepreneur, injected money, made almost every possible mistake at first but learned from each and every one of them. The organisation has improved year after year but results were poor until the summer of 2014 when Elyaniv Barda came home. I met the forward in November 2008 for an interview. In one season, he had become the heart and soul of Racing Genk. He later led them to cup and championship success in Belgium but even then he told me that he was planning to come back to Beer Sheva for one final season. \u201cIt\u2019s my club,\u201d he said. Three seasons ago he returned and asked for a championship bonus clause in his contract. Barkat laughed but eventually agreed. When Barda signed, other Israeli stars followed. The psychological barrier was smashed. Beersheba is only 100km from Tel Aviv but in the national psyche it is light years away. It is the major city of a neglected region with a poor image. It always reminded me of the joke about Texas from the movie True Stories when God take a rest just after creating the Negev and Beersheba. A day later he takes a look at the desert, the dust, the ugly town and the unbearable heat and in his wisdom sees it will be much easier to create people who would love this place instead of making it beautiful. Barkat turned out to be one of those people despite living in the smartest neighbourhood in Tel Aviv and putting money and endless energy into the club. With her money, Barda\u2019s leadership and Turner\u2019s appeal, Hapoel Beer Sheva could build a squad to rival Maccabi Tel Aviv at last, despite having a budget that was less than half that of the champions. All four foreign players turned out to be outstanding, a large squad help to overcome many injuries and Bachar grew quickly into his role. The problem was Eran Zahavi, Maccabi\u2019s talisman. With a record-breaking 35 goals in 36 games, it took something special to win the league.     Hapoel Beer Sheva\u2019s young coach Barak Bachar has led them to not only a first title in 40 years but now within touching distance of the group stages of the Champions League. Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPA    They started slowly and after five games the team had only seven points but Bachar, only 36, did what would become the trademark of the club and learned on the hoof. He understood that the key was a strong midfield, usually with three players led by the excellent Nigerian John Ogu, with rotation but also a clear hierarchy. Once he found that balance, Beer Sheva became the best team in Israel. They didn\u2019t play free-scoring football but controlled and thoughtful football. Beer Sheva looked like a team that knew what it wanted to do. On 21 December they beat Maccabi in Tel Aviv to lead the table by three points. Three days earlier I had got the news about my mother. Although she was in her 80s, she was active, still drove and was a pillar of her community in the little village outside Beersheba. But a brain tumour meant she had only two months left to live. In those two months I went back and forth from London to Beersheba, stayed with her and my two brothers and went to games. I don\u2019t recall much more than that. In the time between the first alert and the end, Hapoel Beer Sheva opened a lead of five points. We went to a game in the last week of her life, a traumatic and frightening week, the longest of my life, and enjoyed another win, but we were afraid we were going to get a call during it. My twin brother, who took the burden of it with my older brother, had to go to Beersheba almost every other day. The biggest medical supply charity was on the road to Turner and every time he stopped there he would walk to the open gates and look at the stadium. Turner and Hapoel Beer Sheva were our morphine.     Talisman: Hapoel Beer Sheva forward Elyaniv Barda returned to the club from Belgian side Genk and was instrumental in their title success. Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images    Standing there in the stadium celebrating another goal and win, hands over mouths and trying not to cry, it brought a sense of proportion to football. By that I mean that football is a proportion-free zone. I knew what was coming soon. The pain and loss were too profound for words but during the games, I was like any other fan, maybe just more emotional. Each victory was the whole world and actually more important than ever. Beersheba wasn\u2019t a great place to live back then but we had our family home and team. My parents weren\u2019t fans but they knew how much we cared about Hapoel (and it was also the best way to get me out of the house). For many years I came back only to see my parents, but from now on, it will be only to see my team. Every time I picked up a ticket to a home game from the office near the old town it was just opposite the home where I grew up. Next season \u201ca home game\u201d will have an added meaning. To make things even more confusing there was the Leicester story in England. I lived there during my first year in the UK and had a season ticket to Filbert Street. Foolishly I didn\u2019t become a fan but still I still have friends who get excited at every game and Leicester\u2019s story meant to me more than to other non-fans. Relatively speaking, Beer Sheva are much bigger than Leicester City, but we were also an underdog, with a great team spirit and excellent scouting. I was at the King Power Stadium when the Foxes beat Liverpool with that Jamie Vardy goal and kept thinking, \u201cIt could happen to us\u201d \u2013 until I got a text message from my brother telling me to get ready for the end after another drastic deterioration in my mother\u2019s condition. On 25 February 2016 my mother passed away at home.   Related: Claus Lundekvam: I was threatening people with a huge kitchen knife | Lars Sivertsen    I lost my sense of taste. Every now and again something tasted powerful and wonderful, although the next day it would taste like water again. Normal life resumed fast but also seemed tasteless apart from our championship run. The team went on a phenomenal run of 17 wins and two draws in 19 games after the fifth game of the season. In a normal season it would have been enough to build a healthy gap but Maccabi Tel Aviv kept the gap at five points. The tension bred a folk campaign called Ama Yaamik. It is an expression in Iraqi that means \u201cmay you go blind\u201d and is used to ward off the evil eye or bad luck. At its core was a primitive and annoying superstition that held that every positive word said about us was intended to hurt the run. For most of the fans it was a way to ease the tension so every victory was greeted with a rendition of, \u201cBeer Sheba won\u2019t get relegated.\u201d The mascot, a camel, had the number 55 on his back and the players\u2019 bus was number 555, as 5 and open palm are key ingredients of the Ama. I, an atheist, found myself unable to say, \u201cIf we win it\u2026\u201d without adding, \u201cAma Yaamik,\u201d immediately. Well, it worked, so why change? And then we got stuck. Injuries to two key players, Maor Melikson and Tony Nwakaeme, one game of too many tactical changes, another of mental block and four successive draws (one against Maccabi during the 10-game play-off between the top six teams) narrowed the gap to one point. In the 30th round of games, on 11 April, Maccabi hosted Beitar Jerusalem, their bogey team. On that day a beloved relative of mine passed away in London and I was in Bristol working on a piece for a travel magazine. It turned out to be the last issue of the magazine, my favourite publication. Maccabi beat Beitar with a 90th-minute goal by Zahavi. They went top by one point and had a superior goal difference. 2016 was turning out to be a horrible year. To add to my misery, many of my cultural heroes have gone, one after another. The biggest loss was Johan Cruyff, my first football hero and father of Jordi, Maccabi\u2019s sports director and the man behind their success. Little did I know this would have a huge impact on the title race in Israel. From then on, Jordi spent more time in Barcelona and Amsterdam, and things, as Zahavi put it later, became loose at Maccabi. They drew their next game and Beer Sheva went top again. It became clear after they won the cup semi-final against Bnei Sachnin, an Arab-Israeli side. The key talking point was Maccabi\u2019s goal, which came from a pass from Tal Ben Haim (not the ex-Bolton player) after Sachnin had kicked the ball out for a player to receive treatment. Ben Haim didn\u2019t give the ball back and Maccabi scored. After the game, Maccabi lacked a voice of reason. Of an adult, of Jordi. Maccabi and Peter Bosz, their dislikeable manager, refused to apologise or to try to calm things down. It was very short-sighted as Maccabi\u2019s next league game was in Sachnin. After 90 sulphurous minutes, the result was 0-0 to the joy of the local fans who chanted, \u201cBeer Sheva, Beer Sheva!\u201d In the mayhem after the game Predrag Rajkovic, Maccabi\u2019s young Serbian keeper, pushed the Sachnin manager to the ground. Maccabi players draped themselves in Israeli flags and Zahavi commented that he didn\u2019t know if he was in Israel or Palestine. It didn\u2019t go down well with the Sachnin players and fans. Not at all.

Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPA    Rajkovic was suspended for three games but, astonishingly, Maccabi went to a civil court in Tel Aviv that ordered another hearing to be held in June. Maccabi, the most privileged, best politically connected, richest and strongest club in Israel became loathed. While most of the media loved the little Beer Sheva narrative, Maccabi\u2019s fans in the media lost their heads. \u201cThey are miserable, sad people living in the desert \u2026 You want to paint their homes for charity, not to dismantle them on the pitch,\u201d wrote one. \u201cBeer Sheva are panicking and the root of it is the stupidity that engulfs the club,\u201d wrote another. Two games before the end of the 36-game season the size of our lead was five points. It felt like we had won it. The biblical phrase of \u201c40 years in the desert\u201d, recalling the wandering of the Israelites before they reached the Promised Land, was used again and again. We only needed two more points. The penultimate game was away against Maccabi Haifa, the only team not to lose to Beer Sheva this season. They maintained their record. Haifa won with the last kick of the game, 2-1, and Beer Sheva lost for the first time in 29 games. The gap was down to two points. It meant we had to win the last game. It was the second-longest week of my life. If we failed, having been so close, we would have been the laughing stock of the country, this team would be destroyed and I would never live it down. For the first time I felt like a defeat could damage me for life, that it could bring me down and drown me in my pain. To lose it at that stage would have meant that \u201cthey\u201d were right, that there was something wrong with us, that we were losers. It would mean not being proud of the club after a huge step forward, and it would unleash the negative forces among the fans. \u201cI felt the stress. I knew that it was a matter of life and death for some people,\u201d said Bachar. \u201cI knew that if we lost somebody would die, some people wouldn\u2019t be able to take it.\u201d It was a sleepless week and I stayed in London, feeling I couldn\u2019t handle another flight. I had a trip to Yorkshire that week but couldn\u2019t drive as I was too tense and tired. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die in an accident just a day before we win it,\u201d I said to my brother. \u201cYou should be positive and think that if you get killed and then we lose you won\u2019t have to suffer it,\u201d he told me. It was time to ditch the Ama and face destiny. The game was at home against Sachnin. Oh yeah. Karma is one feisty bitch. After a week of pressure from Maccabi and Sachnin\u2019s promises that they wouldn\u2019t make it easy, the game started in a frantic atmosphere. I was watching it during the FA Cup final at Wembley on my laptop. My brother, his whole family and 16,000 other fans watched it in a crimson red Turner. After six minutes and a brilliant move Sachnin scored. The fear, the horror. It couldn\u2019t be happening. Ten minutes later we scored. Sachnin had their alibi and from then on it was only a matter of time before we got our goals. Hapoel Beer Sheva won 3-1 and were crowned champions again after a 40-year wait. I would have been happy with a scrappy championship, any title after such a long time. To win it with good football, a respectable 83 points, as one of the best ever teams in Israel\u2019s history, with such a story, with Barda as our captain and knocking Maccabi off their \u201cfucking perch\u201d after a winter of despair meant that I knew that I would never feel anything like it again. It was the most important moment of my football life. That\u2019s why when a Wembley steward asked me why I was so happy, jumping and shouting such a long time after the game had ended. Had I won the lottery, he asked. I thought for a second and told myself, yes, it is a cliche, but fuck it, I earned it after 40 years and said: \u201cOh no. Much better than winning the lottery.\u201d It led to the most emotional celebration at the ground and through the week. 100,000 people came to the official party two days later. I was relieved and also happy for my nephew who started supporting the team when they were in the second division. I was not euphoric and I didn\u2019t cry as I thought I would. It was much deeper. For the first time in months the clouds over me disappeared and I was whole again. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was the season of darkness, it was the season of light.

It went beyond banter, and into the realm of top trolling.  Some bands, such as We Are Scientists, hold together what can only be described as a limited melodic appeal on a sturdy backbone of onstage quips that often take centre stage. Back in the year 10BB (before banter), husband and wife duo the Handsome Family used to counterbalance their dark, gothic country songs with sparky tales of domestic life.  But this does not mean we should expect top bantz from everyone. Nobody wants wisecracks from Anohni, when she\u2019s putting on a multimedia, performance art show about impending ecological doom. Epic, ethereal sets by Floating Points would probably not be improved with the occasional \u201cSo how does he smell? Bloody awful!\u201d thrown into the mix.

As they swapped business cards and exchanged small talk, the multicultural crowd was oblivious to the small group of protesters chanting and waving placards outside. Instead they were intent on laying the groundwork for their industry\u2019s premier international trade fair, which was starting the next day. The Farnborough International Airshow is a hugely popular event with the public. Featuring drones, celebrity guests, simulators and flypasts, it is considered a great day out for families. But behind the scenes Farnborough doubles as a giant trade show for the world\u2019s arms manufacturers. About 100,000 people working in the defence sector attend the event which is run by UKTI DSO, the government\u2019s arms exports promotional division, and which this year attracted 80 military delegations and was formally opened by David Cameron, then still prime minister. Among those sponsoring the fair was the US defence contractor Raytheon, which claims to be \u201cthe world\u2019s premier missile maker\u201d. Raytheon\u2019s factories in Essex and Scotland produce the Paveway IV guided bomb which, according to its manufacturer, has been \u201cput to the test in every major conflict\u201d and proved itself \u201ctime and again, as the weapon of choice by the end users\u201d. One enthusiastic end user is Saudi Arabia, now the UK defence sector\u2019s biggest customer, having agreed orders for \u00a33.5bn of military hardware since the start of 2015. Saudi Arabia\u2019s buying spree has been prompted, at least partially, by its intervention in neighbouring Yemen, where a coalition led by Riyadh is battling Houthi Shia rebels, backed by Iran, who have forced the country\u2019s president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, to flee. For months, evidence has been emerging from the rubble of Yemen that UK-manufactured weapons \u2013 including Paveway bombs \u2013 have been used in the campaign. At the start of this year investigators from Human Rights Watch attended the sites of two bombing targets and found evidence that UK-manufactured weaponry \u2013 in one case a bomb, in the other a laser guidance kit \u2013 had been deployed. The nature of the targets \u2013 a chamber of commerce and a warehouse \u2013 appear to corroborate claims that the Saudis are targeting civilian infrastructure, a breach of international human rights law. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that the Saudis have used these weapons in Yemen: Human Rights Watch has determined that they have been used unlawfully and that the weapons used in the strikes were UK-produced,\u201d said Kristine Beckerle of Human Rights Watch. The organisation has become so frustrated by the government\u2019s refusal to acknowledge how UK weapons are being deployed in Yemen that it is releasing a video highlighting the impact they are having on a conflict in which at least 6,000 people have died. However, in statements to parliament the Foreign Office has insisted that \u201cthe MOD assessment is that the Saudi-led coalition is not targeting civilians\u201d, and that \u201cthere has not been a breach of IHL [international humanitarian law] by the coalition\u201d. Saudi Arabia, too, denies claims that its military coalition is targeting civilian sites. But the denials from both camps are unravelling. On the final day of the last parliamentary session, Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood was forced to issue no fewer than six corrections to statements and answers given about the conflict. The Foreign Office, Ellwood conceded, had been \u201cunable to assess that there has been breach of IHL by the Saudi-led coalition\u201d. Having corrected its statements to parliament, the government is now under pressure to acknowledge that it has also misled the high court in relation to a case being brought against it by the pressure group Campaign Against Arms Trade, which accuses it of failing to ensure that arms exports to Saudi Arabia are not in breach of international humanitarian law. \u201cThe corrections are staggering,\u201d said Andrew Smith of the campaign. \u201cAt best the government has been extremely negligent and careless, and at worst it has acted to mislead parliament and the court. Either way it has serious questions to answer and must make clear what it will do to ensure this never happens again. The stakes could not be higher: UK fighter jets are flying over Yemen and people are dying from UK bombs.\u201d The Saudis, too, now admit mistakes. A commission set up by the kingdom has concluded that the coalition was guilty of \u201cmistakenly\u201d hitting a residential compound in the Red Sea port city of Mokha \u2013 an incident in which at least 65 civilians died. It also acknowledged that the coalition was responsible for airstrikes on a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders, which it claims was being used as a rebel hideout.     Smoke rises from a food factory in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, reportedly targeted by jets from Saudi-led coalition forces earlier this month. Photograph: Yahya Arhab/EPA    The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Tom Brake, said the UK needed to rethink its policy on Saudi arms exports. \u201cThere is such an overwhelming body of evidence that the Saudis have committed breaches of international humanitarian law in Yemen that the UK government can no longer rely on their rather weak reassurances, and should instead initiate their own review to confirm, in my view, that there have been breaches which would require them to stop arms sales to Saudi.\u201d But this would be a disaster for the British defence sector, where business is booming. Newly published official figures reveal that the UK won defence orders worth \u00a37.7bn last year. It now has about 12% of the global defence export market and, over the last decade, has shored up its position as the second largest arms exporter in the world. There is still much to play for. The government\u2019s own figures suggest that the global defence export market in 2015 was worth a fraction under $100bn, a 17% increase on 2014. As the market has expanded, successive governments have gone to extraordinary lengths to promote the sector. Tony Blair intervened to prevent an investigation into arms exports to Riyadh; Cameron assiduously courted Saudi royalty; earlier this year the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, led a UK delegation to Qatar to promote sales of the Eurofighter jet. The Middle East is considered by the government to be a priority market. Two-thirds of all arms exports go to the region. In the last two years the UK has agreed arms deals worth \u00a3388m with the United Arab Emirates, \u00a3170m with Qatar, \u00a3120m with Oman and \u00a324m with Bahrain. Other countries with questionable human rights records have also become major customers. In the last three years the UK has sold \u00a3450m of arms to Turkey, despite its increasing authoritarianism and political instability, and \u00a3116m of weaponry to Egypt, despite its recent coup and worsening human rights situation. It has also signed major contracts to supply missiles to Malaysia and Thailand. Brake suggested that the government\u2019s failure to monitor the impact UK weapons were having in Yemen undermined any assurances it could give that they were not being used elsewhere in breach of international human rights laws. \u201cIf similar breaches of IHL involving the use of UK arms in another theatre of conflict occurred, there is no reason to believe that the UK government would adopt a more proactive stance in relation to those breaches.\u201d A Foreign Office spokeswoman defended Britain\u2019s position. She said the UK had \u201cone of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world\u201d and could revoke licences quickly if circumstances changed, as had happened in the cases of Libya and Yemen. \u201cThe key test for our continued arms exports to Saudi Arabia in relation to international humanitarian law is whether there is a clear risk that those weapons might be used in a serious violation of IHL,\u201d she said. \u201cThe situation is kept under careful and continual review.\u201d But Smith questioned the government\u2019s assurances. \u201cThe arms trade could not function without the active support and participation of the UK government,\u201d he said. \u201cTime and again it has shown that it will stretch to any length, and sink to any low, in order to promote arms sales to some of the most repressive regimes in the world.\u201d KEY CLIENTS FOR UK ARMS IsraelThe UK licensed \u00a382m of arms to Israel while David Cameron was in office. The government acknowledged UK arms had \u201calmost certainly\u201d been used in bombarding Gaza in 2009, in a conflict that saw both sides accused of war crimes.     David Cameron presided over \u00a382m of arms sales to Israel. Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA    TurkeyIn the last three years the UK has licensed to Ankara almost \u00a3450m of arms, including components for military aircraft, helicopters and targeting equipment. In the past year the Turkish military has been engaged in a ferocious conflict with the country\u2019s Kurdish minority. EgyptSince the military coup in July 2013, the UK has licensed more than \u00a3115m of arms, including machine guns and assault rifles, as well as a \u00a340m licence for combat vehicles. In 2011, Cairo used UK-provided teargas against protesters. BahrainSince the Arab spring, the UK has licensed \u00a350m of arms, including hundreds of machine guns and thousands of assault rifles. Last February, Bahraini security forces were accused of quashing pro-democracy demonstrations using teargas and water cannon.

So when a model for a sci-fi looking \u201cstraddling bus\u201d capable of gliding over traffic was unveiled in China in May (six years after first being mooted), we can safely say that the hopes of city commuters were, no pun intended, raised. In the case of the so-called Transit Explore Bus (TEB), however, it seems that potential delays are the least of its troubles. Just one week after a \u201croad test\u201d of the futuristic bus \u2013 which, in the words of the Shanghaiist, proved: \u201cThey built it. They actually built it\u201d \u2013 reports have emerged in the Chinese media suggesting that not only is the bus\u2019s current manifestation completely unfeasible, but that TEB might even be some kind of elaborate Ponzi scheme. Such allegations have been indignantly refuted by the inventor Song Youzhou, who told the website Sixth Tone: \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything wrong at all. The latest tests show that the bus design is entirely possible.\u201d But leaving such murkier allegations aside, the ever-growing list of technical criticisms levelled at the project might seem enough to make Song and his team give up on their radical bus-on-stilts dream. Detailed most comprehensively by Wired, these include the fact that that the TEB has a ground clearance of just 2.1 metres, meaning only small vehicles will be able to drive under it. It\u2019s also unclear what a car is meant to do if the bus rolls over it when approaching a junction. And, keeping the electric vehicle charged would be a real challenge. On top of this, bridges, lamp posts and road signs would all have to be re-thought.            Bus that moves above traffic jams: model unveiled in China    But perhaps the most cutting criticism of all: since the TEB runs on tracks, it\u2019s technically not even a bus. It\u2019s a train.  Even the \u201croad test\u201d, in hindsight, was found by local media to be unconvincing. It took place on a 300 metre highway and was hardly equivalent to actual traffic conditions. Was the test just a chance to show that TEB had actually built something? Anything? Playing it down since, the authorities in Qinhuangdao, where the bus was tested, have said the TEB will just be used for tourism rather than major transportation. As the likelihood of the TEB coming to fruition in any meaningful way crumbles, descending from transport-solution-of-the-future to a folly evocative of that episode of the Simpsons when Springfield gets a monorail, it looks set to join the ranks of other well meaning, but ultimately futile, urban traffic-solving ideas.  Like, for example, the Hyperloop (emphasis on the \u201chype\u201d), in which pods full of people would in theory be fired down a large tube at speeds of up to 750mph. The concept was first put forward by Elon Musk \u2013 the guy behind commercial space travel enterprise SpaceX \u2013 in 2013, and since then two companies have been competing to make it a reality: Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) and Hyperloop One.             Recently, Hyperloop One put on a demonstration in the Nevada desert, shooting a test sled down a track at 115mph. But as Guardian Tech reporter Alex Hern pointed out, while it did represent a step forward, it is a small one, writing: \u201cLinear accelerators are nothing new: they\u2019ve been used in rollercoasters for 20 years and slower versions are already used in metro systems all over the world.\u201d So nothing revolutionary just yet.  If it does come to fruition, it will mean people could travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles in just 30 minutes, but \u2013 as with commercial space travel \u2013 it is still unclear how the project could be economically viable with so many design and development kinks still to be hammered out.  Then there\u2019s SkyTran, a \u201cpatented, high speed, low cost, elevated Personal Rapid Transportation system\u201d based in Nasa\u2019s Ames Research Center in California. SkyTran\u2019s design consists of sleek steel and aluminium pods pods (what is it with pods and the future?) that travel along an elevated maglev track high above the street.   Related: Urban oddities: cities used to do the strangest things \u2026    This rapid transit system, developed by Nasa engineer Doug Malewicki, would carry two or four people in each pod, with the potential to move them at speeds of up to 155 mph. In the case of SkyTran, the argument is that it\u2019s far more economical than building an underground system; the company claims it will cost just $13m (\u00a39.8m) for every mile of track, compared to $160m per mile of subway. Still, it is yet to appear in a city. It was due to launch in Tel Aviv in 2014, and then at the end of 2015. Now the official line is that a demonstration track will be completed at the end of this year. More recently it was announced that Lagos, Nigeria, would get a SkyTran track by 2020. Fingers crossed.  Keeping in mind that most of these suggestions have barely existed beyond the drawing board, perhaps the best new public transport concept to be presented in recent years is the \u201ccat bus\u201d, which appears as a character in the Japanese animated fantasy film My Neighbour Totoro. The cat bus can fly, it can take passengers to any destination they want \u2013 and, well, it\u2019s adorable. And judging by the track record of some other urban transportation ideas doing the rounds, it\u2019s also just as likely to happen.

The Shanghai Tower, reaching 632 metres, is the third \u201csupertall\u201d tower on the city\u2019s iconic skyline. Looking out from the 119th floor, the city lies below like a toy model, a densely packed mass of streets and high-rise buildings.  China loves a world record, and its new building boasts plenty, including the world\u2019s fastest elevators, highest hotel and restaurant, and tallest viewing platform. Reassuringly, it also required the largest ever cement pouring for the foundations. But most importantly, the 128-storey tower also claims to be the world\u2019s greenest skyscraper. Awarded the top green rating, LEED Platinum, the government is hailing the tower as a sign of China\u2019s growing green credentials.  China\u2019s sustainability record in the past has been abysmal. The country burns 47% of the world\u2019s coal, according to the US Energy Information Administration, and is facing the impact of decades of rapid deforestation and water pollution. With some of the most polluted air on the planet, killing as many as 4,000 people a day, an increasingly restive population is demanding more government action.  Nervous of the impact that smog-filled days and clogged roads could have on social stability, the government has begun tree planting programmes, ordered thousands of cars off the roads in cities such as Beijing, and is investing in green technology in a big way. China is now the biggest renewables market in the world, more than double than in the US, and home to almost one of every three wind turbines globally.  Green buildings, however, make up a woefully small part of the green industry, with most work focused on quick construction and quicker sales. Estimates put the number of green buildings on the mainland at less than 1%, though a 2014 target by the State Council wants 30% of new construction projects to be green by 2020.     The Shanghai Tower (right) has been awarded the highest sustainability rating. Photograph: Connie Zhou/Gensler     In Shanghai, engineer Shunfu Cha points to 200 wind turbines spinning at the top of the tower \u2013 the world\u2019s tallest turbines, naturally \u2013 which generate around 10% of the building\u2019s electricity. \u201cThese are one of the most obvious green technologies,\u201d he says, gesturing upwards into the clouds. \u201cBut only one part of bringing down the energy use.\u201d  The building collects rainwater and re-uses waste water, has a combined cooling and heating power system and uses 40 other energy-saving measures that developers claim cut 34,000 metric tonnes from its annual carbon footprint. The building is wrapped in two layers of glass for natural cooling and ventilation, and in total developers say a third of the site is \u201cgreen space\u201d, including 24 sky gardens sitting between the two skins.  \u201cAt the moment, everyone is trying to achieve top green certification criteria,\u201d says Xiaomei Lee, managing director of Gensler Shanghai, the building\u2019s architect. \u201cBut nobody yet has achieved LEED Platinum for a supertall building. People assumed that a building of this size can\u2019t achieve such a high sustainability rating.\u201d  Shanghai Tower might be the only supertall tower to achieve LEED Platinum, but it is part of an increasing movement for towers to market green credentials as the demand for more sustainable urban development is felt.   The world\u2019s first Passivhaus-certified office tower \u2013 a certification rating that considers ongoing annual energy use, considered more stringent than other energy codes \u2013 was opened in Vienna two years ago, using 80% less heating and cooling energy than an equivalent tower through efficient power systems. London\u2019s tallest building, the Shard, also has a raft of sustainability features which enable it to use 30% less energy than a conventionally designed skyscraper of the same height. Globally, 75 skyscrapers are LEED rated.     Bosco verticale in Milan, with more than 1,000 different species of tree. Photograph: Alamy     More buildings are also turning green, literally. The Two World Trade Center development in New York has been designed to include a series of green terraces featuring different biozones. And in Milan, the Bosco Verticale is a pair of residential towers with 800 trees and thousands of plants on concrete balconies, maintained with recycled water. In Tel Aviv, plans for the Gran Mediterraneo tower include farms, vertical gardens and a range of fauna.  Advocates say that far from their reputation as polluters, skyscrapers offer environmental benefits. \u201cPer capita, skyscrapers use less energy and water, generate less waste and provide for a more engaged living experience,\u201d says Mahesh Ramanujam, chief operating officer at the US Green Building Council. \u201cWhen properly developed, they also preserve and protect precious green space in urban markets.\u201d    People assumed that a building of this size can\u2019t achieve such a high sustainability rating  Xiaomei Lee      But the concept of \u201cgreen skyscrapers\u201d itself is controversial. Buildings are the largest contributor to climate change through carbon emissions, and critics point out that logically, taller towers will need more resources both to run and to construct. So are we just seeing the latest version of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d?  Environmental concerns include the fact that clusters of towers can make the streets below dark, trapping hot air and pollution at ground level. There is a knock-on impact in terms of carbon emissions, blocking light to surrounding properties, forcing the need for more electric lighting and eradicating the possibility of solar energy.  Tall towers also face charges of elitism. News that London has 260 new skyscrapers in the pipeline met with bitter opposition from campaigners earlier this year, largely on the grounds that these towers will mostly offer luxury apartments that do little to help problems of affordable housing.         In 2014, two Russian free climbers reached the top of the Shanghai Tower in just two hours.      And money is certainly to be made in green development. Investors and companies are increasingly looking to benefit from cost efficiencies, with maintenance bills around 20% less than typical commercial buildings. While they cost more to build, the USGBC estimates most green projects pay for themselves in around seven years, especially as property agents say rents in LEED-certified buildings can be up to 30% higher. The UN expects two-thirds of the world to live in cities by 2050 \u2013 the Chinese government\u2019s target is 60% by 2020 \u2013 presenting challenges over how to provide sustainable buildings in space-starved cities. Research has suggested that high-rise buildings are the most sustainable form of urban development. A 2013 report by Terrapin Bright Green, commissioned by the New York government, recommended knocking down Manhattan towers that were too inefficient and replacing them with even bigger skyscrapers. Modern replacements could be 44% larger and still use 5% less energy, the study claimed.  While Terrapin acknowledged that demolishing and rebuilding wouldn\u2019t be appropriate \u2013 or affordable \u2013 in every case, they found that even where buildings were knocked down and replaced, the energy needed to dismantle the existing building and construct a new one would still be offset within 15 and 28 years.  \u201cSome people have opposed taller buildings on the premise that they use more energy, but they have failed to consider the larger spillover effects of urban sustainability that come from a dense urban fabric,\u201d claims Sarene Marshall, executive director for the Center for Sustainability at the Urban Land Institute. \u201cWhile buildings are the largest contributor to climate change through carbon emissions, transportation is a very close second. When you have a denser urban population, people are more likely to walk, bike or use public transportation to get to work. So if you build taller buildings, you have a denser urban fabric.     A 2013 report suggested knocking down \u2018inefficient\u2019 skyscrapers in Manhattan and replacing them with taller ones. Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images     \u201cIf you build lower buildings and spread them out over a longer distance, what often happens is a much higher footprint in automobile transportation.\u201d  A study by the New Climate Economy backs this up. Comparing the cities of Barcelona and Atlanta, with similar populations, Atlanta was found to have a much larger carbon footprint because people used cars to get around a large, sprawling urban area. The thinktank concluded that taller, denser buildings can dramatically reduce a city\u2019s carbon impact.   However, green credentials and promises don\u2019t always stack up. Critics say that LEED criteria focuses too much on the development of the building, and not enough on how it is used afterwards. A New Republic report claimed that The Bank of America tower in New York, hailed as the world\u2019s most \u201cenvironmentally responsible\u201d office building when it opened in 2010, actually produces more greenhouse gases and uses more energy per square foot than any comparably sized office building in Manhattan. In relying too much on LEED ratings, critics argue, developers and governments can get additional publicity without necessarily being energy efficient in the long run.   Related: Shanghai tower climb - in pictures     In many US states, there are also tax breaks for energy-efficient buildings, leading to claims that building designers target the easiest and cheapest green points in order to qualify as LEED rated and gain tax exemptions.  And there are cases where the new technology disappoints. In London, the Strata Tower in Elephant and Castle, met criticism by residents when it opened as its in-built wind turbines \u2013 designed for helping heat and cool the building properly \u2013 weren\u2019t turning. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in an eco experiment that has gone wrong at the design stage\u201d, one resident said. The promised new public garden at the Walkie Talkie tower in London also attracted criticism for being neither particularly green nor public enough.   For advocates of high-rise buildings, vertical development seems to be the future, and they remain convinced that green skyscrapers like the Shanghai Tower are the only sustainable way to do it. Sceptics will be watching closely for evidence that their optimism is not unfounded.

The first myths were mostly optimistic fictions, but our ancestors longed to believe in them: that\u2019s how religion established its hold. The original myth-makers expected us to take literally God\u2019s fabulations about heaven and hell and to obey his bullying commandments. Today, less credulous, we think religion itself is a myth, by which we mean a consoling lie. In common usage, \u201cmyth\u201d is at best the word we use to refer to amusingly preposterous urban legends \u2013 tales about albino alligators in the Manhattan sewers or the Holy Grail\u2019s hiding place under the floor of a Paris shopping mall. In our society, it is publicists, spin doctors and advertisers who devise the myths. Sometimes the aim is to exalt an imperfect human being: celebrities and even politicians need to possess \u201ccharisma\u201d, a word that originally vouched for a believer\u2019s direct contact with a divine source. Myth also invests manufactured objects with a supernatural grace or glory. In the 1950s, Citro\u00ebn\u2019s DS car came to be known as the D\u00e9esse \u2013 a goddess of sleek metal and smooth leather, so curvaceously aerodynamic that it seemed, according to Roland Barthes\u2019s description in Mythologies, to have \u201cdescended from the sky\u201d, not driven up the highway. Irony is our defence against such sales pitches: we need to pick the myths apart, deciphering their sneaky designs on us.   Related: Can mythbusters like Snopes.com keep up in a post-truth era?    Take the case of Air Force One, the American presidential plane \u2013 not to be confused with Air Force 1, which is a Nike trainer, mock-heroically named to ally it with the vertical lift of a jet during takeoff. Or could the plane be mimicking the athletic mystique of the shoe? On its white, shiny fuselage, the proud slogan UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is underlined by a blue stripe, a counterpart to the Nike flash, which pays streamlined homage to the Greek goddess of victory. More than a means of transport, Air Force One is a propaganda tool, and its effectiveness\u00a0depends on the implied presence of a deity. So long as the doctrine of American isolation prevailed, the presidency was a desk job, tethered to Washington DC. But when the US acquired global power after 1945, the president took to the air, travelling in a plane that has come to represent the ubiquity and intimidating might of this ultimate empire. Equipped with surveillance systems that eavesdrop on the lowly world it overflies, allegedly able to fire missiles and to withstand a nuclear blast, Air Force One is evidence of dominance. Even if we don\u2019t accept American superiority, we bow down before American immensity: the customised 747 currently in use is as tall as a six-storey building and as long as a football field. On the ground, the president travels in a black Cadillac nicknamed \u201cthe Beast\u201d, ready to repel assailants with rocket-propelled grenades, pump-action shotguns and tear-gas cannon. Soaring aloft, he exchanges a beast for a bird: Air Force One is America with wings, a mechanised version of the beaked, pinioned eagle \u2013 a predator that clutches in its claws twin bundles of peacemaking olive branches and spiky, militarised arrows \u2013 that appears on the country\u2019s Great Seal.     Barack Obama speaks after touching down in Tel Aviv \u2013 his first visit to Israel, 20 March 2013. Photograph: Oliver Weiken/EPA    The first President Bush, who took delivery of the current double-decker Air Force One to replace the humbler 707 he inherited from Ronald Reagan, remarked that it embodies America\u2019s \u201cmajesty\u201d. A Freudian slip, surely \u2013 republics should be unmajestic and the USA was meant to be the paradise of the common man \u2013 but not inaccurate. Air Force One is a triumphal chariot, a steroid-boosted equivalent to the golden coaches and slow-motion Bentleys in which the Queen sedately trundles along. For extra effect, Lyndon Johnson installed a hydraulic \u201cking chair\u201d on board his Air Force One, which enabled him to hover in midair as he harangued the congressmen he invited into his cabin. Like the country whose head of state it carries, Air Force One is exceptional \u2013 and exceptions are always made for it by air-traffic controllers, who suspend other operations to give it instant clearance. The numeral in the plane\u2019s call sign is exclusive, monopolistic, not the inception of a series; it brags of being one of a kind, rather than a first among equals. In fact that solitary integer is misleading: here is the first of the myth\u2019s little fibs. Air Force One has a duplicate that, like the vice-president, is a useful safeguard against mishaps. But to preserve the myth of American primacy, the second plane is never referred to as Air Force Two and whichever of them carries the incumbent becomes Air Force One for the duration.   Related: The \u2018nuclear football\u2019 - the deadly briefcase that never leaves the president\u2019s side    George W Bush may be the only president to have used both planes on a single journey. At Thanksgiving in 2003, he flew to Baghdad, where he spent a couple of hours posing for photographs as he dished out portions of festive turkey to the troops who were fighting his war. To ensure that the trip remained secret, he retreated to his ranch in Texas for the holiday, then travelled back to Washington on the first Air Force One \u2013 though it couldn\u2019t officially be called that because he was pretending not to be on board: the trip was logged as routine maintenance. The second plane was waiting in a hangar, fuelled and provisioned for the onward flight to Iraq. With a baseball cap as his camouflage, Bush entered it by the back stairs, which no president ever uses. That skulking between planes was an odd manoeuvre, very unlike his customary strutting. Bush was playing hide and seek with his twin Air Force Ones, and duplication hints at duplicity, a cultivation of double meanings that dodges, as myth always does, between truth and falsehood. The plane borrows America\u2019s attributes \u2013 its size, its might, its technological supremacy \u2013 but can any president dare borrow those attributes from the plane? Although Americans proverbially describe their nation\u2019s CEO as \u201cthe most powerful man in the world\u201d, it\u2019s a hollow boast, since the only way of making that power manifest is by opening the suitcase of nuclear codes chained to the arm of the military aide who accompanies the president everywhere. Power is meaningless unless it\u2019s displayed, enacted: hence Vladimir Putin\u2019s bare-chested preening or his sessions of bone-crushing judo. American presidents sometimes jog to demonstrate fitness, though Jimmy Carter once embarrassingly keeled over while out for a run. A president\u2019s best chance of personifying confident, aerobic America is in bounding energetically down the stairs of Air Force One. Yet the height of those stairs and their steep pitch are reminders that the presidency is a heady, hubristic office, undermined by pitfalls. In 1975 in rainy Salzburg the notoriously clumsy Gerald Ford slipped on the wet bottom step as he deplaned and tumbled on to the tarmac, forcing his wife to shield him with an umbrella as an official tugged him upright.     President Ford slips as he exits Air Force One, 1975. Photograph: Wally McNamee/Corbis via Getty Images    For once avoiding risks, when Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination last year he relied on a gilded escalator in his New York headquarters to deposit him in the lobby where the photographers were gathered. Stairs require effort, which may be unavailing or self-defeating; an escalator \u2013 or so Trump hoped \u2013 allowed him to waft down smoothly from on high like a golden-maned angel of deliverance. In one respect, America\u2019s aeronautical myth has to wheedle its way around a flagrant contradiction: Air Force One carries the commander-in-chief, but he is not in command of the plane. When Barack Obama came on board for the first time, he shook the hand of the pilot and complimented him for looking the part, \u201clike Sam Shepard in The Right Stuff\u201d. In the film of Tom Wolfe\u2019s book about Nasa\u2019s astronauts, Shepard as Chuck Yeager breaks the sound barrier while remaining laconic, nonchalant, metaphorically down to earth. Actually, the pilot who flies Air Force One is nicknamed Top Gun during his tenure in the cockpit; it\u2019s lucky that Obama was greeted by a laidback Shepard lookalike rather than a clone of Tom Cruise, who played the hepped-up hotshot naval aviator known as Maverick in Tony Scott\u2019s film Top Gun. Obama\u2019s charmingly deferential remark joked about his own unfitness \u2013 physically at least \u2013 for the office. Americans want their head of state to be both a warlord and a saviour and these impossible expectations have turned the presidency into a myth \u2013 a starring role for an action hero rather than an exhaustingly intricate job for a fixer schooled in the art of compromise.         Watch Harrison Ford as President James Marshall in the 1997 film Air Force One.    Trump, when asked last December which president he most admires, did not pay the usual unctuous tribute to Lincoln, Kennedy or Reagan, but said that his role model was James Marshall. He was referring, he explained, to \u201cHarrison Ford on the plane\u201d: in Wolfgang Petersen\u2019s 1997 film Air Force One, Ford plays a president whose name suggests martial prowess as well as anticipating the air marshals who, after 9/11, began to travel on civilian flights, weapons at the ready. Marshall\u2019s backstory alludes to his time piloting combat choppers in Vietnam, when he received the Medal of Honor for valour in battle from one of his predecessors. He is therefore well prepared to beat up or gun down the terrorists from Kazakhstan who take over Air Force One after a summit meeting in Moscow; in an emergency he can even fly the plane himself. Harrison Ford\u2019s reaction to Trump\u2019s accolade was scornful, sad and a little anxious. \u201cDonald,\u201d he groaned, \u201cit was a movie! It\u2019s not like this in real life \u2013 but how would you know?\u201d Undeterred by protests about his infringement of copyright, Trump uses Jerry Goldsmith\u2019s embattled but rousingly brassy music from the film to underscore his campaign appearances, and when he arrived in Cleveland for the Republican convention in July he was greeted by the fanfares that accompany Ford\u2019s gung-ho bouts of fisticuffs with the hijackers. All he did was step out of his name-tagged helicopter, but Goldsmith\u2019s theme lent that act an air of unearned grandiosity.     The Clintons listen to a midair briefing in 1996. Photograph: Robert Mcneely/AP    Trump\u2019s enthusiasm is easy to understand: as Air Force One begins, Marshall plays the kind of president any of us might fancy being, a man for whom the executive branch and its perks are a licence to daydream. Returning to the airport in wintry Moscow, he suggests a whimsical detour on the way home: \u201cLet\u2019s go to Barbados.\u201d Here, in theory, is true power, unhindered by responsibility; the plane is a magic carpet. But once he forfeits control of Air Force One, Marshall is suddenly disempowered. Hiding from the terrorists in the luggage compartment, he finds a mobile phone with which he tries to alert the cabinet to his plight. He has to go through the White House switchboard and when he identifies himself to the woman on duty she refuses to put him through because he sounds like a crackpot fantasist. That, a year ago, is how everyone viewed Trump; real life, we now know, is not quite as reasonable or as immune to delusion as Harrison Ford hoped. Whatever frenzy or folly it is that impels Trump, his motive can hardly be the desire to survey the world from inside Air Force One. He already has a plane, a secondhand 757 branded with his surname along its fuselage and his cross-country trips in it have made him look prematurely presidential. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, began her campaign in April 2015 with a road trip, a reprise of the mythically intrepid expeditions of the pioneers in their horsedrawn wagons: she travelled from New York to Iowa in a chauffeured and prudently armoured Chevrolet camper, emerging to be photographed at fast-food outlets along the way. Days after she set out, Obama teased Hillary\u2019s mock-modesty at a dinner for White House correspondents. Reflecting on the economy\u2019s ups and downs, he said: \u201cI have a friend who used to make millions a year. Now she\u2019s living out of a van in Iowa.\u201d But this July he invited Hillary back on to Air Force One to fly with him to an electoral rally in North Carolina. In a tweet, Trump railed against this partisan misuse of the plane and claimed that Hillary\u2019s free trip cost taxpayers half a million dollars. Obama\u2019s gesture indeed had a solemn constitutional significance. Never before had an incumbent offered a ride to a candidate for the succession who wasn\u2019t already the vice-president; it meant, as one commentator pointed out, that Obama was \u201cready to hand over the keys to Air Force One\u201d. Perhaps that transfer should be part of the ceremony at the inauguration next January. Guarded by snipers and sniffer dogs in a hangar that is described as a \u201csanctuary\u201d, debarred to anyone without security clearance, Air Force One is a symptom of the privileged exclusivity that Trump the populist pretends to despise. With his customary shrewdness, he has maintained an advantage by symbolically opening his private jet to all, thanks to a video tour posted on YouTube. As hostess \u2013 a throwback to the days when flight attendants were described that way \u2013 he has appointed Amanda Miller, his gatekeeper in the reality show The Apprentice. (She first came to Trump\u2019s attention as a 15-year-old waitress at one of his golf clubs and after she graduated from college with a degree in fashion merchandising he hired her as a corporate marketer.) With one hand propped on her hip like a starlet posing on a red carpet, Miller purringly extols the plane\u2019s luxuries: seat belts plated in 24-carat gold, head rests on which the Trump family\u2019s spurious crest is embroidered, silk-clad walls for the boss\u2019s bedroom, Ultrasuede ceiling panels, mahogany cabinets, a shower cubicle. We are supposed to slaver enviously at this ostentation; if we don\u2019t, we condemn ourselves as losers.         Watch a guided tour of Donald Trump\u2019s 757.    Trump\u2019s plane does without the emergency medical facilities secreted on Air Force One, which has an operating table discreetly stowed in a wall like a fold-up bed. Instead, Miller recommends a bouncy mohair divan (she pronounces it \u201cdive-in\u201d) in the guest bedroom. To conclude the tour she curls up on a sofa, tosses gobbets of popcorn into her mouth and relaxes with a film from Trump\u2019s on-board cin\u00e9math\u00e8que of a thousand movies. We hear only noises \u2013 a burst of gunfire and the clatter of broken glass: she could be watching Harrison Ford fight back against the hijackers in Petersen\u2019s Air Force One. That would not be my choice for in-flight entertainment, since the film\u2019s climax is a plane crash. With failing engines, ruptured fuel tanks and a damaged rudder, Air Force One finally lunges into the Caspian Sea and breaks apart; just in time, Ford is safely yanked on to a hovering Hercules turboprop, which, as its pilot beamingly announces while the theme appropriated by Trump blares out one last time, at once becomes Air Force One. This is how the succession works in the supposedly unmonarchical United States: the plane is dead, long live the plane. Obama, asked in 2012 what he might miss if he weren\u2019t re-elected, said: \u201cThe plane is really nice, it really is. It\u2019s a great plane.\u201d Now that he\u2019ll soon lose his right to it, he must dread having to take commercial flights again \u2013 a crash landing for the executive ego. Of course there are consolation prizes. When Bill Clinton left the White House, he swapped Air Force One for an aerial pleasure palace, a Boeing 757 owned by his fun-loving billionaire buddy Ron Burkle, a venture capitalist who, according to a recent article in GQ, paid Clinton $15m for his schmoozy aid in recruiting international clients; the in-flight services available on Burkle\u2019s jolly jet prompted the tycoon\u2019s employees to call it \u201cAir Fuck One\u201d. Absolute power, as Trump understands, can mean uninhibited self-indulgence. As Americans prepare to elect another president, a new presidential plane is on order. Last year, the air force secretary, Deborah Lee James, announced that the Boeing VC25-A currently in use would be replaced by a Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, which \u201cwhen fully missionised\u2026 will meet the necessary capabilities established to execute the presidential support mission, while reflecting the office of the president of the United States of America consistent with the national public interest\u201d. That sentence, which mixes aggression with evangelism by placing an execution between two missions, packs in all the contradictions of the myth that sustains the country and supplies its Messiah-like sense of purpose. But will a technological upgrade to the plane solve the problems of the presidency, which, thanks to props like Air Force One, has an aura of insuperable power, even though in practice it is limited or even enfeebled by partisan feuds and the rapid disillusionment of an electorate that wants its wishes instantly\u00a0gratified?     George W. Bush looks out the window of Air Force One as he flies over New Orleans, Louisiana, surveying the damage left by hurricane Katrina in 2005. Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images    James promised that the new Air Force One would be designed to function as an \u201calternate airborne White House\u201d. That\u2019s a military precaution, a response to the prospect of nuclear war or some other annihilating catastrophe on the ground. In the first Independence Day film, an extraterrestrial death ray incinerates the White House; Bill Pullman, playing President Whitmore, escapes in Air Force One, suits up as a fighter pilot at a base in Nevada and leads an attack to wipe out the aliens. Reality flails and flounders, unable to match the myth. After the terrorist attacks on 9/11, President Bush spent the rest of the day flying to and fro between Florida and Nebraska in a sky that had been emptied of all other traffic. Secure in the \u201cmobile command centre\u201d of Air Force One, he issued no coherent commands, later shiftily explaining that he remained aloft because he didn\u2019t want to give \u201cthe bad guys\u201d the satisfaction of killing him. Air Force One keeps the president out of harm\u2019s way, but it also ensures that he remains out of touch. The shining seas and purple mountains celebrated in the patriotic hymn are far below and actual Americans remain invisible. \u201cThe presidential aircraft,\u201d James insisted, \u201cis one of the most visible symbols of the United States at home and abroad.\u201d True, but a plane is an odd or ominous symbol for a country, which surely consists of terrain, not airspace. Thunderous, scarily propulsive, bristling with weaponry, Air Force One encourages effusions of the wrong kind about American greatness; what\u2019s worse is that Petersen\u2019s film has made it an arena for crazed feats of derring-do by a superhero \u2013 or, with luck, by a superheroine in a nattily tailored trouser suit. The overlapping of politics and fiction is absurd, but that\u2019s no reason not to find it alarming. The very irrationality of myth makes it irresistible in a time of unease or trauma like the present: we are all at risk of being blown away by the rhetorical jet exhaust that Air Force One leaves behind it.

While the UN conveniently sits in silence, government officials around the world can\u2019t seem to shut up about what women should or shouldn\u2019t wear.  India\u2019s tourism minister, for example, has just advised that foreign women shouldn\u2019t wear skirts \u201cfor their own safety\u201d. Meanwhile a number of French mayors are nobly continuing to ban the burkini even after France\u2019s highest administrative court ruled the ban illegal. These mayors care about women\u2019s right to bare arms and are willing to break the law for it. Ladies, you should be grateful.    Is a skort as dangerous as a skirt? Is a sarong just as wrong?    And I certainly don\u2019t want to sound ungrateful. I think it\u2019s great that politicians understand that women\u2019s rights are often simply a matter of the right sort of clothing. It\u2019s laudable that so many men are encouraging us to exercise sartorial safety. But here\u2019s the thing: if you\u2019re going to become the fashion police you need to take your policing a little more seriously. All of this advice is very confusing, occasionally conflicting and doesn\u2019t seem terribly well thought out. Is a skort as dangerous as a skirt, for example? Is a sarong just as wrong? And can we have an official verdict on the burkini already before burkini season is over? I\u2019m sure a lot of women are as concerned about inadvertently dressing inappropriately as I am. So while we wait for the UN to get their act together and sort out some sort of official female dress code we can all abide by, I\u2019ve put together some pointers on dressing while female. Please note, of course, that these are only guidelines and you should always double-check your outfit with a man.  Bikinis in Israel     Muslim women wear hijabs in the waters of the Mediterranean Sea as people play on the beach in Tel Aviv, Israel, on 22 August 2016. Photograph: Baz Ratner/Reuters    While the French are saying non to burkinis, their sluttier sister, the bikini, appears equally out of fashion in Israel. A performance by singer Hanna Goor at a government-organized event was recently cut short because, apparently, her shorts were too short and she was wearing a bikini top. The culture ministry, shocked and saddened by what the public had endured, noted that they would work to ensure correct dress at future events.  As an editorial in Haaretz noted: \u201cThe modesty regime that the culture ministry is trying to enforce on events meant for the general public is the mirror image of France\u2019s unconstitutional burkini law.\u201d  Started from the burkini bottoms now we here, eh? Bikinis in any country whatsoever if you\u2019re not beach body ready It\u2019s irresponsible to wear a bikini unless you\u2019ve got a six pack and a thigh gap. This may not be official legislation in most countries \u2013 but the media and advertising industry helpfully ensure that women are cognizant of these rules all around the world. High heels in a professional environment        In May, a London receptionist was sent home from her first day at corporate accountancy firm PwC after refusing to wear heels. Around the same time a waitress at a Canadian restaurant was told she couldn\u2019t change out of her heels even though her feet were bleeding. I have very little sympathy for these women. Yes, heels can be incredibly painful and result in debilitating foot deformities \u2013 but have you seen Jurassic World? If Bryce Dallas Howard can dodge dinosaurs and sprint through a muddy jungle while wearing 3.5-inch pumps, you should probably just get a decent podiatrist and suck it up! Headphones near a man What if a man wants to talk to you but can\u2019t because you\u2019re rudely covering your ears? Show a little more consideration, ladies, you know you want to. Pants on a plane     British Airways: no longer skirting the issue. Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images    In February, after a two-year dispute, female crew members on British Airways were finally given the right to wear trousers as well as skirts. If you work for Virgin Atlantic, however, then your right to wear trousers is considered on a case-by-case basis. And Etihad doesn\u2019t have a trouser option for its female flight crew. Ettore Bilotta, who designed the Etihad uniform, told the press that: \u201cFemales in the inflight crew were not allowed to wear trousers, because the element of femininity had to be emphasised.\u201d If there isn\u2019t enough femininity in the cabin it can really mess with in-flight safety, I guess. Flats at a film festival The second biggest fashion faux pas in Cannes, after a burkini, is having the audacity to try and attend Cannes Film Festival in rhinestone flats.

Not long after, 30 women were arrested for protesting against the ban by wearing lace underwear on their heads and shouting \u201cfreedom to panties!\u201d What these women didn\u2019t understand, of course, was the ban was for their own good; the government explained they were simply protecting women\u2019s vaginal health. Kazakhstan has issues like the shrinking of the Aral Sea, the devaluation of its currency and radioactive contamination to deal with, but it took time out of its busy schedule to focus on panties. Sometimes women are so ungrateful. Leggings or yoga pants in the US Not appropriate in a number of American high schools, apparently. A Republican in Montana attempted to ban yoga pants from the state last year but was unsuccessful. So for now Montana remains a largely Lululemon safe zone. Miniskirts in Uganda In 2014, Uganda attempted to ban the miniskirt. A number of men tried to help the government out by forcefully undressing any women they saw wearing miniskirts in public. Eventually the Ugandan government was forced to clarify that the miniskirt wasn\u2019t entirely banned. Simon Lokodo, Uganda\u2019s ethics and integrity minister, clarified: \u201cPut on a miniskirt but please don\u2019t expose your thighs, your buttocks and your genitalia.

Map and travel guide publisher Shocart has been told by the ministry to replace Jerusalem with Tel Aviv as the capital or the atlas would no longer be listed as a certified book on the Czech school curriculum. In the Czech Republic, schools receive grants to buy books on the certified list. Czech foreign ministry spokeswoman Irena Valentova told Mlada fronta Dnes that the Czech Republic did not consider East Jerusalem a part of the state of Israel. \u201cThe EU member countries, including the Czech Republic, view Jerusalem as the future capital of both states, ie the State of Israel and the future State of Palestine,\u201d Valentova said.  Atrash praised the decision. \u201cThe atlas says something that is unacceptable not only for the Palestinians but also according to international law and the official positions of the EU, including the Czech Republic,\u201d he said. In a statement to the Jewish News Service, the Israeli foreign ministry said it was in touch with Prague in an attempt to reverse the decision. \u201cThis is a reprehensible decision.

Writing on his Facebook page, Zuckerberg said: \u201cAs I\u2019m here in Africa, I\u2019m deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX\u2019s launch failure destroyed our satellite that would have provided connectivity to so many entrepreneurs and everyone else across the continent.\u201d  The accidental explosion of the Falcon 9 rocket early on Thursday morning \u2013 referred to as an \u201canomaly\u201d by SpaceX engineers \u2013 destroyed both the rocket and its cargo: the AMOS-6 satellite, which Facebook had planned to deploy to provide internet coverage to parts of Africa.           SpaceX test ends in explosion days before planned launch \u2013 video    \u201cFortunately, we have developed other technologies like Aquila that will connect people as well,\u201d Zuckerberg added. \u201cWe remain committed to our mission of connecting everyone, and we will keep working until everyone has the opportunities this satellite would have provided.\u201d Contrary to Zuckerberg\u2019s description, the satellite did not belong to Facebook. In October 2015, Facebook partnered with Eutelsat, a French satellite company, to lease the broadband capability of the AMOS-6, which was built by Israeli company Spacecom.   Related: SpaceX's booms and busts: spaceflight is littered with explosions and disasters    According to Space News, which reviewed Spacecom filings with the Tel Aviv stock exchange, the joint lease cost $95m over five years and included a provision requiring Spacecom to purchase an insurance policy specifically covering Facebook and Eutelsat\u2019s risks, in addition to its own insurance. Space News also reported that both Facebook and Eutelsat would each have additional insurance policies for the satellite. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a query about its own insurance policies.  The tone of Zuckerberg\u2019s response to the explosion was immediately interpreted by many as a sign of a grudge against SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.  The two billionaires cut markedly different swathes through Silicon Valley. In recent years, Zuckerberg has appeared intent on projecting an image of a philanthropist concerned with connecting the earth\u2019s citizens. Musk is better known for his eccentric pronouncements and preoccupation with technological moonshots.  The loss of the satellite is just the latest setback for Zuckerberg\u2019s Internet.org, which aims to expand internet access across the globe.

In a cafe just outside the company\u2019s new offices, near the top of the Tea Building in Shoreditch, London, I meet Hinrikus, fresh from climbing the Matterhorn in Switzerland. TransferWise had outgrown its digs, up the road near Old Street\u2019s Silicon Roundabout, and needs room to expand. But it wasn\u2019t always clear that that expansion would happen in the UK. TransferWise was one of the loudest voices in Britain\u2019s technology sector campaigning against leaving the EU, with Hinrikus telling the Guardian the month before the vote that \u201cIf the UK leaves the EU, we\u2019ll have to consider whether it makes business sense to stay headquartered here. It\u2019s a decision we don\u2019t want to make but one that we\u2019re having to consider.\u201d While its headquarters are in London, the majority of TransferWise\u2019s employees are based in Talinn, Estonia, and it has offices smattered around the rest of the world too. Shortly after the vote, TransferWise again mulled relocation. Hinrikus said: \u201cWe will probably not grow the team based here much more. Headquartering elsewhere is a possibility, but we haven\u2019t made a final decision yet.\u201d Does the new office represent a softening of his approach? Might Brexit not be so bad after all? \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI still think the disaster scenario is real and possible.\u201d He cites reports that venture capital funding has dried up for early-stage startups: \u201cI think that is pretty horrible. At the best case, that means that the UK has one or two lost years for startups, because for one or two years during uncertainty, people couldn\u2019t raise money.\u201d What about technology in general in the country? Should London-based tech reporters start making alternative plans? \u201cYes. If the hard Brexit happens, I would assume that London wouldn\u2019t be the centre of the tech world in Europe.\u201d As a European citizen, Hinrikus is limited to opining from the sidelines. Despite a billion-dollar business headquartered in the nation\u2019s capital, he didn\u2019t get a vote in the referendum, and accepts that he has limited power over what follows. But he hopes that whatever happens will do two things: clear up uncertainty, fast, and keep Britain as close to Europe as is democratically possible. When we spoke, he had just returned from a trip to Switzerland to scale the Matterhorn, and Theresa May was in the middle of her \u201cbrainstorming\u201d session to determine \u201cwhat Brexit means\u201d. For Hinrikus, he had hopes that they\u2019d come to a good conclusion, \u201cwith a clear plan of what\u2019s achievable in a short timeframe. And keeping us as close to Europe as possible is my preference, but hey, the people of Britain \u2013 which doesn\u2019t include me \u2013 have made their moat. Maybe they were frustrated and it\u2019s not really what they wanted, but that doesn\u2019t matter any more. The government needs to come up with a realistic plan which is deliverable in a short timeframe which Europe also will agree to.\u201d As for what that plan should be, it\u2019s the same thing Hinrikus, and most of the rest of the technology community, have been pushing for since even before the referendum campaign kicked off: access to the single market and access to talent from all across Europe. For TransferWise in particular, there\u2019s an additional red line in the form of financial passporting. The firm is regulated in the UK, but EU rules let it operate all across the continent. If that goes, it seems unlikely that the British headquarters will be able to stay much longer, relegating the UK to the same status as the Australian or Japanese subsidiaries. Still, Hinrikus is confident that his own company won\u2019t be negatively impacted too much by Brexit. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid that TransferWise won\u2019t survive,\u201d he says. The company is big enough, and diversified enough, that even a hard Brexit \u2013 one where Britain closed its borders, and kept services out \u2013 would leave it in a healthy position. But he adds that \u201cif I think about the UK as a place, if UK the becomes not competitive for entrepreneurs, the next TransferWise will be built in Berlin, or Tel Aviv, or Stockholm, or in Talinn. Not London. We have more than 100 jobs in London; the next TransferWise will create a thousand jobs outside London.\u201d The company\u2019s most recent results, released on Saturday, show it\u2019s well on the way to its goal of kicking banks out of the international money transfer market entirely. Privately held with an estimated valuation of around $1bn (making it one of Britain\u2019s 18 technology \u201cunicorns\u201d), TransferWise\u2019s latest annual accounts show a doubling of monthly revenue and transactions year-on-year. The company\u2019s annual turnover for the 2016 financial year now stands at \u00a328m, while its monthly revenue has continued to rise, standing at \u00a35m. It holds a market share in its native Britain of 8%, and, Hinrikus tells me proudly, can now transfer money to 90% of the world\u2019s bank accounts. Even the one sour note doesn\u2019t faze him. TransferWise\u2019s losses have increased, from \u00a311m in 2015 to \u00a317m this year. As a proportion, that growth is significantly lower than the increase in revenues, and Hinrikus points out that the losses are because of heavy investment in expansion: the company recently launched in Australia, and will soon come to Japan and Singapore. In Britain itself, the company is in a strong position, he says. \u201cIf you break out UK as a separate business, its economics are working really really well \u2026 So it really depends on the speed of our expansion. We\u2019re very well capitalised, so it\u2019s not the top of our concerns. Break-even on its own shouldn\u2019t be the biggest goal.\u201d Brexit or not, TransferWise is focusing on growth internationally. Just like Facebook\u2019s theoretical growth is capped by the size of the internet, so Transferwise is rapidly hitting the limit of the portion of the world with bank accounts: nine-tenths of the banked world can receive money from the company, although currency controls in countries like China and India mean that the number who can send cash is rather smaller. And so to get much bigger, TransferWise now has to double down on the other aspect of growth: getting those who have access to its services to actually use them. That means taking on the banks. As for how that will go, Hinrikus is optimistic: \u201cWe can beat them on speed and cost. We\u2019re seeing the very early stages of a financial revolution. We\u2019re seeing that kind of exciting where this can lead us to. Yes, we have 8% market share in the UK, which is fantastic, but if we think about the world and fintech at large, it\u2019s the beginning. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the most exciting thing, right? If I look at the five years we\u2019ve been in existence as \u2018this was the warm-up phase\u2019, it\u2019s about how long will it take for fintech as a whole to have a 10% share of the finance system.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-09-03T10:00:28Z", "title": "TransferWise co-founder on Brexit: 'London may no longer be the tech centre for Europe'", "sentences": ["But he adds that \u201cif I think about the UK as a place, if UK the becomes not competitive for entrepreneurs, the next TransferWise will be built in Berlin, or Tel Aviv, or Stockholm, or in Talinn."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/03/transferwise-brexit-london-tech-centre-europe"}, {"tags": ["Benjamin Netanyahu", "Israel", "Australian politics", "Coalition", "Australia news"], "article": "Benjamin Netanyahu has accepted an invitation to make the first official visit to Australia by a sitting Israeli prime minister.

The cost of the meal at the Abu Ghosh restaurant in the Israeli Arab village of the same name, famous for its unpretentious eateries often specialising in hummus, came to light after an Israeli tour operators\u2019 association posted a copy of the bill on social media and suggested that the tourists may have been \u201csuckered\u201d.  That put the association at loggerheads with the owners of the restaurant, who have contested the circumstances of how the bill was run up. Reacting to the bill, which was first reported in the Israeli business magazine Globes, the tourism association said: \u201cThere may be a billion Chinese, but they may not all be suckers. These Chinese said they would not be back and would not recommend their friends to visit Israel.  \u201cNaive customers are a very shaky basis for a business plan, and by behaving this way we are destroying with our own hands the budding potential of the Chinese market for Israel.\u201d  The village of Abu Ghosh is popular with tourists and Israelis, who flock to its restaurants, particularly at the weekend, and Abu Ghosh restaurant is listed as one of the best places to eat hummus on websites such as TripAdvisor. Defending the bill, Jawdat Ibrahim, one of the restaurant\u2019s owners, said half of the restaurant \u2013 which has a capacity of 300 \u2013 had been rented by the tour party, who stayed for hours and ordered large amounts of grilled meat and alcohol. The tourism association denied this claim, saying it had spoken to the unnamed tour operator used by the group. Speaking to the Guardian, Ibrahim blamed \u201cenvy\u201d from competitors for fuelling the controversy. \u201cAbu Ghosh restaurant is very famous. For 25 years it is has been known not just domestically but internationally. \u201cThere are people who are envious of the fact that tourists make a pilgrimage to Abu Ghosh and not to some other establishments, including in Tel Aviv.\u201d Explaining the circumstances of the row, he added: \u201cA while ago Chinese television made a programme about the restaurant and afterwards a guide from a Chinese tour company called me and asked me to prepare a private section for a group of Chinese. \u201cI was told they were very important people and they wanted to reserve a special section of the restaurant on Friday night, our busiest day. We provided them with their own bar and expensive drinks and a whole stuffed lamb, which cost me a lot. \u201cThey seemed happy and gave us a large tip and then someone put the bill on Facebook! People don\u2019t understand of course we have meals that cost $15 but this was special.\u201d   Defending the decision to publish the bill, the tourism association told Israeli media: \u201cThe association decided to make this incident public in order to illustrate the importance of fair and polite treatment of tourists who come to Israel and are an important sector of the country\u2019s economy.

Eno, 68, who started his career with Roxy Music but has latterly become known for his ambient music compositions, said he had not been aware his music was being used in a piece by the Batsheva dance company. Eno, a prominent supporter of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign aimed at Israel\u2019s occupation of the Palestinian territories, wrote to the dance company last month to deny them permission to use his music. Eno is also one of 1,200 artists who have signed the Artists\u2019 Pledge for Palestine, refusing funding from or cultural contacts with Israel\u2019s government. According to the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, the dance piece using Eno\u2019s music \u2013 entitled Humus \u2013 was due to be performed on Tuesday at the TorinoDanza festival at the Teatro Regio in Turin, but Eno\u2019s music was replaced after Eno was made aware of the Israeli embassy sponsorship. His name has been removed from the festival\u2019s website. The dance piece, which uses Eno\u2019s composition Neroli, has long been a staple of Batsheva, a Tel Aviv-based company. In a 2008 review of a performance of it at Sadler\u2019s Wells in London, the Guardian described \u201can eerie vestigial piece of ambient sound that gently binds\u201d the dancers \u201cinto a collective\u201d. As recently as 2013 the Israeli consulate general in Marseille drew attention to the use of Eno\u2019s music in the company\u2019s performances.  In his letter to the dance company and its well-known choreographer Ohad Naharin, which emerged this week, Eno expressed his understanding for Israeli artists but said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for his music to be used in a performance sponsored by part of the Israeli government. \u201cIt has recently come to my attention that you have been using a piece of my music in a work called Humus,\u201d wrote Eno. \u201cI was not aware of this use until last week, and, though in one way I\u2019m flattered that you chose my music for your work, I\u2019m afraid it creates a serious conflict for me. \u201cTo my understanding, the Israeli embassy (and therefore the Israeli government) will be sponsoring the upcoming performances, and, given that I\u2019ve been supporting the BDS campaign for several years now, this is an unacceptable prospect for me. \u201cIt\u2019s often said by opponents of BDS that art shouldn\u2019t be used as a political weapon. However, since the Israeli government has made it quite clear that it uses art in exactly that way \u2013 to promote \u2018Brand Israel\u2019 and to draw attention away from the occupation of Palestinian land \u2013 I consider that my decision to deny permission is a way of taking this particular weapon out of their hands. \u201cI am trying to understand the difficulties that must face any Israeli artist now \u2013 and in particular ones like yourselves who have shown some sympathy to the Palestinian cause. \u201cI feel that your government exploits artists like you, playing on your natural desire to keep working \u2013 even if it does mean becoming part of a propaganda strategy. Your dance company might not be able to formally distance itself from the Israeli government but I can and will: I don\u2019t want my music to be licensed for any event sponsored by the Israeli embassy.\u201d In a statement Batsheva said: \u201cWe have fully respected Mr Eno\u2019s wish and replaced the music in Ohad Naharin\u2019s piece Humus from \u201cThree\u201d \u2013 and with great sadness \u2013 as we believe that this kind of action is useless and has no contribution towards solving the conflict, ending the occupation or bringing peace to our region.  \u201cOhad Naharin has been a political activist for years within Israel, and never hesitated to be very vocal about the situation in the West Bank and the consequences of the occupation. His deep commitment to the freedom of the human spirit is reflected in his actions as well as artistic creations.\u201d  \u2022 This article was amended on 8 September 2016 to clarify that Eno\u2019s music was replaced; the dance piece Humus was not withdrawn entirely.", "publicationDate": "2016-09-08T11:20:24Z", "title": "Brian Eno refuses to let Israeli dance company use his music", "sentences": ["The dance piece, which uses Eno\u2019s composition Neroli, has long been a staple of Batsheva, a Tel Aviv-based company."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/07/brian-eno-israeli-dance-company-batsheva-use-music"}, {"tags": ["Essays", "Society", "Books", "Globalisation", "Culture", "Peace and reconciliation", "EU referendum and Brexit", "Islamic State", "Human biology"], "article": "Recent events in the Middle East and Europe seem to breathe fresh life into the \u201cclash of civilisations\u201d thesis. Western incursions into the Middle East have triggered an Islamic backlash that has driven millions of Muslim refugees westwards and inspired terrorist attacks from Orlando to Nice; now the EU is unravelling as European voters abandon multicultural dreams in favour of xenophobic local identities. Allegedly, this has happened because the west has chosen to ignore the deep logic of history. According to the clash of civilisations thesis, humankind has always been divided into diverse civilisations whose members view the world in different and often irreconcilable ways. These incompatible world views make conflicts between civilisations inevitable, and these conflicts in turn fuel long-term historical processes. Just as in nature different species fight for survival, so throughout history civilisations have repeatedly clashed, and only the fittest have survived. Those who overlook this grim fact do so at their peril. The clash of civilisations thesis has far-reaching political implications. Its supporters contend that any attempt at\u00a0reconciliation between \u201cthe west\u201d and \u201cthe Muslim world\u201d is doomed to failure. They further maintain that the EU can work only if it renounces the multicultural fallacy in favour of an unabashed \u201cwestern\u201d identity. In the long run, only one culture can survive the unforgiving tests of natural selection, and if the EU refuses to save western civilisation from Islamic State and its ilk, Britain had better go\u00a0it\u00a0alone. Though widely held, this thesis is misleading. Isis may indeed pose a radical challenge, but the \u201ccivilisation\u201d it challenges is a global civilisation rather than a uniquely western phenomenon. Not for nothing has Isis managed to unite Iran with the\u00a0United States, and to create rare common ground between Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. And even Isis,\u00a0for all its medieval rhetoric, is grounded in contemporary global culture far more than in seventh-century Arabia; it caters to the fears and hopes of alienated, postmodern youth rather than to those of medieval shepherds and merchants. In pure organisational terms, Isis has more in\u00a0common with a large corporation like Google than with the Umayyad caliphate. The surest sign of a real clash of civilisations is mutual incomprehension. Isis, in contrast, comprehends its enemies only too well\u00a0\u2013 otherwise, its propaganda would not have been so effective. It is better, therefore, to see Isis as an errant offshoot of the global culture we all share, rather than as a branch of some mysterious alien tree.    Human groups may have distinct social systems, but these seldom endure for more than a few centuries    Crucially, the analogy between history and biology that underpins the clash of civilisations thesis is false. Human groups \u2013 including human civilisations \u2013 are fundamentally different from animal species, and historical conflicts differ greatly from natural selection processes. Animal species have objective identities that endure for thousands of generations. Whether you are a chimpanzee or a\u00a0gorilla depends on your genes rather than your beliefs, and different genes dictate diverse social behaviours. Chimpanzees live in mixed groups of\u00a0males and females. They compete for power by building coalitions of supporters among both sexes. Among gorillas, in contrast, a single dominant male establishes a harem of females, and usually expels any adult male that might challenge his position. As far as we know, the same social systems have characterised chimpanzees and gorillas not only in recent decades, but for hundreds of thousands of years. You find nothing like that among humans. Yes, human groups may have distinct social systems, but these are not genetically determined, and they seldom endure for more than a few centuries. Think of 20th-century Germans, for example. In fewer than 100 years, the Germans organised themselves into six very different systems: the Hohenzollern empire, the\u00a0Weimar republic, the Third Reich, Communist East Germany, the federal republic of West Germany, and finally democratic reunited Germany. Of course they kept their language and love of beer. But is there some unique German essence that distinguishes their country from all other nations, and that has remained unchanged from Wilhelm II to Angela Merkel? And if you do come up with something, was it also there back in the\u00a0days of Goethe, of Martin Luther and of Frederick Barbarossa?     What will happen when computers replace people in an increasing number of jobs? \u2026 Alex Proyas\u2019s I, Robot from 2004 Photograph: Allstar    The Preamble of the European Constitution (2004) begins by stating that it draws inspiration \u201cfrom the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe, from which have developed the universal values of\u00a0the inviolable and inalienable rights of the human person, democracy, equality, freedom and the rule of law\u201d. This may easily give one the impression that European civilisation is defined by these values. Countless speeches and documents draw a direct line from ancient Athenian democracy to the present-day EU, celebrating 2,500 years of European freedom and democracy. This is reminiscent of the proverbial blind man taking hold of an\u00a0elephant\u2019s tail and concluding that an elephant is a kind of brush. Athenian democracy was a half-hearted experiment that survived for barely 200 years in a small corner of the Balkans. If European civilisation for the last 25 centuries has been defined by democracy and human rights, what are we to make of Sparta and Julius Caesar, the Crusaders and Conquistadores, the Inquisition and the slave trade, Louis XIV and Goebbels, Lenin and Mussolini? European civilisation is anything Europeans make of it, just as Christianity is anything Christians make of it. And they have made remarkably different things of it over the centuries. Human groups are defined more by the\u00a0changes they undergo than by any continuity, but they nevertheless manage to create for themselves ancient identities thanks to their storytelling skills. No matter what revolutions they\u00a0survive, they can weave old and new into a single yarn. Even an individual may knit revolutionary personal changes into a coherent life story: \u201cI am that person who was once a socialist, but became a capitalist; I\u00a0was born in Senegal, and now live in France; I married, then got divorced; I\u00a0had cancer, and then got well again.\u201d Similarly, a human group such as the Germans may come to define itself by the very changes it has lived through: \u201cOnce we were Nazis, but we have learned our lesson, and now we are peaceful democrats\u201d. You don\u2019t need to look for some unique German essence that manifested itself first in Hitler and then in Merkel: this radical transformation itself makes the Germans who they are. Isis, too, may uphold an allegedly unchanging Muslim identity, but their story of Islam is a brand new tale. Yes,\u00a0they used some venerable Muslim texts and traditions to concoct it, but if\u00a0I bake a cake from flour, oil and sugar that have been sitting in my pantry for\u00a0the past two months, does it mean the cake itself is two months old? Conversely, those who dismiss Isis as \u201cun-Islamic\u201d or even \u201canti-Islamic\u201d are equally mistaken: Islam has no DNA. Just as with Christianity, Islam is whatever Muslims make of it.     Isis wrecked the ancient site of Palmyra in Syria. Photograph: Valery Sharifulin/Tass    Yet there is an even deeper difference distinguishing human groups from animal species. Species often split, but never merge. About seven million years ago, chimpanzees and gorillas had common ancestors. This single ancestral species split into two populations that eventually went their separate, evolutionary ways. Once this happened, there was no going back. Since individuals belonging to different species cannot produce fertile offspring together, species can never merge. Gorillas can\u2019t merge with chimpanzees, giraffes can\u2019t merge with elephants, and dogs can\u2019t merge with cats. Human tribes, in contrast, tend to coalesce over time into larger and larger groups. Modern Germans were created from the merger of Saxons, Prussians, Swabians and Bavarians, which not so long ago wasted little love on one another. The French were created from\u00a0the merger of Franks, Normans, Bretons, Gascons and Provencals. Meanwhile across the Channel, English, Scots, Welsh and Irish gradually came together (willingly or not) to form Britons. In the not too distant future, Germans, French and Britons might yet\u00a0merge into Europeans. Mergers don\u2019t always last, as people in London, Edinburgh and Brussels are well aware these days. Brexit may\u00a0well initiate the simultaneous unravelling of both the EU and the UK. But in the long run, history\u2019s direction is clear-cut. Ten thousand years ago humankind was divided into countless isolated tribes. With each passing millennium, these merged into larger and larger groups, creating fewer and\u00a0fewer distinct civilisations. In recent generations the few remaining civilisations have been merging into a\u00a0single global community. Political and ethnic divisions endure, but they do not undermine the fundamental unity. Indeed, some divisions are made possible only by an over-arching common structure. *** The process of human unification has\u00a0taken two distinct forms: weak heterogeneous unification and strong homogeneous unification. The weaker heterogeneous form involves creating ties between previously unrelated groups. The groups may continue to have different beliefs and practices, but are no longer independent of each other. From this perspective, even war\u00a0is a bond \u2013 perhaps the strongest bond of all. Ten thousand years ago, no\u00a0tribe in America had any quarrel with Middle Eastern enemies, and no African clan bore grudges towards any European. In contrast, during the second world war, people born on the shores of the Mississippi went to their deaths on Pacific islands and European meadows, while recruits from the heart of Africa fell fighting among French vineyards and Alpine snows. Historians often argue that globalisation reached a first peak in 1913, then went into a long decline during the era of the world wars and the cold war, and recuperated only after 1989. They fear that new conflicts may again put globalisation into reverse gear. This may be true of economic globalisation, but it ignores the different but equally important dynamics of military globalisation. War spreads ideas, technologies and people far more quickly than commerce. War also makes people far more interested in one another. Never had the US been more closely in touch with Russia than during the cold war, when every cough in a Moscow corridor sent\u00a0people scrambling up and down Washington staircases. People care far more about their enemies than about their trade partners. For every US film about Thailand, there are probably 20 about Vietnam. The global \u201cwar on terror\u201d simply continues the process of\u00a0military globalisation.      Nowadays, the global unity of conflict is perhaps most apparent on the internet, where Isis and the drug cartels are rubbing shoulders with Google and Facebook, and YouTube offers funny cat videos alongside instructions on how to make bombs. Islamic fanatics, murderous drug dealers and geeky hackers don\u2019t exist on unrelated planets; they share the same global cyberspace. All are thrilled\u00a0by the blockchain technology that gave us the bitcoin; all count on easy accessibility via ubiquitous smartphones, and all are antagonised by national governments attempting to wrest control of the net. Yet the world of the early 21st century has gone way beyond the heterogeneous unity of conflict. People across the globe are not only influenced by one another, they increasingly share identical beliefs and practices. A thousand years ago, planet Earth was home to dozens of different political models. In Europe you could find feudal principalities vying with independent city states and minuscule theocracies. The\u00a0Muslim world had its caliphate, claiming universal sovereignty, but also experimented with kingdoms, emirates and sultanates. The Chinese empire believed itself to be the sole legitimate political entity, while to its north and west tribal confederacies fought each other with glee. India and south-east Asia contained a kaleidoscope of regimes, whereas polities in America, Africa and Australasia ranged from tiny hunter-gatherer bands to sprawling empires. No wonder even neighbouring human groups had trouble agreeing on diplomatic practices, not to mention international laws. Each society had its own political paradigms, and found it difficult to understand \u2013 let alone respect \u2013 alien political concepts.    Today there are nearly 200 sovereign states, which generally agree on diplomatic protocols and common international laws    Today, in contrast, a single political paradigm is accepted everywhere. The planet is divided between nearly 200 sovereign states, which generally agree on the same diplomatic protocols and on common international laws. Sweden, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea and Paraguay are all marked on our world maps as the same kind of colourful shapes; they are all members of the UN; and despite myriad differences they are all recognised as sovereign states enjoying similar rights and privileges. Indeed, they share many more political ideas and practices, including at least a token belief in representative bodies, universal suffrage and human rights. When Israelis and Palestinians, Russians and Ukrainians, or Kurds and\u00a0Turks court global public opinion, they all use the same discourse of human rights, state sovereignty and international law. The world may be peppered with various types of \u201cfailed states\u201d, but it knows only one paradigm for a successful state. Global politics follows \u201cthe Anna Karenina principle\u201d: healthy states are all alike, but every failed state fails in its own way, by missing this or that ingredient of the dominant political package. Isis stands out in its complete rejection of this package, and its attempt to establish an\u00a0entirely different kind of political entity \u2013 a universal caliphate. But it is unlikely to succeed precisely for this reason. Numerous guerrilla forces and terror organisations have managed to establish new countries or conquer existing ones, but they have always done so by accepting the fundamental principles of the global political order. Even the Taliban sought international recognition as the legitimate government of the sovereign country of Afghanistan. No group rejecting the principles of global politics has so far\u00a0gained lasting control of a significant territory. *** In pre-modern times, humans experimented not only with diverse political blueprints, but with a mind-boggling variety of economic models. Russian boyars, Hindu maharajas, Chinese mandarins and Amerindian tribal chiefs had very different ideas about money and taxation, and none was even aware of the existence of such a\u00a0thing as \u201cthe economy\u201d. Nowadays, in contrast, almost everybody believes in slightly different variations on the same capitalist theme, and we are all cogs within a single global production line. Whether you live in Mongolia, New Zealand or Bolivia, your daily routines and economic fortunes depend on the same economic theories, the same corporations and banks, and the same currents of capital. When finance ministers or bank managers from China, Russia, Brazil and India meet, they have a common language, and can\u00a0easily understand and sympathise with their counterparts\u2019 woes. When Isis conquered large parts of Syria and Iraq, it murdered tens of thousands of people, demolished archaeological sites, toppled statues and systematically destroyed the symbols of previous regimes and of western cultural influence. Yet when Isis fighters entered the banks and found stashes of US dollars covered with the faces of American presidents and English slogans praising American political and religious ideals, they did not burn these dollars. For the dollar bill is universally venerated across all political and religious divides. Though it has no intrinsic value \u2013 you cannot eat or drink a dollar bill \u2013 trust in the dollar and in the wisdom of the Federal Reserve is so firm it is shared even by Islamic fundamentalists, Mexican drug lords and North Korean tyrants.     Doctors all over the word will dispense similar medicines made by the same drug companies Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo    Yet the homogeneity of contemporary humanity is most apparent when it comes to our view of the natural world and of the human body. If you fell sick in 1016, it mattered a great deal where you lived. In Europe, the resident priest would probably tell you\u00a0that you\u00a0had made God angry, and\u00a0that in order to regain your health, you should donate something to the church, make a pilgrimage to a sacred site, and pray\u00a0fervently for God\u2019s forgiveness. Alternatively, the village witch might explain that a demon had possessed you, and that she could cast the demon\u00a0out using song, dance and the\u00a0blood of a black cockerel. In the Middle East, doctors brought up on classical traditions might explain that your four bodily humours were out of\u00a0balance, and you could harmonise them anew with a proper diet and foul-smelling potions. In India, Ayurvedic experts would offer their own theories concerning the balance between the\u00a0three bodily elements known as doshas, and recommend a treatment of\u00a0herbs, massages and exercises. Chinese physicians, Siberian shamans, African witch doctors, Amerindian medicine men \u2013 every empire, kingdom and tribe had its own traditions and experts, each espousing different views about the human body and the nature of sickness, and each offering its own cornucopia of rituals, concoctions and\u00a0cures. Some of them worked surprisingly well; others were little short of\u00a0a death sentence. The one thing that\u00a0united European, Chinese, African and American medical conditions was that everywhere at least a third of people died before adulthood, and nowhere did average life expectancy exceed 40. Today, if you are taken ill, it makes far less difference where you live. In Toronto, Tokyo, Tehran or Tel Aviv, you will be taken to similar-looking hospitals, where you will meet doctors who learned the same scientific theories in not-too-different medical colleges. They will follow identical protocols and use identical tests to reach very similar diagnoses. They will then dispense similar medicines made by the same drug companies. There are still some minor cultural differences, but Canadian, Japanese, Iranian and Israeli physicians hold much the same views about the human body and human diseases. After Isis captured Raqqa and Mosul, it did not tear down the hospitals; rather, it launched an appeal to Muslim doctors and nurses throughout the world to volunteer their services there. Presumably, even Isis doctors and nurses believe that the body is made of cells, that diseases are caused by pathogens, and that antibiotics kill bacteria. And what makes up these cells and bacteria? Indeed, what makes up the entire world? Back in 1016, every culture had its own story about the universe, and about the fundamental ingredients of the cosmic soup. Today, learned people throughout the world believe exactly the same things about matter, energy, time and space. Take, for example, Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. The whole problem with it is that the Iranians have exactly the same view of physics as the Israelis and Americans. If the Iranians believed that E=mc\u2074, Israel would not care an iota about their nuclear programme.    Churchill wasn\u2019t more western than Hitler; their struggle defined what it meant to be western at that moment in history    People still claim to believe in different things. But when it comes to\u00a0the really important stuff \u2013 how to build a state, an economy, a hospital, or a weapon \u2013 almost all of us belong to\u00a0the same civilisation. There are disagreements, no doubt, but then all\u00a0civilisations have their internal disagreements \u2013 indeed, they are defined by these disagreements. When\u00a0trying to outline their identity, people often make a grocery list of common traits. They would fare much better if they made a list of common conflicts and dilemmas instead. In 1940, Britain and\u00a0Germany had very different traits, yet they were both part and parcel of \u201cwestern civilisation\u201d. Churchill wasn\u2019t more western than Hitler; rather, the struggle between them defined what it meant to be western at that particular moment in history. In contrast, a !Kung hunter-gatherer in 1940 wasn\u2019t western, because the internal western clash about race and empire would have made little sense to him. The people we fight most often are our own family members. Identity is defined by conflicts and dilemmas more than by agreements. What does it mean to be European in 2016? It doesn\u2019t mean to have white skin, to believe in\u00a0Jesus Christ, or to uphold liberty. Rather, it means to argue vehemently about immigration, about the EU, and about the limits of capitalism. It also means to obsessively ask yourself \u201cWhat defines my identity?\u201d and to worry about an ageing population, about rampant consumerism and about global warming without really knowing what to do about it. In their conflicts and dilemmas, 21st-century Europeans are very different from their early-modern and medieval ancestors, but are increasingly similar to their Chinese and Indian contemporaries. Whatever changes await us, they are\u00a0likely to involve a fraternal struggle within a single civilisation rather than a clash between alien civilisations. The\u00a0big challenges of the 21st century will be global in nature. What will happen when pollution triggers global climate changes? What will happen when computers replace people in an\u00a0increasing number of jobs? When biotechnology enables us to upgrade humans, extend lifespans, and perhaps split humankind into different biological castes? No doubt, we will have huge arguments and bitter conflicts over these questions. But these arguments and conflicts are unlikely to drive us apart. Just the opposite. They will make us ever more interdependent, as members of a single, rowdy, global civilisation. \u2022 Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow is published by Harvill Secker. ynharari.com", "publicationDate": "2016-09-09T07:59:56Z", "title": "Isis is as much an offshoot of our global civilisation as Google", "sentences": ["In Toronto, Tokyo, Tehran or Tel Aviv, you will be taken to similar-looking hospitals, where you will meet doctors who learned the same scientific theories in not-too-different medical colleges."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/09/isis-global-civilisation-google-yuval-noah-harari"}, {"tags": ["Art", "Museums", "Art and design", "V&A", "Protest", "World news", "Isaac Julien", "Culture", "Elmgreen & Dragset", "Sarah Sze", "Doug Aitken"], "article": "In repressive states, the role of the artist is unambiguous: to assert the individual imagination, the singular power that all dictatorships fear. I remember once talking to the Czech dissident and writer Ivan Klima, who had been subject both to the arbitrary horror of a Nazi concentration camp as a child and the long grinding years of Soviet occupation in which he had become a \u201cnon-person\u201d for two decades, harassed constantly by secret police and unable to speak or write in public. He survived by \u201cliving in truth\u201d. \u201cI have always pursued inner freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never been censored.\u201d Klima was part of that group of artists and writers who gathered in the Magic Lantern theatre in Prague in 1989 to orchestrate the \u201cVelvet Revolution\u201d and see their dreams of liberation realised. And how did it feel to experience freedom, to have the external world finally correspond with that interior life for the first time?     Czech writer Ivan Klima: \u2018I have never been censored.\u2019 Photograph: Eamonn McCabe for the Guardian    \u201cIt is interesting that a man very quickly accepts freedom as a normal thing,\u201d Klima said. \u201cThough we had fought for it for so long, after a few weeks or months we did not think about it. Rather you start to see things you would like to change, things that make you angry, corruption and so forth, environmental problems, the obsession with the market\u2026\u201d Habits of protest die hard. There are, of course, many courageous artists across the world with Klima\u2019s stubborn courage. Ai Weiwei is only the best known, but he remains a crucial figure, one irrepressible man living in truth who reveals the billion lies attending China\u2019s advance into the world. Weiwei used to reject the idea he was a political figure, insisting that he was only an artist (as if the two were distinguishable). After his imprisonment in 2012, his tone seemed to change. \u201cPeople are always wondering if I am an artist or politician,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just clearly tell you: whatever I do is not art. Let\u2019s say it is just objects or materials, movies or writing, but not art, OK?\u201d    How do you stick it to the man when the man is a tax-dodging global network of information systems run by smart hippies?    In Russia, Pussy Riot have acquired something of Weiwei\u2019s power \u2013 the power to prove the futility of censorship and the integrity of protest. They took their inspiration from the Voina, a group which, like all the best art political movements, trailed a manifesto. Point one read: \u201cCreate the rebirth of heroical behavioural ideals of an artist-intellectual\u2026 the artist as romantic hero, who prevails over evil. Produce lively romantic models in contrast with today\u2019s soulless commercial conceptual art.\u201d Voina\u2019s most famous performance was a protest against the 2008 election of President Medvedev. This \u201clively romantic\u201d act took place in the Moscow Biological Museum, beside a stuffed bear. Five couples from Voina undressed and had vigorous sex in the hall. One of the participants, Alexei Plutser-Sarno, described the work as the only honest portrait of pre-election Russia: \u201cEverybody fucks each other, and the puppy bear\u201d [a nickname for Medvedev] \u201clooks on with an unconcealed scorn.\u201d     Pussy Riot perform in Moscow\u2019s Christ the Saviour cathedral to protest Putin\u2019s return to the Kremlin, 2012. Photograph: Sergey Ponomarev/AP    In the west, where freedoms of speech are, theoretically at least, guaranteed in law, the challenge for an artist to make an effective political statement is more complex. Where anything goes, where we are flooded daily with millions of uncensored images, what honestly gives us pause, or makes a statement? Perhaps as a result of this, the art world, that moving spectacle of expos and fairs and biennials \u2013 Voina\u2019s \u201csoulless commercial conceptual art\u201d \u2013 can appear to exist in a self-referential bubble. The suddenly hardening political moment, however \u2013 where across Europe and in the US, liberal certainties feel under threat \u2013 seems to call for a different kind of artistic engagement. What that might look like is still under construction. Street art and the outlaw sloganeering of Banksy was one effort to test the in-house freedoms of the gallery in less permissive spaces. Another, more rigorous attempt would be the inspiring project of the American Theaster Gates in Chicago\u2019s South Side. Gates is using the material of his historically blighted neighbourhood, repurposed as art, to regenerate entire blocks of that community and connect its residents with a radical civil rights past, making black lives matter in bricks and mortar. His 2011 collection, In the Event of a Race Riot, coiled a series decommissioned fire hoses from the civil rights era in gilt-frame boxes. They sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars and Gates ploughed the money directly back into community projects.

Protest, which opens later this month at the Victoria Miro gallery in London, will dramatise some of them. It is a show, in some ways, nostalgic for the dualities of 60s protest (currently celebrated in the V&amp;A exhibition You Say You Want a Revolution?). Taking as a starting point the American painter Alice Neel\u2019s prophetic 1936 painting, Nazis Murder Jews, which depicts a Communist party torchlight parade through the streets of New York City, it collects new and recent pieces that address in different ways our own disorienting political moment. Work that confronts, often obliquely, the struggles around migration, censorship, Black Lives Matter, the rise of surveillance and the re-emergence, across Europe and in the US, of the populist right.    I wanted something that existed outside any system\u2026 a living platform for the artists to experiment'  Doug Aitken     Speaking to some of the artists involved in the show in the past week, I found a consensus about two things. The first was that, with the phenomenon of Trump in America and the threats to cohesive democracy in Europe, the need for a politically engaged art has rarely been more urgent. The second was that the means to that end are necessarily nuanced. It is harder to challenge power if, in a globalised world, you don\u2019t know precisely where power lies. How do you stick it to the man, when the man in question is not a state or a corporation, but, increasingly a tax-dodging global network of information systems run by smart former hippies with untold wealth?     Nazis Murder Jews, 1936, by Alice Neel. Photograph: Courtesy the Artist\u2019s Estate and Victoria Miro, London    Western artists are generally uneasy at being viewed as political in the way that Weiwei has come to accept; they see it as a limit on their asserted freedom. Michael Elmgreen, one half of the celebrated provocateur duo Elmgreen &amp; Dragset, winced a little when I used the phrase \u201cprotest art\u201d. He doesn\u2019t, he said, feel comfortable under that banner. \u201cI feel that more political activists like Pussy Riot have a different kind of approach. Our statements are more influenced by ideas of infiltration.\u201d    Masses of information is coming at us and the speed of it makes the hierarchy of what to protest against very slippery  Sarah Sze     Why not something more direct? \u201cTake something like Occupy Wall Street,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re making yourself as an otherness, an opponent, you try to fight power in that way. Unfortunately, in 99% of cases you lose because you are not strong enough to fight an established power structure. So we prefer to go in and try to clarify how easily these existing structures could be changed. Show how fragile and unstable they are.\u201d Most famously, with this project in mind, the duo built a replica Prada shop in the middle of the howling Texas desert, to suggest even artful capitalism would pass.

Photograph: Matt Slocum/AP    When showing work in China, some western artists have had a small taste of what Ai WeiWei encounters daily. Sarah Sze, the American sculptor, who creates wonderful, unsettling mind maps of consumerist detritus that spill across the gallery floor, fell foul of the Chinese censors in Guangzhou. While in no way comparing her situation to that of Ai Weiwei, in some ways confronting the blunt instrument of censorship gave her work extra force and clarity, she suggested. \u201cProtest requires focus,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the Occupy movement could have focused around one moment or image \u2013 like John and Yoko in a bed \u2013 it would have helped that movement a lot. My work really reflects the sense, I think, that we have masses of information coming at us from sources we don\u2019t know, and the speed of that makes the hierarchy of what to protest against very slippery all the time.\u201d Sze is somewhat wistful for the simple visual protests of her student years. \u201cAt my American college the entire main campus was filled with shanty towns protesting apartheid. A lot of students were kicked out as a result. Those are the kinds of things where art can be dangerous to power.\u201d In our digital age did she feel that any solid act of making becomes a political act? \u201cThere\u2019s an incredible longing for stillness,\u201d she said, \u201cin the way that you stand in front of a Vermeer and are having a physical conversation with Vermeer across time and place. The idea of the hand-made itself can be quite conservative. But what seems important to me is how you create a moment where you feel the presence of the maker, a live conversation. You see it in the growth of live events and talks and happenings. The premium on storytelling. Museum attendance rates even have gone through the ceiling.\u201d     Ai Weiwei\u2019s installation depicting a scene from his time in prison. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA    That one-to-one connection in itself might suggest a form of protest at the way culture and relationships are now mediated \u2013 the acceptance that conversation and intimacy are structurally eavesdropped by corporations and government. One of the motivations for American Doug Aitken\u2019s ongoing Station to Station project, which took groups of artists coast to the coast in the States by train, making spontaneous 60s-style happenings on the way, was to avoid any mediation at all. \u201cI wanted something that existed outside any system,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted a living platform for the artists to experiment. To be open to what crosses your path.\u201d What were the moments in that journey that he enjoyed most? \u201cI think of an artist like Ed Ruscha, famous for his painting. His response was to make 300 cactus omelettes out in the desert,\u201d he said. \u201cOr a musician like Beck who said he had always wanted to work with, like, a huge choir of gospel singers but he had never been allowed to do it in the commercial sector. So we were able to do that in an abandoned drive-in theatre in the middle of the desert where the train stopped, and the sound of this vocal was like a huge turbine engine, at dusk, and the warm wind blowing and you are in the middle of nowhere in America. It feels untethered to any existing system. Those kinds of situations are very special.\u201d     Station to Station, Doug Aitken\u2019s journey through modern creativity. Photograph: Doug Aitken    At a time of political insanity such as that which is unfolding in this American election, Aitken suggested it was an artist\u2019s role to create alternative visions of society, or just to create for the hell of it. It is an honourable tradition. The abstract painter Joan Mir\u00f3 was never a political activist in a conventional sense, but he was always his own man. When he was asked late in life what he had done to oppose General Franco, he didn\u2019t hesitate to reply: \u201cFree and radical things.\u201d Aitken agreed. \u201cAny worthwhile art is never optional,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a political strategy. It\u2019s an extension of who you are and how you see the world. It\u2019s always non-negotiable.\u201d Michael Elmgreen: \u2018The internet has made us very egocentric individuals\u2026 we have lost our sense of belonging\u2019     Michael Elmgreen, left, with Ingar Dragset: \u2018Art can make people less fearful.\u2019 Photograph: Getty Images    The Danish artist Michael Elmgreen has worked in a partnership with the Norwegian artist Ingar Dragset since 1995. Their 2012 bronze of a boy on a rocking horse occupied the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, as a comment on the surrounding statues commemorating war heroes. For the Protest show, they will display a replica prison cell, broken up as if by an earthquake, which they first showed in S\u00e3o Paulo.  We are living at a time when the freedom to offend - and to protest - is widely under threat. Is it ever more important as an artist to make those statements?Fear is a very unfortunate thing for a culture if you want to make it vibrant and dynamic. And fear of offence shows you are scared of what happens if people express their opinions. That often ends up in a kind of stagnation, with everyone holding each other at gunpoint. It also ends up giving men like Nigel Farage or Donald Trump their popularity, because people are fed up being told what they can or cannot say in public. They vote as a protest, no matter what the consequences of it.    The really frightening thing is that the generation now in their 20s, they don\u2019t believe things can be better    How do we process these things? Can art create that space?Art can work with it in a different way than a sensational news way. Art is not just some loose information that you get on the internet. You are confronted with something physical and hopefully the art statement is a bit more nuanced and even profound. We recently did a show in Israel at the Tel Aviv museum. In their main hall, we put a full-scale replica of a section of the Berlin Wall. We moved to Berlin soon after the wall came down, so we felt we could speak about walls in general and hoped that it would make people think about the wall that had been built between Palestine and Israel. We come from outside, we don\u2019t live with that conflict. But we could speak about our experience of how important it was for us that the Berlin Wall came down What response did you get?People were moved by it, I think, especially because we did no finger pointing. It was something for them to stand in front of a wall as a single person being blocked in their movement. And we were of course also speaking about Donald Trump\u2019s idea of building a wall at the Mexican border. It is not uncommon to try to solve problems by putting up a physical barrier. But it doesn\u2019t often work.     Powerless Structures Fig 101, by Elmgreen &amp; Dragset, on the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square, 2012. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    Given the fevered political moment across Europe and in the States, is there more of an urgency for artists to have a position?Absolutely. We have lost our sense of being good citizens, of having a wider vision. That sounds quite old school and nostalgic, but it is true. Politics has just become economics \u2013 how much do I pay in tax, how much do I get? The internet has made us very egocentric individuals. We are no longer proud of, say, being part of a third generation of steel workers that built a country. We call ourselves \u201cworking class\u201d or \u201cartist\u201d or \u201cfeminist\u201d or \u201chomosexual\u201d in a very different way from the way we would have said those things in the 1960s. We have lost our sense of belonging. What are the consequences of that?We have a very cynical media landscape and the internet fuels that. We don\u2019t hear enough: how can we make this in a different way? The really frightening thing is that the generation now in their 20s, they don\u2019t believe things can be better. That is not only very unusual, it is also super-fucking-dangerous. How can art help in that?Press and politicians focus on fear-mongering. People are easy to control if they are fearful. That\u2019s how art can make a difference, I think: it can make people less fearful. Sarah Sze: \u2018 I just gave an artwork to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign\u2019     Sarah Sze: \u2018The powers that be here are more aware [than in China] that the moment you shut something down you make it radical.\u2019 Photograph: Suki Dhanda for the Observer    Sarah Sze\u2019s intricate installations were described by the New Yorker as \u201cchanging the potential for sculpture\u201d. She has been awarded a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant and represented the US at the 2013 Venice Biennale.  What\u2019s the history of the piece you have made for this Protest show?I originally made a version of the piece for a show in Philadelphia. Every day, I kept the front page of the New York Times and cut out the pictures and replaced them with pictures that were vast in terms of time and space \u2013 there could be an image of the ocean, an image from 500 years ago\u2026 I was interested in contrasting what was newsworthy with these timeless images. That piece was then accepted for a triennial in Guangzhou. When we were shipping it we were contacted by the Chinese authorities saying they wanted specific front pages to be removed. What was the problem?It turned out that every front page I was being asked to remove said something about China; it could be just a phrase or something. So I made a new version for China. The piece was actually on the floor, like it was protecting the floor, spattered with paint and so on. So I took black paint and painted out the parts they wanted redacted and then mentioned the fact in the wall note. For this show, I have done the opposite. I left in all the pieces I had redacted and painted black all the rest of the text.     Third Wednesday, 2016, from Sarah Sze\u2019s Calendar Series. Photograph: Courtesy the artist/Victoria Miro, London    So it wasn\u2019t conceived as a narrowly political work, but the Chinese censors gave it that edge?Yes. It was amazing to me that the Chinese government actually paid such attention. It suggests a belief that art has a major influence on society.    At Columbia. I\u2019ve had to remind students a few times that making art is not like going to business or law school    Have we become complacent about these things in the west?Perhaps. But the powers that be here are more aware that the moment you shut something down you make it radical. Those things backfire on politicians. We are living in quite extreme political times, suddenly. Does that feel like something that you feel you need to respond to in a direct way?Artists respond in different ways. I just gave an artwork to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and a lot of artists are doing that. Some of the artworks that have been given are demonstrably anti-Trump but you have to be careful making direct statements because it can be turned on its head very quickly. Why did you donate to Clinton?We\u2019re at a very critical point in the US and I wanted to do anything I could to see things move in a better direction. Everyone needs to do something. There is this great sense still of: oh, of course that won\u2019t happen, but at each point so far it has been predicted very poorly. Can artists lead that action? Is it a moment where culture needs to assert its values?The conversation is going on certainly. I think campuses got very deradicalised in the US in the first 10 years of this century; I don\u2019t know why. Over here, the money became so absurd for young artists in the public eye that it became difficult to see them as radical. I suppose the sense grew that being an artist was a career option, and a lucrative one, in the way that it had really never been\u2026Absolutely. I\u2019m a professor at Columbia. I find I\u2019ve had to remind students a few times that making art is not like going to business or law school. You are not guaranteed an outcome. Isaac Julien: \u2018There\u2019s always more than one story going on\u2019     Isaac Julien: \u2018It doesn\u2019t help to resort to the clich\u00e9s of protest.\u2019 Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    London-born Isaac Julien began to explore the crisis of migration into Europe in 2007 with his prophetic film, Western Union: Small Boats, which explored the perilous crossing from North Africa. He was speaking from Rio where he is installing his follow-up work, 10,000 Waves, about the world of the Chinese cockle pickers who drowned on Morecambe Bay in 2004. Brazil is the 30th country in which it has been shown.  Does your work always have a journalistic impulse in the beginning? Yes, it\u2019s usually connected to something in the real world. I read the news all the time, like everyone does, but when you make art you are trying to see how to move beyond the headline. How do you make a work that will stand the test of time? You need to give some visceral and emotional relationship to the story. As soon as I read the cockle-picker story I knew I would make something. The problem is how to shape it. It haunts you.    The Ukip stuff is nostalgia\u2026 for England to become great again. But that \u201cgreatness\u201d was intimately connected to empire    Your first film looked at the black artist Langston Hughes and the Harlem renaissance that was a forerunner of the civil-rights movement. Is it harder for artist activists to find a focus for protest now?At the moment art is seeking to find the right questions rather than come up with answers. And that is an important role. We\u2019re in a much more complex world now. As artists it doesn\u2019t help to resort to clich\u00e9s of protest. Oddly, there is a lot of new interest in Looking for Langston. It is partly because of Black Lives Matter. As the political culture of Trump has brought about a nostalgia for very conservative values, there\u2019s a sort of balancing re-engagement with civil rights. The current situation in Britain seems to be parallelling what happened in the 1980s with the collapse of a coherent left and the dominance of a xenophobic Tory party. The strongest critique of Thatcherism came from writers and film-makers. Are we not crying out for something like that?Culture can provide a place for thinking things through in opposition, which is desperately needed at the moment. There is a crisis. I was very influenced by the thinking of [the cultural theorist] Stuart Hall. Those people were very good at looking at the political scene and providing a language to discuss it.     Isaac Julien\u2019s Western Union Series no. 10 (Sculpture for the New Millennium), 2007. Photograph: Courtesy the Artist and Victoria Miro, London    It makes no sense in many ways for us to think in national terms in art or politics or anything else any more - our world is characterised by interdependence - but is the \u201cinternational\u201d artist in danger of becoming unmoored in some ways, of losing a connection with the audience?I wouldn\u2019t say that Western Union: Small Boats was unmoored. I have a background in London, but my parents were from the Caribbean, so you have that internationalism into your DNA. Is creating art that has a global range of reference in itself a protest against the advance of Little England rhetoric?I think so. The Ukip stuff is nostalgia. I can understand it. The nostalgia is for England to become great again. But that \u201cgreatness\u201d was intimately connected to empire, you can\u2019t forget that. The OBE is still not the Order of British Excellence. It is the Order of the British Empire. Is the multicultural ideal advanced by Hall and others more under threat than ever?There is always more than one story going on. At the same time as we had Brexit, London voted for a mayor with an Indian and Muslim background. There is a double movement between the metropolitan idea of England and the reaction against that. But it\u2019s not clear which one is winning just now. Doug Aitken: \u2018There\u2019s a constant river of images from millions of iPhones. The question is: what has potency?\u2019     Doug Aitken: \u2019The Station to Station project was born out of a desire for action.\u2019 Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    Doug Aitken is an American artist and curator, best known recently for his creation Station to Station, which invited a 100 artists from all disciplines \u2013 including musician Beck and conceptual artist Olafur Eliasson \u2013 to take a train from coast to coast across America and stop along the way to create a series of 60s-style \u201chappenings\u201d. He lives, inevitably, in California.  Did you see Station to Station in the tradition of the great American road trip of the 50s and 60s?I did, but the project was born out of a desire for action. It\u2019s really interesting how segregated music, art, cinema, books and so on are. With Station to Station, instead of critiquing this, we tried to create something that erases the separation, that allowed many artists to be in motion together. Do you think that fragmentation is a way of controlling those cultural forces?I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a conspiracy. Different mediums create infrastructures and infrastructures slow down the possibilities for change. It\u2019s funny. When I was talking to the gallery about Protest it conjured those ideas of a feminist rally in 1978 and people standing out in the cold with placards. The tools we have to work with now are so different. The power of an image to transmit an idea coherently is so much reduced. Take those seminal images from Vietnam \u2013 the monk setting himself on fire or the child running from the napalm. Those images were disseminated by conventional media. Now there\u2019s a constant river of images from millions of iPhones. The question is: what has potency? Technology is opening up incredible new possibilities but also dangers, not least a sense of the loss of self. It is a twilight that we are living in right now, which is very unpredictable and also very stimulating.    I don\u2019t separate social and political work from any other art. The value of any art is to forge new questions    On a political level, that twilight sense seems to have led to the rise of these populist political leaders who promise control. What do you make of the Trump phenomenon?The whole presidential race in America right now is like an enormous hologram projected on the sky. We all look up at it. It is like a cloud that will never leave us but it has no meaning or substance.         Watch the trailer for Doug Aitken\u2019s Station to Station.    At some point soon, though, it might have real meaning for a lot of lives. Do we not need to find a direct way to engage with it?It\u2019s an interesting question and a strange time to ask it. What I see mostly is an incredible political apathy. By and large, the political system appears so corporate-driven that people have a hard time seeing how they can affect it. When you get to that point, real change comes from secession. The most interesting projects or groups or actions now don\u2019t exist in opposition in a traditional protest way, but as something entirely separate from the mainstream, for example, the Slow Food Movement, which is people following something they believe in ethically but also taking away the capital that is funding the existing system. They are voting with what they purchase or don\u2019t purchase. Can art work in the same way?I don\u2019t separate social and political work as different from any other art. The value of any art is to be curious and to forge new languages and questions. The whole landscape has changed. You don\u2019t have to wait for a single critic in New York to come to your exhibition or hear your music. We don\u2019t have those high peaks of culture and dark valleys of culture \u2013 everything is eroded down to this kind of universal jungle. We are all our own critics and sponsors now.

The windows light up, each becoming a \u201cpixel\u201d on a giant screen measuring 3,000 square metres. A pair of 1.5 metre joysticks is installed outside in Rabin Square; whoever gets there first can play what is probably the world\u2019s biggest game of Tetris. The stunt is designed to draw attention to the upcoming DLD Tel Aviv Innovation Festival, which starts later this month. While admittedly fun, and a good advertisement for the innovation festival, the giant game \u2013 which also becomes Snake or Pong at different times \u2013 is (somewhat ironically) not particularly innovative. Back in 2001, Project Blinkenlights lit up Haus des Lehrers in Berlin\u2019s Alexanderplatz, allowing people to use their Nokia handsets to play Pong. Since them, students at Brown, MIT and Kiel have pulled similar stunts. You can even play Snake on the fountains in London\u2019s Granary Square. Nor, it must be said, does Tel Aviv\u2019s Tetris intervention do much for the city. Turning city hall into a video game probably isn\u2019t an effective way to get people interested in what happens within. And with room for only two players at a time, it hardly encourages broader interaction. Even 2004\u2019s Pac-Manhattan (which was surely an inevitability, given the strength of that wordplay), which saw five players in a control room guide five players dressed as Pac-Man characters through the New York City streets, got more people and places involved. So is there more to these stunts than PR?            Despite what this year\u2019s Pokemania might suggest, games have long been central to public spaces. A few years after the first world war, the Italian town of Marostica hosted the first of what would become a biennial game of chess played with human pieces, reenacting the (potentially fictional) story of a medieval lord who ordered his daughter\u2019s two suitors to play for her hand. Earlier this year, the Boris Johnson-endorsed Games London temporarily installed a giant Monopoly board in Trafalgar Square, with the familiar locations replaced with notable years in the history of UK video game development. \u201cIt was a bit of a gimmick to get attention from some of the press and from passersby,\u201d admits Michael French, Games London\u2019s senior games programme executive. Similar to the Tetris tournament in Tel Aviv, Games London was part of the London Games festival, which aims to drive investment into games companies in the city.

It\u2019s not as interesting to me as a game design challenge.\u201d Matheson Marcault\u2019s contribution to the London Games Festival was a three-day event called Now Play This. Two teams of children faced off across the river Thames in a game of Massive Battleships, making their moves by holding up signs at which their opponents, on the other side of the river, peered through binoculars. In the courtyard of Somerset House, meanwhile, Just Add People saw groups of players construct imaginative buildings out of sticks and balls.     People play Pass the Impossibly Large Parcel on the South Bank, London in 2010. Photograph: 815 Agency    \u201cBuilding your own pretend building within the context of the real buildings that are sitting there imposingly and have been there for hundreds of years, for me made me feel like part of the city,\u201d says Gramazio.  One event that really captures that feeling is GameCity, a yearly takeover of Nottingham that incorporates the history and geography of the city, from specially commissioned games playable in Old Market Square to the revival of the traditional Sheriff\u2019s Gauntlet trials. Now that GameCity has opened the fun-filled National Videogame Arcade, Nottingham is a city of games all year round. As well as encouraging people to pay more attention to the challenges facing their city, Gramazio thinks that games can get us to pay more attention to each other. Citizens of Hildesheim and Oberhausen, Germany, can play games with strangers on the opposite side of a pedestrian crossing via prototypes of a new kind of traffic-light button called ActiWait (though the promise to \u201cconvert boring waiting times into positive experiences\u201d smacks of dystopian science fiction).  Big events like the yearly MP3 Experiments, for which thousands of people download an MP3 of instructions and gather for synchronised play, and 2012\u2019s New Year Games, in which two teams competed in challenges such as throwing paper aeroplanes at invisible musicians and stealing ribbons from a man dressed as a minotaur, bring thousands of people together.     Children play Pokemon Go in Mexico City on 21 August 2016. Photograph: Carlos Jasso/Reuters    One morning in July 2010, outside the National Theatre, Londoners played a game called Pass the Impossibly Large Parcel. Each layer of the parcel, when unwrapped, revealed \u201cprizes\u201d in the form of costume items. Players wore them before they went about their day \u2013 a kind of tribal identification, marking you on the tube or the office as a member of a secret club. Those who took part in the early days of Pokemon Go phenomenon will recognise that feeling of camaraderie. The game\u2019s sense of community has manifested in 9,000-strong gatherings, and charitable play such as dropping lures outside hospitals so that sick kids can catch Pokemon from their beds.  One of the most common complaints about cities is that the crowds can leave one feeling lost and lonely. Games counter that by connecting us to each other and the spaces in which we play. Tetris in Tel Aviv might be a bit of a damp squib, but only because it had a deeper potential. \u201cPlaying is a thing that we usually do in places that feel like they\u2019re ours \u2013 like we\u2019re safe there,\u201d says Gramazio. \u201cHaving that happen in a city, where people are wandering through, can make me as a player feel more at home.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion", "publicationDate": "2016-09-13T07:08:30Z", "title": "Tetris on an office building: can 'gamifying' cities help improve them?", "sentences": ["Every Thursday evening, Tel Aviv\u2019s city hall is transformed.", "The stunt is designed to draw attention to the upcoming DLD Tel Aviv Innovation Festival, which starts later this month.", "Nor, it must be said, does Tel Aviv\u2019s Tetris intervention do much for the city.", "Similar to the Tetris tournament in Tel Aviv, Games London was part of the London Games festival, which aims to drive investment into games companies in the city.", "Tetris in Tel Aviv might be a bit of a damp squib, but only because it had a deeper potential."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/13/tetris-tel-aviv-gamifying-cities-pr"}, {"tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Second world war", "Culture"], "article": "Nir Baram is an Israeli writer. Good People, his second novel, has been translated into 10 languages and is now published in English by Text. He writes for Haaretz and other newspapers and lives in Tel Aviv. This book looks at the second world war\u00a0from the perspective of two characters, Sasha and Thomas, who collaborate with Stalin and Hitler respectively. What interested you about\u00a0that subject?In Israel, the second world war and the Holocaust are something you grow up with. At school, in the army, you sometimes feel that the Holocaust is shoved down your throat. But in literature you tend to come across the usual character types: either the bureaucrats such as Eichmann, or the highly perverse caricature of a Nazi. In contrast, I wanted to look at the role of brilliant and creative people, kind of \u201cfree spirits\u201d, who happened to find themselves living under those regimes. Sasha, for example, may not agree with the objectives of the NKVD, but working for them provides her first chance to shine, and an opportunity to realise her talents. Thomas has the cultural contempt for nazism that many bourgeois Germans had. But he sees the job offer from the Foreign Office as an opportunity to become a great man in Germany. He is not a coward: he takes major risks to achieve his goals. It interested me that in that situation, there would have to be a deal between the individual and the regime: the regime would get to use the individual\u2019s talents, and in return the individual would get an opportunity for fulfilment. Both sides are both being used by, and using, the other. Do you see any parallels with the moral dilemmas facing contemporary Israelis?I see parallels in every society. Those of us who live in capitalist societies often go out and work for corporations that contradict our political ideas. And then we come home and rant on Facebook or go out to a protest. In Israel it is very interesting how many people can function while working for organisations that totally contradict their personal beliefs. And I don\u2019t mean that in a judgmental way, just to observe that literature can try to understand what that means, psychologically: how can we go out into the world and live within a society that we may consider to be unjust? It must involve a level of personal denial: in every case of genocide, you have a small group of people who actually commit the atrocities, and a great many other people who are greasing the genocide machine. Was either Sasha or Thomas based on a real historical figure?I did a lot of historical research, obviously, but it was important to me that these characters and their precise roles were made up. Both of them have strange positions, as writers in the service of the regime. I wanted to give the reader a sense of having an imaginary journey within this historical landscape. So Thomas, for example, is inspired by Gatsby, and also by Ulrich, the protagonist of Robert Musil\u2019s The Man Without Qualities. One of the book\u2019s strengths is its intimate portrayal of life in wartime Germany and Russia \u2013 it brings to life the daily chaos and terror of these turbulent societies. How did you research it?I read many books about the period, and testimonies of people who lived through it. But most importantly I travelled to many of the places mentioned in the book: Lublin, Warsaw and Brest-Litovsk. I needed to create the personal landscapes of Sasha and Thomas, to see what they would have seen when they woke up in the morning. As I read the book, I was trying to work out to what extent the title is ironic\u2026It is ironic! But you are right, I think the extent of the irony changes from chapter to chapter. Clearly, as a writer you allocate to your characters some of your own qualities, your background and memories. But I also wanted to maintain a certain distance from them, that was quite deliberate, and perhaps it is why some people have found the book cold. Sometimes I identified with them, and sometimes I felt repulsion for what they were doing. I don\u2019t have things planned out from the beginning \u2013 I leave myself open to surprises and variations as I write. This novel was published in Israel in 2010. What have you been working on since?My next book to be published in English will be a nonfiction book about\u00a0Israel, In a Land Without Borders. I was very interested as someone who has long been involved in politics [Baram\u2019s father and grandfather were both Israeli politicians] to go out and challenge my political beliefs against the reality of the West Bank.

Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, invited the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, to address the Israeli parliament and said he was willing to speak to the Palestinian legislative council in Ramallah. But Netanyahu insisted on Thursday that the central problem was Palestinian rejectionism, not Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.   Related: Want peace between Israel and Palestine? The Iran Deal is a good guide | Wardah Khalid    The two leaders\u2019 speeches reflected their very different personal styles, with Netanyahu relying heavily on the theatrical and confrontational style he has brought to his recent general assembly addresses that have seen him deploy props and, last year, a period of silence. For his part, Abbas called on the UN to declare 2017 \u2013 the 50th anniversary of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories \u2013 the year to end the occupation.  Speaking an hour before Netanyahu, Abbas told the general assembly that Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank was destroying \u201cwhatever possibility is left for a two-state solution\u201d. The outgoing UN general secretary, Ban Ki-moon, and the US president, Barack Obama, cited Israeli settlement-building as a threat to a two-state solution in their own speeches to the assembly earlier this week.

Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters    Netanyahu aimed his fire at what he described as Palestinian incitement, while denying it existed in Israeli society, and used the opportunity to accuse UN members of \u201cobsessive bias\u201d against Israel. \u201cThe UN began as moral force, and has become a moral farce,\u201d Netanyahu declared, adding that while the UN denounces Israel, the US supports it. The Israeli prime minister saved his heaviest criticism for allegations levelled at the Palestinian Authority, claiming it had no interest in peace. \u201cThis remains the true core of the conflict: the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognise the Jewish state in any boundary,\u201d he said, in a direct contradiction of Abbas. \u201cThis conflict has never been about the settlements or about establishing a Palestinian state,\u201d Netanyahu told the UN.  Netanyahu added that Israeli cities Haifa, Jaffa and Tel Aviv were \u201cthe real settlements they are after\u201d. The issue of settlements in the West Bank was nonetheless real, he conceded, adding that it \u201ccan and must be resolved in final negotiations, final-status negotiations\u201d.   Related: Will Palestinians sue Britain over the Balfour declaration of 1917?    Netanyahu\u2019s comments came despite the fact that Abbas had reiterated his view of Palestinian recognition of Israel in his speech. Abbas said: \u201cI say to him [Netanyahu] today that our 1993 recognition of the existence of the state of Israel, a recognition which remains valid to this moment, is not a gratuitous recognition.\u201d In his speech, Abbas also reiterated his demand from the British government that it apologise for the 1917 Balfour declaration that agreed to the establishment in principle of a Jewish state in Palestine. \u201cThis is the least Great Britain can do,\u201d he said. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks last collapsed in 2014 and there are few hopes for a resumption anytime soon, in part because of Israel\u2019s anger at Palestinian violence and Palestine\u2019s criticism of settlements constructed on occupied land where it wishes to establish a state.  On the issue of peace talks, Abbas said: \u201cOur hand remains outstretched for making peace\u201d, but questioned whether any Israeli leader was ready to make \u201ca true peace \u2026 that will abandon the mentality of hegemony, expansionism and colonisation\u201d.

Amos Oz recalls falling for \u201cthis Jew\u201d many years ago, when, as a teenage kibbutznik, he became enchanted by \u201chis poetry, his humour, his compassion, his warmth, his simplicity\u201d. Oz\u2019s sweet hymn of praise is addressed to Jesus Christ. If that comes as a surprise, it\u2019s not only because Oz is an Israeli Jew. It\u2019s also because he\u2019s written often \u2013 and fiercely \u2013 of the role centuries of Christian persecution played in nurturing the Jewish longing for a homeland. But whatever anger he harbours toward Christian Europe, for Jesus, Oz expresses only fond admiration. Even if, the writer adds with a smile, \u201che and I disagree on many things \u2013 like any two Israelis\u201d. Now aged 77, his spectacles attached to a cord around his neck, he is still blessed with the rugged good looks and spellbinding English that have made international literary audiences swoon since the 1970s. This autumn cinemagoers might join them, thanks to the release of Natalie Portman\u2019s film adaptation of A Tale of Love and Darkness, Oz\u2019s bestselling memoir-cum-novel. But\u00a0for now he is in London to promote his latest novel, the first for more than\u00a0a decade: Judas in English, it was published in Hebrew as The Gospel According to Judas. In neatly formed, well-honed paragraphs, he tells me of his teenage fascination with the New Testament. \u201cI\u00a0realised at the age of 16 that unless I\u00a0read the gospels, I would never have access to Renaissance art, to the music of Bach or the novels of Dostoevsky. So in the evenings, when the other boys went to play basketball or chase girls \u2013 I\u00a0had no chance in either \u2013 I found my comfort in Jesus.\u201d For most of his contemporaries, especially then, the New Testament would have felt like forbidden territory, a place nice Jewish boys feared to tread. But Oz and Jesus had a family connection. His great-uncle, the scholar Joseph Klausner, was the author of Jesus of Nazareth, published in 1921, a book that scandalised Jews and Christians alike: it reclaimed Jesus as a Jew. As Oz puts it, \u201cJesus was born a Jew and he died a Jew. It never occurred to him to establish a new religion. He never crossed himself: he had no reason to. He never set one foot in a church. He went to synagogue.\u201d But as much as the young Oz was enthralled by Jesus, the story of Judas irritated him. Not theologically. But rather \u201cthe little detective within me\u201d was appalled by the Judas tale, which, Oz says, is a \u201cvicious, ugly story\u201d, arresting for being so badly written: had the gospels had a decent editor, he says, it would have been struck out.    This is not an innocent story. It is responsible for rivers of blood, for generations of hatred and persecution    Nothing about it adds up. Judas Iscariot is meant to be a rich man, yet he performs his great act of treachery for just 30 pieces of silver \u2013 \u201cabout \u00a3400 in\u00a0today\u2019s money\u201d. A decent sum, but surely not enough to provide a motive. And why would Jesus\u2019s pursuers need\u00a0Judas to point him out via the unforgettable gesture of a kiss? The miracle-worker was already notorious in Roman\u00a0Jerusalem, having caused such\u00a0a commotion at the temple. None\u00a0of it makes any sense, says Oz. These inconsistencies nagged away at him for more than half a century. Not least because the Judas legend has had grave consequences. \u201cThis is not an innocent story. This story is responsible, more than any other story told in history, for rivers of blood, for generations of hatred and persecution and inquisition and massacres and possibly the Holocaust.\u201d For Judas is a double synonym: a byword for traitor, but also for Jew. \u201cIn\u00a0my dictionaries, it\u2019s difficult to distinguish the two,\u201d Oz says, before rattling off the words for Jew and Judas in both German and Spanish: in each language, the two words sound almost the same. How could a three year old German child, hearing the word for Judas, the ultimate betrayer, separate that concept from their idea of \u201cJew\u201d, asks Oz. In his view, the story of Judas is \u201cthe Chernobyl of world antisemitism\u201d. And yet it took the arrival of this new novel\u2019s central character to suggest a way of wrestling with the Judas problem at long last. (Oz tends to speak this way about his characters: as if they are wholly independent actors, constantly able to surprise him, even to move him to tears, by words and deeds they choose for themselves. In line with Jewish conceptions of the Almighty, Oz\u00a0may be their creator, but they have free will.)     Natalie Portman in A Tale of Love and Darkness.

(Oz says she reminds him of the Jerusalem of his youth: \u201cShe\u2019s not young. She\u2019s very beautiful. She\u2019s deeply injured. She is ferociously independent and she is very angry.\u201d) As\u00a0Oz himself says, much of the book consists of this trio drinking gallons of tea and talking, talking, talking. Many of the familiar Oz motifs are present. A triangle, or series of intersecting triangles, each containing two men and a woman. A protagonist paralysed into inaction. A woman out of reach. A mystery, perhaps a buried scandal, related to the country\u2019s recent past. But what will gladden those readers who may have found some of Oz\u2019s past fiction forbidding, even as they lapped up his journalism and essays \u2013 delighting in their moral rigour and deployment of fresh, clarifying metaphor \u2013 is that this novel offers aspects of both genres. It is a novel of ideas, packed with argument and inquiry, displaying Oz\u2019s dizzying range of skills.    Judas believed in Jesus more than Jesus believed in himself    For Ash\u2019s field of inquiry is Jewish attitudes to Jesus and, especially, the maligning of Judas. He unfolds his theory of the true story of Judas \u2013 a tour de force that, alone, ensures this book will linger in the memory. Ash presents a persuasive case that, far from being a betrayer, Judas was the truest believer in Jesus. Indeed, the\u00a0tragedy was that, as Oz puts it, \u201cHe\u00a0believed in Jesus more than Jesus believed in himself.\u201d Judas put aside his initial scepticism and became convinced that the Nazarene truly was the one: the purity of his teachings, the wonder of his miracles, left no doubt in his mind. But to convince the wider public, a few remarkable feats of magic in the Galilee would not be enough. As Oz tells me, Jesus would have to pull off something incredible \u201con prime time television\u201d in Jerusalem, where everyone would witness it. If he were to be crucified and yet miraculously defy his own death, somehow climbing down from the cross in front of a watching Jerusalem public, why, then everyone would bow down to him in an instant: the kingdom of heaven would be upon us. Jesus was anxious, fearing his own death, but Judas was adamant. He played the impresario, working overtime to nudge the authorities to crucify this wonder-worker from Galilee \u2013 not because he did not believe in him, but because he did. Judas got his way, but when he saw that Jesus was not able to\u00a0escape his fate, that he could not come down from the cross, that his father had forsaken him, he was distraught. He understood his mistake and duly hanged himself. \u201cSo died... the first Christian. The last Christian. The only Christian.\u201d   Related: Judas by Amos Oz \u2013 review    It is a remarkable reimagining of this toxic tale, one that would indeed, in Oz\u2019s words, \u201cneutralise the lethal radiation\u201d of antisemitism\u2019s Chernobyl, were it ever to become the accepted view of Judas. Instead, Judas remains the hated betrayer, routinely depicted in artists\u2019 evocations of the Last Supper with the\u00a0dark, exaggerated features of anti-Jewish caricature \u2013 a man apart from his fellow apostles who are, oddly enough, all fair skinned and blessed with Aryan good looks. This thesis sits comfortably in the novel because both share a defining theme: treachery. The enigmatic widow, Atalia, saw her father ostracised as a traitor, shunned for opposing the establishment of the state of Israel a decade earlier. He was an idealist, with a Jesus-like faith in universal love and brotherhood. He opposed all states, with their borders and flags and armies, and hoped that Jews and Arabs might live side by side in a loose community free of such apparatus. For this, he was accused of treason. Oz does not share the dead man\u2019s politics \u2013 he stresses that while he may be a peacenik, he has never been a pacifist \u2013 but he knows what it\u2019s like to\u00a0be branded a traitor. He denounced the occupation of the territories Israel conquered in 1967 almost as soon as the six-day war was over, when his countrymen were still giddy with victory. A soldier in that conflict \u2013 and again in 1973 \u2013 Oz first came to prominence as one of a group of young kibbutznik writers who assembled a dissenting collection on the war just won: The Seventh Day. Long before it became a matter of international diplomatic consensus, Oz was advocating the partition of historical Palestine into two states \u2013 Israel and Palestine \u2013 alongside each other. And he was a founder member of the movement that became famous as Peace Now. At each turn, strident voices on the nationalist right have been quick to denounce him as a betrayer of his people. He says he regards it as \u201ca badge of honour\u201d, offering a rollcall of visionaries who were similarly denounced for treason, starting with the prophet Jeremiah and including Abraham Lincoln, the German officers who plotted to assassinate Hitler, Charles de\u00a0Gaulle, Anwar Sadat, Mikhail Gorbachev and, closer to home, Israel\u2019s founder, David Ben-Gurion along with Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres \u2013 all Israeli leaders excoriated at some point for their readiness to compromise on territory. (Later, on the night it emerges that Peres has suffered a major stroke, Oz will be anxiously checking his phone, awaiting word on a man he has long considered a good friend: Peres, even as prime minister and even when they strenuously disagreed with each other, was a faithful reader of Oz\u2019s novels. The two saw each other and spoke often.) To this traitors\u2019 hall of fame, Oz adds Thomas Mann, Boris Pasternak, Albert Camus and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn for good measure. Sometimes, he says, what others lambast as treason is simply \u201cthe courage to be ahead of your time\u201d.    This is my political credo and my business as a novelist: the changes that occur in the hearts and minds of people    In the novel, these questions of fidelity and treachery hover. For Oz, an\u00a0accusation of betrayal is often the reward a person receives simply for the act of changing. If they change their mind, they are accused of betraying the cause \u2013 even if they are simply finding a new way to serve the cause better. And yet change they must. \u201cThis is\u00a0my political credo and this is my business as a novelist: the changes that\u00a0occur in the hearts and minds of people.\u201d Think of Begin or Ariel Sharon, longtime hawks who found themselves pulling out of occupied territory and uprooting Israeli settlements. Admittedly, the changes experienced by Oz\u2019s characters tend to be of the subtler, less spectacular variety, but the essential truth is the same: Oz insists that people\u00a0have a tendency to surprise us\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and themselves.     Amos Oz in 1999. Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian    So what about him? How has he changed? On the core issues, he seems remarkably consistent, despite the dramatic shifts that have shaped and reshaped his small country. I first interviewed him in 1985, when I was 18. He\u00a0was younger then than I am now. I remember asking him about the biblical injunction that the people of Israel be \u201ca light unto the nations\u201d. At the time, he told me that the day Israel abandoned that objective would be the day he would lose interest in Israel as a project. \u201cI take it back,\u201d he says now. \u201cIsrael should aspire to be a decent country. That\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d And what of the two state solution, an idea for which he was something of an intellectual pioneer nearly 50 years ago? Many who believe it\u2019s right in principle have given up on it in practice, believing the moment has passed: 50 years of occupation and settlements have made it impossible. AB Yehoshua told the Guardian earlier this year: \u201cWe have to rethink the two state solution.\u201d It was not good enough to repeat the same old slogan for half a century. Oz is impatient with such impatience. He believes nothing in human affairs is irrevocable. If De Gaulle could move a\u00a0million settlers out of Algeria, Israel could take its settlers out of the West Bank \u2013 if it had the will to do it.   Related: Interview: Amos Oz    And he makes a point about time. \u201cDifferent clocks are working simultaneously,\u201d he says, meaning that there are always different time scales at work. He\u2019s opposed the occupation for every one of its 50 years. But compared with the many centuries the people of Europe took to stop killing each other and settle their borders? The Palestinian-Israeli conflict \u201cjust began yesterday\u201d. Besides, he\u2019s suspicious of those who are so insistent that the two state solution is dead. He points to the curious alliance of \u201cthe Israeli far right and the radical left in Europe, including this country [Britain]. Both are amplifying the same music, saying, \u2018There\u2019s no going back on the occupation, the only\u00a0solution is to live ... in one state.\u2019 I\u00a0think this is nonsense.\u201d He is especially impatient with the leftist vision of a single state, which he brands a kind of\u00a0\u201ckitsch\u201d, imagining that the two peoples can forget the bloodshed and conflict of the last century and \u201cjump into bed with each other, like in a lousy Hollywood movie\u201d. That\u2019s just one of many scoldings Oz is keen to dish out to the harder edges of the continental and British left. On this visit, he told Newsnight that to argue that Israel should not exist is to cross the line from anti-Zionism into antisemitism, because no one \u201cever said after Hitler that Germany should cease to exist, or after Stalin that there should be no Russia\u201d. He believes that if you want to change Israel, boycotting it is foolish because \u201cit deepens the Israeli paranoia that the whole world is against us\u201d, thereby strengthening the Israeli right. And he notes what he feels is a double standard. He thinks liberals overlook violence in parts of the developing world, \u201csaying, \u2018Well those people have suffered a lot, you have to understand it is only natural they are violent.\u2019\u201d But, \u201cWhen it comes to the Jews they often say: \u2018Well, they have suffered so much. How can they be violent after such an experience?\u2019\u201d In our conversation, he gives short shrift to those who think the\u00a0Holocaust should have turned Jews into pacifists. He recalls the words of a\u00a0relative of his, a survivor of the Nazi concentration camps, who always reminded him that her liberators \u201cwere not peace demonstrators with placards and olive branches. They were soldiers, with helmets and sub-machine guns. A\u00a0Jew of my generation cannot afford to forget it.\u201d    Societies immersed in conflict tend to become more racist, intolerant and unforgiving    None of which is to suggest he\u2019s happy with the status quo in Israel. On\u00a0the contrary, he says frankly: \u201cI love Israel, but I don\u2019t like it very much.\u201d What he loves remains the same as it\u00a0ever was. \u201cI love it because of the argumentativeness, because every staircase in Israel is full of memories and stories and conflicting ideas.\u201d But\u00a0he resents, he says, \u201cthe politics, the\u00a0occupation, the oppression of the Palestinian people and the deterioration in civil rights standards.\u201d He thinks \u201c50 years of occupation and 100 years of solitude\u201d have taken their toll, adding that \u201csocieties immersed in conflict tend to become more racist, intolerant and unforgiving\u201d. With the weariness of a man who has seen too much history, he reflects that \u201clong wars stink\u201d. Yet he remains resistant to any quick fixes or revolutionary answers. As the old man in the new novel says, big sweeping dreams of world reform \u201calways involve slaughter, crusades or jihad or Gulag or the wars of Gog and Demagogue\u201d. Indeed, this aversion to all-encompassing ideological dogmas is another Oz theme. His bestselling essay, \u201cHow to Cure a Fanatic\u201d, is now taught in Swedish schools. \u201cA fanatic wants to change other people for their own good,\u201d Oz tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s a great altruist, more interested in you than in himself. He wants to save your soul, change you, redeem you \u2013 and if you prove to be irredeemable, he will be at your throat and kill you. For your own good.\u201d Oz worries that the current era is proving hospitable to fanatics, who exist on every side and in every culture, because \u201cas things get more complicated, people crave the simple, one-sentence answer to everything\u201d. The novelist says he\u2019s always preferred \u201csolutions, not salvations\u201d, confirmation that for all his teenage infatuation with Jesus, he never did become a Christian. And so he keeps rising at 4am \u2013 the legacy of all those years on the kibbutz, waking early to milk the cows \u2013 leaving the Tel Aviv apartment he calls home, and taking a walk \u2013 limping slightly, thanks to a war wound \u2013 to the beach or the park to clear his head. And when he sees a window with a light on, he still finds himself imagining what\u2019s keeping that person up at night, what\u2019s troubling them.

In 2003, his studio moved its headquarters from Berlin to New York, when Libeskind was selected as master planner for the World Trade Center redevelopment I grew up in a dreary industrial city called Lodz, where all the greyness of postwar Poland, conformity and communism shaped my childhood. We lived on a main street in a crumbling tenement building. When I went to see it recently, I realised what a limited environment it was. It had two small rooms and a kitchen, which also housed the bathtub. My parents slept in one room, and I slept in the living room with my sister. The only view we had was of the other side of the building, over a dismal little courtyard where people would beat their carpets. As a small boy, I\u2019d look out of the window and watch the dust. When I was 11, we moved to Israel, where I lived for three years on a kibbutz without my parents, who had gone to Tel Aviv to find work, and later in downtown Tel Aviv, in a white, square building that was inspired by Bauhaus ideas. On the kibbutz, I shared a dormitory with kids my own age and we studied or worked together, picking potatoes in the fields. It was a strange experience for me, moving from an intimate, hidden existence in Lodz to this open, beautiful landscape in Israel where I had the freedom to think and be myself on this collectivist farm. We emigrated to New York when I was a young teenager, and I found myself in the Bronx, living in one of the first social housing projects in the US. It was a tiny apartment with no air conditioning and everybody sat out on the fire escape at night. It was here that my interest in architecture began. We had a Formica kitchen table with curved edges and, when I started to study, I worked with a T-square; but because the table had a curved edge, I could never tell at precisely what point the angle was no longer a right angle. Perhaps this had a subliminal impact on my future thinking.     \u2018All the greyness of postwar Poland shaped my childhood\u2019: Libeskind back where he grew up, in Lodz. Photograph: Daniel Libeskind    Nowadays, I live with my wife in Lower Manhattan, in an apartment that bears little resemblance to my childhood home. It\u2019s on the seventh floor of a former bank that was built in the early 1900s. Working with architects, I\u2019ve completely transformed the interior \u2013 all the walls have been removed and small windows replaced so we now have spectacular views of the New York skyline. There\u2019s little clutter. Natural light and good acoustics are important, as is the flow of space. There is only one room in the apartment with a door, and that\u2019s my daughter\u2019s bedroom: that argument I could not win. Our bedroom doesn\u2019t have a door \u2013 it is not a private space. I shared a dormitory in Israel so I grew up with a communal sense of space. I like it; my wife is not so keen. What I love about this apartment is that it is part of the bustle of New York. When I look out the window, I can see thousands of people on the streets, in the park and in buildings. Day and night, there\u2019s never a quiet moment. And our building is right on top of the subway line, so you can feel the vibrations travelling up from deep inside the building. I find it one of the most beautiful feelings. It\u2019s the same subway line I took to school when I was living in the Bronx. It\u2019s where I live and work \u2013 a place I continue to be deeply connected to.

Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Guardian    I was born in Buckinghamshire and moved to London aged four, so I regard myself as a Londoner. Growing up, I lived with my parents and sister in a late-Victorian, four-bedroom mansion block flat in West Kensington. The flat was T-shaped and all of the rooms to the right-hand side of the central corridor looked out on to the street. At the end of the T was a small kitchen, where we held all our birthday parties and made dens. I would run up and down the corridor, playing with the cat. We shared the flat with two lodgers; I shared a room with my sister until our early teens. I remember looking out of our bedroom window one afternoon, watching prefabs coming off the back of lorries and being slotted together. It was the early 1960s, so there were still quite a lot of bomb sites in our neighbourhood. To watch these houses being built, with people moving in the very next week, was amazing.     \u2018The fact that I grew up in a flat made me unafraid of them\u2019: Julia Barfield in her parents\u2019 kitchen, at her fifth birthday party. Photograph: Julia Barfield    The fact that I grew up in a flat made me unafraid of them. We didn\u2019t really have any outdoor space, apart from balconies that my father filled with flowers, so we played on the street or took the bus to Holland Park, to one of London\u2019s first adventure playgrounds. My husband and I moved to our current home in south London, in the 1970s, when we were students. Back then, it was virtually derelict, so there was a lot of self-build involved. It\u2019s an end-of-terrace built in the 1840s. In the early 1980s it was under threat of demolition, but eventually the planners decided to make it a conservation area. When we started having children, we built a shed on the side, which served as an office, then a playroom. But then we built the London Eye and eventually had enough money to transform the house. Now, it is as green as can be: highly insulated, with an air-source heat pump, double glazing, underfloor heating and two green roofs to encourage biodiversity. The kitchen is still the heart of the house. Our firm hasn\u2019t done a lot of residential work, but in 2002 we did propose a tower called Skyhouse. It was our suggestion for solving London\u2019s housing crisis: high-density with mixed tenancies, renewable energies and communal facilities. It was slightly ahead of its time. Towers were still associated with council blocks, so we never got to build it; but we put it out there as an idea. It has contributed to the discussion about high-density living \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s something we will revisit in the future. John Pawson  Pawson, 67, is renowned for his minimalist buildings.

Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Guardian    Minimalism is a label that follows me. I\u2019m not against it, but it means different things to different people. In my terms, minimalism doesn\u2019t mean painting it white and not having any possessions; for me, it\u2019s about clarity \u2013 trying to get to the essence of things. I grew up in the house I was born in. Looking back, I can see where my minimalist aesthetic came from. The house was near the edge of the Yorkshire moors, a treeless landscape. Growing up, we were encouraged not to set much store by material things. Of course, that\u2019s easy to say, coming from a comfortable middle-class family. And we didn\u2019t live in a minimal place \u2013 my mother liked antiques, but she also promoted a very attractive modesty. She tended to wear one suit, but it was a Chanel suit. My parents bought the house after the second world war. It was part 16th-century and it incorporated a Norman arch, so it had a lot of character. My father was in the rag trade. He manufactured women\u2019s dresses, so he loved quality. In fact, I think he built the most expensive orangery, probably ever. I now know where I get it from. These days, most people want what I had when I was growing up: one room in which everything happened. For us it was the kitchen. It seemed there was always an architect laying out plans on the kitchen table, always workmen around, always a project. My room was the smallest, and each time one of my sisters left home my dad would knock a wall down between rooms. In the end, I had a giant room with nothing more in it. And aside from the orangery, my father also renovated a cottage and the lodge on the property. At 16 or 17 I moved into the cottage and, of course, I changed it. I simplified it, stripped it out.     \u2018We didn\u2019t live in a minimal place\u2019: Pawson\u2019s childhood home dates back to the 16th century. Photograph: Pawson House    I now live in a 19th-century row house in Notting Hill, west London. My wife, Catherine, found it and put in an offer before I had even seen the place, because the setting is so unusual \u2013 there are uninterrupted views over communal gardens. It\u2019s in a conservation area, so we had to keep the facade, but I opened up the back and redrew the floor plans. The interiors are designed around the way we live, with everything we need and nothing we don\u2019t. As in my parents\u2019 house, the kitchen table is the main gathering place \u2013 it\u2019s where we talk, eat, work and sit down with family and friends. Whatever else is different, I like to think my parents would recognise the atmosphere of the place, and feel at home. I never intended to be an architect. I came to the profession late, after working for my father for six years. I remember him saying: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just hire an architect? Why would you want to be one?\u201d But I think he knew that it was where I found pleasure. I\u2019ve spent the past few years working on London\u2019s new Design Museum. The existing building is fairly iconic from the outside; I wanted to slightly calm it down so that the objects become more potent than my work inside the building. People say I am uncompromising and detail-orientated, and I am \u2013 qualities I definitely got from my father. And I tend to attract clients who are even more so \u2013 they are happy to push me up a mountain if necessary.

Photograph: Adam Willis    I grew up at the foot of the Malvern Hills in Whiteleaved Oak, a rural hamlet in Herefordshire where my parents still live. The oldest part of the house was a cottage that dates back to the early 1600s. There is a more recent, 19th-century, timber-framed structure that was badly adapted before my parents bought the house in the early 1980s. They erected new timbers, replaced the roof and built a small extension and a studio for my dad to work in. I grew up around building work. My father is a sculptor, so he was hands-on with the work around the house \u2013 and you can see his involvement. The floor is intricately laid, for example: it\u2019s made from different widths and lengths of elm notched together. I have strong memories of my father laying and oiling those boards. Building was an early obsession. I used to ask my mum to make me packed lunches so I could eat lunch with the builders on site. By the age of about 14, I had become obsessed with woodwork. I was given some wood for my birthday, which I used to build a workbench that is still in the studio \u2013 I go back and use it. At 18, I built a modern timber and glass extension with my dad. The house now shows a progression of timber-framed construction: from the old cottage at one end to that extension at the other. The home I am currently living in couldn\u2019t be more different. I\u2019m renting a flat on the 31st floor of a tower block in the Barbican, in the City of London, with three other architects and a fashion designer. We\u2019ve been here for two years, and it\u2019s an incredibly uplifting place to live. The flat has most of its original features: the kitchen, cupboards and fittings. I\u2019ve made a few pieces of furniture, such as a simple elm dining table. The bedrooms are arranged along one side and each opens out on to a balcony that wraps around the entire flat. It has generous proportions, with a large, open-plan living and dining room that overlooks north and east London. There\u2019s a solidity to everything that is satisfying. And being up so high is an amazing experience in itself.     \u2018It\u2019s an incredibly uplifting place to live\u2019: Adam Willis at his flat at the Barbican, London \u2013 his block is identical to the one he overlooks here. Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Guardian    What\u2019s striking is that the singular vision of the architect is apparent throughout the estate, from the master-planning right through to the kitchen taps. The complexity and variety of spaces within the project \u2013 realised with such coherence and integrity \u2013 is quite extraordinary. The luxury of space that I enjoyed when I was growing up is obviously impossible to replicate in London, so you have to start looking at alternatives. I\u2019m interested in the potential of co-housing, or models of communal living where people can benefit from sharing resources, such as a workshop or greenhouse, say, or from a generosity of common space. Wherever I end up, there will be an element of self-build: like my dad, I\u2019ll always have the urge to be hands-on.

Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Guardian    I was brought up in a semi-detached Victorian villa in north London, where my parents lived for about 50 years. They bought it in 1955 for \u00a32,500. They were the first generation of gentrifiers to move to Islington. The house they bought in Canonbury had been a rooming house. Every room had a Yale lock on it and there were stoves on the landing. They turned it back into a family home. My father, Gordon, was an architect. He combined the main living rooms into one enormous room, replacing the central main wall on the ground floor with two amazing pitch pine columns that were beautiful. He ripped out the fireplaces, installed a downstairs toilet and replaced the florid, Victorian cornices in the main living room with a sleek and simple design of his own. There was a sense of modernising it and adapting it to suit the needs of a growing family, but keeping elements of its period. He also designed and built us a second home in Hampshire, inspired by the early work of Frank Lloyd Wright. It was a brick box surrounded by courtyard gardens. It was open plan, with exposed brick walls, flat roofed and low lying in the landscape. It was built when I was about eight, and we went there every summer. My father talked about it obsessively. I loved that building, but we lost interest in the house when we were teenagers, so my parents sold it. It has been added to, so it has lost that essence of being a simple holiday house. Likewise, when we sold the London house, my friend saw my father\u2019s pine pillars in a skip \u2013 the new owners had stripped them out. I was upset to hear that. In a way, the two homes are combined in the Straw House, in London, where I live and work. We\u2019ve got the open-plan living space that my father created in my childhood home.     \u2018I loved that building\u2019: the Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired home where Wigglesworth spent many of her childhood summers.

Buildings ought to be adaptable, flexible and forgiving. I don\u2019t believe in the preciousness of \u201cthe beautiful concept\u201d. Longevity is given by a building\u2019s ability to adapt.

Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Guardian    I grew up in central India in a community founded by Mahatma Gandhi in 1937. It was a village with utopian ambitions; a vision of what rural India could look like after independence. People from all over the world came through the village, drawn by Gandhi\u2019s legacy. Education was at its heart. My father was an art teacher and my mother a nurse. The house we lived in was a simple, symmetrical structure with a deep veranda, two good-sized rooms, and a bathroom and kitchen. On summer days, we closed the windows and hung dampened vetiver mats over the doorways, so the hot winds turned into a cool, scented breeze that filled the house. On summer nights, we would sleep out in the open. I have a fond memory of my mum pointing out the constellations before we fell asleep. In the winter it was the other way round \u2013 taking the sun in the day and sleeping inside at night. The walls were made of wattle and daub, and we had timber-trussed roofs, plain interlocking tiles and wide eaves. The house was raised off the ground to keep it dry during the monsoons. These, and the summer heat, took their toll on the house, so every spring there was a celebratory redecoration. The walls were coated with a slurry of mud and a sterile cow dung derivative, which repelled insects. The house sat in the middle of a rose garden surrounded by fields. Seasonally, there would be sweet potatoes and bananas on one side and an orange grove on the other. There was also a gulmohar tree, which had fern-like branches and beautiful red flowers. The community thrived in the mid-50s and our house was very much in the middle of that. My father built an art school next door \u2013 his passion. One of my first memories is pointing the flagstones in the veranda when I was four; I was given a little trowel. It\u2019s nice to think that this was the beginning of my architectural career, further encouraged by the Meccano set my father found in a junk shop.     \u2018On summer days the hot winds turned into a cool, scented breeze\u2019: the house where Sunand Prasad grew up, in rural India. Photograph: Sunand Prasad    Looking back, it was a truly sustainable lifestyle: simple, enjoyable and stylish. All those things were influential to me. Of the places I have lived in, the most comparable since was a home friends and I built in east London using recycled materials, as part of a housing co-operative. We raised our children there. It linked with other houses across back gardens and had a sense of community reminiscent of my childhood. I would love one day to build a house that is as regenerative as nature, wasting nothing.

Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Guardian    I believe in a pluralist approach to taste, which is probably affected by my emerging from a working class. I grew up the child of a postman and then went to grammar school, so I was part of that transition. I was born on the outskirts of Manchester. When I was eight, we moved to the Grange council estate three miles north of Newcastle upon Tyne. We lived there from 1946 to 1954 in a prefab and a brick house. The prefab was well-designed: a lightweight aluminium frame clad in asbestos. It had an image problem, though. After four years, we moved into a brick house on the other side of the estate. It was handcrafted rather than factory-made, but it had smaller windows and the kitchen wasn\u2019t as functional. I still live in the middle of a housing estate. Thirty years ago, I bought a disused factory in a deprived ward in Westminster. It was built in the 1920s and requisitioned during the second world war by a tyre and aeroworks company. I bought it for \u00a310 a square foot. My offices occupy the ground and first floors, and for the past 15 years I have lived with my wife in the roof. It\u2019s a steel-framed, rough-and-ready space of 3,500 sq ft with no separate bedroom or study. I\u2019ve never adjusted to a desk, study or studio \u2013 my home is my workplace. Although it is industrial, there are lots of plants and trees inside, and on my roof terrace. I was immersed in nature as a child \u2013 the estate was surrounded by countryside.     \u2018I feel a sense of social justice about what I do\u2019: Terry Farrell as a baby in Manchester, with his older brother, Tony, and their father.

In Trump\u2019s hour-long meeting with Netanyahu at his Trump Tower penthouse, the two reportedly discussed \u201cat length Israel\u2019s successful experience with a security fence that helped secure its borders\u201d, according to the Trump campaign.  Israel\u2019s separation barrier runs for 440 miles (700km) partly along the 1949 armistice lines set after Israel\u2019s war for independence and partly through territory occupied by Israel after the 1967 war. It is a fence most of its length. In contrast, Trump has pledged to build a wall of concrete and rebar as high as 55 feet (17 metres) along the nearly 2,000 mile border between the US and Mexico.   Related: Clinton camp says Trump in 'sewer' as debate looms and fight gets dirty    The meeting was the first of two that Netanyahu held with presidential candidates on Sunday, the day before the first presidential debate. Contrary to custom both meetings were closed to the media, the Trump campaign has prevented reporters from any access to his meeting with Netanyahu and aides to the Israeli prime minister reportedly went on to insist Clinton\u2019s campaign abide by the same rules Trump insisted upon. According to a readout provided by the Republican\u2019s campaign, the nominee signaled support for the controversial moving of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, as the real estate developer \u201cacknowledged that Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the Jewish people for over 3,000 years, and that the United States, under a Trump administration, will finally accept the long-standing Congressional mandate to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israel\u201d. Despite the fact Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism upon her marriage to property developer and top Trump campaign aide Jared Kushner in 2009, he has made some missteps so far in the campaign on Middle East policy and appealing to Jewish voters, who make up a key demographic in American elections.   Related: Netanyahu plans fence around Israel to protect it from 'wild beasts'    In 2015, speaking to the Republican Jewish Coalition, Trump referred to stereotypes relating to Jews and money and told the audience: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to support me because I don\u2019t want your money\u201d, suggesting they wanted to control politicians. In 2016, speaking before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel advocacy group, Trump gave a notably stilted performance in what was his first speech using a teleprompter. Clinton\u2019s meeting, which lasted just under an hour on Sunday night, was held at the W Hotel in Union Square. In the meeting, which was described by the Clinton campaign as an \u201cin-depth conversation\u201d, Clinton \u201cstressed that a strong and secure Israel is vital to the United States because we share overarching strategic interests and the common values of democracy, equality, tolerance, and pluralism\u201d. The Democratic nominee also reaffirmed her support for a two-state solution \u201cthat guarantees Israel\u2019s future as a secure and democratic Jewish state with recognized borders and provides the Palestinians with independence, sovereignty, and dignity\u201d. She stressed \u201cher opposition to any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the UN security council\u201d.           Trump v Clinton: an analysis of debate styles    After decades in public service, the former secretary of state has a far more extensive record on Israel and Middle East. She defended her pro-Israel bona fides in a March speech to AIPAC, saying: \u201cI feel so strongly that America can\u2019t ever be neutral when it comes to Israel\u2019s security or survival.\u201d In July 2015, she wrote a public letter condemning the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. In the US, the BDS movement is a fringe issue pursued by left wing groups. It seeks to equate Israel with apartheid South Africa and has drawn significant concern in the American Jewish community. In the meeting, Clinton \u201cstressed her commitment to countering attempts to delegitimize Israel, including through the BDS movement\u201d.  However, unlike Trump, Clinton did support the controversial Iran nuclear deal that the US reached in 2015 as a part of an effort to prevent the Iranian regime obtaining nuclear weapons. Supporters of the deal have insisted that it provides the mechanisms to stop Iran building such armaments. Critics say it provides the regime, which is still listed as a state sponsor of terrorism, with an undeserved windfall in sanctions relief and does not contain enough nuclear safeguards.   The US has long maintained a close alliance with Israel and the maintenance of that relationship has long been a crucial issue for many American voters. Despite a difficult personal relationship between the Obama White House and the Netanyahu government, including conflict over the Iran deal, the US pledged a record increase in military aid to Israel earlier in September.  \u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2016 to clarify references to Israel\u2019s separation barrier and to the BDS movement.", "publicationDate": "2016-09-26T09:05:14Z", "title": "Donald Trump links Mexico border wall plan to Israel's 'successful' separation barrier", "sentences": ["According to a readout provided by the Republican\u2019s campaign, the nominee signaled support for the controversial moving of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, as the real estate developer \u201cacknowledged that Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the Jewish people for over 3,000 years, and that the United States, under a Trump administration, will finally accept the long-standing Congressional mandate to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israel\u201d."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/donald-trump-links-mexico-border-wall-plan-to-israels-successful-separation-barrier"}, {"tags": ["Shimon Peres", "World news", "Israel"], "article": "Shimon Peres, one of Israel\u2019s defining political figures, has been described by his doctors as \u201cfighting for his life\u201d, two weeks after he suffered a massive stroke. The condition of Peres, 93, who twice served as prime minister of Israel and later as the country\u2019s ninth president, was said to have worsened seriously in the course of a few hours on Tuesday as family members gathered at his bedside. \u201cThe president is fighting for his life,\u201d medical sources said. \u201cHis health position is very, very difficult. His doctors are worried about his health.\u201d Peres\u2019s son-in-law and deputy director-general of the hospital treating him, Rafi Walden, added that \u201chis condition is extremely serious\u201d.

His defining achievement was as one of the key architects of the Oslo peace accords for which he was jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize with Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.   The last surviving political figure associated with the founding of modern Israel, Peres\u2019s life story tracked many of the most important moments in the country\u2019s short history, and saw him move from being a hawk to a key peacemaker \u2013 a legacy that in recent years has substantially unravelled, to his dismay. For a long time Peres was deeply divisive in Israeli politics, but he went on to become one of the country\u2019s most popular public figures, serving a seven-year term as the president, which he completed two years ago. \u201cIn his people\u2019s eyes he ceased to be a politician. He became an historic figure, larger than politics, larger than everyday affairs, a figure in a league of his own,\u201d wrote Nahum Barnea, a columnist for the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, shortly after Peres was taken ill in one among many retrospectives of his long career.", "publicationDate": "2016-09-27T16:31:43Z", "title": "Former Israeli president Shimon Peres 'fighting for his life'", "sentences": ["Peres was rushed to hospital near Tel Aviv on 13 September after he reported feeling ill."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/27/former-israeli-president-shimon-peres-fighting-for-his-life"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Jordan", "Judaism", "Lebanon", "Palestinian territories", "Mordechai Vanunu", "Shimon Peres"], "article": "Ever since the state of Israel was created in 1948, Shimon Peres, who has died aged 93, was at or near the centre of action. A protege of David Ben-Gurion, Israel\u2019s first prime minister, Peres became premier himself on three occasions, foreign minister for another three, and state president from 2007 until 2014. He fashioned alliances with France in the 1950s, and planted the seeds for Israel\u2019s embryonic electronics and aircraft industries. During the 60s, he honed the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and secretly amassed Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons. For 15 long years after it fell from power in 1977, Peres led the Labour party. In the early 80s, he resuscitated Israel\u2019s economy, and in 1994 shared the Nobel prize for his role in the efforts to create peace in the Middle East through the Oslo accords. In the same year, he cemented Israel\u2019s peace treaty with Jordan. Defeated at the polls in 1996, he returned in 2001 as foreign minister, thereby giving Israel\u2019s controversial new premier, Ariel Sharon, a much-needed veneer of respectability. And in 2006, he left Labour, his home for five decades, to help Sharon set up his powerful new breakaway faction, Kadima. A simple listing of achievements only hints at the phenomenon that was Peres. The Jerusalem Report news magazine called him \u201cIsrael\u2019s only world-class statesman, perhaps Zionism\u2019s last pragmatic visionary\u201d. Peres wrote 11 books, read poetry voraciously, and could quote from Old Testament prophets, French literature and Chinese philosophy with equal ease. After the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, he bound together a shattered nation. And yet, despite all his talent, there was something tragic about the man. Peres contested five elections without winning a single outright victory. His longest tenure as premier was two years, and came while he was in an awkward alliance with his Likud enemies. He lost the Labour leadership on the eve of the party\u2019s return to power in 1992. A slew of terrorist attacks in early 1996 allowed Binyamin Netanyahu victory over Peres in Israel\u2019s first direct prime ministerial elections. No wonder Orly Azoulay titled her 1996 biography of him The Man Who Didn\u2019t Know How to Win. Some of his initiatives were halted before they had got going, such as his 1987 London agreement with King Hussein of Jordan. Others collapsed because opponents chipped away at the scaffolding, as with the Oslo accords. Even when in 2000 he stood for state president \u2013 the ultimate consolation prize for veterans \u2013 Knesset members opted not for him but for the pedestrian Moshe Katsav. All the same, Peres campaigned well into his 80s. No sooner had the media written him off as a \u201cserial loser\u201d than he would pop up again as a saviour in a time of crisis. He was used to playing the long game. In 2007 Katsav resigned in disgrace amid charges of sexual improprieties, and Peres was elected president in his stead. Virtually across the board, Israeli editorials spoke of a national sigh of relief in recognition of a long-maligned yet irreplaceable figure. \u201cI am a child of the generation that lost one world and went on to build another,\u201d Peres once wrote. Son of Yitzhak and Sarah Persky (he later Hebraised the family surname), he was born in Vishneva, then a largely Jewish town located in the borderlands between modern Belarus, Poland and Lithuania. His New York-born cousin Betty Perske, one year his junior, went on to achieve fame as the actor Lauren Bacall. Shimon\u2019s maternal grandfather, Zvi Meltzer, who later died in the Holocaust, inspired his love for literature. Frequent antisemitic raids undermined Vishneva\u2019s patina of autonomy. At the age of 10, Shimon left to settle in Tel Aviv, where his father, a lumber merchant, had emigrated two years earlier. At 15 Peres joined the Ben Shemen agricultural youth village, a crucible of future Israeli leaders. He soon met the Ukrainian-born Sonia Gelman and wooed her by moonlight with readings from Marx\u2019s Das Kapital. The couple married in 1945 after Sonia had served as a nurse and driver with the British Army in Egypt. She became a source of strength to him in private and an enigmatically deferential figure in public. Peres became leader of the Hano\u2019ar Ha\u2019oved (Working Youth) Zionist movement when he was 19, and founded Kibbutz Alumot in the Jordan Valley. Apprised of his skills, Ben-Gurion appointed Peres head of mobilisation for the Haganah underground in 1947. He procured plane parts from the US, Italy and Czechoslovakia during the 1948 war. He even became secretary of Israel\u2019s navy, although he confessed: \u201cMy experience consisted of moderate proficiency at breaststroke and one childhood attempt to launch a raft off the coast of Tel Aviv.\u201d In 1950 Peres travelled to Washington as military attache. By 1953, aged 29, he was director of the entire defence ministry, an office he held until 1959. Peres helped plan the Sinai campaign of 1956. In 1957, he successfully lobbied the French government for a nuclear reactor, and established a hi-tech intelligence unit, Lakam, whose operatives served him in future clandestine ventures. He also tried to abolish military rule over Israel\u2019s Arab citizens, but Ben-Gurion overruled him and the law was only repealed in 1966. Israel later promised that it would not introduce atomic weapons into the region \u2013 \u201cat my urging\u201d, wrote Peres. Though he conceded that Arab leaders saw his creation, Israel\u2019s secret Dimona plant in the Negev Desert, as \u201ca worrisome fuzzy deterrent\u201d, Peres the politician enjoyed creating such deliberate ambiguities. In 1959 Peres was elected to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, for the ruling Mapai party (forerunner of Labour) and immediately became deputy defence minister. He bought Israel\u2019s first US weapons, but resigned in 1965 with the prime minister, Ben-Gurion. Their breakaway Rafi party proved unsuccessful, winning only 10 seats, and in 1968 Rafi rejoined Labour, as did Peres, who became its deputy general secretary. Israel gained the Palestinian-populated territories of Gaza and the West Bank in the 1967 war \u2013 an acquisition that was to change its politics more profoundly than was realised at the time. In 1969 Peres was charged with developing these areas, and absorbing new eastern European immigrants. He then served in turn as communications, transport and information minister. When, in 1974, the prime minister, Golda Meir, was forced to resign, Peres gamely stood for election to the vacant post of party leader, but lost narrowly to an equally youthful, native-born military hero, Rabin. This was a battle that would be repeated often over the next two decades. Appointed defence minister that June, Peres immediately plunged into the intricacies of negotiating a second interim Sinai treaty with Egypt. He also opened a \u201cgood fence\u201d border crossing with Lebanon, revitalised the IDF after the near-humiliation of the 1973 war, allowed legally questionable settlements on the West Bank, and masterminded the daring rescue of hostages from Entebbe in 1976. Yet support haemorrhaged for a government blighted by scandal and economic malaise. Rabin resigned in April 1977 and Peres was prime minister for barely a month before Menachem Begin\u2019s Likud demolished Labour at the polls. Peres thus won the dubious privilege of becoming Labour\u2019s first-ever opposition leader. He then saw Begin negotiate the historic peace agreement with Egypt that he had expected to make himself. Rabin\u2019s memoirs decried Peres for betraying him in 1977, and Begin was able to exploit the spat to triumph at the 1981 polls. Peres meanwhile became a vice-president of the Socialist International in 1978. There he befriended Willy Brandt, Bruno Kreisky, British Labour politicians and delegates from Africa and Asia. Such ties were to prove invaluable. Likud\u2019s ill-fated Lebanese war of 1982 allowed Peres to tap into national unease. He fought the 1984 elections to a dead heat, and duly headed a national unity government, agreeing that he would hand power to Likud\u2019s pugnacious new leader, Yitzhak Shamir, after two years. As prime minister, Peres made up for lost time. He withdrew troops from Beirut to a narrow \u201csecurity zone\u201d in southern Lebanon. Then he slashed Israel\u2019s inflation rate from 450% to 16% by forcing the Histadrut labour confederation and big business into a national compact. When Shamir became prime minister, Peres served as foreign minister (1986-88), during which time the iconoclastic pragmatist and security hawk, who once called settlements \u201cthe roots and eyes of Israel\u201d, blossomed into a peace campaigner. He had first met King Hussein in 1974. Their mutual respect was clear from the outset. Peres felt that a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation could break the stalemate in the territories, and bring peace to Israel, and in 1987 negotiated with the king in London. Shamir, angry that Peres had \u201cgone behind his back\u201d, quashed the deal. The acrimony between them deepened, and probably exacerbated Palestinian frustration. For his part Hussein blamed Peres for leaking their secret talks. Israel\u2019s 1988 election took place against the backdrop of the Palestinian intifada (the uprising against Israel in the occupied territories). It ended in deadlock, and led to another unsatisfactory \u201cunity government\u201d. Peres rejected Shamir\u2019s endorsement of settlements and, in 1990, sought to topple the government. At the last moment, the religious Shas party withdrew the support it had promised him. In early 1992, Rabin replaced Peres as party leader, and went on to win the June elections for Labour. Miraculously, their enmity turned to partnership, with Peres, the foreign minister, as the engine and Rabin, the prime minister, as the gears and brakes (or so Peres later described it). A longtime foe of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Peres now persuaded Rabin to consider talks with the PLO leader Yasser Arafat. Peres\u2019s lieutenants, led by Yossi Beilin and Uri Savir, opened a secret track with PLO negotiators outside Oslo. At the subsequent White House lawn signing in September 1993, Peres nudged a reluctant Rabin to shake hands with Arafat \u2013 an image that went round the world. For two years, Peres worked furiously to keep the imperfect peace on track. Given the problem of settlements, it was, he quipped, an attempt \u201cto turn an omelette back into eggs\u201d. He negotiated directly with Arafat, turned the \u201cGaza and Jericho First\u201d proposals agreed at the White House into reality, drafted the 1994 Paris Protocol of Israeli-Palestinian economic relations, promoted regional summits and in 1995 sealed Oslo II (an agreement to restore Palestinian rule to six major West Bank towns). Rabin, meanwhile, concentrated on Syrian talks via his protege, the military chief of staff Ehud Barak. But Israeli fury at persistent terrorism prompted demonstrations against the Rabin-Peres administration. In 1995, Yigal Amir assassinated Rabin at a peace rally. Peres, Amir\u2019s other intended target, was just metres away. He took over as prime minister on a wave of sympathy. With hindsight, Peres\u2019s decision not to call immediate elections was an error. Nonetheless, he achieved much in his six months in charge: he implemented Oslo II ahead of schedule, assuaged the religious right, bolstered the economy and co-operated with Arafat over the first-ever Palestinian elections. Support for Peres evaporated when successive bomb attacks killed dozens in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and talks with Syria came to naught. Likud warned: \u201cPeres will divide Jerusalem.\u201d Arab states feared that his dream of a borderless Middle East spelled Israeli economic colonialism by stealth. Peres\u2019s retaliatory invasion of Lebanon in April 1996 also misfired, when more than 100 refugees perished in one Israeli bombing. For all Peres\u2019s Panglossian fantasies of a \u201cnew Middle East\u201d the electorate narrowly yet decisively favoured Netanyahu that May. Peres chided \u201cBibi\u201d for \u201c111 days of verbiage\u201d, and held on as party chairman until Barak ousted him in 1997. After Labour\u2019s victory in 1999, Barak gave Peres the nebulous portfolio of \u201cregional co-operation minister\u201d, but sidetracked him over the peace process. Peres had meanwhile founded a centre for peace in his name, with headquarters in Ajami, a largely Arab neighbourhood of Jaffa. It is dedicated to dialogue, cultural, economic and youth initiatives, and healthcare assistance to Palestinians. In 1998 he wrote forewords to four books on the 50th anniversary of Israel\u2019s independence. He also released For the Future of Israel, a series of philosophical conversations with the author Robert Littell. Where other Israeli politicians grudgingly accepted a Palestinian state as inevitable, only Peres argued in Le Monde that it was necessary for Israel\u2019s future. When the new intifada broke out in 2000, polls backed Peres to restore the peace process. In the event, Barak sabotaged his rival\u2019s \u201cvirtual candidacy\u201d, only to lose at the polls himself. Peres emerged as foreign minister under Sharon in a Likud-Labour coalition government. This time Peres was the liberal brake to Sharon\u2019s determinedly rightwing engine. Whether he was an effective brake was another story. Although many Israeli leftists felt outraged at his \u201cbetrayal\u201d, experienced Peres-watchers knew that his personal friendship with Sharon counted for more than ideological congruence. Less charitable souls felt that his overvaulting ambition had once again trumped his principles. Similar charges resurfaced in 2005, when he left Labour to co-found Kadima with Sharon, barely a month after losing the Labour leadership to an outside candidate, Amir Peretz. Peres served as Ehud Olmert\u2019s deputy premier after Kadima convincingly won elections in 2006. The following year, by now Israel\u2019s longest serving parliamentarian, he left the Knesset to contest the presidency. As Israel\u2019s ninth president, he helped restore his nation\u2019s battered reputation. He became the first Israeli head of state to address a Muslim state legislature when he spoke to Turkey\u2019s national assembly in November 2007. Turkey and Japan supported his \u201cvalley of peace initiative\u201d for economic revival and joint industrial projects in the West Bank. In 2008 he launched the Israeli Presidential Conference, an annual brainstorming forum which attracted guests including George W Bush, Elie Wiesel, Robert De Niro, Rupert Murdoch and Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy. In 2009 Peres served as \u201cnational host\u201d for Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s visit to Israel. At last he gained the affection of Oriental Jews \u2013 half of Israel\u2019s population \u2013 who had once seen him as an Ashkenazi elitist. Most unusually for an Israeli president, Peres became his nation\u2019s top diplomat. He asked Palestinians and Arab nations to join in \u201ca great journey towards a world built on logic and intellect, not land\u201d. He negotiated directly with Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, on behalf of a taciturn Netanyahu. He placated President Barack Obama when Israeli actions offended the Oval Office. And in 2013 he delivered a video interview beamed from Jerusalem to a security summit in Abu Dhabi for 29 foreign ministers of Arab and Muslim countries. His honours included appointment as honorary GCMG in 2008, award of the US presidential medal of freedom in 2012 and the Congressional gold medal in 2014. Nonetheless, Peres still engendered controversy. In his inaugural presidential speech he bluntly stated that Israel had to \u201cget rid of the territories\u201d. He averred that he had changed his position, not his beliefs. Although many hailed him as a man of vision and peace, Israeli rightists flayed him for playing into the hands of the PLO. Many Likud supporters resented the way he pushed his peace agenda while the foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, was persona non grata in most capitals. More than that, his stance seemed to contradict Netanyahu\u2019s policies. For their part, the Israeli left accused Peres of acting as a figleaf for an obdurate Likud administration. They were dismayed when in 2009 he defended Israel\u2019s continuing attack on Gaza. Days later he found himself at the centre of an unseemly row with the Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan at the Davos world economic summit as a result. Though Peres\u2019s diplomatic intercession smoothed ruffled feathers, he still warned against a nuclear Iran \u201ctaking over the Middle East\u201d and rejected the critical UN report into the Gaza war. Former liberal allies were perplexed when, that May, he proclaimed newly elected Likud premier Netanyahu a peace pioneer \u2013 an opinion he reversed in 2015 when he blamed Netanyahu (re-elected that year) for talking peace but doing nothing to implement it. \u201cOver the years,\u201d wrote the Israeli historian Ze\u2019ev Sternhell, \u201cShimon Peres \u2026 destroyed everything of value [in Labour].\u201d Other leftists blamed him for initiating with Oslo II the settlement bypass roads that seemed to render a contiguous Palestinian state impossible. Peres repeatedly called Abbas a serious and true partner for peace, even admiring the courage, if not agreeing with the timing, of Abbas\u2019s 2012 UN bid for Palestinian statehood. Yet many Palestinians blamed Peres for saddling them with inferior terms in the Paris economic deal of 1994. Now Israeli critics charged him with abusing the apolitical nature of the presidency. After leaving the presidency in 2014, Peres continued work for his peace centre. When Israeli authorities denied the centre tax-exempt status because it trained doctors from Gaza, the centre suspended its application and continued with its programme, which by 2015 had helped 250 personnel. As late as November 2015, his health now failing, he insisted that Israel faced \u201ceternal war\u201d if there was no Palestinian state. Peres was an intriguingly contradictory figure: a romantic in a cynical age, an Israeli icon with a Polish accent and francophone sensibility, who carried about him the taint (deserved or otherwise) of political chicanery. Unlike holiness, he told David Frost, politics is built on compromise. Nor was he above taking audacious decisions, as in 1989 when he ordered Mossad to abduct the nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu from British soil, or in 2002, when he attracted millions to invest in nanotechnology. He certainly brought a touch of aesthetic philosophical discrimination to the world of politics. His books included The Next Step (1965), David\u2019s Sling: The Arming of Israel (1970), Entebbe Diary (1991), The New Middle East (1993), Battling for Peace (1995), The Imaginary Voyage: With Herzl in Israel (2000) and Ben Gurion: A Political Life (2011). Among the numerous biographies of him are Matti Golan\u2019s Road to Peace (1989) and Michael Bar-Zohar\u2019s Shimon Peres (2013).

Peres had twice served as prime minister of Israel and later as the country\u2019s ninth president. He had been seriously ill on a respirator in an Israeli hospital near Tel Aviv and died after his condition deteriorated sharply. Among those who have said they will attend his funeral and burial on Jerusalem\u2019s Mount Herzl on Friday are Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton, as well as Prince Charles and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. In more than six decades of political life his defining achievement was as one of the key architects of the Oslo peace accords, for which he was jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1994 with the then Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Those peace agreements \u2013 signed in Washington in 1993 and Taba, Egypt in 1995, \u2013 foresaw the creation of a Palestinian state, and were named after the Norwegian capital where the two sides launched eight months of secret negotiations in which Peres played a key role. With Peres\u2019s death the last of that trio has now gone.  Rabin was cut down by a rightwing assassin\u2019s bullet in 1995, with Arafat dying nine years later. Today, the prospect of the peace and two-state solution offered by Oslo is far away, after the collapse of that peace process in 2014.

We were privileged to be part of his private family, but today we sense that the entire nation of Israel and the global community share this great loss. We share this pain together.\u201d Within hours of his death, tributes to Peres began from world leaders. In a statement, Obama described him as \u201cthe essence of Israel itself\u201d.  He added: \u201cAs Americans, we are in his debt because, having worked with every US president since John F Kennedy, no one did more over so many years as Shimon Peres to build the alliance between our two countries \u2013 an unbreakable alliance that today is closer and stronger than it has ever been.\u201d The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said: \u201cHe worked tirelessly for a two-state solution that would enable Israel to live securely and harmoniously with the Palestinians and the wider region.  Even in the most difficult hours, he remained an optimist about the prospects for reconciliation and peace.\u201d  The Clintons said they had \u201clost a true and treasured friend\u201d and that Israel had lost a leader \u201cwho championed its security, prosperity and limitless possibilities from its birth to his last day on Earth\u201d.

Related: What do you think Shimon Peres' legacy will be?    Describing a tireless friend, his neighbour and biographer Michael Bar Zohar suggested that despite being one of its strongest proponents, Peres also recognised the failure of Oslo. \u201cThe Oslo agreement was not a very big success, not its conception, not its writing, not its partner,\u201d said Bar Zohar. \u201cIt was one of things he regretted most, but he still stuck to the conviction that Oslo was a great thing and that the \u2018new Middle East\u2019 was a new reality despite what was happening around us. \u201cHe still felt the two-state solution could be implemented although he was critical of the Israeli government about the stalemate in those negotiations and partly the Palestinians as well.\u201d The leader of Israel\u2019s opposition, Isaac Herzog, who had known Peres since childhood first through his father, Chaim Herzog, himself a president of Israel, described a man who lived his life largely in public. \u201cI was a close confidante of Shimon Peres,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cMy father was a colleague of his and I was also an adviser and an assistant to him as well as a member of government with him. For me he was a teacher and mentor.  On Oslo, he added: \u201cI think Peres vision of a two-state solution is alive and kicking. It has problems. Stumbling blocks.

But his dream will be implemented.\u201d  Despite his role in the Oslo accords, Palestinians and the wider Arab world saw the legacy of Peres differently. Many have portrayed him as a key figure in early settlement construction and pointed to his role in the 1996 Israeli assault on Lebanon, which saw the deaths of 106 civilians when a UN base where they were sheltering was shelled. For many Israelis \u2013 even those on the right who opposed his support of the peace process as \u201cnaive\u201d \u2013 Peres will be remembered for a career that intimately tracked the country\u2019s short history.  The last surviving figure associated with the founding of modern Israel, Peres moved from being a hawk to a peacemaker.

Speaking in front of almost 80 world leaders gathered at Mount Herzl cemetery, including Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, Obama said Peres had understood that \u201cthe Jewish people weren\u2019t born to rule another people\u201d. Peres, who was regarded as the last of Israel\u2019s founding generation, was buried between two other prime ministers, Yitzhak Rabin and Yitzhak Shamir. The ceremony was Israel\u2019s largest gathering of international dignitaries since the funeral of Rabin, Peres\u2019s partner in peace, who was assassinated by a Jewish nationalist in 1995. Obama\u2019s remarks were the most political at a sombre occasion where the ghost of the failed Middle East peace process loomed large, referred to as well by the former US president Bill Clinton and the Israeli novelist Amos Oz. Abbas said to Netanyahu as the two men shook hands at the ceremony: \u201cLong time, long time.\u201d     Mahmoud Abbas and Benjamin Netanyahu shake hands. Photograph: Reuters Tv/Reuters    Obama said the presence of the Palestinian leader at the funeral was \u201ca gesture and reminder of the unfinished business of peace\u201d.  He said Peres \u201cnever saw his dream of peace fulfilled \u2026 And yet he did not stop dreaming, and he did not stop working. Even in the face of terrorist attacks, repeated disappointments at the negotiating table, he insisted that Palestinians must be seen as equal in dignity to Jews and therefore equal in self-determination. He believed that Israel would be best protected when Palestinians had a state of their own.\u201d  Obama concluded: \u201cThe last of the founding generation is now gone. Toda rabah haver yakar\u201d \u2013 Hebrew for \u201cthank you so much, dear friend.\u201d Other dignitaries at the funeral included Prince Charles, Boris Johnson, David Cameron and Tony Blair, as well as Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and other heads of state. Abbas\u2019s attendance, leading a Palestinian delegation, sparked anger in some Palestinian quarters, reflected in a cartoon circulated on social media showing him in Israeli military uniform with his name altered to sound Israeli, weeping over Peres\u2019s grave. In an unprecedented security operation for the funeral, roads including the main Tel Aviv to Jerusalem highway were closed and thousands of police officers were deployed.

Photograph: Baz Ratner/Reuters    The day began with Peres\u2019s coffin carried out of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, just after 8.30am by eight military pallbearers, followed by his family. The procession was led by another member of Israel\u2019s armed forces reciting the kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead. The coffin was loaded into a hearse to travel to Mount Herzl cemetery shortly after Obama\u2019s jet set down at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv. Obama was accompanied on Air Force One by the vice-president, Joe Biden, the secretary of state, John Kerry, and 18 members of Congress.  Clinton, who was US president when Peres negotiated an interim peace accord with the Palestinians in 1993, praised Peres as a \u201cwide champion of our common humanity\u201d. Describing their 25-year friendship, Clinton dismissed critics who described Peres as a naive dreamer. \u201cHe started life as Israel\u2019s brightest student, became its best teacher and ended up its biggest dreamer,\u201d he said.  Clinton has now attended the funerals of all three of the figures who signed the Oslo peace accords and shared the Nobel peace prize \u2013 Rabin, the former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, and now Peres.

He was a great man of the world. Israel grieves for him. The world grieves for him.\u201d He said they had \u201cnever glossed over\u201d their differences of opinion, and described the fundamental difference between their approaches. \u201cIn one of our nearly night-long discussions, we addressed a fundamental question: from Israel\u2019s perspective, what is paramount \u2013 security or peace?\u201d he recalled.  \u201cShimon enthusiastically replied: \u2018Bibi, peace is the true security. If there will be peace, there will be security.\u2019 And I responded to him: \u2018Shimon, in the Middle East, security is essential for achieving peace and for maintaining it.\u2019\u201d   Related: Shimon Peres obituary    Oz, who knew Peres for 40 years, recalled his \u201ccapacity to change\u201d and called him \u201ca trailblazer who had been ridiculed, who seemed a big dreamer until the future came and proved him right\u201d. He added: \u201cWhen some say peace is not possible, it is possible, and it is necessary and inevitable because we are not going anywhere. That is why we have no option but to divide this house into two apartments. Where are the leaders, the brave leaders, who will make this dream come true and continue his vision?\u201d     An Israeli woman lights a memorial candle for Shimon Peres as she pays her respects at the Knesset. Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPA    Peres\u2019s death on Wednesday at the age of 93 led to an outpouring of tributes. In a career spanning seven decades, Peres held nearly every major office in Israel, serving twice as prime minister, and as president from 2007 to 2014. He was also an architect of Israel\u2019s undeclared nuclear programme and defence industries. While those in the west and within Israel have hailed Peres as a peacemaker, many Palestinians and those from Arab nations have questioned his record, citing his involvement in successive Arab-Israeli wars, the occupation of Palestinian territory and his support for settlement building before his work on Oslo. He was prime minister in 1996 when more than 100 civilians sheltering at a UN peacekeepers\u2019 base in the Lebanese village of Qana were killed when it was fired upon by Israel. Despite his reputation as a statesman, Peres never managed an outright win in a national election. Many in Israel opposed to the Oslo accords blamed him for what they saw as their failure. But in later life, especially during his time as president, he came to be widely embraced.

Instead the flagbearers are Dundalk FC and their manager, Stephen Kenny, who has led the team to unprecedented success by cultivating flair and technique, shattering stereotypes and redefining Irish players\u2019 potential. Now he is being acclaimed as an ideal future manager of a country whose football has not fully broken free of the mould imposed by Jack Charlton in the 1980s. \u201cThe next few weeks will determine whether this is the most successful season in the history of Irish football or we actually win nothing,\u201d Kenny tells the Guardian in advance of an intensive period during which Dundalk could win a third league title in a row, retain the FAI Cup and become the first Irish club to qualify from the Europa League\u2019s group stage, having already become the first to win a match in it or even a point. It is an extraordinary turnaround for a club that finished bottom of the league and was on the brink of extinction before new owners arrived and hired Kenny four years ago. But it is not merely results that have led to the praise for Kenny, it is the style with which they have been achieved.   Related: Dundalk\u2019s part-timers ready to make Champions League history | Alan Smith    On the same night that Feyenoord beat Manchester United last month, Dundalk drew at AZ Alkmaar with 10 men and the Dutch team\u2019s manager, John van den Brom, admitted that Dundalk \u201cwere better than us with their short combinations\u201d. The former Leeds United and Republic of Ireland midfielder Johnny Giles said last week that Kenny \u201chas tapped into the true traditions of Irish football\u201d by encouraging skill and wit rather than just brawn and guts. \u201cI don\u2019t subscribe to this view that being Irish it\u2019s in our DNA to play the direct physical route,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to have the mindset that because we\u2019re from this part of the world we\u2019re less skilful so we have to rely on physical attributes and determination and that\u2019s it. That mindset has existed for a long time. It certainly hasn\u2019t served our clubs well. There has to be another way. I do think we have very skilful players in Ireland and it\u2019s about trying to get them to absolutely believe in themselves. \u201cEveryone has their own view but a lot of people who love the game want to come and watch teams play with flair, real composure and encouragement of individual skill, having players really express themselves. That excites people to see and if you\u2019re a skilful player, that\u2019s the environment you want to flourish in. You\u2019re excited about the fact that you\u2019re coming into train with, and play for, a team that has those values and helps you fulfil your potential. \u201cAnd that\u2019s more important than winning to me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we\u2019re not adverse to winning, but I do feel that the way the team plays is hugely important to us. We want skill to overcome any other thing.\u201d It has suddenly become relevant for fans and media to compare and contrast every Republic of Ireland performance with those of Kenny\u2019s Dundalk. But Kenny is too smart and respectful to add his own voice to the suggestions that the national team would be better off in his hands. \u201cMartin O\u2019Neill is an inspirational Irish manager,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s an iconic figure, somebody who\u2019s won two European Cups as a player and then gone back and managed at the lowest level with Wycombe, then went on and had great success with Celtic and Leicester and brought Aston Villa to a top-six finish. He\u2019s got great pedigree and has just signed a new contract and is going to be there for a long time. \u201cMe, I\u2019m still learning. Every day I hope to get better. I\u2019m really hungry to do well, very focused on what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not saying: \u2018I\u2019m in the running to be an international manager\u2019 because that\u2019s a dangerous way to think. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having ambition but you have to go and make sure you do your task to hand extremely well. We have a very experienced international manager who has achieved a huge amount. For me, I have a lot to achieve myself and a lot to look forward to.\u201d His achievements so far suggest that he does indeed have a lot look forward to. The man who turns 45 later this month already has nearly two decades of mostly successful management under his belt, having become the youngest manager in League of Ireland history when he took charge of Longford Town at the age of 27. He took Longford to new heights before winning the league with Bohemians and reviving the fortunes of Derry City, whom he saved from relegation and took on a memorable Uefa Cup run that ended with a narrow defeat by Paris Saint-Germain. Those achievements attracted the interest of Dunfermline Athletic, who were then adrift at the foot of the Scottish Premier League table. Kenny led them to the 2007 Scottish Cup final \u2013 beating Rangers, Hearts and Hibernian before losing 1-0 to Celtic \u2013 but he could not rescue them from relegation, nor prevent a slow start to the following season. He was sacked after a year. \u201cI was only 35 when I walked out alongside Gordon Strachan to 55,000 people at Hampden Park,\u201d Kenny recalls. \u201c[Managing in Scotland] was a great experience but it was nine years ago. I\u2019m a different person now. You learn from experiences, good and bad. I know my own mind now. I\u2019m very certain about what I want, the type of people and players I want to work with.\u201d He began demonstrating how much he had learned at Dunfermline when he returned to Derry City, who were beset by financial trouble and demoted to the second tier. Kenny won promotion by forming a skilful winning team with a tiny budget. Seven of the youngsters he signed went on to become senior internationals, including Niall McGinn and James McClean. His thesis for the Uefa Pro Licence, which he was awarded in 2011, was on \u201cbuilding a club from nothing\u201d. Dundalk\u2019s owners knew what they were doing when they turned to him in their hour of greatest need four years ago. Wins this season over teams such as Bate Borisov and Maccabi Tel Aviv have brought unprecedented attention to a domestic league that is often overlooked even by Irish football fans. \u201cWe\u2019re competing against the English Premier League and also Gaelic games and rugby, all of which have a high profile here,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cGoing for a double double would not in itself capture the wider public in the way you\u2019d hope but the European experience elevates it. Now everyone is rooting for us, even from different sporting codes. People keep saying, \u2018we\u2019re enjoying watching you play\u2019 and we get letters and emails from schoolboy coaches all over Ireland.\u201d While others trumpet his suitability for even grander roles, Kenny is concentrating on a task that has become more difficult due to an infernal run-in. The down side to Dundalk\u2019s success this season is a fixture pileup that is stretching the resources of a squad that features several players who combine football with day jobs. On Saturday they suffered their heaviest home league defeat of Kenny\u2019s reign, 3-0 to Sligo Rovers. That leaves them one point above Cork City at the top of the table with six league games to go \u2013 and they host Cork on Tuesday. That crunch match is the first of nine games in 27 days, including a Europa League double-header against Zenit St Petersburg. The run concludes with the FAI Cup final (also against Cork) three days after their assignment in Russia. Their last two Europa League group games are in what would normally be the off-season for Irish clubs. \u201cObviously this is a challenging time for us and we have to maximise every resting opportunity between games but it\u2019s been a brilliant experience so far,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cAnd we hope to get out of the group and extend our season into February.\u201d Kenny disagrees with suggestions that there is another potential down side to his team\u2019s European run: that the money the club has earned from it \u2013 in excess of \u00a36m so far, more than six times Dundalk\u2019s annual budget \u2013 will distort competition in the League of Ireland and enable them to dominate for the foreseeable future. \u201cThat\u2019s easy to say but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate,\u201d says Kenny, whose team must stage their home European games in Dublin because their ground, Oriel Park, is ramshackle. \u201cOur facilities are poor, to say the least, so I would imagine the vast majority [of the money] is earmarked for facilities,\u201d says Kenny. \u201cAlso, several other teams are improving. Cork are pushing us hard all the way this season. The title is very much in the balance.\u201d Whatever happens on Tuesday and over the next few weeks, Kenny has shown that he is a manager worth keeping an eye on.", "publicationDate": "2016-10-10T10:42:58Z", "title": "Dundalk\u2019s Stephen Kenny winning friends and trophies with Irish trailblazers", "sentences": ["Wins this season over teams such as Bate Borisov and Maccabi Tel Aviv have brought unprecedented attention to a domestic league that is often overlooked even by Irish football fans."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/10/dundalk-stephen-kenny-ireland-europa-league"}, {"tags": ["Oceans", "Energy", "UK news", "World news", "Environment", "Marine life"], "article": "Invasions of jellyfish have proved adept at shutting down power plants in recent years. But an early warning tool is now in development to alert power stations to incoming swarms which block the cooling water intakes of coastal plants. EDF\u2019s Torness nuclear power plant in Scotland was closed for a week in 2011 after a mass of moon jellyfish invaded and the company is now working with researchers from the University of Bristol to tackle the problem.  Jellyfish swarms have also closed nuclear and coal power plants in Sweden, the US and Japan in recent years, and the new forecast tool is being designed to work in all oceans. Israeli power stations have also had jellyfish problems, while the Philippines suffered a massive blackout in 1999 after 50 truck loads of jellyfish had to be removed, and a US nuclear-powered warship, the USS Ronald Reagan, was incapacitated when visiting Australia in 2006. \u201cThey can build up a population extremely quickly,\u201d said Erica Hendy, at Bristol University. A lack of historical records makes it hard to say whether jellyfish blooms are increasing because of climate change or the overfishing of their predators. The project will use a supercomputer to model how currents sweep jellyfish blooms across oceans and how this changes over the year. Jellyfish have very limited ability to swim, but the model will take account of how they move up and down during the day, avoid rough surface conditions during storms and how their buoyancy changes as they age. Using data from recent invasions, the researchers will backtrack to identify the hotspots where the blooms are likely to have developed and where monitoring should be put in place to spot them early. EDF is already researching whether satellite imaging or drones could be used as lookouts.  Once a bloom is identified the new system should be able to predict where and when jellyfish are likely to hit the coast. \u201cEDF would like as long a warning as possible, so they could send out local fishing crews to remove the bloom before they get anywhere near the coast,\u201d said Hendy.

They can have an impact on the amount of electricity we are able to supply to consumers and can cost the business money.

Far fewer still have made it back to Israel to tell their tale.  Among that handful is Sabareen Zbeidt, aged 30, and her husband, Wissam, aged 42, who flew back into Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion airport last month with their three children \u2013 aged between three and eight \u2013 in the knowledge they would face long sentences in jail. Their return marked the end of a year-long journey through the brutalities and poverty of Isis\u2019s self-proclaimed caliphate in both Syria and Iraq, where Wissam fought with the group while Sabareen monitored security cameras in a hospital.  Disillusioned, and with Wissam wounded in the leg in fighting against the Iraqi army, they were finally persuaded by their family to come home. At the 10th attempt to cross the dangerous border with Turkey, they finally made it out of Syria with people smugglers paid for by Sabareen\u2019s father \u2013 and with the youngest daughter drugged to keep her quiet. On 22 September they flew back to Israel \u2013 and immediate arrest. A housewife and a furniture upholsterer, Sabareen and Wissam both came from families that were Hebrew-speaking, professional and middle class \u2013 far, far removed from the world of the radical Islam espoused by Isis. Their decisions have come as a profound shock and source of shame to their families, which alerted Israeli security services to the fact that their relatives had gone to join the \u201ccaliphate\u201d. Even among Sabareen\u2019s closest family members who worked so hard to bring them back, there was little sympathy for the jail time the couple are now facing. \u201cEvery person with a head on his shoulders knows it is better to be in hell here, than in paradise [with Isis],\u201d one close member of the family told the Guardian bitterly the day after the couple appeared in court in Haifa, charged with joining an \u201cenemy organisation\u201d. The story that Israel\u2019s \u201cIsis family\u201d told their interrogators has cast a light not only on their own radicalisation and harsh experiences with the jihadist group, but on the wider phenomenon of Isis jihadis with Israeli citizenship \u2013 one of the least represented groups in Isis. It has raised many questions too for their relatives, not least how it was possible for the Zbeidts to radicalise online and \u2013 undetected by Israel\u2019s security services or close relatives \u2013 make the contacts necessary to arrange their passage to the Islamists\u2019 Syrian capital, Raqqa. According to the indictment, the couple told investigators that they left Israel on 16 June last year to visit relatives in Romania, then travelled to Turkey where, via social media, they had already made contact with another Israeli national from the town of Umm-al-Fahm who had joined Isis in 2013. Handing their Israeli passports to the Isis contact who met them at the Syrian border, they were taken to Raqqa first. There, Wissam was separated from Sabareen and his children and sent to a training camp in Iraq before being sent to Mosul where he was injured in the leg during a raid on an Iraqi military outpost. Sabareen\u2019s family, who live in a large village outside the Israeli-Arab city of Sakhnin which includes a retired Israeli police officer and a teacher \u2013 say they are ashamed and angry at what their relative has done. In interviews with the Guardian, they described how Sabareen made a night-time departure from Romania where she and her family were visiting her brother, who was then completing his medical studies. \u201cTwo of her brothers were sleeping in a room,\u201d the family member recalled asking for anonymity before speaking. \u201cShe shook him and told him she was leaving \u2018for Iraq\u2019.\u201d Still half asleep, her family says, her brother did not fully understand what she was saying until it was too late. Sabareen\u2019s relatives do not, however, dispute most of what was in a statement from Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s security service, or the indictment, describing the details alleged as \u201c99% correct\u201d. Furious and ashamed at the couple\u2019s actions, they talked of their bafflement at how the couple\u2019s online activities and contacts with Isis were missed by Israel\u2019s famously attentive security services. \u201cWe have so many questions about what happened,\u201d explained the relative. \u201cWhy weren\u2019t they noticed and stopped? We still don\u2019t know what was on their minds, what they planned, or who sent them. It\u2019s no secret but after they went missing, once we understood, we informed the authorities.\u201d One clue has been supplied in an interview that appeared on Israeli news website Ynet with another member of Sabareen\u2019s family, who suggested that it was the older Wissam who pressured Sabareen to join Isis with her children. Declining to confirm this, the relative who spoke to the Guardian added only that the family would \u201cshut the door\u201d to Wissam should he ever be released. \u201cHe is a furniture upholsterer,\u201d he added. \u201cHe had a very good business. He always used to boast how he had clients who were [Israeli] security people. But Sabareen also seemed an unlikely candidate for Isis, recalled family members \u2013 she was not overly religious, and shown little interest in events in Syria and Iraq. \u201cWhen I saw her yesterday on television in the court, fully veiled, I thought: since when does she do that?\u201d the family member said. \u201cMaybe they thought it would be an adventure. Maybe they wanted be famous or thought in 100 years they would be remembered by history. Who did she think she was going to free in Syria? Who was she going to free in Iraq? \u201cWe are we are people who don\u2019t make problems,\u201d the relative added. \u201cWe are loyal to this country. They should be in prison for what they have done.\u201d Equally worrying for Israel\u2019s authorities is the fact that the Zbeidt case is the third in a month to come to court following the arrest and indictment of six residents of east Jerusalem who had allegedly set up an Isis-inspired study group and planned to reach join Isis in Syria or Egypt. But if the Zbeidt\u2019s motivations for travelling to join Isis remain obscure, what is clear is their reasons for returning, described by the couple to their interrogators and recounted in the Shin Bet statement that accompanied their charging. \u201cAt the start of the current year,\u201d the statement read, \u201cthe family members suffered a heavy bombardment that caused widespread destruction and heavy casualties in their area of residence. The children developed anxieties as a result.  \u201cMany details were also learned about the harsh routine under Daesh [Isis] rule. For example, the administration enacted discriminatory laws against women and used brutal methods of punishment such as the amputation of limbs, lashings and beheadings. A \u201cmorality police\u201d enforced dress codes for women and regarding the length of men\u2019s beards. Daesh approved trafficking in Yazidi women for housework and for sex. Children as young as eight undergo military training.\u201d The Zbeidts children are being cared for by Sabareen\u2019s parents. \u201cWe are so happy to have the children back and safe,\u201d the relative added. \u201cBut as for the parents, it is almost as if we are in mourning. Not just the family, but the whole village. We don\u2019t want this kind of people.

For business, this era is one of constant turbulence and disruption, as technological innovators pick up the snow dome and shake it again and again. Australia is not alone in having to come to terms with the challenges and opportunities that digital change is presenting. \u201cIt\u2019s borderless,\u201d says Stefan Hajkowicz, senior principal scientist, strategy and foresight, for the CSIRO. \u201cThe big thing is connectivity. The international global-level network of devices and connected data sets is having an impact in Australia as well as everywhere else. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through the early phases of it\u2026 minor changes to the way we did customer service and stored information, for example. It was business as usual with better tools. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone beyond that. Platform-based businesses \u2013 the Airbnbs, the Ubers \u2013 can challenge the existing ones and disrupt really easily. Peer-to-peer models are being unleashed in banking and finance\u2026 In the next five to 10 years banking and finance will see a lot of change. \u201cNow we\u2019re really getting deeply into business models, governance systems and policies. It\u2019s having a deeper level effect on the how the economy works.\u201d  How are other countries coping? Some countries are managing digital change better than others.  \u201cThe emerging economies of Asia are moving really fast and are at the top of the pile,\u201d Hajkowicz says. \u201cSingapore usually comes to the top of the list on the World Economic Forum rankings. They are very quick to adopt and capitalise on new technologies. There are government policies in place, the private sector is moving quickly, there\u2019s evidence of a lot of technology uptake and the education systems are responding.\u201d Singapore is training a workforce ready to tackle technological innovation. Its students are among the world\u2019s top performers in science and maths, according to the 2012 OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) rankings, which tested 15-year-olds in more than 60 countries. Other high performers were Taiwan, Korea, Finland, Switzerland, and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China. Countries that are lagging behind, or could do better \u2013 such as Australia \u2013 are desperate to improve their performance in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects to fill what has become known as the STEM skills shortage. Those countries that perform well in STEM have several attributes in common, according to the Australian Council of Learned Academies, which reported to the Prime Minister\u2019s Science Engineering and Innovation Council on STEM country comparisons in 2013.  These include:  Highly esteemed, well-paid teachers Compulsory disciplinary content Reform to encourage more engaging, problem/inquiry-based learning, and critical and creative thinking Prestige attached to careers in science Strategic bipartisan national STEM policy frameworks Targets to motivate collaborative action  The US came up with just such a target in 2012, when it announced its aim to have one million additional college graduates with STEM degrees in 10 years in a bid to fill labour shortages.

Photograph: Chinnaphong Mungsiri/Getty Images    A cultural push Professor David Wilkinson, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Corporate Engagement and Advancement) at Macquarie University, points to Israel as an example of a country that is leading the way in terms of digital transformation. Israel is known \u201cthe Start-up Nation\u201d. With astonishing rates of R&amp;D expenditure, venture capital and start-ups per capita, and an extremely high proportion of scientists and engineers, Israel has become the nearest thing to Silicon Valley outside California. So much so that the Israeli tech scene is sometimes called Silicon Wadi (Hebrew for valley). In 2010 Israel raised 20 times more venture capital, per head of population, than Australia, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.  Multinationals including Intel, IBM and Microsoft are among almost 300 foreign companies to have R&amp;D centres in Israel, according to the City of Tel Aviv. And a country with a population of just 8.5 million has an estimated 3000 to 5000 start-ups and 300,000 people employed in high-tech industries. Long-standing strong government support for commercial R&amp;D has played a big role in Israel\u2019s ongoing tech innovation success. But there\u2019s also something about the Israeli character \u2013 chutpaz, perhaps \u2013 that helps people make the leap into start-ups, says Ben Lang, co-founder of the start-up community, Innovation Israel. \u201cThe culture plays a big part,\u201d Lang says. \u201cIt has a lot to do with the personality of the entrepreneurs. It\u2019s something very unique to the ecosystem here.\u201d The fact that everyone does national service also helps, Lang says. \u201cSo much of the start-up community is influenced by their service in the IDF [Israeli Defence Forces]. What unit they served in, people they know. Since everyone is required to serve in the army, that\u2019s where the networking and lots of learning occurs.\u201d But while some countries are obviously managing digital change better than others, Professor Wilkinson says innovation can be found all over the globe, sometimes in surprising areas. \u201cI have a deep personal interest in Africa, for example, and know of many hubs of innovation, incubation and digital disruption there,\u201d Professor Wilkinson says. \u201cOf course many such settings don\u2019t have much depth and breadth, but once the change takes hold, it will spread.\u201d   Related: The age of collaboration    From the States to Spain Inspiration can be found everywhere. In the US, the Brookings Insitution, a non-profit public policy organisation, describes innovation districts as the \u201cultimate mash-up of entrepreneurs and educational institutions, start-ups and schools, mixed-use development and medical innovations, bike-sharing and bankable investments \u2013 all connected by transit, powered by clean energy, wired for digital technology, and fuelled by caffeine.\u201d Economic, physical, and networking assets combine with a supportive, risk-taking culture to create what Brookings calls an innovation ecosystem: \u201ca synergistic relationship between people, firms and place (the physical geography of the district) that facilitates idea generation and accelerates commercialisation.\u201d Brookings\u2019 work has helped inform Macquarie University\u2019s ongoing development of its own innovation district in Sydney\u2019s Macquarie Park. \u201cBrookings has characterised and codified the model beautifully,\u201d Professor Wilkinson says. He says the Brookings model or \u201cplaybook\u201d is clear, and can be adjusted for each setting. \u201cThere is also a very useful audit and evaluation framework,\u201d he says. \u201cI have visited many innovation districts and the key principles play out in each \u2013 but being sensitive to local needs is essential.\u201d Meanwhile, as the Spanish economy recovers from its years in the doldrums, the Barcelona start-up scene is an exciting place to be, says Scott Mackin, the American founder of Barcinno, a community-driven English-language platform that shares news of the local start-up scene as well as hosting events and workshops and helping inbound companies settle in the city. \u201cBarcelona is poised for exponential growth in the next five to 10 years.\u201d Mackin says. \u201cOn the whole, we\u2019re still a very young and immature start-up ecosystem, but that is rapidly changing\u2026 investors are coming in from all sides to get a piece of the action.\u201d As an English-language platform, Barcinno helps Spanish start-ups reach an international audience. Mackin describes it as \u201ca two-way bridge of talent, capital and information between Barcelona and the global business community\u201d. The Spanish Government has done a good job in supporting entrepreneurship, City Hall has been active in branding Barcelona an \u201cinnovation capital\u201d, and the city has world-class business, polytechnic and research facilities, which together makes a potent combination, Mackin says.

(In Australia) all happening and will happen more and more, whatever government does or does not do  Professor Wilkinson     Hajkowicz says Australia is lagging behind the rising economies of Asia, particularly in areas such as high-speed broadband connectivity and having a workforce qualified to take on the digital age. The Government acknowledged the need for action last December, when it launched the National Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA), a $1.1 billion, four-year program to incentivise innovation and entrepreneurship, reward risk taking, and promote science, maths and computing in schools.  Launching the agenda, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull noted that Australia has some good things going for it: strong economic fundamentals; direct access to Asia; a global reputation for goods and services; and quality scientific research organisations.  But it also has obstacles: a low appetite for risk, which can make it hard for start-ups to attract capital; declining participation in science, maths and computing at high school; and a consistent ranking of last or second last among OECD countries for business research collaboration.  \u201cIncreasing collaboration between businesses, universities and the research sector is absolutely critical for our businesses to remain competitive,\u201d the Prime Minister said. Hajkowicz welcomed the initiative.  \u2018It\u2019s a really important agenda,\u201d he says. \u201cEssentially Australia has to make a transition in its economy from where we are now to a much more advanced hi-tech economy that is much better plugged in to the Asian economies around us.  \u201cThe NISA package is a key policy tool instrument to help us make this leap. But there is still a how-to factor to building an innovative economy that we haven\u2019t resolved. We don\u2019t really know how to do it.  \u201cDo we just build infrastructure and hope they will all come? Or do we pick winners and choose industries? Should we be trying to invest big time in the fintech sector because we think it is going to be a huge industry? Or do we just let the marketplace sort itself out? There are some unanswered questions there.\u201d Professor Wilkinson was also glad to see the NISA package launched, though he has reservations. \u201cNISA has encouraged and enabled the conversation,\u201d Professor Wilkinson says. \u201cIt is important for that alone. There are some useful new investments being proposed, but others, such as funding for incubators and incubation programming, are completely inadequate. \u201cMy own view of the sector in Australia is that it is all happening and will happen more and more, whatever government does or does not do. Nobody is waiting for government, and we don\u2019t need to.\u201d Ready to be a smart disruptor?

I\u2019d never set foot outside England, but after the second world war I felt a great urge to escape the greyness of austerity Britain, so I applied to the Colonial Nursing Service. The first big difference was that the sun was shining, which it didn\u2019t do much at home. And, while I\u2019d been told to expect all sorts of shortages, it was a land of plenty; nothing like England, where everything was rationed, even clothes. I thought I would never stop eating. It was the first time I\u2019d had anything like hummus or little baby courgettes or any of the lovely Mediterranean food. There were Viennese coffee shops with sticky cakes and gooey stuff. And Jaffa, where I was based, was the centre of the orange export trade. I worked as a sister at the government hospital. The nursing staff was a mixture (when I first got there, it was Jews, Arabs and Armenians) but the patients were mostly Arab. It was a very pleasant atmosphere. There was a good bus service to Tel Aviv, so I\u2019d go to look at the shops and have clothes made; there were all these lovely dresses with full skirts and tight waists. There were a lot of British people stationed in Palestine at the time. The country was full of British army, and the colonial way of life was still in existence. Newcomers wrote their names in a book at Government House, and were invited to all sorts of exciting gatherings: I would never have rubbed shoulders with the people I was introduced to otherwise. But the situation had been rumbling for a while, and everybody was wondering how things were going to work out. I met my husband, Stanley, at the swimming club in Jaffa. I remember the first time I saw him \u2013 he was a very nice shade of brown, having served in various places all through the war. We married in February 1948. By this time, the state of affairs in Palestine had become unsafe, following the UN vote to partition Palestine into Arab and Jewish states. People on all sides were being killed, and most British civilians had already been evacuated. While the situation was worrying, I didn\u2019t feel unsafe. But I was naive.   Related: \u2018National service had its moments\u2019: the Queen\u2019s Commonwealth tour of Nigeria, 1956    At the end of April 1948, we were told a convoy was coming to take us to the airport. We were disappointed to leave, but there were no two ways about it: the day before, the airport had been looted and the customs building set on fire. The army was guarding the runway, and we were flown in an RAF plane that was unpressurised and very noisy. They served tea and coffee from flasks. I hadn\u2019t thought about media attention, but there were others on board who were much more newsworthy than us, such as the mayor of Jerusalem, who had had his braces nicked by a bullet that had come through his office window a few hours earlier. Landing at Heathrow, I had hoped our return would be temporary, but a month later I found out I was pregnant, and that rather changed everything. After a few years, though, we were fortunate to work abroad again. Looking at this picture now, I am reminded of how excited I had been to live abroad. But the picture also makes me sad: Stanley is dead, and I\u2019m 95 and a bit frayed around the edges. The situation in the Middle East upsets me, too: there are good people on both sides, but I can\u2019t see how it\u2019s going to end. \u2022 Interview by Candice Pires Are you in a notable photograph?

In April, thousands of jellyfish invaded Hallandale Beach in South Florida, Miami, while officials continued to discourage visits to certain beaches in the US with expected jellyfish invasions. Global jellyfish populations have been steadily growing in recent years, driven by rising ocean temperatures, pollution and overfishing. In her book, Stung!: On Jellyfish Blooms and the Future of the Oceans, scientist Lisa-Ann Gershwin argues the increased acidity in oceans have made it ideal for jellyfish to thrive. Aside from being a menace to beachgoers, jellyfish can also harm underwater infrastructure, clogging the cooling systems of nuclear power plants. According to the National Science Foundation, colonies of jellyfish in the Gulf of Mexico can be 100 miles long, with more jellyfish than water at their densest.   Related: The perfect hangover cure? Californian company makes snack bars from beer    Howard Carter, a bite prevention expert who developed a product to relieve jellyfish stings, believes the trend will continue: \u201cMore and more jellyfish will end up on the popular beaches like in South Florida, especially with the strong winds and currents in the US. There are already extremely poisonous species like the box jellyfish in the Caribbean Sea \u2013 which is not too far.\u201d Now, one Israeli startup thinks it\u2019s found a solution to tackling these swelling populations \u2013 biodegradable diapers and female hygiene products made out of jellyfish. Cine\u2019al was conceived by Shachar Richter, a material scientist at the University of Tel Aviv, who began studying jellyfish a few years ago. As a material scientist, Richter looked closely at the flesh of jellyfish, and found that it could absorb liquid in large quantities. He and his colleagues then developed a super-absorbent material they named \u201chydromash\u201d, which Richter says can absorb a high volume of blood and water.  In order to produce hydromash, the company first breaks down the jellyfish flesh and then adds antibacterial nanoparticles to the mix, which remove the sting. The process converts the jellyfish into a strong, flexible but fully biodegradable material. Although jellyfish stings are painful and sometimes fatal, jellyfish are composed of 90% water. Richter and his colleagues realized jellyfish flesh could actually be used in medical bandages and sponges. Cine\u2019al is now developing infant and adult diapers, as well as feminine hygiene products made out of hydromash. The company expects the products to hit the market in the next 18 months. The global diaper market size was estimated at $52bn in 2015, and set to reach $76.5bn by 2022. There are 40.37m diapers used daily in the US, most of which end up in landfills. About 43 million women in the US use tampons; on average, a woman uses 11,000 tampons in her lifetime. A typical disposable diaper or tampon can take hundreds of years to break down. According to Richter, a product made of hydromash takes less than 30 days to biodegrade. Cine\u2019al isn\u2019t unique when it comes to drawing inspiration from nature to create new materials. Biomason, a North Carolina startup, makes eco-friendly bricks grown with sand and bacteria. Coeio has invented a \u201cburial suit\u201d made out of mushrooms, which is intended to neutralize toxins found in a decomposing body and transfer nutrients to plant life after burial. Agroplast, a Danish startup, uses pig urine to produce bioplastics which could be turned into disposable plates and utensils. \u201cIf these products go mainstream, they can revolutionize the market and make an environmentally noticeable difference,\u201d says Nir Davison, Richter\u2019s colleague at Cine\u2019al also involved in the development of the material. \u201cJellyfish are elegant, beautiful and intriguing creatures.

The strong connection between the United States and Israel is based on shared values, shared interests and a shared destiny. \u201cI\u2019m certain that President-elect Trump and I will continue to strengthen the unique alliance between Israel and the United States, and bring it to new heights,\u201d he added. After a phone conversation between Netanyahu and Trump later, it emerged that Trump had invited the Israeli prime minister to the US. \u201cPresident-elect Trump invited Prime Minister Netanyahu to a meeting in the United States at the first opportunity,\u201d said a statement from Netanyahu\u2019s office.   Related: Donald Trump wins US election: 'we're all on the same team' says Obama \u2013 live    Netanyahu\u2019s remarks came as it was suggested that Netanyahu and his team had privately expected Hillary Clinton to be elected. In a more coded message of congratulations, Israel\u2019s opposition leader, Isaac Herzog, referred to the rise of a new global populist politics, saying: \u201cThe US elections are a continuation of a global trend of rejecting the old ruling elites and a wish for a clear and emphatic change. \u201cTrump\u2019s election is the continuation of a social, economic and political tsunami that we\u2019ve seen in many countries, which will also bring about change in Israel.\u201d But other members of Netanyahu\u2019s government \u2013 considered the most rightwing in Israeli history \u2013 showed less restraint. The education minister, Naftali Bennett, who heads the hardline Jewish Home party and is seen as seeking to be prime minister one day, said the idea of a Palestinian state was now over. \u201cTrump\u2019s victory is an opportunity for Israel to immediately retract the notion of a Palestinian state in the centre of the country, which would hurt our security and just cause,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThis is the position of the president-elect \u2026 The era of a Palestinian state is over.\u201d The justice minister, Ayelet Shaked, also of Jewish Home; deputy foreign minister Tzipi Hotovely, from Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing Likud party; and Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat also called for the embassy to be transferred. The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Palestinians see Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, while the Israelis call the entire city their eternal indivisible capital. A Trump administration will be far more favourable to the Jewish state, another of the president-elect\u2019s advisers on Israel has said. Shmuel Rosner, a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute, said a Trump administration is likely to be \u201cmuch more understanding if Israel has to use force in order to tamp down Palestinian violence\u201d. He also said he felt the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be \u201cmuch less of a priority, and when it\u2019s not a priority, this means that Israel in some ways gets off the hook\u201d. The Palestinian president, Mahmud Abbas, congratulated Trump and said he hoped peace could be achieved during his term based on the two-state solution. \u201cWe are ready to deal with the elected president on the basis of a two-state solution and to establish a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders,\u201d spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina told AFP, referring to the year when Israel seized the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.", "publicationDate": "2016-11-09T18:23:42Z", "title": "Trump has 'every intention' of recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital", "sentences": ["Israeli government ministers and political figures are pushing the US president-elect, Donald Trump, to quickly fulfill his campaign promise to overturn decades of US foreign policy and recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/09/israel-donald-trump-netanyahu-jerusalem"}, {"tags": ["Trump administration", "US foreign policy", "Donald Trump", "US news", "US elections 2016", "World news"], "article": "Picture the scene. A US Air Force F-16 Falcon has come down over Syria. The pilot is being held by Islamic State which threatens to behead him. Video shows the pilot being tortured in a cage, while the terrorists taunt new US president, Donald Trump. The pilot\u2019s family plead for the White House to save him. The drama is dominating the 24-hour TV news networks. It\u2019s a media storm. What will Trump do? Answer: nobody has a clue. Trump lacks military experience. He has never served in the armed forces. Nor does he have any background in diplomacy. What Trump does have, by all accounts, is a short fuse \u2013 a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later. His predecessors would have played for time, appealed to local allies, or pursued deniable, back-door talks while examining options for a rescue. But president Trump is different. Unused to the awesome responsibility of the Oval Office, under fierce pressure to act, enraged by Isis\u2019s personal jibes, infuriated by accusations of dithering, and determined not to show weakness, it is easy to imagine Trump making a wrong, hasty and disastrous call. With a few hot-headed words, translated into situation-room orders, Trump could not only lose the pilot, he could plunge the US inextricably into the quagmire of another Middle East war.    There are grave doubts about Trump's inexperience, volatile temperament and macho instincts    Grave doubts about Trump\u2019s inexperience, volatile temperament and macho instincts also apply in other global hotspots where a US president\u2019s actions, or inaction, are always critical and sometimes lethal. Here are five dangerous flashpoint issues that could suddenly and unpredictably test the novice president\u2019s judgment, cool and common sense in the first 100 days of his tenure. SYRIA AND IRAQ The Isis hostage scenario is not wholly imaginary. In January last year, a Royal Jordanian air force pilot, Muath al-Kasasbeh, was captured and burned to death in a cage by the jihadis after negotiations for his release failed. Similar repeat incidents involving US, European and Arab members of the anti-Isis coalition, and local forces, are becoming more likely as the endgame in the fight against the Isis caliphate approaches. The battle is being fought out on two main fronts. One is the siege of Mosul, northern Iraq\u2019s principal city. Trump has criticised the conduct of the campaign, which involves the mainly Shia Iraqi army, Kurdish and Sunni Arab militias backed by 300 US special forces commandos. But he has not offered an alternative strategy. Much the same holds true of the attempt to seize the Isis headquarters in Raqqa, in northern Syria. Trump says that defeating terrorism is a top priority and he will \u201cbomb the shit out of Isis\u201d. But nobody, including him, appears to know what this means in practice. If the battle goes badly, will he escalate? Will he carpet-bomb cities where millions of civilians live? Is he prepared to deploy US ground forces? What will he do if, as seems possible, both sieges become bogged down, or Isis begins mass, daily executions of civilians? Trump is also silent about Turkey\u2019s significant military intervention in Syria and Iraq and its parallel fight with the Kurds. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan wants two things from Trump: an end to US support for the Kurdish peshmerga and the extradition of Fethullah G\u00fclen, a cleric exiled in the US who he blames for last summer\u2019s failed coup. With Isis on the back foot and the Iraqi and Syrian governments weakened, the Turkey-Kurd feud could explode at any time as the protagonists try to redraw national boundaries and compete for territory and resources. RUSSIA AND EASTERN EUROPE Trump has raised expectations that he can repair the US rupture with Russia. But a reset will come with a price. In the first instance, Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s authoritarian president, will want a relaxation or scrapping of punitive sanctions imposed after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. To dismay in Europe, Trump has suggested he may agree. Putin also seems likely to get his way in Syria, where Russian forces have pushed his client, Bashar al-Assad, to the brink of victory in Aleppo and elsewhere. Trump has made no serious objection to Russian actions in Syria, even though the UN says they may constitute war crimes. He seems content to have Assad remain in power, or even to treat him as an anti-Isis ally. However, the regime\u2019s renewed use of chemical weapons, for example, new Russian atrocities, or a suddenly escalating humanitarian and refugee catastrophe could all trigger a new crisis that blows up in Trump\u2019s face, forcing him to move against Putin. The idea of no-fly zones and civilian safe havens still has backers. If Trump goes down this route, he could end up directly confronting Russia\u2019s military. The European allies cannot do much about Trump\u2019s Syria insouciance. But they will strongly oppose him if he tries to run down the Nato alliance, as he has suggested. Russian pressure on Nato\u2019s easternmost members in the Baltic republics, Poland and Bulgaria \u2013 in terms of political meddling, disinformation, cyber attacks, missile deployments and military exercises \u2013 is reaching new heights. Influence-peddling and destabilisation operations are increasingly reported in Moldova, Montenegro and elsewhere in the Balkans. Eastern Ukraine remains a ticking timebomb. Any of these flashpoints could ignite at any time in Trump\u2019s first 100 days. European governments want to present a strong, united front. But Trump seems more interested in buying Russia off by acquiescing in Putin\u2019s reclamation of former cold war spheres of influence. Trump\u2019s disdain for the EU \u2013 he loudly applauded Britain\u2019s vote to leave \u2013 and critical European reaction to his election, notably in Germany and France, point to a possible US-Europe schism down the road. If it happens, Trump will have helped Putin achieve a long-cherished Russian strategic objective, shattering 70 years of Euro-Atlanticism. CHINA Beijing shows no sign of backing away from its expansionist policies in the South China and East China seas. It is busily transforming reefs and tiny islands into military bases, which will ultimately give it control of sea lanes through which much of the world\u2019s maritime trade passes. China continues to ignore the rival territorial claims of neighbouring countries, including Japan, whose commerce is directly threatened. To counter China, the US and Japan have stepped up naval and air patrols in the disputed areas. They have also pursued closer military cooperation with Vietnam and other regional states such as Australia. A recent UN court ruling in the Hague on a complaint brought by the Philippines rejected China\u2019s claims as illegal. But Beijing rejected the decision, and has since sought to woo the Philippines\u2019 anti-American president, Rodrigo Duterte. It is more than likely, on present trends, that the US and Chinese militaries will, sooner or later, come into direct confrontation, either by air or at sea. Until now a clash has been avoided, partly because neither side knows where it would lead. Nationalist feeling in China is periodically whipped up by the Communist party. If Trump blunders into this delicate situation, or deliberately tries to push the Chinese back, the fallout could be dangerous. In terms of tripwires, Taiwan is, as always, a trap for an unwary American leader. Taiwan elected a new president earlier this year whom the Chinese suspect of pursuing an independence agenda. It has since increased pressure on Taipei, including suspending talks. Taiwan has been a frozen conflict for so long that it is hard to imagine it suddenly going \u201clive\u201d. But Xi Jinping, China\u2019s hard-headed president, is clear that he will not wait indefinitely for reunification. Like Trump, he is used to getting what he wants. NORTH KOREA AND IRAN The issue of nuclear proliferation links these two countries. Iran has always denied possessing or trying to acquire or build nuclear weapons in the past. Last year\u2019s landmark pact between Washington, its European partners and Tehran produced pledges that Iran would not seek to make a bomb in the future, or at least for the next 10 years. But Trump is on record as saying the deal is a bad one and should be scrapped. This stance plays into the hands of hardline clerics in Tehran who have consistently opposed president Hassan Rouhani\u2019s policy of nuclear concessions in return for UN sanctions relief. Israel\u2019s right-wing government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump\u2019s new best friend (see below), also wants the deal scrapped. If Trump reneges, Rouhani will be undermined, as will be global counter-proliferation efforts. North Korea\u2019s dictator, Kim Jong-un, not only already has nuclear weapons, but is accelerating and expanding the country\u2019s weapons-building programmes, much to the alarm of Japan, South Korea and the west. In the past, Trump suggested he might meet Kim. The offer was laughed off in Pyongyang. A parlay between Kim and Trump might set some kind of record for clashing egos. But it would be unlikely to achieve much. Trump\u2019s other suggestion, that Japan and South Korea acquire nuclear weapons to deter North Korea, was one of his more irresponsible \u2013 and insensitive, given Japan\u2019s unique experience in 1945. North Korea will be watching the Trump administration closely. If it senses Trump is distracted, or disinterested in Asian security issues (which has certainly appeared to be the case until now), Kim could try something provocative or risky, if only to test US reactions. Given that he is three-parts unhinged, that is a scary prospect. ISRAEL AND PALESTINE     Donald Trump with Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu in New York. Photograph: Reuters    Trump has taken a staunchly pro-Israel line since running for president and has promised to be the country\u2019s \u201cclosest friend\u201d. What this may mean in practice is the subject of speculation. But Trump advisers have told Israeli media that one of his first acts will be to order the removal of the US embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Such a decision, resisted by past Democrat and Republican presidents alike, is of enormous symbolic importance since it would represent de facto recognition of Israel\u2019s claim to all of Jerusalem as its indivisible capital. It would negate, in one sweeping gesture, the Palestinians\u2019 claim to east Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent Palestinian state. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, has been careful to keep on the right side of Trump, having fallen out with Barack Obama over US peacemaking efforts and a range of other issues. Netanyahu\u2019s obsequiousness may be paying off. As far as is known, he is the first foreign leader to be invited to the Trump White House. Some of his more hardline cabinet ministers are meanwhile predicting the end of any American efforts to implement a two-state solution. The Palestinian leadership has politely congratulated Trump on his success. But if he makes the Jerusalem switch, anger in the occupied territories and Gaza will be intense, and could quickly turn violent. Another intifada is the very last thing the Middle East needs.

About 50,000 people have been evacuated from the city as a precaution. Haifa\u2019s civilian airport was closed on Thursday, while local media reported plans to evacuate prisons. \u201cWe evacuated three neighbourhoods and there are people who are stuck,\u201d a fire department spokesman, Kayed Daher, said of the situation in Haifa earlier in the day. \u201cThe fire is still burning and the flames are approaching a gas [petrol] station.\u201d The fires are the worst since 2010, when Israel suffered its single deadliest wildfire; it killed 42 people and was extinguished only after firefighting aircraft from as far away as the US were dispatched to bring it under control.

Rosen\u2019s comments come amid fraught debate among American Jews over Trump\u2019s election, appointments and likely policies on Israel. While some prominent Jewish organisations have remained silent over the appointment of Bannon, others have issued condemnations.

It wasn\u2019t a question of success \u2013 both genres have been globally successful for many years \u2013 but of provenance. This was the year in which western audiences began to wake up to the excellence and diversity of genre voices from around the world. Take, for instance, the Hugo, the genre\u2019s most prestigious award. Over the last couple of years this prize was more or less hijacked by the \u201cSad\u201d and \u201cRabid Puppies\u201d \u2013 groups opposed to the more progressive and liberal iterations of SF. In 2016 these angry activists proved much less destructive. This year\u2019s Hugo winners were not only great books, they were pointers for the direction in which the genre as a whole is moving. Best novel went to NK Jemisin\u2019s The Fifth Season (Orbit), a tale of an earthquake-afflicted and wasted world that functions as a powerful fable of ecological collapse while also reconfiguring fantasy in more ethnically and sexually diverse directions. Best novella was Nnedi Okorafor\u2019s African-flavoured space opera Binti (Tor), while best novelette was Folding Beijing by Hao Jingfang, translated by Ken Liu.    The power of translation is a unifying theme in an unusually varied year for SF    Hao is the first Chinese woman to win a Hugo, and while SF has been a big deal in China for some years, in 2016 it began properly to filter into western consciousness. Death\u2019s End (Head of Zeus), the final volume of Liu Cixin\u2019s Remembrance of Earth\u2019s Past trilogy, was published in English (the first volume, The Three-Body Problem, won last year\u2019s best novel Hugo), again translated by Ken Liu. Liu Cixin\u2019s trilogy is SF in the grand style, a galaxy-spanning, ideas-rich narrative of invasion and war between humanity and the alien \u201cTrisolarians\u201d. There is an energy, a rawness, to a lot of Chinese SF, a sense of excitement in the possibilities of the genre itself. The more China becomes a high-tech global power, the more we will see its writers and artists turn to SF as the literature best fitted to exploring technological and social change. Of course, the main barrier to a properly global SF remains the anglophone biases of culture and fandom, which give an advantage to writers who work in English. Lavie Tidhar\u2019s Central Station (Tachyon), a sprawling hymn to the glory and mess of cultural diversity set in a future spaceport Tel Aviv, is one example: Israeli-born Tidhar lives in London and writes in English. Malaysian-born writer Zen Cho also lives in London and writes in English: her elegantly drawn Regency fantasy Sorcerer to the Crown (Pan) won this year\u2019s British Fantasy award. But translation is on the rise, too, often drawing on crowdsourced or kickstarted funds to bring writers to new audiences. Meanwhile, in Iraq + 100: Stories from a Century After the Invasion, Comma press commissioned 10 homegrown writers to imagine what their country might look like in the year 2103, with fascinating results.     Galaxy-spanning \u2026 Death\u2019s End, the final volume of Liu Cixin\u2019s Remembrance of Earth\u2019s Past trilogy, portrays alien invasion.

South African author Nick Wood\u2019s potent debut Azanian Bridges (NewCon) uses alt\u2011history to get under the skin of apartheid. Ada Palmer\u2019s first novel, Too Like the Lightning (Tor), is written with real panache, mashing together 18th-century manners and 25th-century interplanetary adventure. Becky Chambers followed up the huge success of her self-published first novel with an equally good second, the clever and touching A Closed and Common Orbit (Hodder &amp; Stoughton). And Yoon Ha Lee\u2019s Ninefox Gambit (Solaris) recasts Korean legend in a densely rendered high-tech future universe governed by \u201ccalendars\u201d, in effect computer programs that determine the nature of reality. While Yoon Ha Lee\u2019s worldbuilding is intricate, some of the year\u2019s best books took quite simple ideas and developed them in direct and powerful ways. Christopher Priest\u2019s The Gradual (Gollancz), set in a vast archipelago, develops a straightforward-enough science-fictional version of time zone differences into an extraordinary meditation on travel, ageing and loss, while Nina Allan\u2019s beautifully written The Race (Titan) works four characters and two versions of Britain into a heart-wrenching story about the difficulties of human connection. In an unusually varied year for SF and fantasy, this may be the closest we have to a unifying theme: translation as a way of talking about the obstacles to, and possibilities of, truer communication. It\u2019s no coincidence that the alien-encounter movie Arrival turned out to be one of the best films of the year. It was based on a short story by Ted Chiang, a writer long revered in the genre, though little known outside it. Chiang\u2019s story takes as its hero a linguistics expert and translator. Her struggles to connect are a metaphor for something far bigger \u2013 in SF and fantasy, and in the wider world. \u2022 Adam Roberts\u2019 The Thing Itself is published by Gollancz.

They rarely break out into global activity by themselves. Cities participate in collective movements or networks to take advantage of new conditions, and often their demise or withdrawal from a global orientation is also experienced jointly with other cities as circumstances change, affecting many at once. The world\u2019s first great market-driven cities were established more than 4,000 years ago in the early bronze age, and their rich history is only now beginning to be understood. An urban revolution was taking place, with most residents of what is today southern Iraq living in cities, and this process of urbanisation was accompanied by trade on a new scale. Farther east, the cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, in modern-day Pakistan along the Indus River valley, were among the first cities with diversified economies and societies. They were located on trade routes that specialised in gemstones and spanned the whole of central Asia.   Related: The story of cities, part 1: how Alexandria laid foundations for the modern world    These cities formed the epicentre of a vast trade network based on a common cultural and linguistic community, and built infrastructure to provide good standards of living for residents. With their deep-rooted cultures and external orientation, they exhibited many of the hallmarks of what are now considered to be global cities. One important lesson to be drawn from the early waves of urbanisation and the long distance activities of cities is that prized assets and luxury possessions have often been drivers of interconnection and collaboration. As China began to expand its horizons, the trade in horses, silk, bamboo, rice and wine was vigorous and often used in diplomacy to guarantee peace between empires and cities. Silk even became an international currency. Within a few hundred years, the world had been effectively shrunk by the growing sophistication of the trade network. As historian Peter Frankopan, author of The Silk Roads, notes: \u201cWe think of globalisation as a uniquely modern phenomenon, yet 2,000 years ago it was a fact of life \u2013 one that presented opportunities, created problems, and prompted technological advance.\u201d The first European city to develop networks akin to those of a modern global city was Rome. Its empire came to consist of a federation of cities \u2013 stretching from Spain and Scotland in the west, to the Euphrates river in the east \u2013 each of which had a territory attached. Rome provided the administration, the stability, the monetary regime, and the tax structure for cities to thrive amid a huge spike in population mobility and mercantile activity.     Video by Max Galka   By the mid-Roman era, most contemporaneous historians perceived the world to have been globalised. Polybius in his Histories remarked that \u201cfrom this point onwards history becomes an organic whole: the affairs of Italy and Africa are connected with those of Asia and of Greece, and all events bear a relationship and contribute to a single end.\u201d Among the lasting features of this wave of globalisation of trading cities was a much larger and more diverse trading of goods across continents. This trade fuelled a new commercial zone in the Indian Ocean and direct trade with India. The Roman urban network also helped spread religion, and cities in the Roman system later became centres of Christian authority. This era was perhaps the first time that one city\u2019s power and influence became the fundamental driver of intercontinental trade.  But while the rise and fall of Rome as a global city is well documented, others have resumed global roles whenever the geopolitical opportunity has presented itself.  Istanbul, for example, has experienced many cycles of global exchange over the last two millennia because of its unique strategic location as a bridge between Europe and Asia. Formerly named Byzantium, the city was transformed by Emperor Constantine in the fourth century AD and renamed Constantinople because it was close to Rome\u2019s economic and political interests in the eastern empire.     Contemporary historians of the mid-Roman era believed that the word had been globalised. Photograph: Andrew Medichini/AP    Roman leaders needed an open city located close to Rome\u2019s supply market along the Silk Roads, across the Black Sea, through rich Anatolia and into the wheat producing areas of the Nile. As a result, Constantinople assumed command and control functions, and drew ambitious Roman citizens and traders from around the world. As a cultural melting pot, Constantinople facilitated the spread of Christianity across the Roman Empire. Despite the collapse of the western Roman empire, Constantinople later resumed its role as a vibrant trade hub in the eighth and ninth centuries. Under a tight system of state control over factories, workshops, wages and tariffs, the city processed trade from Russia, India, China and Africa, with merchants attracted by its gold and silk commodities. It transported goods to and from Venice, Pisa, Genoa and all over Europe, and at one point is said to have been home to 60,000 Italians. Much later, under the Ottomans, Constantinople became Istanbul. Its leaders grasped the new opportunities of European trade and actively invited the intelligentsia of the Islamic world. While Istanbul\u2019s influence has waxed and waned, its strategic position has repeatedly proved an asset to outward-looking leaders, and has created an enduring appeal to immigrant entrepreneurs and innovators. Europe\u2019s commercial wave A new wave of cities developing international roles took place in the 11th and 12th centuries, as part of what is sometimes called the \u201ccommercial revolution\u201d. As population and urbanisation grew, a two-pronged system of cities emerged: the lucrative trade in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea of Europe was gathering pace in some, while many Italian city-states were becoming prosperous through shipping, commerce and banking. This was a time when many systems of rule and governance coexisted. As cities grew, they became independent or semi-autonomous entities with their own military capability. This wave of globalisation was also characterised by a powerful merchant class that dominated the market economy and had an active role in city leadership.

Illustration: De Agostini Picture Library/Getty Images    Italian cities took advantage of geopolitical opportunity during the Crusades to expand their trading and banking services for the military campaigns. Venice in particular gained privileges in the Byzantine empire and extended relations with the pope. With Italian success came influence. By the late 1200s, Florence and Genoa were minting gold coins, and Florence\u2019s own currency became dominant in European commercial and financial markets. This wave marked the first time that so many regions and religions had come into sustained contact. In her book Before European Hegemony, sociologist Janet Abu-Lughod identified eight regional circuits in operation, stretching from north-western Europe all the way to modern-day Malaysia and Philippines. It was also a time in which cities achieved great cultural, artistic and intellectual advances, spawning both trade and knowledge exchange. The circuits Abu-Lughod described thus fostered interregional contact through cultural gateway cities such as Venice in the west and Malacca in the east. In between, the geopolitical opportunity for peace after the 13th-century Mongol invasions was also a catalyst for ports and caravan cities in the Middle East to develop and globalise.     The Blue Mosque in Tabriz, once described as the most cosmopolitan city in the world. Photograph: Alamy    One example was Tabriz, in modern-day Iran, which attracted a large number of European merchants and was described as the most cosmopolitan city in the world in the 13th century. It specialised in gold and silk cloth-weaving, and in trade in precious stones. Five hundred years later, the city was still noted for its independent merchant class. The Black Death devastated many of the leading cities in this wave, but the advanced network of the Hanseatic League and the globalising cities in southern Europe endured into the 15th century, brought together by a shared desire to conduct free trade. This wave is thus often seen as vital to the later spread and success of modern capitalism. The post-Columbus wave Beginning in around 1500, cities that had globalised in the previous wave began experiencing multiple and long-lasting setbacks. Agriculture was earning diminishing returns, and religious warfare gripped many cities. Italian and Iberian cities began to experience deindustrialisation, uncompetitive wages, and loss of market share to cities in the east. A shift in favour of northern European cities began to take place. Globalisation had taken on new characteristics, with new roles for cities in a system where sovereign states were stamping their authority. Advances in map-making and ship-building helped improve communications and reduce transaction costs for cities. One change was in the nature of consumption: a new class of consumers appeared with a shared goal to signal position and status, driving major growth in production and retail sectors.  Gradually a much better connectivity emerged, characterised by an enlarged and integrated global market, new notions of a single world, and a sense of cosmopolitan identity. Northern European cities profited the most from this wave of globalisation. At this point, the beginnings of what became known as the \u201cgreat divergence\u201d between Europe and Asia appeared. Many arguments have been put forward to explain it. One factor was that merchants and bankers in northern European cities were able to protect their investments by legal means and to separate their capital from personal risk, which was not possible in Asian cities. A higher pace of urban growth, greater self-government for cities, and a strong trade focus in urban public policy have all also been suggested as key factors explaining the divergence. European cities are often described as the globalising cities of this era, but Islamic conquests were also enabling a new group of cities to go global. From the early 1500s, northern Indian cities in particular were brought into a vast Muslim sphere of influence under the Mughal empire.     English grandee rides in an Indian procession, \u2018Company Style\u2019 (East India Company). Illustration: Universal Images Group/Getty Images    The unification of commercial practices, common customs and beliefs allowed cities such as Delhi to become tightly integrated into Eurasian trade routes, especially for the export of textiles. Ahmedabad and Agra also thrived, aided by factory investment from the English East India Company \u2013 and, along with Delhi, reached a peak population of 400,000 people. Meanwhile Surat, nearly 200 miles north of Mumbai, became possibly the world\u2019s largest port, home to 150,000 people and at one point the richest city in India. Many assessments place these Indian cities\u2019 output at least on a par with leading European centres of the time \u2013 of which Antwerp and Amsterdam stand out as the two foremost world cities in continental Europe during this wave of globalisation. Antwerp rose to prominence by cannily exploiting its gateway location at the heart of a rapidly expanding Habsburg empire. The fall of Constantinople in 1453 had weakened Venice and Genoa, and the Scheldt river made the city a gateway to navigable inland waterways reaching far into western Europe. When nearby Bruges\u2019 own port silted up, Antwerp\u2019s merchants made incremental gains in the wool and fabric trade, and Portuguese spices from the East Indies started passing through the port. By the mid-15th century, Antwerp had become a preferred trading hub between the Baltic, the North Sea, northern Italy, France, and the Holy Roman empire. A few decades later, the city\u2019s stock exchange and banking sector had become the largest in Europe. Antwerp benefited from geopolitical advantage when it was absorbed into the Spanish Hapsburg Empire. This gave the city privileged access to a large unified market, and it became an entry point for silver and other precious goods shipped from Spanish American possessions. At its height, 40% of the world\u2019s trade was channelled through Antwerp. It was Europe\u2019s truly global city, with an ambitious and enlightened merchant class. The phenomenal wealth generated saw urbanisation in the region reach 30%. The city\u2019s population peaked at 100,000 by the 1560s, but then the city suffered from Spanish insistence that Atlantic trade go through Seville \u2013 a way of diverting wealth to Spain. Entanglement in the Dutch revolt and religious conflicts saw the city sacked and repeatedly besieged. While it retained a merchant ethos, it never recovered its mantle as a global city, although its port is today resurgent.     In the late 15th century, Antwerp had built the largest financial centre in Europe. Photograph: Don McPhee for the Guardian    Amsterdam took over the mantle from Antwerp and Genoa as Europe\u2019s major commercial city during the 1600s, and it developed many of the technologies that underpin today\u2019s global cities. The overthrow of the Spanish elite, which had hampered the interests of powerful local merchants, granted more freedom to Dutch traders. Soon after, the blockade of Spanish Antwerp triggered a flight of capital and talented entrepreneurs to Amsterdam. The protestant city became prized for its safe port, political stability and access to inland waterways. It maximised its appeal by guaranteeing equal protection to all merchants, wherever they came from, while developing standardised institutional norms. A relaxed attitude toward interest-bearing loans spurred the development of modern finance in Amsterdam, including maritime insurance, making the city both the logistical hub and the trade financier of Europe. The establishment of the Dutch East India Company and a powerful navy helped Amsterdam secure control over trade routes and outposts as far away as Japan, Indonesia, India and the Americas. The city\u2019s shipbuilders pioneered new materials and produced cheap cargo vessels, which considerably lowered transport costs. Amsterdam gained sufficient leverage over supply chains to wage price wars, prioritising volumes over margins to eliminate weak competition and secure a monopoly over pepper, tea and sugar imports. The impact of European wars and the rise of British naval supremacy in the 18th century meant that London eventually took Amsterdam\u2019s mantle. However, much of the know-how and assets acquired during Amsterdam\u2019s era of supremacy remain relevant today. The industrial wave For many observers of urban history, the modern era of globalisation began with industrialisation, whose effects occurred at a pace and on a scale not previously seen. Although the globalisation of traded goods long preceded the industrial era, industrialisation really reshaped whole societies, not just the tastes of upper-income groups.     The trading post of the Dutch East India Company in Hooghly, now a district in west Bengal, 1665. Illustration: History Archive/Rex/Shutterstock    By this point in history, national governments had become much more effective at managing global trade and reducing the dangers involved in carrying it out, while transport was becoming ever more reliable. These were the preconditions for successive waves of cities to become substantially more global in their traded specialisations, to diversify their populations, and to increase their capacity for commercial innovation.   Related: Story of cities #9: Kingston, Jamaica \u2013 a city born of 'wickedness' and disaster    A turning point in globalisation occurred in the late 18th century owing to a confluence of geopolitics and technological innovation. The victory of Britain in the Seven Years\u2019 War enhanced British power in India, and a more comprehensive system of colonial government was installed. This situation favoured British industrial development, and in 1771 the first water-powered cotton spinning model was invented. At the same time, colonial disputes in North and Central America intensified. As a result, a new wave of cities globalised as part of the British Empire. The slave trade, managed from London, was undoubtedly critical in financing British imperialism and industrialisation, and cities such as Bridgetown, Barbados and Kingston, Jamaica became subject to the empire\u2019s needs. As the empire extended its reach east, Cape Town, Calcutta and Hong Kong all became globally engaged cities, with Calcutta (now Kolkata) subject to a system of mercantilism, while Hong Kong became an instrument for promoting free trade. In east Africa, Mombasa grew into an important trade entrep\u00f4t with strong maritime business links to India and the Arabian Peninsula, as well as the long-distance caravan trade across east Africa. Another city that became open to global flows was Canton. The British empire likely had a greater impact on global cities than any of its rivals, and many of the cities enrolled in the imperial project remain highly influential actors on the global stage today. London, New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, Mumbai, Shanghai, Toronto, Cape Town and Boston each developed their global roles and reach within the British Empire.      During the 19th century, Manchester emerged as the world\u2019s first global industrial city. Photograph: The Art Archive/Rex/Shutterstock    Infrastructure connectivity was often the catalyst. One of the clearest examples of this was in New York. In 1825, a growth coalition between New York\u2019s city leaders and businesses began the construction of the Erie Canal, connecting the city to the Great Lakes and the US midwest. The availability of this water route resulted in a phenomenal surge in local manufacturing and trade and new financial and insurance industries supplying the growth of a young America. New York moved ahead of Philadelphia in financial power as a result of its enhanced connectivity. In Britain itself, cities such as Liverpool, Bristol and Birmingham prospered from having access to imperial markets and from the global reach they afforded. Manchester emerged as the world\u2019s first global industrial city, while London, the city at the centre of it all, surpassed Beijing\u2019s all-time population record, reaching two million by 1840. Across Europe, a wave of cities benefited from unprecedented urban growth and industrial expansion. The European cities that globalised in this wave had in common a specific set of assets: historical trading knowledge, locations on major rivers or seas, and the ready availability of natural resources such as coal, iron and water. Drawing on this asset base, places such as Bilbao, Bremen, Leipzig, Sheffield and Turin were able to build exceptional manufacturing economies, specialising in engineering, machine tools, ships and other industrial areas. They attracted a huge manufacturing labour force, and became pioneering cities in terms of their public services, education and civic institutions.  Economic globalisation expanded massively in the decades leading up to the first world war. One of the main groups of cities to globalise in this wave was in the United States. American cities became substantially differentiated and specialised at this time, with their own mix of industrial enterprises and the \u201csecond wave\u201d of immigration giving them very different social and cultural characters.     Two men survey the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge with Manhattan in the background, 1877. Photograph: Museum of the City of New York/Getty Images    New York specialised in advanced services and consumer products, Chicago became a centre for heavy industrial plants, while Los Angeles moved into oil and the creative industries. Diverse and entrepreneurial populations played an indispensable role: New York was the main US gateway for immigrant labor. Tens of millions of immigrants, mainly Europeans, came to the city, and many settled there in search of a better life, making New York a cosmopolitan city on a scale never previously seen. Infrastructure was a critical enabler for this wave of American city globalisation. The installation of canals, railroads, water systems, highways and sewerage systems helped to provide the conditions for a half-century of extraordinary growth. The postwar wave A major wave of cities taking on global roles unfolded in the aftermath of the second world war. Changing geopolitics and American investment support provided opportunities for many commercially minded cities to become highly specialised. Often benefiting from sound city leadership, cities in this wave of globalisation were successful in restoration and in planning ahead to avoid the worst in congestion.  Munich, Toronto and Tokyo are all prominent examples of cities in this wave. These cities were able to achieve intensive clustering and organisational modernisation in a supportive political environment among higher tiers of government. For this wave, it was key for corporate proficiency to partner with a strong knowledge platform in order to develop successful products for export. Cities in this wave of globalisation were prominent well into the mid-1970s, by which time they had acquired many of the core assets that make them competitive today. Although these cities have experienced slowdowns and setbacks in the last 25 years, they have successfully preserved a culture of knowledge and innovation to support specialisations with global reach.

Photograph: Tim Chong/Reuters    Perhaps the most remarkable example during this wave was Singapore, the only global city also to be a fully autonomous city-state. Prior to independence in 1965, Singapore\u2019s economic prospects were uncertain. Its traditional entrep\u00f4t trade industries had declined, manufacturing was stagnant, and housing and roads were in urgent need of modernization.   Related: Story of cities #27: Singapore \u2013 the most meticulously planned city in the world    But its first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, was not deterred by geographic limitations and immediately pursued a labour-intensive industrialisation policy that was open to overseas capital. Emphasis was placed on tax incentives for industrial investors, improved labour discipline, technical education and foreign expertise, in order to specialise in industrial technologies. Singapore immediately tried to build trade and connectivity roles by leveraging its position as a multilingual city, with links to east and west, and a strong western legal model. Since achieving global status, Singapore has continued to adapt to the global marketplace through state-led policies and programmes that encourage light manufacturing and high-tech research investment. Its economic development board and housing development board, in particular, have been able to leverage the scale of large public institutions to create effective systems at a citywide scale. The postwar wave of globalisation was also striking for the process of decolonisation, which saw many cities lose their imperial roles. In the past, many global cities fell along with the empires that spawned them. Indeed, for London, this period coincided with a challenging postwar process of deindustrialisation, port decline and outdated regulation in its stock exchange, banking and insurance sectors. Although London attracted immigrants from the Commonwealth diaspora, the city continued to lose population until the mid-1980s, when it resumed the journey toward becoming a quintessential global city. The IT-powered wave The decade after the 1973 oil crisis and the subsequent global slowdown was a period of great flux in the global economy. Older models became discredited and new ideas and solutions came to the fore. By the mid-1980s, a new wave of globalisation was under way, led initially by a small group of cities but with an increasing number of smaller cities also becoming globally engaged and globally oriented for the first time. For a small, elite group of financial centres, the mid-1980s started a wave of resurgence when these cities began to re-attract people, business and capital. London and New York began to reverse their population decline, and in London the 1986 \u201cBig Bang\u201d in financial services marked the start of a new generation of international banks and surrounding business services firms setting up shop.     The New York Stock Exchange in Lower Manhattan. Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images    For Asian members of this group, such as Tokyo and Singapore, this wave was characterised by a more selective and tactical globalisation. It promoted internationalisation of financial and business sectors through liberalisation reforms, while also protecting against over-exposure to western cultural influences. In this wave of globalisation, cities also re-established themselves as information and media capitals in their respective regions. This period was notable for significant governance changes in some cities \u2013 such as the abolition and then the recreation of a metropolitan government system in London; the new \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy in Hong Kong, which sought to guarantee that it would maintain a capitalist system for 50 years after the 1997 British handover to China; and the increasing withdrawal of federal government from its role in New York City.    Related: Story of cities #39: Shenzhen \u2013 from rural village to the world's largest megalopolis    At the same time, the new wave of globalisation was showcasing a set of cities that until then had not been globally oriented. The global geopolitical context had changed considerably as a result of the fall of communism in Europe, the unification of Germany, the opening up of China beginning in 1980, and the Oslo peace accords, part of the Arab-Israeli peace process, in 1993. The agreements of new trade arrangements \u2013 such as the European Economic Area and the North American Free Trade Association, and the establishment of the World Trade Organisation in 1995 \u2013 ushered in an era of multilateralism that allowed many countries and cities to globalise. These factors created a climate of opportunity for the growth of leading cities in the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and the smaller Mints (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, Turkey) economies, as well as in eastern Europe, the Middle East and Australasia. Among the most notable cities coming to global prominence in this wave were Bangalore, Barcelona, Cape Town, Sydney, and Tel Aviv.  New tradable specialisations associated with the information and communications technology revolution precipitated the unexpected globalisation of many cities. Bangalore is one of the most striking examples: its electronics specialisation took off in 1985 after the arrival of Texas Instruments. This prompted other multinational firms to relocate and boosted the local software design environment, laying the platform for successive climbs up the value chain.     The Infosys Technologies headquarters in Bangalore, India\u2019s tech hub. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images    Another striking example of innovation driving a city\u2019s globalisation in this wave comes from Tel Aviv. This young city\u2019s spirit of commerce and entrepreneurial capitalism translated into an open and horizontal concentration of skills in finance, optics, communications, information systems, medicine, and software. This strong technological base was reinforced by the Israeli military\u2019s investment in the city\u2019s advanced defence industries, which produced a regular flow of highly proficient talent. With its tech cluster benefiting from a supportive early stage investor arrangement and a positive attitude to risk, Tel Aviv is noted for its numerous tech inventions. The city\u2019s leadership has since sought to reinforce this global potential by emphasising Tel Aviv\u2019s pluralism, tolerance and investment readiness.  This wave of globalisation was distinctive for a more intentional approach by city governments and the rise of strategic planning for globalising cities. For cities like Barcelona and Tel Aviv, city governments designed strategic approaches to infrastructure, quality of life, and architecture in order to build a profile that would attract global talent. Many also converted their commercial land into use by more innovation-led activity. In nearly all cases, these cities witnessed an unprecedented wave of population diversification, fuelled by immigration and mobile talent. By the climax of this wave in 2007-8, these cities had a totally different global proposition \u2013 and new problems that had appeared alongside growth.  The current wave The most recent cycle of globalisation has seen the start of a new wave of distinctive, specialised and globally aspirational cities. Many of them are higher-income cities within their respective regions and seek to leverage their efficient infrastructure, improved quality of life, and better security and environmental performance compared to the larger megacities. Cities in this wave are less likely to have major political or institutional functions. Rather, they are competing in more dynamic and fast-moving global industries where opportunities have arisen for greater market share. Among this group are Brisbane, San Diego, Shenzhen, Santiago de Chile and Stockholm. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis and its impact on public sector finances, the ability of cities to find new sources and tools for investment has been a key enabler for globalising cities since 2008. Brisbane is an example of a city that has been able to globalise with the help of a large and financially astute city government, which has used the surplus from its recent commodities boom to erect a more international model of economic development.      Brisbane has been helped to \u2018globalise\u2019 by support from local government. Photograph: Jeff Greenberg/UIG via Getty Images    The Brisbane city council has pursued a wide range of joint ventures, sponsored business conventions and sporting events, and convinced its state government to prioritise Brisbane for road and rail infrastructure funding. It has also experimented with public-private partnerships and toll roads, with some success. Much of the city\u2019s investment attractiveness owes to its reputation in Asia, where its ambassadors programme has boosted expatriate investment connections and reached out much more successfully to Chinese, Japanese and Malaysian commodities firms. The ability to attract a new generation of immigrants and entrepreneurs has been central to many cities\u2019 success in this wave. The ability to convey opportunity and appeal to the world, whether to talent, investors, or visitors, has also been very important. London is an example of a city that has been successful in this area since 2008. Through a unified organisation, London &amp; Partners, it has delivered a consistent message to the world that it is open for business and investment and has made substantial strides in becoming a city that welcomes new technology and science industries. In medicine, media, and digital industries, the ingredients of leading sector innovations, combined with an open city with deep labour markets and cosmopolitan liveability, have created a winning formula. The city\u2019s advocacy organisations have helped maintain its appeal by successfully lobbying for a competitive business and tax climate. Lessons for future cities A comparison of the waves of globalisation in the last two centuries with the earlier waves shows clearly that the duration of each wave is becoming shorter. Where waves once lasted a century or more, they now appear to run their course in as little as 15-to-20 years, and in the future this duration may be even shorter. As the global economy becomes ever more integrated, globalising city waves increasingly come to resemble global economic cycles, and the windows of opportunity for cities to participate close quickly. Although there are vast differences between the networks of cities along the ancient Silk Roads and the 21st-century system of global value chains and competitive advantage, there are also striking parallels. Today\u2019s cities can learn much from how those in previous waves built and sustained their competitive attributes, and how to avoid becoming locked into unsustainable or unproductive cycles of development.   Related: A history of cities in 50 buildings \u2013 interactive    Not all of today\u2019s leading cities were destined to play key roles in the global economy. Many started out from an unpromising or uncompetitive situation because of either internal weaknesses or external disadvantages. Sometimes cities have endured long periods of global isolation, and begin to internationalise only when geopolitical changes occur and foreign investment arrives. This was certainly the case in the 20th century, and in the 21st century it is visible in many other cities outside the established west. Equally, the ebb and flow of cities\u2019 fortunes means that some cities we take for granted today as global will likely be much less globally oriented in future. History shows this is a risk if cities lose competitiveness in traded sectors, fail to embrace innovation or to project influence, are closed to immigration and entrepreneurship, or are unable to adapt to a changing geopolitical or geoeconomic centre of gravity. The ingredients of today\u2019s most successful cities are sometimes hard for other cities to emulate directly, and so alternative strategies and pathways to global engagement have arisen. Over time, these alternative pathways result in very different kinds of global cities.

They have come in the form of personal and regular Facebook posts denouncing him, as well as telephone calls to Drucker\u2019s colleagues. This week, Drucker \u2013 who works for Channel 10 television \u2013 was in Netanyahu\u2019s sights again as the prime minister used Facebook to accuse Drucker of waging a personal war against him and his family in attempt at \u201cbrainwashing\u201d Israel\u2019s voters. The reason for the animus at least is clear. Amid all the allegations against Netanyahu during his present period in office, Drucker\u2019s reports have landed the most effective and repeated blows. The journalist has been behind a run of high-profile stories in the last few weeks that have embarrassed Netanyahu, his family and friends \u2013 and dominated Israel\u2019s headlines.     Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara. Photograph: Gali Tibbon/AP    He has raised concerns over the role of Netanyahu\u2019s personal lawyer and relative, David Shimron, in a deal to buy German submarines. (Netanyahu and Shimron insist they never spoke about the deal so there could be no conflict of interest.) In recent days, Drucker has raised questions over the relationship between Netanyahu\u2019s son, Yair, and the billionaire Australian businessman James Packer. Drucker\u2019s report alleged Packer paid for lavish holidays and flights, and gave other gifts to Netanyahu\u2019s family. The prime minister\u2019s office insisted that Netanyahu\u2019s son is a private citizen who does not need to answer to journalists and has the right to be hosted by friends. But the latest stories have prompted Netanyahu to lash out again in public, singling out Drucker in a post on Wednesday evening.  \u201cIt is amusing to see these same journalists explain their smear campaign against me and my family with the explanation that the \u2018media needs to criticise the government\u2019,\u201d Netanyahu wrote on Facebook.   Related: Israeli police to probe alleged Netanyahu submarine scandal    \u201cBy means of daily brainwashing of the public and character assassination against me and my family they hope to distract the public\u2019s attention away from the core issues of the political debate in Israel. \u201cThat isn\u2019t going to do them any good. The hot air escapes from every balloon that is inflated by Noni Mozes [the owner of the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper], Raviv Drucker, and company.\u201d  A Facebook attack just a few days earlier saw Netanyahu launch a lengthy attack on Drucker, mocking him for joining a well-known TV gossip show. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see,\u201d Netanyahu wrote, \u201chow Drucker always manages to reach new lows of malicious and shameful journalism, even by the standards of the already biased Israeli media.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s complaints have become familiar to Israeli media since his 2015 re-election. A piece earlier this month in the newspaper Haaretz detailed Netanyahu\u2019s habit of calling journalists, their publishers and television executives, often in the most aggrieved tone, to complain about coverage and the treatment of his wife, Sara \u2013 a habit confirmed to the Guardian by other Israeli journalists. Drucker is not the only one who has been targeted by Netanyahu in recent weeks. Ilana Dayan \u2013 like Drucker one of the country\u2019s most prominent broadcast reporters \u2013 read out on-air a 680-word response from Netanyahu\u2019s office to an investigative piece. The response accused her of being an \u201cextreme leftist\u201d responsible for \u201cpolitical propaganda against the prime minister and his wife, made up entirely of recycled slanted gossip and vicious lies.\u201d Drucker seemed to shrug off the attacks. \u201cI\u2019m used to it,\u201d he told the Guardian in a cafe below his Tel Aviv studio a few hours before the latest Facebook rant from Netanyahu.  \u201cI believe he\u2019s now published five or six posts against me, as far as I know. You know, I don\u2019t go looking for them, but sometimes I bump up against them.\u201d He mentions, the calls \u2013 sometimes to multiple people, one after the other. \u201cHe\u2019s called everyone. Shareholders [in the television company], managers editors, even correspondents. I can\u2019t believe how much time he spends on this. He texts people as well.\u201d Drucker says the change came after the 2015 election, when Netanyahu won a far larger share of seats than expected. He said: \u201cAfter that election, when he won against all odds, from his perspective it was: \u2018Shut the fuck up. You, the outside world, told me [I] needed to go along [with what they thought] and yet I won by a landslide.\u2019\u201d The irony is not lost on Drucker that he once enjoyed a good relationship with Netanyahu, and his political rivals accused him of being too close to him. \u201cIt got to point that when I published stories about [former prime ministers] Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert they would say I\u2019m the was the most friendly reporter to Netanyahu,\u201d Drucker said. Netanyahu\u2019s critics say his claim that the media is \u201cagainst him\u201d is somewhat disingenuous in a country where the biggest circulation newspaper \u2013 the freesheet Israel Hayom \u2013 is owned by Netanyahu\u2019s biggest supporter, the US casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. But in a country whose press freedom rating has been downgraded by the US NGO Freedom House to only \u201cpartly free\u201d, Netanyahu\u2019s interventions \u2013 on top of his recent stated desire to shut down the country\u2019s public broadcasting authority \u2013 has led to mounting concern in the media. Drucker, however, believes some claims that Netanyahu wants media controls echoing those of Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin or Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayipp Erdo\u011fan are exaggerated.  \u201cYes, democracy is fragile here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think were are on the slippery slope towards Erdo\u011fan and Putin. In Russia and Turkey people like me were already behind bars years ago. But it is not like Britain or the US [in terms of press freedom]. \u201cSure Netanyahu wants an obedient media. And he is smart. You can\u2019t take that away from him. So long as he is prime minister of Israel he knows he won\u2019t get the totally obedient media he wants. He pressures the media so that people will think before broadcasting anything.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s latest attack suggests that his interventions are calculated as much as angry, and he seeks, like Donald Trump in the US, to bypass traditional outlets to speak to his supporters via social media. \u201cThe media is the new Arabs,\u201d Israeli journalist Udi Segal told Haaretz. \u201cThe bloody steak that Netanyahu serves his electorate. He\u2019s in a win-win situation because he manages to have a chilling effect on the media outlets while portraying himself as a victim.\u201d  His actions have not gone without comment by Netanyahu\u2019s political rivals. Responding to the attack on Dayan, Tzipi Livni, the joint leader of the Zionist Union party, said: \u201cWe must not remain silent to this targeting, incitement and persecution \u2013 but to act together to replace Netanyahu and save Israeli democracy.\u201d  Barak, the former prime minister, was more succinct, tweeting that Netanyahu had \u201cgone off the rails\u201d. Netanyahu, however, appears to have an answer ready for his critics, writing: \u201cIt is also amusing to hear the media\u2019s cries of dismay and its double standards when I respond to their smears. They hold freedom of speech to be a preeminent value \u2013 as long as it is reserved only for them.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-12-01T16:18:28Z", "title": "Raviv Drucker: the Israeli journalist incurring the wrath of Netanyahu", "sentences": ["\u201cI\u2019m used to it,\u201d he told the Guardian in a cafe below his Tel Aviv studio a few hours before the latest Facebook rant from Netanyahu."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/01/raviv-drucker-the-israeli-journalist-incurring-the-wrath-of-netanyahu"}, {"tags": ["Franz Kafka", "Biography", "Books", "Culture", "Manuscripts", "Sex"], "article": "It is a tantalising mystery that has fascinated historians and fans alike for decades, but a biographer who gained access to one of the author\u2019s closest friends\u2019 diaries has revealed a new theory about Franz Kafka\u2019s sexuality. Kafka\u2019s intense attraction to women but clear aversion to physical contact and sex has been a subject for discussion for years. Theories on his possible asexuality or repressed homosexuality contributed to the mythology around the author. Max Brod, writer and eventual inheritor of Kafka\u2019s estate, once described his close friend as being \u201ctortured by his sexual desires\u201d. Kafka himself described his fear of intimacy in a letter to Brod in January 1921:  \u201cLike a person who cannot resist the temptation to swim out into the sea, and is blissful to be carried away \u2013 \u2018now you are a man, you are a great swimmer\u2019 \u2013 and suddenly, with little reason, he raises himself up and sees only the sky and the sea, and on the waves is only his own little head and he is seized by a horrible fear and nothing else matters, he must get back to the shore, even if his lungs burst. That is how it is.\u201d  But Reiner Stach, a Kafka academic and author of a three-volume biography, has developed a new theory on Kafka\u2019s seemingly contradictory views on sex: that the author, like most people of the time, had an intense phobia of STDs and pregnancy.   Related: Franz Kafka's virtual romance: a love affair by letters as unreal as online dating    While researching for his third volume, titled Kafka: The Early Years (published in October in an English translation by Shelley Frisch), Stach obtained copies of Brod\u2019s diaries between 1909 and 1911, when Kafka was in his mid-20s. In these hitherto unpublished diaries, Stach discovered a new side to the man often credited as being more rambunctious and sexually active than his friend Kafka: Brod himself was constantly and deeply worried about the consequences of sex. \u201cIt was really astonishing. Max Brod was a real womaniser. He\u2019d often talk about his ideal woman, the idea of women being the saviour of men \u2013 but when you read his diaries, there is nothing but fear: fear of unwanted pregnancies, syphilis, venereal diseases, on every page. It almost overwhelmed all his other interests,\u201d Stach says. \u201cIt is an outdated idea that Kafka was neurotic and Brod was healthy. I think Brod was just able to repress all of this in the couple of hours he spent with his lovers, and Kafka was not able to because his mind never slept.\u201d     \u2018When you read his diaries, there is nothing but fear\u2019 \u2026 Max Brod, photographed circa 1940. Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images    But, Stach says, this was \u201cabsolutely normal\u201d for the bourgeois in early 20th-century Bohemia, where people were more interested in maintaining sexual hygiene than chasing sexual pleasure. \u201cI read a lot of books on sexuality published in the 1900s, books usually intended for young girls and men. They are just focused on risks, never about sexuality as a source of happiness. It is not about morality or religion - just medical risks,\u201d Stach says. \u201cBut look at the historical and psychological context \u2013 men and women were really separated at the time \u2026 they were educated in completely different ways. So when they met for the first time, often in their early 20s, this was often very embarrassing and very frightening.\u201d Stach, who also read newspaper reports and memoirs of Kafka\u2019s classmates and contemporaries to build a new portrait of the author, writes in the latest volume of the biography that Kafka was \u201cunable to integrate his own sexuality into his self-image because he regarded it as something both physically and ethically impure, and therefore incapable of developing human intimacy with women who actively drew him into this filth \u2013 this anti-sensual and misogynist syndrome was shared by millions of middle-class men, whose upbringing simply did not allow for erotic happiness.\u201d Stach is not sure why the terms asexual and homosexual have so frequently been applied to an author who had such well-documented affairs with women. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it persists. Kafka had homosexual fantasies, but everyone does. He had a really intense access to his own subconscious, more than we might have, and this is why he is such a great writer. So, he had homosexual, bisexual, sadistic, masochistic and voyeuristic fantasies and all of these appeared in his works, which is typical for writers like Kafka. But you can\u2019t conclude that he was any one of those things himself.\u201d The research brings new life to Kafka\u2019s The Castle, Stach says. On Kafka\u2019s manuscript for the novel, published posthumously in 1926, it is visible that Kafka originally wrote in the first person until he reached the first sex scene \u2013 at which point he changed it to be in the third person. \u201cHe is always describing sex as a kind of self-alienation, as if you could lose yourself in sexual encounters,\u201d Stach says. \u201cHe found it impossible to describe it from his point of view, as a subjective experience. So he distanced himself.\u201d While many have come before with theories to explain Kafka\u2019s seemingly contradictory views on sex and women, none have identified Kafka as simply being a product of the sexual education system absorbed by most of his peers. This, Stach says, is partly due to the mythology around Kafka: other biographers, and parties such as the Brod estate, have been more preoccupied with finding new manuscripts and letters than examining what was already known. \u201cThey\u2019re always looking for new material, but they forget the masses of material we already have \u2013 and we can do so much with it if you put the puzzle pieces together,\u201d he says. Any further research may be stymied by ongoing legal wranglings with the Brod estate. Brod, who was entrusted with thousands of pages of Kafka\u2019s writings on the promise he would burn them after Kafka\u2019s death in 1924, in turn left the papers to his lover Esther Hoffe when he died in 1968. Hoffe\u2019s elderly daughters have since kept all of the documents \u2013 estimated to be around 20,000 \u2013 in a small flat in Tel Aviv, stacking them in piles among their belonging and numerous cats. The situation has long been a source of frustration and amusement; the Israeli writer Etgar Keret once said: \u201cThe next best thing to having your stuff burned, if you\u2019re ambivalent, is giving it to some guy who gives it to some lady who gives it to her daughters who keep it in an apartment full of cats, right?\u201d   Related: Franz Kafka literary legal battle ends as Israel's high court rules in favor of library    In August, a legal battle between the Hoffe family and the National Library of Israel was resolved, with Israel winning the right to claim the papers because Brod had ambiguously promised to donate them. However, Israel has not yet attempted to remove and sort through the papers. Stach believes this will begin in early 2017. In addition to the Hoffes\u2019 archive, Stach says around 17 letters from Kafka to his last lover, Dora Diamant, and around 20 of the author\u2019s notebooks are believed to have been lost after Diamant\u2019s flat was raided by the Gestapo in 1933. \u201cPerhaps someone will find them in an archive someday, in Berlin, Krakow or Moscow.

Taking a book\u2019s setting, physical and cultural, and trying to convey it to an audience unfamiliar with it is challenging. Doing so while maintaining the sense of the original language\u2019s flow is even harder. Yet we rely on translation to communicate and understand cultures different from our own. In shapeshifting one language into another, and in reading the result of such a strangely magical act, a window to empathy opens.  Between Life and Death \u2013 the final novel of Yoram Kaniuk, the well-known Israeli writer who died in 2013 \u2013 was released this September via Restless Books and was translated by Barbara Harshav. The book is classic Kaniuk in that it is a kind of auto-fiction in which real life and memoir blend with style and language and humor. Cultural references abound, meaning cultural differences do too, but these pale in comparison to the universality of the experience Kaniuk has documented. In the novel, originally published in 2007, the narrator (also named Yoram Kaniuk) goes on a stream-of-consciousness journey around and within the death he plunged into and emerged from during his weeks-long coma following the removal of a cancerous growth in his intestines.   Related: Yoram Kaniuk obituary    In the months after the coma, having returned from nowhere \u2013 which is what he experienced in death \u2013 he can barely communicate. He was in an isolation unit for much of that time with nothing but memories, the pigeons on the windowsill, and his drug-induced hallucinations to keep his mind busy. Kaniuk\u2019s book joins a strange genre of books about experiences from inside diseases, such as Over My Head by Claudia L Osborn. But Between Life and Death shares more with The Diving Bell and the Butterfly by Jean-Dominique Bauby, and both share the intensely personal and yet fascinatingly general experience of those who have been incapacitated by disease. Reading Between Life and Death in translation is a strange experience for someone fluent in both Hebrew and English. Grammatical oddities are immediately recognizable, the original words jumping out of the translation like Jacks-in-the-Box. An example is the phrase \u201cgo know\u201d, one of many idiosyncratic Hebrew phrases. \u201cGo know\u201d is the direct, literal translation of \u05dc\u05da \u05ea\u05d3\u05e2, and while it is almost \u201cwho knows?\u201d and almost \u201cgo figure\u201d, it\u2019s not quite either of them. Translator Barbara Harshav has let the wording stand, which to a Hebrew speaker can be maddening, knowing the meaning of the phrase and how it won\u2019t necessarily be understood by a non-Hebrew speaker. And yet the awkwardness of the phrase stands proud and distinct in its otherness, which allows the reader to remember that this is, in fact, a translation from a language with its own unique rhythm. Other clear markers of translation include street names whose English versions on the actual signs in Tel Aviv are in memory (and Google Maps) different from the spelling used by the translator; knowing that \u201cgrave garden\u201d is a massaging of the more literal and cumbersome translation \u201cgarden of the dead\u201d; and recognizing that words that are only verbs in Hebrew are both verbs and nouns in English, making them more ambiguous.  None of which is to say that Harshav\u2019s translation is bad \u2013 it is, in fact, excellent. And it elegantly brings forth both Kaniuk\u2019s peculiarly beautiful style and the Israeli culture and life that he both disdained and loved. His voice in translation is reminiscent of Israeli expats in New York telling stories of their parents who lived on this or that kibbutz, who left their doors unlocked, who watched the sea from Tel Aviv balconies now blocked by the hotels and luxury condos that have been built there. These complaints and joys are familiar \u2013 they sound like ones that anyone in the west could express when talking about \u201cthe old times\u201d. Language and style aren\u2019t the only concerns, though. Politics is hard to translate without providing context, and easy for readers to gloss over, but it needn\u2019t be. Indeed, even in politics of particular places \u2013 in this case the Arab-Israeli conflict \u2013 there is a seemingly never-changing sense of injustice, which is, after all, not a particular concern but one inhabiting most places.  Similarly, the book\u2019s take on the medical establishment is eerily familiar. In one memorable scene, Kaniuk describes a chief doctor\u2019s excitement at showing a group of nurses and internists how to put in a feeding tube. In another, Kaniuk is washed by two young women who thrust him back and forth between them in a tub, until one of them realizes that he is actually a sentient being. The humiliation that so many experience with disease, the dehumanizing of the elderly, and the frustration of living inside a coherent mind connected to a body stripped of its independence \u2013 these aren\u2019t foreign ideas. They\u2019re not particularly Jewish or Israeli \u2013 they\u2019re human. Translation captures voices, moments, and experiences that are often unfamiliar \u2013 it\u2019s part of why we read. But it also captures the falseness of our conception of the \u201cother\u201d as we recognize ourselves in countries, hospitals, beds, and beaches far from our own small worlds. This experience is too often relegated to non-English speakers, but translations to English are just as important, especially with the insularity that many English speakers have, trusting as we do to the internationality of our language standing head and shoulders above the rest.

The Barenboim-Said Academy, which opened on Thursday evening in Berlin, will offer 90 talented students from the Middle East the chance to study classical music under the maestro himself as well as a raft of other top musicians and composers. Housed in the former sets and props depot of Berlin\u2019s Staatsoper (state opera), the academy \u2013 which is being largely funded by the German government, including students\u2019 tuition fees and accommodation \u2013 will aim to nurture new recruits for 74-year-old Barenboim\u2019s acclaimed West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, which for the past 17 years has brought together musicians from across the region and is now considered world class. Barenboim, the artistic director of the Staatsoper next door, said that just as with the orchestra, the academy was inspired by conversations he had had with his friend, the late American-Palestinian professor of literature Edward Said.

Photograph: Adam Berry/Getty Images    \u201cThe academy is an attempt at creating peace through the means of music,\u201d said Barenboim, who holds Argentinian, Israeli and Palestinian citizenships. \u201cBut it is not a political project, it\u2019s a humanistic project. \u201cHere we hope the young musicians will find a protected place far from the everyday of war and crisis. The students should not only learn to become professional musicians but also to become ambassadors of peace.\u201d Barenboim and Said\u2019s joint vision had been for the academy to be built in the Middle East. \u201cIt should have been founded in Tel Aviv, Damascus or Ramallah. But because we cannot have it in those places, here at least the musicians can meet in a place that evens out the differences, at eye level.\u201d For now the aim is to give the students a chance to develop their musical skills and encourage dialogue between them. The academy\u2019s unique four-year bachelor of music programme offers accredited degrees in all orchestral instruments, piano, conducting and composition. As well as courses in ear training, music history and physiotherapy (for repetitive strain injuries typically suffered by musicians), a quarter of the degree involves a humanities component, comprising courses in philosophy, ethics, history and literature.   Related: Daniel Barenboim on ageing, mistakes and why Israel and Iran are twin brothers    The academy has also reached out to musicians who arrived in Germany from Syria as refugees, with five enrolled in a preparatory scheme where exceptional students can be promoted to the degree programme. Next to the academy is its \u20ac35.1m (\u00a329.6m) concert hall \u2013 designed by the American architect Frank Gehry and the Japanese acoustician Yasuhisa Toyota, both of whom waived their fees for the project. Due to be inaugurated in March 2017, it has been named after the late composer and conductor Pierre Boulez. Gehry said during a recent visit to Berlin that he had become involved in the project after meeting Barenboim, and out of a conviction that the arts offered \u201can understanding of humanity that transcends all rhetoric\u201d. He recalled showing a model of the concert hall to Boulez two months before he died. \u201cIt became a very important thing for him at the end of his life,\u201d Gehry said. Gehry\u2019s ellipsis-shaped hall appears to be suspended in mid-air, with a stage made of Canadian cedar, whose vibrations have been compared to the sounds of a Stradivarius and which are meant to enhance the musical experience. A sense of intimacy has been created by ensuring that no audience member is more than 14 metres away from the conductor.

Southampton were tepid throughout, edging towards a goalless draw that would have seen them through until, with the visitors\u2019 first shot of the evening on target, Maor Buzaglo drilled an effort low beyond the goalkeeper, Fraser Forster, after 78 minutes. Only then did the hosts truly rally, with Virgil van Dijk poking home an equaliser in injury time, but it was inadequate on a disappointing night for Puel, who witnessed his side limp out of the competition on head-to-head record. \u201cTonight it\u2019s difficult to find a good word. It\u2019s a big disappointment for the club, the fans and the players also,\u201d the Southampton manager said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to accept this result with just one chance and one goal for this team, but it\u2019s football and now it\u2019s important to look forward. \u201cWe need to come back with a good spirit and it\u2019s a strong challenge now to give a good answer. Many teams are eliminated and come back with a strong spirit. It\u2019s disappointing for the staff and players, we were ambitious for this competition and now our mission is in the Premier League.\u201d Southampton have now managed only four goals in six matches and against Hapoel they paid for their profligacy. Puel made three changes from the 3-0 defeat at Crystal Palace on Saturday, one of which was to replace the captain Jos\u00e9 Fonte with Maya Yoshida. As a result the Portuguese, who helped his country win Euro 2016 in the summer, has not featured for Southampton in the Europa League this season. Fonte, who turns 33 this month, has 18 months to run on his current contract and the club do not have plans to offer him a new one. The defender is held in high regard by Southampton supporters, though, and the Northam Stand took all of 155 seconds to sing the name of their leader. Hapoel, too, were without their captain, Elyaniv Barda. Another fans favourite, Maor Melikson, in his second spell with the Israeli champions, was also missing. Hapoel are a team predominantly made up of free transfers and cut-price signings, including Ben Sahar, the former Chelsea and Portsmouth striker. Nicknamed the Camels, they are 10 points clear of Maccabi Tel Aviv at the top of their domestic league after clinching their first Israeli title for 40 years last season. Unsurprisingly, then, the Hapoel manager, Barak Bakhar, at 37, is regarded as something of a prodigy by the club\u2019s supporters, even more so after guiding the club past the group stages in a European competition for the first time in their history. Southampton started brightly and dominated large spells of the first half. Inside two minutes Nathan Redmond\u2019s corner was met by Charlie Austin, whose header was comfortably gathered by David Goresh, the Hapoel goalkeeper. Redmond then shot from distance before his pace left the visitors defenders flummoxed, running with the ball from his own half, but his cross from the byline was a little too high for the leaping Austin, who was later withdrawn with a shoulder injury. Southampton were forced to settle for glimpses at goal and it was Buzaglo who squandered the best opportunity in a fairly tame half. A deep cross by Mihaly Korhut evaded both Van Dijk and Yoshida, allowing the unmarked Hapoel striker to get in a shot at the back post. It was much the same after the break, with the substitute Shane Long, who replaced Austin, next to puff out his cheeks, after failing to guide a fine low cross by Ryan Bertrand goalwards. Van Dijk headed wide once more and as the game crept towards full-time, Oriol Romeu was urged to shoot at goal in an attempt to put the home supporters out of their misery. But it was about to get much worse when Yuval Shabtay picked out Buzaglo, who found the net with a low drive. Only after going behind did Southampton display the urgency required, with Van Dijk eventually poking home an equaliser. The giant Dutchman charged forward again during injury-time in search of a winner, as did Yoshida, who climbed highest to head millimetres wide with seconds remaining. In the end Southampton were left to ponder what might have been. As for Hapoel, they once again are breaking new ground. The club\u2019s very presence on the European circuit was proudly represented by more than 1000 travelling fans, who will doubtless enjoy the 3,700km trip back to the dusty city of Beersheba. \u201cWe did a big thing \u2013 there\u2019s no question about that. We played our game and we knew eventually we would get a chance to score,\u201d Bakhar said. \u201cWe believed from the off that we could do it.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-12-08T22:15:17Z", "title": "Wasteful Southampton crash out of Europa League to Israeli champions", "sentences": ["Nicknamed the Camels, they are 10 points clear of Maccabi Tel Aviv at the top of their domestic league after clinching their first Israeli title for 40 years last season."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/08/southampton-hapoel-match-report"}, {"tags": ["Israel", "Donald Trump", "US foreign policy", "Middle East and North Africa", "US news", "World news"], "article": "A senior adviser to Donald Trump has reiterated that the president-elect is determined to overturn years of government policy and move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem after his inauguration in January.

I\u2019m supposed to be on paternity leave but don\u2019t like the idea of not doing this column, so I\u2019m working in a few snatched moments between nappy changes and feeds. Nonetheless I\u2019m keeping my promise to stay at home and so am taking a break from all the activity of the church in the run-up to Christmas. Not only that, but my mother-in-law is over from Tel Aviv to coo over her new grandchild and take charge of the kitchen. And with her arrival, the common language of the vicarage has shifted to Hebrew, with me struggling to keep up. All of which draws my attention to something that sociologists of religion often remark upon: that many of the great liturgies and festivals of Judaism centre on the home in a way that they do not with catholic Christianity \u2013 Christmas being the only possible exception. With catholic Christianity \u2013 and that includes my part of the C of E \u2013 religion is for church. Very occasionally, I say prayers before meal times. Usually, it has to be said, when we have the bishop round for supper. And when a parishioner is too ill to make it to Sunday service, I take the eucharist to them at home. But all this is small beer compared with the wealth of liturgical and semi-liturgical stuff that goes on in the Jewish home: from the three-line whip of eating at home on shabbat, to the grand meal of the passover seder, from the ceremony of circumcision (traditionally performed at home unless too many people want to come), to sitting shiva for the dead. When Jews fix the mezuzah on the doorpost of their home, they are declaring their homes holy in a way that Christians rarely do. And while Jewish weddings don\u2019t commonly take place at home, they do take place under the chuppah, which symbolises the home. This year, the festival of Hanukah begins on Christmas Eve, which further emphasises the contrast. My wife will light Hanukah candles at home. I will light Christmas candles in church. One common explanation for the catholic emphasis on church as opposed to home is that catholic Christianity maintained a firm distinction between the sacred and the profane. To be holy was to be set apart. To be a priest was not to be involved with worldly stuff. God was seen as more intensely present in special places and at special times. What dramatically changed all this was the Reformation and the rejection of the idea that the church is the middleman between human beings and God. With the Bible in the vernacular, you could read about God at home and not have to be told about God in church. This sucks power away from the church and begins its relocation to the home. Thus George Herbert could write, in 1633, words that became a much-loved hymn: \u201cA servant with this clause makes drudgery divine: who sweeps a room as for Thy\u00a0laws makes that and\u00a0th\u2019 action fine.\u201d With the Reformation, the profane makes a religious comeback. In his magisterial Sources of the Self, the philosopher Charles Taylor calls this shift in sensibility \u201cthe affirmation of ordinary life\u201d and links it to the Protestant deification of profane work, the Protestant work ethic, and ultimately as setting the scene for capitalism. For as God broke out of his imprisonment in churches, he came to be seen not just in the profane home but also in profane work. Thus hard work, making money work, previously distinguished from God\u2019s holy work done by religious people, came to be invested with some higher religious purpose. But this affirmation of profane work became too successful. For even when secularisation took God out of the picture, the Protestant idea persisted that not working hard enough is some sort of secular sin or moral failing. And now we are slaves to that idea. Which is why I\u2019m going to enjoy a guilt-free paternity leave, messing around with my son, eating my mother-in-law\u2019s borscht and lighting our candles. My Jewish relatives are all secular Israelis \u2013 yet it is they, not I, who have introduced religious liturgies into our house. And I thank them for bringing God home.

David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer who represented the president-elect over his failing hotels in Atlantic City, served Trump\u2019s advisory team on the Middle East. He has set out a number of hardline positions on Israeli-Palestinian relations, including fervent opposition to the two-state solution and strong support for an undivided Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. He has called President Barack Obama an antisemite and suggested that US Jews who oppose the Israeli occupation of the West Bank are worse than kapos, Nazi-era prisoners who served as concentration camp guards.   Related: Donald Trump still set on relocating US embassy in Israel, adviser says    Liberal Jewish groups in the US denounced the appointment as \u201creckless\u201d and described Friedman \u2013 a man with no experience of foreign service \u2013 as the \u201cleast experienced pick\u201d ever for a US ambassador to Israel. Yossi Dagan, a prominent Israeli settler leader and friend of Friedman, welcomed the news, describing him as \u201ca true friend and partner of the state of Israel and the settlements\u201d. Morton Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America, said Friedman had \u201cthe potential to be the greatest US ambassador to Israel ever\u201d. An indication of how Friedman views Israel came in a 16-point action plan he issued with another Trump adviser in November. It included \u201censur[ing] that Israel receives maximum military, strategic and tactical cooperation from the United States\u201d and a declaration of war on the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and pro-Palestinian campus activism. Friedman, 57, has worked with Trump for more than 15 years and advised the president-elect on the Middle East during his election campaign. He represented Trump after the umbrella company for his three Atlantic City casinos, Trump Entertainment Resorts, went into bankruptcy in 2009. He said he was looking forward to taking up his post in \u201cthe US embassy in Israel\u2019s eternal capital, Jerusalem\u201d, indicating Trump\u2019s determination to overturn years of US policy and move the embassy from Tel Aviv. The change would be a potentially explosive gesture in the Middle East, as the status of Jerusalem is one of the issues in the long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Also controversial is Friedman\u2019s presidency of the American Friends of Bet El Institutions, an organisation that supports a large illegal West Bank settlement just outside Ramallah. His links with Bet El, along with recent revelations that the family charity of Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, gave money to one of the West Bank\u2019s most hard-line ideological settlements, suggests the settler movement will have an unprecedented number of advocates in the heart of Washington. Announcing the appointment in a statement, Trump said: \u201c[Friedman] has been a long-time friend and trusted adviser to me. His strong relationships in Israel will form the foundation of his diplomatic mission and be a tremendous asset to our country as we strengthen the ties with our allies and strive for peace in the Middle East.\u201d  The announcement appears to have caught Israeli analysts by surprise.

He wrote in the Jerusalem Post during the US election campaign that Israel would feel \u201cno pressure\u201d under a Trump administration. \u201cAmerica and Israel will enjoy unprecedented military and strategic cooperation, and there will be no daylight between the two countries,\u201d he said. In a column for the Israel National News website, he compared the liberal Jewish US lobby group J Street to concentration camp prisoner-guards and described its supporters as \u201csmug advocates of Israel\u2019s destruction delivered from the comfort of their secure American sofas \u2013 it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone worse\u201d.

Related: After Berlin, Angela Merkel\u2019s open door to migrants might be about to slam shut | Josef Joffe    On Monday, a lorry sped past that very church and deliberately drove into a busy Christmas market on Breitscheidplatz, killing a dozen people and injuring many more. It\u2019s the most deadly and violent incident seen here in decades. Other European capitals have been subjected to vicious terror attacks. Berlin, for some reason, had remained unscathed. Until Monday, that is. Now, many Berliners who\u2019ve witnessed the transformation of a high-security cold war town into a tolerant, fun and multicultural city, wonder whether this atrocity signals the beginning of yet another chapter in the city\u2019s history. I grew up in Berlin in the 1970s, when the western part was encircled by barbed-wire fences and a massive concrete wall. Although the threat of a nuclear war was real, West Berlin had a strangely cosy feel to it. Thousands of US, French and British soldiers were deployed in the city\u2019s three sectors and they provided a sense of protection. And with the Stasi and the Soviet army all over the place in East Germany, daily life behind the iron curtain was tightly controlled. So, presumably, citizens loyal to the regime felt pretty safe there, too. Then the wall fell. Many people here, now in their 40s and 50s, nostalgically remember how the city opened up. True, Berlin was suffering economically back then. Unemployment was high, and the city remained deeply divided for years. But to the young Germans of the 1990s, central Berlin seemed like a giant playground. Rents were low, and vast public spaces \u2013 vacant buildings and empty lots \u2013 made themselves available for whatever came to mind. Bulgarian artist Christo wrapped the Reichstag building. The Palace of the Republic, the old seat of the East German parliament, was flooded so that visitors could go in with rubber rafts. Thousands of party people dressed up in eccentric costumes for the so-called Love Parade, a techno music festival on wheels. Even when the September 11 attacks happened and then, a couple of years later, the London and Madrid bombings, the city and its inhabitants seemed comparatively unperturbed. The good life went on. Al-Qaida was elsewhere, not in Berlin. Starting in the mid-2000s, young people from all over the globe flocked to Berlin. They were attracted by the same thing that had drawn young Germans a decade earlier. They liked the mix of affordable housing, a heavily-subsidised culture scene and lots of lively clubs and bars. In spite of Berlin\u2019s history as the capital of Nazi Germany, thousands of Israelis were among those who came. They felt that Berlin was like a better version of Tel Aviv: hedonistic, liberal and tolerant, but without the looming threat of terrorism.    Germany\u2019s increasing economic and political power has attracted the attention of Islamist extremists    Berlin has a long and eventful history. Socialist, Nazi, Wilhelminian and Prussian classicism-style buildings are scattered all over the place \u2013 and many tourists come here just for the architecture. Even so, the city feels much younger than, say, Paris or London. That\u2019s because so much was built in the 1990s when Berlin was Europe\u2019s biggest construction site. The dominant style, back then, was playfully postmodern, and it bears witness to an era of boundless optimism. The German government moved to Berlin in 1999. The architects responsible for the so-called Regierungsviertel, or government district, mostly built unassuming glass structures in the midst of generous public spaces, lawns and walkways. They wanted the government to come across as friendly, open and transparent. Security was not the biggest issue back then. In the past couple of years, though, the atmosphere in Berlin has gradually changed. Germany\u2019s increasing economic and political power has attracted the attention of Islamist extremists. Berlin, the capital, is on the map now. Some argue that last year\u2019s influx of refugees has heightened the risk of attacks. Most recently, in October, these arguments were bolstered when a Syrian refugee allegedly scouted Berlin\u2019s two airports for bombings. (Luckily, he was arrested.) Minor incidents of public violence over the past couple of months have added to a collective sense of anxiety. Many friends and acquaintances now say they no longer feel as safe using public transport at night. Others decided that this year they wouldn\u2019t visit any Christmas markets \u2013 a possible target of terror attacks. It\u2019s far from reassuring that the perpetrator struck where people feared something might happen. Now what? In the coming days, we\u2019ll likely see a lot more \u201cJe suis Berlin\u201d traffic on social media.

But in the long run, attacks like this one tend to leave their mark. There\u2019ll be more police, more surveillance, more anxiety, more violence \u2013 and much less of that freewheeling spirit that made Berlin somewhat unique among western capitals.

In recent days, potential officials with the incoming administration have repeatedly made clear Trump\u2019s desire to relocate the embassy early in his presidency.   Related: Donald Trump's Israel ambassador is hardline pro-settler lawyer    That has included remarks by senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway and David Friedman, the controversial pro-Israel hardliner Trump has nominated to be his new ambassador to Israel. Friedman said last week he looked forward to serving in Jerusalem. And following Trump\u2019s nomination of Friedman, the president-elect\u2019s transition team spokesman, Jason Miller, again reiterated the issue in a briefing for reporters. \u201cThis is a commitment that the president-elect made numerous times on the campaign trail, that he remains firmly committed to.\u201d The US embassy has been housed in a modernist concrete cube on Tel Aviv\u2019s HaYarkon Street since the 1960s. Moving to Jerusalem would mark a reversal of almost seven decades of US policy that has until now decreed that the final status of Jerusalem, whose eastern \u2013 and largely Arab \u2013 side has been occupied by Israel since 1967, should be determined in peace talks with the Palestinians. In recent days, however, an escalating war of words has erupted between Israeli and Palestinian officials, and others, over the potential consequences of moving the embassy to Jerusalem.  On Tuesday evening, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the US weighed in. Ron Dermer, a rightwing figure close to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long had a cool relationship with the Obama administration, described the move of the embassy as a \u201cgreat step forward to peace\u201d, denying it would inflame tensions in the region. But his comments follow remarks by Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official and peace negotiator, who warned in answer to a question from the Guardian on Friday that moving the embassy to Jerusalem would result in the \u201cdestruction of the peace process as a whole\u201d. Speaking at a gathering of journalists following the nomination of Friedman as Trump\u2019s pick for ambassador, Erekat added: \u201cIf you were to take these steps, of moving the embassy, annexing settlements in the West Bank \u2013 you are sending this region down the path of something that I call chaos, lawlessness and extremism.\u201d During the traditional lighting of Hanukah candles at Israel\u2019s embassy in Washington on Tuesday, Derner said the move \u201cshould have happened a long time ago\u201d and added he believed the relocation would \u201csend a strong message against the delegitimisation of Israel\u201d. Both George W Bush and Bill Clinton made similar promises during their campaigns, and in 1994 Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act which explicitly calls for relocation. But successive presidents have refrained from moving the embassy out of concern over the potential ramifications for US diplomacy in the Middle East. Trump\u2019s most definitive statement on the issue came in the middle of the election campaign. \u201cWe will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem \u2013 and we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the state of Israel,\u201d he said to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) lobbying group. If there is a difference with his predecessors, it is that Trump\u2019s team has shown no signs of backing down on that commitment, instead emphasising it as a key foreign policy objective. To some, that has suggested the influence of his advisers on an Israel-Palestine issue is dominated by his son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2013 whose family charity has given money to one of the West Bank\u2019s most hardline settlements, Yitzhar \u2013 and Friedman, who has raised money for another hardline settlement. \u201cWe were told by US officials that Kushner and Friedman are the ones who are advising Trump on the Israel-Palestinian issue,\u201d said one Palestinian official. If Palestinians are alarmed by the issue, US officials dealing with the Israel-Palestine question appear equally concerned over what the implications of such a sharp policy U-turn might be. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of bricks and mortar,\u201d said one, speculating, as others have, that the move could be accomplished easily by re-signing the large US consulate in Jerusalem. \u201cIt is a question of policy.\u201d  In the wider diplomatic community, the move is seen as a \u201cgame changer\u201d and one with multiple risks attached despite Dermer\u2019s reassurances, including the risk of renewed violence between Israelis and Palestinians. If the change in policy itself is one concern, another has been the way in which it has been articulated in such ad hoc fashion by Trump advisers.  Dan Kurtzer, a former US ambassador to Egypt and Israel and now an academic,described his surprise at Friedman\u2019s breach with state department protocols. \u201cThe president hasn\u2019t been sworn in yet, the secretary of state hasn\u2019t spoken about this, and [Friedman\u2019s] already talking about the policy he is going to change. This is unheard of,\u201d said Kurtzer. But despite all this, Trump associates have not said when a move might happen.  Trump\u2019s spokesman Miller has avoided the issue, and while it appears the practical and policy implications have been discussed by US officials in Jerusalem, it seems no concrete steps are likely to be made until after Trump\u2019s inauguration next month. If Friedman is guiding Trump\u2019s policy on Israel and Palestine, he has already set up the conditions for confrontation with the US state department over the issue. In a speech in October to Trump supporters in Jerusalem \u2013 before his nomination as ambassador \u2013 Friedman made his views clear, accusing state department officials of \u201cantisemitism\u201d.  \u201cThe lifers in the state department are absolutely, positively committed to never moving the embassy to Jerusalem. What\u2019s different about Donald Trump? You all know Donald Trump. If there is anybody in the world politics who could stand up to the state department it is Donald Trump.   Related: Trump presidency bodes ill for Israel-Palestine peace process    \u201cWhen Donald Trump has his first meeting with the lifers in the state department and they say: \u2018Mr Trump, with all due respect, you have only been president for a couple of days, we\u2019ve been living here for the last 20 years, we don\u2019t do it that way, we do it this way, we don\u2019t move the embassy, that\u2019s been state department policy for 20 years\u2019 \u2013 the reaction from Donald Trump is going to be, \u2018You know what, guys? You\u2019re all fired!\u2019\u201d All of which has left Palestinian officials such as Erekat holding on to the faintest of hopes: that some US institutions will put a brake on the issue. \u201cWe will see, will he do it? I don\u2019t think they will do it,\u201d Erekat told journalists. \u201cI think the United States, at the end of the day, is a country of institutions and they\u2019re guided by their veteran interests, and not the interests, I believe, of this person or that person,\u201d Erekat said. If the move does occur, however, other Palestinian officials have warned they will fight the move in the UN, including the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour. \u201cIf people attack us by moving the embassy to Jerusalem, which is a violation of security council resolutions, it is a violation of resolution 181 of the UN general assembly that was drafted by the US \u2026 it means they are showing belligerency towards us,\u201d Mansour said. \u201cIf they do that, nobody should blame us for unleashing all of the weapons that we have in the UN to defend ourselves, and we have a lot of weapons in the UN.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-12-21T16:36:02Z", "title": "Moving US embassy to Jerusalem could provoke violent 'chaos', experts warn", "sentences": ["Donald Trump\u2019s plan to move the Israeli embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would be a \u201cgame changer\u201d, according to diplomats, as senior Palestinian officials warn that the move could provoke regional violence.", "\u201cThis is a commitment that the president-elect made numerous times on the campaign trail, that he remains firmly committed to.\u201d The US embassy has been housed in a modernist concrete cube on Tel Aviv\u2019s HaYarkon Street since the 1960s."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/21/us-israel-embassy-jerusalem-peace-process"}, {"tags": ["Animal behaviour", "Artificial intelligence (AI)", "Science", "Technology", "Biology", "Animals"], "article": "It turns out you don\u2019t need to be Dr Doolittle to eavesdrop on arguments in the animal kingdom. Researchers studying Egyptian fruit bats say they have found a way to work out who is arguing with whom, what they are squabbling about and can even predict the outcome of a disagreement \u2013 all from the bats\u2019 calls.  \u201cThe global quest is to understand where human language comes from. To do this we must study animal communication,\u201d said Yossi Yovel, co-author of the research from Tel Aviv University in Israel. \u201cOne of the big questions in animal communication is how much information is conveyed.\u201d  Egyptian fruit bats, common to Africa and the Middle East, are social creatures. But the calls they make as they huddle together to roost are almost impossible to tell apart by human ear, all simply sounding aggressive. \u201cBasically [it\u2019s] bats shouting at each other,\u201d said Yovel. But, writing in the journal Scientific Reports, Yovel and colleagues describe how they managed to discern meaning within the squeaks.  The approach, they reveal, relied on harnessing machine learning algorithms originally used for human voice recognition. A form of artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms are \u201ctrained\u201d by being fed data that has already been sorted into categories, and then used to apply the patterns and relationships the system has spotted to sort new data.   Related: These dolphins talk to each other. Why do we insist it isn\u2019t language?    The team spent 75 days continuously recording both audio and video footage of 22 bats that were split into two groups and housed in separate cages. By studying the video footage, the researchers were able to unpick which bats were arguing each other, the outcome of each row, and sort the squabbles into four different bones of contention: sleep, food, perching position and unwanted mating attempts. The team then trained the machine learning algorithm with around 15,000 bat calls from seven adult females, each categorised using information gleaned from the video footage, before testing the system\u2019s accuracy.  The results revealed that, based only on the frequencies within the bats\u2019 calls, the algorithm correctly identified the bat making the call around 71% of the time, and what the animals were squabbling about around 61% of the time. The system was also able to identify, although with less accuracy, who the call was aimed at and predict the fallout of the disagreement, revealing whether the bats would part or not, and if so, which bat would leave.  The differences between the calls were nuanced. \u201cWhat we find is there are certain pitch differences that characterise the different categories - but it is not as if you can say mating [calls] are high vocalisations and eating are low,\u201d said Yovel. The results, he says, reveals that even everyday calls are rich in information. \u201cWe have shown that a big bulk of bat vocalisations that previously were thought to all mean the same thing, something like \u2018get out of here!\u2019 actually contain a lot of information,\u201d said Yovel, adding that analysing further aspects of the bats\u2019 calls, such as their patterns and stresses, could reveal even more detail encoded in the squeaks. Kate Jones, professor of ecology and biodiversity at University College, London described the findings as exciting. \u201cIt is like a Rosetta stone to getting into [the bats\u2019] social behaviours,\u201d she said of the team\u2019s approach. \u201cI really like the fact that they have managed to decode some of this vocalisation and there is much more information in these signals than we thought.\u201d With the approach based on the social sounds made between bats, Jones says the technique could be used to shed light on how other species of animals communicate. \u201cIt could be that you could apply the same type of techniques to other species to figure out what they mean when they are interacting with each other,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it could be that it opens up a different world of understanding what these communications are.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2016-12-22T14:00:01Z", "title": "Bat chat: machine learning algorithms provide translations for bat squeaks", "sentences": ["To do this we must study animal communication,\u201d said Yossi Yovel, co-author of the research from Tel Aviv University in Israel."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/dec/22/bat-chat-machine-learning-algorithms-provide-translations-for-bat-squeaks"}, {"tags": ["US foreign policy", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Trump administration", "Obama administration", "United Nations", "Egypt", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "Abdel Fatah al-Sisi", "US politics", "US news", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Donald Trump appears to have intervened with two foreign governments in a move aimed at sidelining Barack Obama over a UN security council resolution criticising Israel\u2019s settlements. A resolution drafted by Egypt had demanded Israel halt all settlement activities in occupied territories claimed by the Palestinians and declared that existing settlements \u201chave no legal validity\u201d. However, the vote on passing the resolution was abruptly postponed by Egypt on Thursday amid a series of contacts between Israel, Trump and his transition team and Egypt, which culminated in Trump calling Egypt\u2019s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.   Related: White House faces exodus of foreign policy experts ahead of Trump's arrival    Details of the contacts emerged on Friday morning as Israeli officials disclosed that the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had contacted Trump\u2019s transition team on Thursday seeking help after learning that the US delegation at the UN, under the instruction of Obama, might not veto the resolution. Those fears were given extra prominence late on Thursday when Reuters, citing \u201cwestern officials\u201d as sources, reported that the Obama administration intended to abstain from the vote, in a sharp break from recent US policy on resolutions concerning Israel. New Zealand, Venezuela, Malaysia, and Senegal \u2013 all currently non-veto-wielding members of the security council, have warned Egypt that if it does not clarify by midnight on Friday whether it plans to call a vote, they reserve the right to move ahead with the text.  Although the US opposes the settlements, it has traditionally used its veto power as a permanent member of the security council to block resolutions condemning Israel, saying disputes between Israel and the Palestinians must be resolved through negotiations.  But after eight years of failed peace efforts during the Obama administration, Israel has expressed concern that the outgoing president could take an audacious stand to try to leave his mark on the region. In recent weeks the White House has been especially secretive about its deliberations. On Thursday Trump issued a statement of opposition to any decision not to use the US veto on the resolution. He said in a statement: \u201cThe resolution being considered at the United Nations security council regarding Israel should be vetoed. As the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations. This puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis.\u201d    The big loss yesterday for Israel in the United Nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace.Too bad, but we will get it done anyway!&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2016    The timing of some of the contacts \u2013 between Netanyahu and Trump\u2019s transition team, and between Trump\u2019s team and Egypt to set up a phone call between leaders \u2013 remains unclear, but it appears Trump called Sisi after the cancellation of the vote. Unlike Trump\u2019s other recent interventions in US foreign policy, which have largely flagged up his often contradictory intentions, on this occasion he appears to have deliberately interposed himself in an issue of current US and international diplomacy.  Sisi\u2019s spokesman, Alaa Yousef, said on Friday that the two had agreed to give Trump\u2019s incoming administration a chance to tackle the issue. \u201cDuring the call they discussed regional affairs and developments in the Middle East, and in that context the draft resolution in front of the security council on Israeli settlement,\u201d Yousef said. In an unintended slip referring to Trump\u2019s status, he added: \u201cThe presidents agreed on the importance of affording the new US administration the full chance to deal with all dimensions of the Palestinian case with a view of achieving a full and final settlement.\u201d  Speculation that the US might not deploy its veto had been fuelled by the Obama administration\u2019s frustration over recent political moves by Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing coalition, not least over proposed measures to retroactively legalise 100 outposts built on private Palestinian land.  Israeli settlements have long been seen as a stumbling block in peace efforts as they are built on land the Palestinians see as part of their future state. The UN maintains that settlements are illegal. UN officials have reported a surge in construction over the past months. The peace process is in a period of profound uncertainty largely due to questions over what Trump\u2019s Middle East policy might be. Last week Trump nominated as his ambassador to Israel David Friedman, who has said Washington will not pressure Israel to curtail settlement building in the occupied West Bank. Another key influence on Trump is said to be his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, whose family charity has donated money to one of the occupied West Bank\u2019s most hardline settlements.  Trump has signalled he will be far more sympathetic to Israel. His campaign platform made no mention of the establishment of a Palestinian state, a core policy objective of Democratic and Republican presidents over the past two decades.

The move is the latest in a series of diplomatic retaliations by Israel against the countries that supported a UN security council resolution describing Jewish settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories as a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d of international law and an obstacle to peace. Reports in the Israeli media said Netanyahu had told ministers at his weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday that he did not intend to meet May in Davos at the forthcoming World Economic Forum. Responding to the reports, the UK\u2019s deputy ambassador, Tony Kay, said he regretted the decision. \u201cIt is a disappointment that the Israeli government has announced that Prime Minister Netanyahu does not want to have a conversation with Theresa May,\u201d Kay told Israel Army Radio on Monday. Kay had been called in with other ambassadors and senior diplomats of the other members of the security council who voted for the motion or abstained, including the US ambassador Dan Shapiro, to be reprimanded for supporting a resolution that reiterated the view of the international community that Jewish settlements are illegal and an obstacle to peace.   Related: Israel summons ambassadors for dressing down over UN resolution    \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be many conversations between the two prime ministers moving forward and we look forward to having those conversations, and we\u2019ll certainly continue to have those conversations in Tel Aviv,\u201d Kay said. In response to the reports, Israeli officials said no meeting had been scheduled with May. \u201cNo meeting with the UK prime minister had been set therefore no meeting was cancelled,\u201d a spokesperson said.  However, the Israeli media later reported that \u2013 despite the official denial \u2013 there had been discussions about May and Netanyahu speaking in Davos, although Britain had not been officially informed of the cancellation. The prime minister is regarded as one of the most pro-Israeli leaders in Europe, recently describing it as \u201ca remarkable country\u201d and \u201ca beacon of tolerance\u201d. Kay\u2019s comments came as the fallout from Friday\u2019s vote continued to reverberate, amid growing fears in Israel that the US and the security council may be considering further moves against Israel before Donald Trump is inaugurated as US president on 20 January.           US abstains from UN vote to end Israeli settlement building    That has included speculation over a second security council resolution and reports that the US secretary of state, John Kerry, may be considering a speech outlining potential parameters for a two-state solution in the dying days of the Barack Obama administration. The moves come against the background of reports that Israel is to approve hundreds of new houses in occupied Jerusalem. The moves by the Obama administration, including the abstention in the security council vote on Friday, appear designed to leave a legacy of acts that can be used by the EU, the international criminal court and other institutions to continue to pressure Israel over settlement and the moribund peace process even if Trump \u2013 as appears highly likely \u2013 pursues a one-sided and vigorously pro-Israel foreign policy. On Monday night Donald Trump made clear his thoughts on the effectiveness of the UN. The president-elect wrote:    The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!&mdash; Donald J.

Israel has warned of further retaliation to come against the UN and countries that supported the resolution. That includes the emergence of further details on the UN agencies Israel is considering sanctioning as part of its diplomatic blitz, including cutting funding. Among the reported targets is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which has long been in Israel\u2019s sights and runs schools and provides housing and facilities in refugee camps in the occupied territories.   Related: Israel to \u2018reassess\u2019 ties with UN, says Benjamin Netanyahu    It is also being suggested that Israel will promote its own UN resolution that would set rules of conduct for UN employees so they would be made accountable for any statements regarded as being anti-Israel \u2013 although it is unclear what support if any that could muster given last week\u2019s uncontested vote. Despite the loud noises from Netanyahu it remained unclear how much of it was bluster, designed to placate rightwing sentiments within his own Likud party and far-right coalition partners such as Jewish Home, and how much would have concrete consequences. In contrast to the recent harsh statements, Netanyahu has also reportedly warned ministers to avoid making calls for annexation of the occupied territories for fear of promoting further moves aganist Israel. The latest planned reported moves also come amid evidence of a mounting backlash against Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the situation.

The government of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has accused Washington of conspiring against it when a UN security council vote on Friday demanded an end to settlement building in the West Bank.  The Kerry speech at the state department at 11am (4pm GMT) is expected to restate the Obama administration\u2019s continued faith in a two-state solution to the chronic impasse. It is a parting shot after eight years in office, during which there has been a dearth of diplomatic progress. It is not expected to lead to any new initiative but rather lay down a marker on a longstanding US and international approach to the region before the US president-elect, whose commitment to such a solution is in doubt, assumes office.

The parameters outlined by Kerry are expected to draw international endorsement at a meeting of foreign ministers on 15 January, just five days before Trump moves into the White House. The meeting is supposed to reinforce a strategy of isolating Netanyahu in the hope it will push him towards reviving stalled negotiations with the Palestinians. Netanyahu has said his government will not attend.  In expectation of a more supportive administration in Washington next month, Netanyahu has reacted to the diplomatic manoeuvring in the last week\u2019s of Obama\u2019s term with defiance. Israel responded furiously to the UN security council resolution passed on Friday that demanded an end to settlement building, threatening diplomatic reprisals against the countries that voted in favour.           Benjamin Netanyahu to John Kerry: friends don\u2019t take friends to the security council    Jerusalem authorities had been expected to discuss the issue of more than 600 building permits for settlements in historically Palestinian east Jerusalem on Wednesday, but the planned vote was cancelled. Hanan Rubin, a member of Jerusalem\u2019s Planning and Housing Committee, told Reuters the request to put off the vote came from Netanyahu.    Related: Obama\u2019s parting shot at Netanyahu is a futile gesture | Simon Tisdall    Netanyahu has vowed to resist a peace framework imposed on his government, and observers warn that a threatened Israeli backlash in the form of thousands of new settler homes in east Jerusalem, combined with Trump\u2019s plan to move the US embassy to the disputed city, could trigger a fresh wave of violence. The Israeli government is reportedly fearful that any guidelines agreed in Paris would be turned into another UN resolution before Trump\u2019s inauguration, and it has ratcheted up its rhetoric, presenting itself as the victim of an international conspiracy. A spokesman for Netanyahu claimed to have \u201cironclad evidence\u201d that the Obama administration had plotted behind the scenes to promote the UN resolution. Israel has said it will present evidence against the Obama administration to the incoming Trump team. On Tuesday, Egyptian media published a document purporting to be a transcript of a meeting in which Kerry and the US national security adviser, Susan Rice, discussed the UN resolution and US proposals with Palestinian officials, who agreed to give the Kerry framework immediate support. The State Department spokesman, John Kirby, said no such meeting took place.  Meanwhile, Israel\u2019s defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, portrayed the Paris conference as a new \u201cDreyfus trial\u201d, referring to an outburst of French antisemitism more than a century ago, and urged French Jews to move to Israel. On Tuesday a French official denied there was any intention to pass a new security council resolution on the basis of the Paris conference. A foreign ministry spokesperson said the meeting would \u201cgive the participants an opportunity to present a comprehensive incentive package to encourage the resumption of negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians. Only they will be able to conclude a peace deal directly.\u201d Palestinian leaders hope the UN resolution and the Paris conference will offer some degree of international protection against the encroachment of settlements in the Trump era. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, said he hoped the Paris meeting would establish an international mechanism to end Israeli settlement building. Trump criticised Friday\u2019s UN resolution, saying it would make it harder to negotiate a peace agreement. In a tweet on Monday, he described the UN as \u201cjust a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time\u201d. Trump\u2019s designated ambassador to Israel, his own bankruptcy lawyer David Friedman, has actively supported settlement building. Aaron David Miller, a former US negotiator on the Middle East and now a scholar at the Wilson Centre thinktank, said Obama\u2019s 11th-hour attempt at legacy building on the Israeli-Palestinian issue could trigger a backlash. \u201cIt risks the incoming administration walking away from whatever has transpired in December and early January, and not just walking away from [but] sending unmistakable signals to the Israelis that it would support and favour acts on the ground that go beyond what we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe odds that Netanyahu will now press and Trump will respond positively to a move to push the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, I think have gone up.\u201d He said that if the highly emotive issue of Jerusalem\u2019s status became the focal point of Israeli-Palestinian friction once more, \u201cthen I think the prospects for a serious, significant confrontation are high\u201d. Amir Oren, a liberal Israeli commentator, argued that the UN resolution could save the government from itself by bringing closer an end to settlement construction. \u201cSanta Obama delivered a wonderful Christmas present to Israel when the United States opted not to veto Friday\u2019s United Nations security council vote condemning settlement policy,\u201d he wrote in Haaretz. \u201cThe passage of the resolution won\u2019t result in the immediate dismantling of any West Bank settlements, but the world is beginning to come to the rescue and try to save Israel from itself.\u201d ", "publicationDate": "2016-12-28T09:05:45Z", "title": "White House races to save Middle East peace process before Trump takes office", "sentences": ["\u201cThe odds that Netanyahu will now press and Trump will respond positively to a move to push the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, I think have gone up.\u201d He said that if the highly emotive issue of Jerusalem\u2019s status became the focal point of Israeli-Palestinian friction once more, \u201cthen I think the prospects for a serious, significant confrontation are high\u201d."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/27/obama-and-allies-seek-to-isolate-netanyahu-before-trump-takes-office"}, {"tags": ["John Kerry", "Israel", "US news", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "John Kerry is not the first US statesman to lay out a Middle East peace plan just as he is about to leave office. In December 2000, Bill Clinton presented a set of parameters for a two-state solution, covering the same set of daunting issues: Jerusalem, the right of return (or not) of Palestinian refugees, territorial exchange on the basis of the 1967 ceasefire line and Israeli security.    Related: Kerry defends US decision not to veto UN resolution against Israeli settlements    It is a reflection of the paralysis and steady demise of the peace process over the ensuing 16 years that Kerry\u2019s principles closely resemble Clinton\u2019s parameters.  In his hour-plus speech Wednesday, Kerry went further than any previous secretary of state in spelling out the self-destructive nature of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s policy for Israel\u2019s long-term security. He used unusually blunt language to describe the nature of the present Israeli government and referred to the Arab perception of the impact of Israel\u2019s creation on Palestinian lives, the nakba \u2013 the catastrophe. The most significant differences between Kerry\u2019s message and Clinton\u2019s are that Israel is explicitly accepted by its neighbours as a Jewish state in Kerry\u2019s solution, and Jerusalem is to be shared but not divided.  But the most important difference is the context in which the two frameworks are being proposed. At Camp David in July 2000 Clinton had come closer than any US president to brokering a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian agreement, and a deal between Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat was still possible five months later. The two sides came close again at the Taba summit in January 2001. By striking contrast, Kerry made his speech at a time when a two-state solution has been corroded into an almost abstract concept and is no longer a shared destination for both parties. As the secretary of the state noted, Netanyahu continues to pay lip service to two states, but sits at the head of a government that Kerry described as the \u201cmost right wing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by its most extreme elements,\u201d with an aggressive settlement-building approach that leads in the other direction \u2013 to a one-state solution. According to the New York Times, Kerry had wanted to deliver a speech like this some two years ago but was blocked by the White House, which saw little value in enraging Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister had already shown himself willing and capable of inflicting political damage on Obama and the Democrats on their home ground. Netanyahu was indeed enraged by the speech \u2013 his office was quick to dismiss it as \u201cbiased against Israel\u201d but he was clearly not worried. He has his eye on the near horizon. As Kerry was preparing to make the speech, the administration\u2019s Middle East policy was trolled on Twitter by the next president.  \u201cWe cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect,\u201d Donald Trump tweeted. \u201cThey used to have a great friend in the US, but not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (UN)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!\u201d  The president-elect\u2019s message to the Israeli government was clear: ignore Kerry\u2019s words. The next US administration will lift any pressure over settlements. The designated US ambassador, David Friedman, Trump\u2019s bankruptcy lawyer, is vowing to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, has a record of funding settlements and advocates the annexation of parts of the West Bank, aligning himself with the far right elements in the Netanyahu cabinet.  Given these circumstances, the Kerry speech raises questions about what purpose it serves 23 days before he leaves his job, other than a cri de coeur at the end of long and abortive effort to make an impact on the Israeli-Palestinian impasse, and a desire perhaps to put his own imprimatur on a formal blueprint for peace.  Ilan Goldenberg, a former state department official, argued the speech had a value beyond such vain motives in setting down a marker ahead of Trump\u2019s arrival in office.   \u201cObviously it would have been better to give this speech two or three years ago,\u201d said Goldenberg, now director of the middle east security programme at the Centre for a New American Security. \u201cBut it is still important to get those principles out there for future negotiators to rally around.\u201d   In other words, the speech is a tidal marker before the coming of the Trump deluge, in the hope it will still have relevance if and when the flood waters recede.
