A disagreement over appearance money is the probable reason for Federer&apos;s absence from the $1.1m (\u00a3600,000) tournament, which in previous years is reputed to have dished out half that amount again to get him. This worldwide practice caused Wight to claim last month that handing out appearance money was the &quot;economics of the madhouse&quot; which was &quot;killing the game&quot;. This view may have chimed with the Qatar organisers, quoted as having been &quot;unable to reach agreement&quot; with IMG, Federer&apos;s agents. As Federer&apos;s practice base for this month&apos;s Australian Open is Dubai, just a hop down the Gulf, it can hardly have been his travel schedule which caused the deal to collapse. If, as seems almost certain, it is money, then a first small blow for what officials such as Wight would see as a saner world has been struck. It leaves as the top seed the world&apos;s lowest-profile leading player, Nikolay Davydenko, a balding workaholic who remains largely overlooked despite the improvement which enabled him to lead Russia to their first triumph on home soil in a Davis Cup final last month and to a career-high world ranking of No3. &quot;I know that being world No3 will make a whole lot of difference,&quot; he said after the draw which pitched him against South Korea&apos;s Lee Hyung-taik. &quot;It means that in Australia I will be seeded third, and I won&apos;t have to face either Federer or [Rafael] Nadal until the round of four.&quot; Davydenko is scheduled for a semi-final here with Britain&apos;s Andy Murray and a final with Ivan Ljubicic, the Croatian who served more aces (929) and won more first service points (79%) in 2006 than any other player on the tour. But the most motivated player may be the third-seeded Cypriot, Marcos Baghdatis, who soon has to defend the ranking points he won for reaching the 2006 Australian Open final, with the risk of becoming known more for his charisma than his ability.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport"], "title": "Qatar rebuffs Federer's agents", "sentences": ["As Federer&apos;s practice base for this month&apos;s Australian Open is Dubai, just a hop down the Gulf, it can hardly have been his travel schedule which caused the deal to collapse."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jan/01/tennis.gdnsport31", "publicationDate": "2007-01-01T22:22:16Z"}, {"article": "The turmoil surrounding Paul Le Guen&apos;s tenure as Rangers&apos; manager yesterday rose to an unprecedented level after the Frenchman stripped Barry Ferguson of the club captaincy. Ferguson met Le Guen at Rangers&apos; training ground yesterday to relieve the midfielder of the armband and duties in the squad which travels to Motherwell today. Suggestions that Ferguson has been transfer-listed are premature but it is clear the relationship between midfielder and manager has reached breaking point. Le Guen is adamant he will not walk away from the troubled Ibrox club and is anxious not to appear to be undermined by his players. Ferguson&apos;s career with the team he has supported since childhood is therefore in jeopardy. Rangers would only confirm last night that Ferguson will not feature in today&apos;s encounter, with Le Guen promising to expand on matters further at the post-match press conference. Ferguson&apos;s agent, John Viola, will fly into Scotland from Dubai today to discuss matters with the club. Gavin Rae, a midfielder who has been unable to command a regular place this season and one of the few Scots on Le Guen&apos;s staff, has been appointed as Ferguson&apos;s successor, which is unlikely to placate an increasingly vocal and agitated Rangers support. Ferguson, who left Rangers for Blackburn Rovers in 2003 before returning north in 2005, is seen by fans as an inspirational figure and one of the few impressive performers in recent months as the team have lurched from crisis to crisis. The situation represents a dilemma for Rangers&apos; chairman, David Murray, who has staunchly backed his manager this season but has a long-standing affinity with Ferguson. Speculation regarding an unworkable relationship between Ferguson and the former Lyon manager has constantly arisen since Le Guen was appointed in June. The pair are understood to have exchanged words after last midweek&apos;s defeat to Inverness Caledonian Thistle and again in the aftermath of Saturday&apos;s home draw against St Mirren. It had been thought that Ferguson would end his career at Rangers. With that now seemingly impossible, the midfielder will have to return to England, or attempt the unthinkable in moving to Celtic, to find a club who will match his weekly wage of \u00a325,000. Otherwise, he may opt to sit tight at Ibrox in the belief that he will last longer than the beleaguered manager.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "title": "Football: Barry Ferguson stripped of Rangers captaincy", "sentences": ["Ferguson&apos;s agent, John Viola, will fly into Scotland from Dubai today to discuss matters with the club."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jan/02/newsstory.sport", "publicationDate": "2007-01-02T00:32:10Z"}, {"article": "The following correction was made on Monday January 8 2007  The article below incorrectly quotes &apos;Michael Byrne of Time Out Dubai&apos;. This should in fact be Michelle Byrne.   With Borat the highest-grossing adult-rated film in the US for 2006, the writing team of Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant booming with a second series of Extras, and Little Britain still riding high, it&apos;s clear that the comedy of shock, bad taste and outrage shows no sign of disappearing. But reading about these shows in print and online, they are often described in a way that makes me, for one, feel as if I have been watching different material from everyone else. For many viewers and critics, Borat, Little Britain and The Office and Extras represent blows against the monstrous, and perhaps largely imagined, regiment of politically correct thinkers, who impinge upon our basic freedoms on a daily basis. &quot;Little Britain makes no apologies for being highly offensive and preying on the sensitivities of even the slightest politically correct sensibilities, which in an ever more sanitised society should be applauded,&quot; writes Michelle Byrne, of Time Out Dubai, where society is considerably more sanitised than it is here. &quot;Borat raises an index finger to political correctness and all its exponents,&quot; claims Mail on Sunday reader Colin Veitch online, who obviously feels that were Borat to raise his middle finger, the finger traditionally used for giving offence, he may have been overstating his case. Meanwhile, an Extras fan site lauds &quot;Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant&apos;s mockery of political correctness&quot;. I&apos;m 38, and old enough to remember comedy, and life in general, before political correctness. At secondary school in the Midlands in the early 80s, our maths teacher, who was a genuinely nice man, would routinely refer to the one Asian boy in our class as &quot;the Black Spot&quot;, fondly imagining that this was in some way inclusive, like some pocket calculator-wielding version of David Brent\u2122. And the idea of a comic performer like Little Britain&apos;s Matt Lucas being openly gay - let alone having photographs of his civil ceremony splashed across the tabloids - would have been unimaginable, however camp his on-stage persona. There&apos;s a vast difference between the casual, inadvertent offence prevalent in my childhood and the choices made today by performers and writers of my generation, operating in a post-PC world, where they are aware of the power and meaning of the taboos they choose to break. Linguistic theorists who define the terminology of political correctness suggest that grammatical choices made in language influence both the speaker&apos;s and the listener&apos;s ideas and actions. This would seem to be common sense, so it would be churlish to argue against the idea of attempting to ensure basic levels of politeness and consideration in official, public discourse. I am a great fan of political correctness, even though, as one of the writers of Jerry Springer the Opera, I was routinely praised for apparently attacking it, and feel that any indignities we suffer from PC&apos;s overzealous policing are a small price to pay for all that it has achieved. Is anyone apart from Robertson&apos;s jam really inconvenienced by the extinction of the golliwog? So why, then, do some sections of the viewing public insist on seeing attacks on PC where there perhaps are none? Stephen Merchant, co-writer of The Office and Extras with Ricky Gervais, says: &quot;We&apos;re endlessly cited as being non-PC, and yet we sit and agonise for ages over what we put into the scripts, and over whether our choices can be defended, both morally and intellectually,&quot; he says. &quot;We may push things, but we&apos;re always motivated by satirical imperatives.&quot; But the duo&apos;s scripts do use non-PC language? &quot;Yes,&quot; explains Merchant, clearly slotting back into a tramline he has had to follow many times before. &quot;But we deal in taboos and hot areas by appearing to approach them from a non-PC standpoint, but as soon as you even introduce topics that PC has declared off limits, people assume you are trying to be dangerous and politically incorrect. Often we&apos;re all unsure of what to say, for example, in the company of someone who is disabled. These are areas ripe for comedy because of social anxiety, not because the subject itself is intrinsically funny. A joke about race, and about how we react to race, is not necessarily a racist joke. That is fundamental. Political correctness has made the world better for those who might otherwise have been unfairly marginalised, but there is the problem of the idea that you cannot discuss different areas for fear of being politically incorrect.&quot; Peter Baynham is one of the unsung heroes of British comedy over the past two decades - he wrote the famous &quot;Michael Heseltine Is Dead&quot; bit for Chris Morris&apos;s radio show, and helped sculpt Patrick Marber&apos;s Alan Partridge character from its chatshow incarnation into its fully realised sitcom version. But it is as one of the co-writers of Sacha Baron-Cohen&apos;s Borat movie that he has finally won a British Comedy Award, the industry&apos;s least valuable honour, and earned enough money to buy David Hasselhoff&apos;s hair from him and wear it as if it were his own. So what does he think of the attacks on the Borat film? According to Simon Dillon, of the Christian film review website The Greatest Trick, &quot;Borat is a monstrous creation designed to fly in the face of every politically correct notion you can possibly think of, yet despite being misogynistic, homophobic, anti-semitic, and worse, Borat has proved hugely popular, possibly because people are sick and tired of politically correct comedy (surely a contradiction in terms in any case).&quot; Baynham is philosophical about the way Borat has occasionally been received. &quot;It&apos;s weird to see the film seized upon by people who hate political correctness, and think it&apos;s a bad thing, when PC was clearly just an understandable reaction to 70s racist awfulness,&quot; he says, on a rare trip home from Los Angeles to the native land he now scorns. &quot;In my own pretentious, terrible opinion, which may not be shared by the other writers, the Borat movie is not anti-PC at all. When Borat says a black politician has a &apos;genuine chocolate face&apos; he is a) clearly an idiot and b) from a naive, fictionalised foreign culture. But it&apos;s also a good thing to do because that bit absolutely wouldn&apos;t have been funny 25 years ago, precisely because that sort of thing was more openly said by people. It&apos;s a little kick, a little reminder, of why we don&apos;t say those things, and it&apos;s weird when you read people saying it was deliberately offensive. The laugh is a laugh of &apos;Oh my God, you can&apos;t say that!&apos; People are laughing with shock, because we&apos;ve reminded them of why it&apos;s wrong to say that black people have chocolate faces.&quot; At this point, Baynham seems to be approaching something profound and timeless about comedy, that stretches beyond petty concerns about political correctness. At the end of September last year, I was lucky enough to attend the St Geronimo feast-day celebrations at Taos Pueblo, New Mexico, while helping out on a Radio 4 documentary about clowns. For a long time I had fondly imagined that the clowns of the Pueblo Indians, who take over the village for the afternoon on the second day of the festival, might be a key to understanding, on some essential level, what comedy is, and what comedy is for. I had seen a re-creation of the medieval fools&apos; day five years ago near B\u00e9ziers in Languedoc, when the bouffonnades, a clown troupe which was traditionally assembled from the village&apos;s mentally and physically handicapped outcasts, were given free rein to mock the citizenry, but research suggested the Pueblo clowns seemed to have a more pronounced philosophical dimension. Just after lunch, 10 figures appeared, silhouetted against the blue sky on the roof of a stack of brown adobe buildings. They were naked but for loincloths, their bodies painted in rings of concentric black and white stripes, their hair decorated with jagged stalks of corn. After a while, the clowns made their way down into the plaza, where they ran between the houses, intimidating and entertaining, overturning every social norm at hand, and reshaping the rules of Pueblo life. Food was stolen from stallholders and redistributed. We were shouted at, shoved and shocked. Our drinks were flung on the floor. We followed the clowns into the chief&apos;s house, where an absurd Indian dance was performed at the dinner table for the benefit of his white guests. Back outside, Pueblo women were made to wear different-sized shoes, so they struggled and stumbled as they walked; young men were clad in dresses and forced to skip. And when confronted with someone in a wheelchair, or a mentally handicapped onlooker, the clowns would fall before them on their knees in worship. Despite our BBC credentials, Native American commentators were reluctant to explain the theory behind any of this practice in detail, partly because, when the white settlers moved into the American south-west, one of the first things their delicate sensibilities required them to suppress were the Pueblo clown ceremonials, but gentle pressure revealed the suggestion of a social, maybe even moral, purpose at work. By reversing the norms and breaking the taboos, the clowns show us what we have to lose, and what we might also stand to gain, if we step outside the restrictions of social convention and polite everyday discourse. This core idea holds whether it is played out up close in the plaza of a New Mexican pueblo, or miles away by the tiny dots of television stars on the stage of a vast arena. Comedy is about funny faces, and funny noises, and silly words and stupid fun, but it&apos;s also about this more profound idea. To say that the taboo-busting antics of current favourites like Borat or Extras are somehow bound up explicitly in contemporary cultural negotiations with the ephemeral, late-20th-century notion of political correctness is to miss the point on a massive scale. This stuff is justified, ancient and righteous. It is not there to be appropriated by Daily Mail editorials as evidence of mass disillusionment with the soft left, nor by disgusted liberals as examples of society&apos;s collapsing values.

But while most of us manage to maintain good intentions until at least February, Alan Curbishley is taking his lead from Celebrity Big Brother&apos;s Ken Russell by throwing himself into 2007 with aplomb. Not content with a king-sized \u00a39.8m bid for pint-sized Chelsea winger Shaun Wright-Phillips, Curbs has also dispatched minions in pursuit of West Brom bully-boy Nigel Quashie, Middlesbrough fat-boy Mark Viduka and Tottenham not-very-good-boy Anthony Gardner. Cheekier still, Alan&apos;s even been leaving messages on Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s voicemail, asking if he can borrow Theo Walcott for the rest of the season. Heaven knows where Curbishley plans to find the money for all this wheeling and dealing, though he can make a good start by off-loading Javier Mascherano to Real Zaragoza... no wait Liverpool, for \u00a34m. Except what everyone keeps forgetting is that Mascherano will need special dispensation from Fifa if he wants to play for any other club this season, as he has already taken part in competitive matches for two teams (West Ham and Corinthians) since last July. Nobody&apos;s ever surprised about Chelsea spending money, especially after a disastrous return of only 48 points from 22 matches, but it does come as a bit of a shock to find Jose Mourinho scrabbling around in the mud, looking for any old Tal Ben Haim. Especially since &apos;Arry Redknapp reckons Mr. Haim is already on his way to Pompey. Jose will soothe his inevitable rage with big-money bids for City defenders Micah Richards and Sylvain Distin, Deportivo defender Jorge Andrade and Valencia (you guessed it) centre-back Roberto Ayala. There&apos;s no such luxuries at Anfield, especially if whispers that Dubai International Capital plan to mortgage the club for \u00a3300m turn out to be true. Worse yet that group of black-and-white-suited men waving bags of money in Peter Crouch&apos;s direction aren&apos;t from Newcastle after all - they&apos;re from Juventus. The Toon have their own transfer targets too, mind - Glenn Roeder sees something nobody else can see in Wes Brown and James Beattie. David Moyes will no doubt be delighted to offload Beattie, but he will probably be rather less impressed to find Martin O&apos;Neill sneaking ahead of him in the race to sign Barry Ferguson. O&apos;Neill has some dead wood of his own to shift too though - he needs to convince Real Sociedad to part with \u00a34m for Milan Baros, so he can stump up the cash Liverpool want for Craig Bellamy. Blackburn have been trying to fill a Bellamy-shaped hole in their attack since he wandered off in the summer, and now Mark Hughes reckons Robert Earnshaw could fill it. He&apos;s probably wrong, but not as wrong as Torino or Napoli would be to invest their hard-earned cash in Massimo Maccarone. And in an absurdly cramped finale Tottenham and Arsenal are squabbling over Ashley Young, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink likes the smell of Neil Warnock&apos;s money, Fulham want to pair Freddy Eastwood with new signing Vincenzo Montella, Portsmouth like Yossi Benayoun, Ivan Campo has turned down a switch to Atletico Bilbao and Sven-Goran Eriksson could soon be manager of Marseille.

So it would be understandable if he were pining for the happy old days of Milan - particularly if any of his old friends happened to get in touch with him. They are in Malta at the moment, training on the beach in the sunshine. Having had some time off to relax with their families and clear their heads of the pressures of constant football, Milan&apos;s players are on phase two of their winter break, where they top up fitness levels and work on team bonding. Milan&apos;s athletic coach, Daniele Tognaccini, cannot speak highly enough of the benefits of this annual breather. &apos;Working in the warm weather has benefits for muscles. It&apos;s also good for the players&apos; well-being. A lot of them needed a rest during the vacation and we are pleased they were able to do that. To get Milan in top condition, we will work continuously from January through to May. In January we won&apos;t be on top of our brilliance, but I think that we will be for the double encounter against Celtic in February.&apos; Of the 16 teams due to get back to Champions League business next month, 11 have had - and the lucky ones are still having - a winter break. And then there are the Brits, who are slogging their way through their most intensive period of the season in inclement weather with some predictable consequences. Is it any surprise Chelsea lost points and players over Christmas? Can Manchester United keep everybody fresh for the next five months after all they have given in the first half of the campaign? Are Arsenal and Liverpool ever going to mount challenges at home and abroad simultaneously as they so crave? Will Celtic be robust enough to overcome a Milan side that will surely be livelier than they were pre-Christmas? Bayern Munich are in Dubai, Inter have gone to Bahrain. Lille, who play Manchester United in the knock-out phase, have stayed closer to home and enjoyed bike rides and basketball. Even those clubs who have not plumped for warm weather training give their players time off to get away from it all. Hence Lyon&apos;s band of Brazilians - Juninho, Fred, Cris and Capaca - were able to return to South America. Barcelona&apos;s chief inspiration Ronaldinho went home to open a sport and education institute in Porto Alegre. Real Madrid&apos;s Robinho played in a charity match back home against Romario - every spectator had to donate one kilo of non-perishable food to get a ticket. A little nourishment for the soul is hugely beneficial midway through the season - particularly after a World Cup year. Bayern Munich&apos;s manager Felix Magath thinks this period to rehabilitate mind and body is imperative: &apos;Our troubled pre-season period, coupled with the extra burden of the World Cup in July, definitely caused all the significant problems we&apos;ve had up to now. Now we can try a few things out. I&apos;m convinced we&apos;ll hit on a formation that plays a great deal better than we have so far.&apos; If all other countries in Europe see value in putting the competition on hold, they cannot all be wrong. Managers of the Premiership&apos;s establishment clubs are virtually unified in their backing for a winter break, but their pleas have always been ignored. The reasons are simple enough: money, money and more money. Any respite from our programme would require the Premiership to be cut to 18 clubs. Naturally all clubs who flirt with relegation will not be voting for it. Even for the stronger clubs, potential revenue from an extra four matches is not to be sniffed at. Scotland, who experimented with a break for four seasons from 1998-99, have binned it. As Gordon Strachan points out, &apos;The cash-flow is the problem, I don&apos;t think a lot of clubs could do without the cash flow. But I would like it. If you asked most managers and physios, there are a lot of niggling injuries at this time, especially with the rain we have had recently. A nice break would be handy for everybody.&apos; Opponents of the idea point out that English clubs have reached the finals for the past two seasons. However, Liverpool, in 2005, and Arsenal, in 2006, jeopardised their league position in doing so. Both were fortunate to squeeze back into Europe&apos;s premier competition. The English contingent are currently among the favourites to win the Champions League, but they will do well to have the legs to go the distance. Perrin happier in dour Doubs than Portsmouth Paul Le Guen&apos;s disastrous reign at Rangers makes him the third Frenchman to come to Britain with a solid reputation as a smart coach only to watch it wither. Remember Jacques Santini&apos;s awful few weeks at Tottenham and Alain Perrin&apos;s swift disappearance from Portsmouth? While Santini is currently off the radar having underachieved at his next post in Auxerre, Perrin ended up in an area of France that is so bleak in winter it is known as &apos;Little Siberia&apos;. From this outpost he has made a splendid revival at Sochaux. &apos;Les Lionceaux&apos; - the Lion Cubs - are pushing hard for a Champions League position. So how could a man who failed so spectacularly on the south coast of England rise again so rapidly in a strange corner of France? Perrin and Sochaux are made for each other. Doubs is a notoriously dour region close to the Swiss border, known for the manufacture of pipes and Gruyere cheese. The phrase people say about the cheery locals is: &apos;They laugh when they burn themselves.&apos; Sochaux are known as the French Juventus because they were backed by car producers Peugeot, as Fiat have with the Italian giants. They are one of France&apos;s grand old clubs, but have been starved of success in recent years. Like Perrin, Le Guen will return to France with every chance to survive his British blip. The French believe the situation at Rangers is an example of player power gone mad and the reputation more likely to be damaged over the Channel is not Le Guen&apos;s but Rangers&apos;.

Few sportsmen have been as merciless as the Swede. The late Vitas Gerulaitis, his great friend, once recalled of their matches: &apos;Every time I play Borg I come out with some 30 ideas that should get me victory. And each time Bjorn breaks each one of the 30 to pieces, like a clay-pigeon shooter.&apos; They practised together most weeks on tour and played each other 16 times in tournaments, including an epic Wimbledon semi-final in 1977. Gerulaitis never won once. Every player Borg faced had a similar story. Jimmy Connors, the greatest slugging competitor, lost 10 matches in a row to him. Ilie Nastase, the master gamesman, was brutally denied the Wimbledon championship he felt was his destiny by the 20-year-old Borg in 1976. For his six consecutive French Open titles and five Wimbledons, unparalleled summers of achievement, it seemed that failure would never be an option for Borg. His arrival in SW19 in 1973 had been heralded by the hormonal screams of girl fans, a new sound on Centre Court; but by the time he won there three years later, even those screams had faded. There seemed no way to get to him, so focused was he on the next ball, and the next. In this pursuit of perfection, nothing was ever left to chance - Borg&apos;s Wimbledon routine was the same every year: the same hotel in Hampstead, the same locker, the same chair, the same number of towels on Centre Court. The same abstinence from shaving and sex for the duration of the tournament. And the same result. Everything beyond that, Borg had removed from his game by drills and application. There was no excess flourish about his strokes, no recrimination when he mishit, no emotion beyond absolute determination. His heart, which pulsed extraordinarily slowly at 29 beats a minute, never once, it seemed, came into it. Because he was mostly spared the drama of defeat, his victories sometimes lacked romance. And his retirement at 26 seemed to be born of a typical cold-blooded logic. In 1981 Borg had lost, twice, to John McEnroe, the first and only player to get his number, at the final of Wimbledon and at the US Open. After the latter defeat, Borg walked off court and out of the stadium before the ceremonies and press conference had begun; he went straight to the airport and never looked back. Borg had no interest in being the number two player in the world, it seemed. It was number one, or it was nothing. He had had his time. He knew to quit at the very top, without putting himself through every great champion&apos;s story of dwindling expectation. He would not expose himself to that humiliation: the prodigy&apos;s knowledge that even he would have to grow old. Oddly, it was only when he stopped playing that Borg seemed to become fully, frailly human. The headlines he had made as a player of adamantine resolve were replaced by tales of bankruptcy and disastrous relationships. His first marriage, to the tennis player Mariana Simionescu, failed when he met a 17-year-old while judging a wet T-shirt competition and fathered her child. He then married, briefly, the Italian singer and one-time glamour model Loredana Berte. By the time that marriage was almost over and his clothing business was foundering amid lawsuits and lost fortunes, Borg looked a lot different to the peerless King of Wimbledon he had been. It was then, at 34, that he decided to make the most poignant of comebacks at the high-profile clay-court tournament in Monte Carlo, by then his home town. Time, in sport, moves extremely quickly. Borg, stubborn as ever, appeared to want to ignore that fact entirely. He made his return with his antique small-headed wooden racket - when all around him were wielding great graphite clubs - wearing the same brief Fila kit that he had made his trademark. He lost to Jordi Arrese, a journeyman Spaniard, in straight sets. A couple of other similar defeats and the cringe-inducing return was over. Talking to Borg now, in Birmingham, in a rare interview on the day after he has won the BBC Sports Personality lifetime achievement award, he is happy to laugh a little at the hubris and embarrassment of that attempted comeback. &apos;You know,&apos; he says, &apos;the thing was I just wanted to play tennis again. After I retired I did not play much for seven or eight years. In 1991, I decided to come to play Monte Carlo. It was a big tournament. I was living in Monte Carlo. I played no practice, no exhibitions, I just kind of turned up.&apos; The most exactingly prepared man ever to hold a tennis racket, wanted, it appeared, to find out if he could do it without trying. &apos;It was madness; I knew that,&apos; he says. &apos;I knew I was not playing well. But I can&apos;t explain it except to say I wanted to play. One or two years later Jimmy Connors started the senior circuit. If they&apos;d had that in &apos;91, I would have done that instead. As it was, I went to Monte Carlo.&apos; And the wooden racket? &apos;Well, I had never played with anything else. I knew that if I wanted to do well I had to use another racket but I thought, you know: why change?&apos; He would never say as much, would not allow himself that much psychology, but there was something about that heartbreaking comeback that went far beyond a simple desire to play. It looked a lot like Borg laying ghosts to rest, a slaying of his own legend. This, he seemed to be saying, is why I stopped, because no one can do it for ever, win for ever, life is not like that. What he proved, when he came out those few times in his thirties, was not only that he was big enough to lose; but that winning was not the only thing. It has been claimed that the comeback destroyed Borg&apos;s cool mystique; on the contrary it seems to me that it reaffirmed it - it showed, after all those years, just how much, underneath it all, that the game meant to him. Now aged 50, Borg is in relaxed good health. He has stayed on in Birmingham to launch his range of underwear at the space-age Selfridges store, so he is surrounded by teenage models in boxer shorts. He seems quietly amused by his life and unusually happy to talk. For a long while after he finished the game it was not like that for him, however. He had his own mythical past to contend with and it was a hard reputation to bear, a kind of stoic genius that was at odds with the new reality of his life. &apos;When I played tennis up to 25 everyone could only see the positive things about me, really,&apos; he suggests. &apos;Afterwards, if I did something negative, they always measured it against what I had done before. To be so perfect in my tennis, and as a person in some ways while I was playing, that was always going to be a hard act to follow.&apos; Monte Carlo was one way of coping with that, his way of reminding himself and everyone else that he was vulnerable, that he could make mistakes. Oddly, he says, the moment that vulnerability first hit him with proper force was also the moment of his most famous triumph. It came at the end of his tie-break with McEnroe in the Wimbledon final of 1980 when, having surrendered seven match points, he walked back to his chair with the final all square at two sets apiece. That was the first time, he says, in all of his winning years at Wimbledon, that he entertained the thing he most feared: doubt. It was the first time he ever really believed that he would lose. He had never watched the final again, never seen the point of that, until recently, when his children forced him to sit down with them and talk them through it. I wonder how it feels to him, seeing all that tension after all these years. Watching that other life? &apos;Well,&apos; he says, laughing, &apos;it helps that I know the result. But watching myself losing that last point, 18-16, I can feel that walk back to the chair now as if it was yesterday. That was the toughest moment in my tennis career, that walk. I knew John thought he would win the match. I thought he would win the match. I don&apos;t know how I regrouped. If he had broken me in the first game of the fifth set I would have lost, but I won from love-30 and then I played just unbelievably well, hardly lost a point on serve and won the match. That was the strongest set, mentally, in my tennis career.&apos; But it was also, he had recognised, the beginning of the end. The strangest thing, he suggests, was that of all the Wimbledon finals the one he should have won most easily was the one he lost, in 1981, against McEnroe. &apos;I felt I was much the better player that day. But I just wasn&apos;t so focused. And when I lost what shocked me was I wasn&apos;t even upset. That was not me: losing a Wimbledon final and not upset. I hate to lose. It was the same at the US Open. Losing to John again I was relieved the match was over.&apos; He knew that something had gone for good and, despite McEnroe&apos;s desperate efforts to persuade him not to retire, to continue their rivalry, he knew he would not properly get that thing - desire - back. &apos;The difficulty is,&apos; he says, &apos;when you play at that level you don&apos;t have problems. If someone had said to me while I was playing tennis, &quot;Look, I have this problem in my life&quot;, I would not have known what they meant, not really. Everything was looked after for me. I was following my schedule. Practice, eating, sleeping...&apos; He craved, I suppose, complication, disorder, indiscipline (you might say he wanted to be John McEnroe). Once he stepped out of the lines of the tennis court, he found them. &apos;It took many years to find peace with myself and to find what I really wanted to do,&apos; he says. &apos;I had a lot of choice, a lot of opportunities. I tried lots of things, some good, some bad. It has taken me this many years to get to where I want to be.&apos; I wonder what he looks back on now - from the vantage of an idyllic home life in Stockholm, a young family - as the lowest points. There were, around the time of his comeback, rumours of a drug overdose, a suicide attempt? He denies this strongly, suggesting that the rumours grew out of an admission to hospital with food poisoning. But still around that time, with the collapse of his business interests, he acknowledges he felt under severe strain. &apos;Money is important, but not that important,&apos; he says. &apos;The most disappointing thing was that people abused me, you know. When the business started, I thought these people were my friends. But they were all out to screw me really.&apos; One of the things that has allowed him to rebuild his life is the renaissance of his clothing line, its retro look inspired a little by the playboy image of tennis in the 1970s (one memorable advert for his briefs implored Swedes to address urgently the falling birthrate: &apos;Fuck for the future&apos; ran the strapline). The invocation worked, apparently; Bjorn Borg is second only to Calvin Klein back home. &apos;We are now doing unbelievably well,&apos; he says. &apos;New designers, new managers. We are on the stock market in Sweden, in 10 different territories in Europe and the business is huge ...&apos; I wonder, despite this success, if it still hasn&apos;t, in the underwear business, been impossible for him to recreate the intensity of his tennis years. &apos;The intensity is not the problem,&apos; he says. &apos;One thing is, as a man, you have to find a great woman. Unfortunately this is the third time I got married. That is nothing you aim for. Hopefully you want to stay with the same woman. But if you are not peaceful with yourself, marriage is not going to work.&apos; His current contentment explains his apparent reclusiveness in recent years he says. He and his wife, Patricia, have a son of three, as well as two children from her previous marriage. They live outside Stockholm on an island in the archipelago. He gets up with the kids at six, plays tennis five times a week and coaches Swedish juniors. Like McEnroe, he has never lost his love of the game whether playing or watching. Lately, he says, he has become friendly with Roger Federer. He practised with him recently in Dubai and he can&apos;t help but see a lot of himself in the four-time Wimbledon champion - and also a lot of his rivalry with McEnroe in Federer&apos;s matches with Rafael Nadal. I wonder if he can immediately recognise in any young pretender the potential not just to reach the top 10, but to be the best? &apos;I think so,&apos; he says. &apos;After Federer, I think Andy Murray has a great chance to be the next number-one player in the world. He has the heart for it. You can always see straight away the people that will put themselves out there. Henman had it, too, actually. He never made it, but at Wimbledon in particular he gave himself chances.&apos; Last year, there was a surprising story involving Borg&apos;s plans to put up his Wimbledon trophies for auction at Bonhams in London. At the time it seemed like this was to solve a financial crisis, but that did not square with the success of his business, and he denies it now. &apos;It wasn&apos;t a money thing, not at all,&apos; he says. &apos;Over the years I have been giving away trophies to charities, for kids tournaments. I have given away everything, all my kit, shoes, lots of trophies. The only things I had left were the Wimbledon trophies, my French trophies, and the Davis Cup medals. And I wondered if, at 50, I should sell them. Because no one can take away my memories of these things, of Wimbledon, they are always there.&apos; He was hugely surprised by the reaction. &apos;I had no idea,&apos; he says, &apos;the fuss it would cause. People all over the world contacted radio, television. They all said you cannot sell your trophies. We have lived this with you, you can&apos;t just give it away.&apos; Borg was uncertain. Then the other person to whom the trophies meant most called. And called again. &apos;McEnroe called me many times, saying, &quot;What the hell are you doing?&quot; &apos; he recalls. Except you imagine he did not quite say &apos;hell&apos;. In the old days, perhaps, Borg would not have listened to his friend. But he has learned a few things over the years and one of them is that it is not worth arguing with McEnroe, life is too short. &apos;I bought them back off Bonhams,&apos; Borg says smiling, &apos;and they are in a safe place. They are only trophies, but I will keep them now for ever.&apos; \u00b7 Tim Adams is the author of Being John McEnroe (Yellow Jersey)", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport"], "title": "'I can't explain except to say I wanted to play again.

The absence of a &quot;W&quot; from the corporate acronym is an anomaly that the chairman, David Morgan, formerly in the same post at Glamorgan, is thought to be in favour of amending.

Lee&apos;s spin eases fans&apos; pain Liverpool expect to receive a formal offer from Dubai International Capital before the end of the month, a move which will signal the final stage of a remarkably bloodless takeover. A demonstration last Saturday against the former Sun editor, Kelvin MacKenzie, by Koppites was a reminder that Liverpool fans remain among the most militant in the country, which makes their silence on a takeover by a foreign-owned investment vehicle all the more remarkable. The club have been receiving PR advice from Mike Lee, the former London 2012 spin doctor who advised Eggert Magnusson&apos;s consortium on its purchase of West Ham and worked with Liverpool&apos;s chief executive, Rick Parry, at the Premier League. Sky takes a swing The increasingly lively competition between Sky and Setanta for the eyeballs of the nation&apos;s golf fans saw Sky take out a series of cheeky adverts in the weekend newspapers featuring Darren Clarke, unveiled last week as a Setanta ambassador. In the adverts Clarke is shown swinging alongside a number of other leading players. Crucially he is not wearing the Setanta-branded clothing he will sport this season. Setanta, which poached the USPGA Tour from Sky last autumn, will be quietly pleased that its much larger rival felt the need to commission the campaign at short notice.

Immediately after the glory of Istanbul there was an impression that his mind had turned to fine-tuning the pre-season training plans. He never gets carried away, but frustrations were apparent after the FA Cup defeat to Arsenal. The Liverpool manager was not rebelling or making a futile attempt to put pressure on the board but there was a regretfulness when he said, with other clubs&apos; buying in mind, &quot;If you have \u00a310m, OK, you can get this one.&quot; The manager is unlikely to be spending that sum on a single player this month, unless he first offloads current squad members. &quot;If you don&apos;t have the money you have to work harder,&quot; he accepted. He has a particular gift for preparation and it was a coup for Liverpool to recruit such a person. In his third season on Merseyside, however, the Spaniard has a realistic view of the task ahead. The implication that Arsenal are big spenders was inappropriate, but it is understandable that he should look wistfully at Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s fully developed youth programme. All Ben\u00edtez can do for now is press on with his painstaking approach, hoping to counteract the higher levels of talent at the clubs seen as his Premiership rivals. He can devise a strategy, as he confirmed while beating Manchester United and Chelsea on the way to taking the FA Cup last season. The knockout tournaments suit him best, with the apotheosis coming in the 2005 Champions League. Saturday&apos;s FA Cup tie was no such galvanising occasion. For half an hour there was a possibility that the holders would grind down Arsenal, but Ben\u00edtez&apos;s team were not their meticulous selves in defence. Once they had been breached, the Anfield line-up turned into a collection of dogged triers rather than the tough, resourceful unit they can be. Steven Gerrard has the potential to be a game-changer but Arsenal had merely to stop him and did so on this occasion. These sides face each other again tonight on the same field in the first leg of the Carling Cup semi-final, but taking that trophy would not be fulfilling for a manager who seized the Champions League and then the FA Cup during his first two seasons with Liverpool. Too many of his players are just short of the top level. Regulars guess that three at most would make the first team at Manchester United, Chelsea or Arsenal. Ben\u00edtez would probably not dispute that verdict with any genuine vehemence. He has arrived at a difficult moment in his tenure. There are aspects to please him and for all the lapses in away games Liverpool hold the best home record in the Premiership. With one defeat in the past 10 league matches, even the travels are going far more smoothly than they were. Ben\u00edtez, none the less, will wonder about his long-term destination. A strong finish is needed if Liverpool, who last claimed the title 17 years ago, are not to collect fewer points this season than they did last, and there will not be many more European sorties to take the mind off that if the Champions League tie with Barcelona goes as most pundits predict. Failed efforts to close the gap in the Premiership lead to exhaustion, as people at Anfield understand perfectly. G\u00e9rard Houllier inched Liverpool into the runners-up berth in 2002, seven points behind Arsenal. Two years later they came fourth, 30 points adrift of Wenger&apos;s men as Arsenal regained the title. Ben\u00edtez dreads repeating that Houllier pattern. He has a good squad, but cannot depend on it outdoing itself whenever a major occasion arises. Results against United and Arsenal in the current campaign have been chastening. Liverpool do need a squad in which the ability is spread more evenly and, although Ben\u00edtez generally buys well enough for odd exceptions, such as the surprisingly ineffective Fernando Morientes, to be overlooked, he cannot afford the exceptional talents. He is bidding in a very different marketplace from United, let alone Chelsea. None the less the present Anfield board, bearing an overdraft of about \u00a380m, has done all it can for him. Ben\u00edtez must pray for the Dubai International Capital group to complete its takeover in the next month or so. The manager will then have to plead eloquently and persuade DIC that it is no more than common sense to fund major transfers that avert the danger of stagnation at Liverpool.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Liverpool"], "title": "Liverpool must look to shake the Houllier habit", "sentences": ["Ben\u00edtez must pray for the Dubai International Capital group to complete its takeover in the next month or so."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jan/09/sport.comment2", "publicationDate": "2007-01-09T01:09:38Z"}, {"article": "The publication of international racing&apos;s prizemoney &apos;league table&apos; for 2006 in the Racing Post last week appeared to carry an obvious warning. The top 10 slots in the list all belonged to races run outside Europe, while the Derby, Britain&apos;s highest - and only - entry in the top 40, occupied 15th place, well adrift of events including the Melbourne Cup and even the Japanese St Leger. The immediate conclusion drawn by many observers was that British racing is doomed as an international force unless it can find a way to compete with the cash on offer in places like Hong Kong, Japan, Dubai and America. Given that most of those countries also operate a pari-mutuel betting monopoly - the obvious exception being Dubai, where betting is illegal - it is a short leap to suggest that the bookmakers who dominate the betting market in Britain have much to answer for. The fact that Ireland, which also has a gambling culture based around fixed-odds bookmaking, has only one top-40 entry - the Irish Derby in 38th place - seems to add weight to the argument. Short leaps, though, can be just as misguided as large ones, and the mistake here is to assume that prizemoney levels are not merely an indicator of a racing industry&apos;s wellbeing, but the only measure worth considering. It is a legacy, perhaps, of the period when the multi-millionaire Peter Savill, with dozens of horses in training, was in charge at the British Horseracing Board, and prizemoney was accorded such overarching significance that you felt he probably had a shrine to Mammon in the corner of his office. What his one-dimensional analysis failed to appreciate, however, is that British racing is about rather more than just a headline number, competing with all the other headline numbers elsewhere in the world. Prizemoney is important to some owners, but others see the real value of our sport elsewhere. The fact that there are nearly 60 courses and no two tracks are the same, that summer and winter have their own codes, that there is a tangible sense of rich heritage at so many British venues and, yes, that you can take a tilt at the bookies if you fancy your horse: these are all factors that are difficult to quantify in strict monetary terms, but undoubtedly help to attract and keep owners in British racing. Given that 2006 also saw an Australian-trained winner at Royal Ascot, and a third-place finish for Japan in the King George, it is also fair to assume that the heritage aspect in particular still plays well internationally. British-trained horses, meanwhile, took six of the top 40 prizes, an impressive strike-rate when so many of these races took place thousands of miles away.

Rolls-Royce revealed a convertible car, the Phantom Drophead Coupe, at this week&apos;s North American International Auto Show - its first new model for four years. Made in Goodwood, Sussex, the car costs $408,000 (\u00a3210,000). It has wood and brushed steel fittings, a distinctive curved nose and a radiator grill described as &quot;rakish&quot;. It is intended to be a more &quot;informal&quot; offering to attract younger buyers. Rolls-Royce&apos;s chairman, Ian Robertson, said the soft-top was a natural successor to models such as the Silver Ghost, the Silver Cloud and the Corniche: &quot;If we look at our history, Rolls-Royce has always had very notable convertibles.&quot; Since being taken over by BMW, Rolls-Royce has renewed its factory and its workforce. It sold 805 cars last year - the most for 16 years - and the number of dealerships has grown from 60 to 80. The US is Rolls-Royce&apos;s biggest market. But Mr Robertson said that the firm&apos;s biggest-selling showroom, Beverley Hills in California, had been caught up by Tokyo. Behind them ranks London, followed by Dubai and New York. &quot;We&apos;re experiencing very strong growth in Asia,&quot; said Mr Robertson. &quot;Our sales in China are up by 60%.&quot; He said the average age of Rolls-Royce owners had dropped by 10 years and added that recent purchasers were &quot;more often than not owner-drivers&quot;. The Drophead Coupe boasts a boot capable of carrying three sets of golf clubs and a camera under the numberplate with a dashboard monitor to help with parking. With 12 cylinders, a top speed of 149mph and a weight of 2.6 tonnes, it is something of an anomaly at this year&apos;s Detroit show, which is dominated by discussion of fuel economy, environmentally friendly vehicles and the US&apos;s shift from gas-guzzling trucks to smaller cars. A Rolls-Royce spokesman, Bob Austin, told the Guardian a &quot;hybrid&quot; Rolls-Royce combining petrol and an alternative fuel such as hydrogen was a long-term possibility because the vehicles were based on the same structure as hydrogen-powered vehicles in the BMW 7-series. &quot;We are looking at what we need to do in terms of the environment,&quot; he said, but added that such ideas were still on the drawing board. He said Rolls-Royce had introduced recycling, a vegetation-covered roof and other green features, although he maintained that the company&apos;s pollution footprint was limited: &quot;We only produce 800 cars a year. If you were to remove all the Rolls-Royce cars from the roads, it wouldn&apos;t make a big difference to the environment.&quot; Commentators gave the new car a positive reception. Gary Vasilach, editor-in-chief of the US magazine Automotive Design &amp; Production, said: &quot;Rolls-Royce still resonates very well in America - they&apos;ll never go away. Where do they sell?

I am under no illusions about the task ahead, but throughout my career I have faced certain challenges and met them all in the same way&quot; - considering he&apos;s been relegated four times so far in his career, West Ham fans may find Nigel Quashie&apos;s cri de coeur slightly less than reassuring. ********************* SUPER BLOOPER In Superman III, two directors discover that a hacker has pinched thousands of dollars from their company via some untraceable technological trickery. &quot;Unless the man&apos;s a complete idiot - I mean a total ignoramus - he&apos;ll keep a low profile and not do anything to draw attention to himself,&quot; they lament, realising they may never catch the culprit ... until, at that moment, Richard Pryor&apos;s character, low-paid computer geek Gus, turns up for work in flash new clothes and a gleaming Ferrari. Yet when it comes to outlandishly dumb indiscretions, there is one man dimmer than dear old Gus: ex-England ringleader Sven-Goran Eriksson. Yes, the stealthy Swede, who famously fended off rumours linking him with a move to Chelsea by strolling into Roman Abramovich&apos;s gaff in full view of Fleet Street photographers, today finds himself engulfed in controversy in France following the sort of tactless display that even seasoned streakers would be embarrassed by. Amid intense speculation linking Eriksson to the job of Marseille manager - what with Jack Kachkar, the clearly clueless Canadian bidding to take over the club, reportedly having made the Swede his top target - Eriksson deftly played down the gossip by turning up to watch yesterday&apos;s friendly between Marseille and Lazio in Dubai. And ostentatiously taking notes throughout the game. After OM chairman Pape Diouf vented his fury at what he said was a brazen attempt to pile pressure on current manager Albert Emon, the ever-convincing Swede, who famously underlined his commitment to keeping his professional and private life separate by banging his colleagues&apos; secretary, innocently pleaded: &quot;I&apos;m here on holiday, that&apos;s all ... I haven&apos;t even thought about going to Olympique Marseille.&quot; Perhaps. But an offer of \u00a34m-a-season will soon change his mind. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Rafa Benitez will solve his goalkeeping, defensive and attacking problems in one fell swoop with a \u00a39m bid for footballing Swiss Army knife Phil Jagielka. Lee Hendrie could soon be splitting pantomime villain duties with Craig Bellamy at Villa Park ... ... especially if Jose Mourinho carries through with his inexplicable plan to take Milan Baros off Martin O&apos;Neill&apos;s hands. Not content with having at least four times more hair than Silvio Berlusconi, Massimo Moratti will continue his quest to prove he is Milan&apos;s most virile football club owner by hooking up with Andriy Shevchenko. And Edgar Davids will run all the way to Everton in search of a starting role. * * * * * * * * * * * STILL WANT MORE? &quot;Regulars guess that three, at most, of Liverpool&apos;s players would make the first team at [the MU Rowdies], Chelsea or Arsenal. Ben\u00edtez would probably not dispute that verdict with any genuine vehemence&quot; - Kevin McCarra on why Liverpool must spend big in the transfer market.

Officials from Stevens&apos; firm, Quest, met the FA yesterday for the first time since the former Metropolitan Police commissioner published the findings of his inquiry into illegal payments. The identities of the eight agents, all of whom have a foreign connection, were handed over to the FA. It is understood that Quest also requested that the FA ask the world governing body to press the agents to open up their accounts so that the money from 17 Premier League transfers can be traced. An FA spokesman said: &quot;This meeting was the first step of the next stage of this process.&quot; At the meeting, members of the FA&apos;s compliance department were told that they would have to wait to be given the identity of three clubs found by the inquiry to have breached transfer rules. Investigators from Quest are still putting together the final details of the case against the three clubs. Stevens revealed before Christmas that eight agents had refused to cooperate with the inquiry, that three Premier League clubs had breached transfer rules because they had not known the regulations, and that 16 clubs had failed appropriately to document financial arrangements connected to transfers. All of the 17 transfers still under investigation have an international element. In places such as South America transfer fees are often split among numerous parties.

There, his face burnished by a recent dose of Dubai sun, sat Steve McClaren, whose capture of the trophy at Middlesbrough went a long way towards securing him the England manager&apos;s job. In Ben\u00edtez&apos;s position last night McClaren would almost certainly have fielded his strongest possible side as he tried to exorcise pyschological damage inflicted by the weekend&apos;s FA Cup defeat at the hands of the same opponents. But the Liverpool manager&apos;s Spanish roots dictate that he remains a bit of a snob about domestic cup competitions. How else to explain why he gambled on causing palpitations among the Maktoum family in Dubai by fielding several second-stringers against a similarly weakened Arsenal side? Afterwards his words remained as defiant as his decision to keep Peter Crouch on the bench, but his expression told another story. Regret seemed written all over his face when he admitted: &quot;I say sorry to our supporters.&quot; A proud man, Ben\u00edtez does not find apology easy and continued in uncomfortable sentences: &quot;It was a bad game and we will try and forget it as soon as possible. We worked really hard, but it&apos;s very difficult to explain. The other team has quality and were keeping the ball better - and each attempt they had at a goal they scored.&quot; It is surely too much for Liverpool&apos;s manager to hope that the club&apos;s soon-to-be owners were not watching in horror in the United Arab Emirates. The Maktoums will be mystified as to why Ben\u00edtez spurned the chance of lifting a piece of silverware, particularly when Liverpool are already way out of title contention, eliminated from the FA Cup and facing a daunting Champions League tie with Barcelona next month. Surely this was the last occasion when key players needed resting and rotating. He may have won the Uefa Cup with Valencia but Ben\u00edtez has apparently made the mistake of being too sniffy about a competition capable of conferring invaluable boardroom and terrace &quot;cred&quot; on those who choreograph its winners. Not to mention virtual immunity from the sack; it would, after all, take a harsh chairman to dismiss a trophy winner. Yet Ben\u00edtez treated the Carling Cup with the sort of disdain he might once have reserved for the plain girl who kept demanding his attention at a teenage disco. Now, in the second week of January, he is the one in danger of being left looking like a wallflower, the boy left with no girl to walk home as Liverpool&apos;s season dissolves in dashed expectations. How he must wish he could swap places with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. &quot;Our future is very promising,&quot; agreed Arsenal&apos;s manager, who admitted he was surprised that Ben\u00edtez had not started with a &quot;normal&quot; team. &quot;Our young players have shown they have mental strength as well as talent.&quot; When he eventually reports to the club&apos;s new owners, Ben\u00edtez may blame the English academy system and its failings for Liverpool&apos;s lack of strength in depth. Indeed, he apparently has so little faith in the homegrown players coming through at Anfield that only three youngsters in his starting XI were produced locally. Although no worse than the lightweight foreign imports playing alongside them, Danny Guthrie, Lee Peltier and Stephen Warnock failed to impress on a night which cried out for such second- stringers to strut their stuff - not to mention impress watching managers seeking to work the loan system during this month&apos;s transfer window. Glenn Roeder, for instance, had presumably made the long drive from Newcastle to identify such a potential acquistion. Roeder may have had his eye on Warnock, Liverpool&apos;s left-back. If so, it might explain why he looked rather pale as he left his seat at the interval, by which time Warnock&apos;s part in Liverpool&apos;s collapse possibly had Newcastle&apos;s manager wondering if even Albert Luque might be a better alternative to Celestine Babayaro. Indeed, Liverpool&apos;s defensive positioning was so bad that even J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re looked a world beater.

Shaun Woodward, the minister for the creative industries, sought to quash rumours of the details of the yet to be announced licence fee settlement, following intense speculation that the BBC will receive a less generous increase than anticipated. The minister told a parliamentary rally held last night that the funding would be sufficient for the BBC to &quot;set the benchmarks&quot; in a media village due to be erected on the new 200-acre Salford site in the north of England, which the government wants to see rival Dubai and Seoul. Mr Woodward said that despite the speculation, the licence fee increases had not yet been settled because of what he described as an unprecedented level of government consultation with interested parties. According to leaked government briefings last month, the BBC is expected to receive an annual rise of 3% for the two years from April 2007, followed by 2% for the next three years and a rise of between 0% and 2% in the final year of the deal. Speaking at the parliamentary lobby meeting organised by media unions and listener and viewer bodies, the minister said: &quot;Despite all the rumours that people have heard in the media since Christmas, it is not finalised and will not be finalised until it goes through cabinet and we make a statement through parliament.&quot; On the speculation, he said: &quot;A lot of it is conjecture, some of it is informed, some of it less informed and some of it is pretty accurate.&quot; Mr Woodward revealed ministers&apos; ambitions for a &quot;new media village&quot; in the north-west of England after the government was barracked at the meeting over its decision to force the BBC to foot the bill for digital switchover. The Conservatives warned such a move would swallow up most of the license fee increase. Mr Woodward said the final license fee settlement would cover both switchover and the planned relocation of almost 4,000 staff to Salford, near Manchester. &quot;I think the BBC settlement will be tough but fair. It will be appropriate for the climate in which the BBC must operate in relation to the digital age but also in relation to Salford.&quot; He added: &quot;What Salford offers is not just an opportunity for people to work for the BBC in the north, it is an opportunity to create our first digital media community on a scale that will be a rival to Dubai and Seoul and will allow an additional 12,000 jobs from the industry to work there. &quot;This is actually a fantastic opportunity, not just for Manchester and the north-west but for the creative industries more broadly.&quot; The digital switchover bill currently going through parliament will see financial assistance given to those on low incomes, subject to means testing, at an estimated cost of \u00a3600m. The Liberal Democrat broadcast spokesman, Don Foster, accused the government of using the BBC to deliver social policy. He said: &quot;It is absolutely clear that the cost of switching to digital, and particularly targeted assistance, is actually a government social policy that the government has said must happen&quot;, he said. &quot;It is not something that should be foisted on licence fee payers but should be paid directly by government.&quot; Ed Vaizey, the Tory shadow broadcast minister, said his calculations suggested that the cost of funding digital switch would swallow up the bulk of the expected licence fee increase. &quot;From our [Conservatives&apos;] perspective we would not have started from here&quot;, he said. But Mr Woodward said digital switchover was key to allowing the BBC to &quot;set benchmarks for everyone else&quot; in the digital age. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.

Because as a crowd (not as individuals), they&apos;re dumb. I&apos;m not sure if I mean lovably simple like Jason McAteer. Or so ostentatiously, in-your-face stupid that they inspire not laughter, not solidarity, not even sympathy, but a desire to avoid them at all costs ... or exploit them for all their worth. Which, it could be argued, is what their club has been doing to them for the last 17 years. Mid-way through the second-half of last night&apos;s shambles, Liverpool fans began booming out &apos;You&apos;ll Never Walk Alone&apos; with such gusto that anyone tuning in at that precise moment would have assumed the home side were comfortably ahead. But, of course, they weren&apos;t. They were being rogered 5-1. Once again, then, the Liverpool faithful, like the loyal sheep of certain other clubs, were wallowing in failure. And this morning many of them smugly expect everyone to congratulate them for that by agreeing that they&apos;re &quot;the greatest fans in the world&quot;, or some such swill. Belting out your devotion to a club when it is, yet again, blatantly underachieving is not being a &quot;true fan&quot; any more than cheering on an alcoholic every time he downs a jug of vodka is being a true friend. Like a man suffering from an addiction, a once-great club hooked on mediocrity and half-success needs a mighty metaphorical boot in the hole. It needs to be shaken out of its self-defeating stupor. Sure, when you see signs of a willingness to get better, then rousing outporusings of affection may be appropriate, but until that point is reached, you&apos;ve got to be cruel to be kind (like I&apos;m being here, see). G\u00e9rard Houllier inched towards recovery and was embraced. Then he lost the plot and was indulged. Fan desertion should have (a) forced him to change his ways or (b) forced the directors to bin him sooner than 18 months after he&apos;d passed his expiry date. Similarly, Rafael Benitez initially suggested he was the man to restore Liverpool to greatness, most obviously when he somehow led them to Champions League triumph in 2005 despite completely botching his selection and tactics in the final. Greatness doesn&apos;t mean sporadic success in cups, it means sustained domination of leagues. And in that sense, Benitez has been going backwards since his inspired half-time changes in Istanbul. So let&apos;s be clear: rather than pledge their allegiance to the unacceptable, Liverpool fans should have walked out en masse shortly after half-time in yesterday debacle. And made it plain that until they&apos;re convinced that Liverpool could win the Premiership (nothing less should do) they will not be paying into Anfield, nor buying replica jerseys, official merchandise or Benitez&apos;s guff about not having enough money to rival the big three (when you&apos;ve spunked \u00a36.7m on Arsenal reject Jermaine Pennant, \u00a37m on one season wonder(ish) Peter Crouch and oh-my-god-how-bloody-much?! on busy-but-aimless strikers such as Craig Bellamy and Dirk Kuyt, do you really deserve to be entrusted with even more funds, even if they were available? Certain Dubai fat cats may well be asking themselves that questions right now). If there is anybody other than away fans at Anfield&apos;s next game, then Liverpool deserve another tonking. All of the above is, of course, equally applicable to many fans of Newcastle, Manchester City and every other band of fools who regularly boast about filling their ground to watch overpaid underperformers.

With a takeover imminent, Ben\u00edtez felt emboldened enough to question the club&apos;s spending policies under the current regime and blame the 6-3 Carling Cup thrashing by Arsenal on a failure to release more transfer funds. On another troubled day for the club, Ben\u00edtez learned last night that Luis Garc\u00eda would be out for six months after rupturing knee ligaments in Tuesday&apos;s extraordinary quarter-final, the first time Liverpool had conceded six goals at home since 1930. Amid a welter of criticism from supporters and former players, Ben\u00edtez denied any culpability for the defeat and, in his most outspoken criticism of the Anfield hierarchy since replacing G\u00e9rard Houllier in 2004, he expressed his dissatisfaction about the level of financial backing and that the club worked &quot;too slowly&quot; in the transfer market. &quot;If Arsenal can play nine reserves and score six at Anfield, people should be asking why,&quot; said Ben\u00edtez. &quot;It&apos;s not because of one game, it&apos;s because of many reasons. There is a lesson for the whole of our club. That lesson is that if you want to compete at the top level you must be able to spend a lot of money - not only on your first team but on the young players and the reserves. &quot;My scouting department has done an excellent job but sometimes we go too slowly as a club to make signings we need. We need to work quickly. And when we do, there is not a lot of money. Arsenal spent \u00a34m on Abou Diaby, \u00a34m on Denilson, \u00a38m on Theo Walcott and Julio Baptista is a \u00a322m player. We had seven players with first-team experience and still we could not win.&quot; The Spaniard had admitted, in private, to being frustrated by these matters on several occasions, but this is the first time he has expressed his grievances publicly and it is understood to have been timed deliberately given the advanced nature of the takeover talks. He described the club as being several years behind Arsenal in terms of development and made it clear Liverpool would not be in a position to re-establish themselves as England&apos;s top club until the Dubai International Capital group moved into power and made significant money available for new signings. Liverpool&apos;s directors, however, are entitled to question some of Ben\u00edtez&apos;s figures. Baptista, for example, is only on loan at Arsenal and, before that, joined Real Madrid from Sevilla for \u00a313.8m. Ben\u00edtez&apos;s complaints also fail to take into account that the \u00a377.8m paid out by Liverpool in transfer fees during his 2\u00bd seasons as manager is higher than at any other Premiership club in the same period, apart from Chelsea and Manchester United. Ben\u00edtez has brought in 25 players and has also put in place a loan deal for Sampdoria&apos;s 21-year-old goalkeeper Danielle Padell, a move that effectively ends Jerzy Dudek&apos;s first-team career at Anfield. &quot;We are signing a young Italian goalkeeper on loan with an option for longer,&quot; said Ben\u00edtez. &quot;We have also been working for many weeks to sign James McCarthy, a young Scot [from Hamilton Academicals]. These are deals we are doing because we want to build for the future. But without spending money it is difficult. Arsenal have two or three players, for example, who we were monitoring but couldn&apos;t sign because we didn&apos;t have enough money.&quot; It was put to Ben\u00edtez that he had blundered by resting so many players when the tie represented Liverpool&apos;s last chance of a domestic trophy. &quot;What is more important?&quot; he replied. &quot;The Premiership, the Champions League or the Carling Cup?

Middle East watchers at this morning&apos;s conference pointed out that the British military is keen to get out of Basra and plans to begin the handover to Iraqi forces in April and May. But will Bush&apos;s reinforcement of Baghdad and the Anbar province -- and his declared crackdown on both Sunni insurgents and Shia militias -- make this goal impossible? Will the looming battle for Baghdad become, in turn, a new battle for Basra? The foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, this morning supported the US &quot;troop surge&quot; but refused to speculate on the British withdrawal from Basra, saying that the pull-out of British forces would depend on improvements in the security situation on the ground there. &quot;Nothing has changed from what we have said in the past,&quot; she said. &quot;We will make our judgments and our decisions depending on the progress of those events. That was the case in the past. It is the case now.&quot; Some saw this, coupled with other comments from government ministers on Britain being able to &quot;do our own thing&quot;, as an indication that some divergence in US-UK policy may be about to take place. There has been a historic difference in military strategy in any case. This was qualified by the observation that this divergence may be beginning in the minds of some ministers, but the prime minister seems to be travelling in the opposite direction. He appeared to support some of the conclusions of the Baker-Hamilton report from the Iraq Study Group in his annual speech on foreign policy at the Guildhall last November. One element in that speech was seeking a civil &quot;partnership&quot; with Iran. Just one month later, after his latest visit to the White House, he claimed in a speech in Dubai that Iran posed a &quot;strategic challenge&quot; to moderate Middle East governments and the west as a whole. Now that American policy has toughened to include &quot;hot pursuit&quot; of hostile forces into Iran in Syria, will the prime minister follow suit and embroil British forces in the aggressive policy, ditching the favoured Foreign and Commonwealth Office approach of engagement? Events are already running ahead of the new policy. Earlier this morning Reuters reported that the official Iranian news agency, IRNA, stated that US forces raided the Iranian consulate office in the northern Iraqi city of Abril today and arrested five employees. The Reuters report continued: &quot;There was no immediate comment by the US military on the raid which came hours after President George W Bush vowed in a speech to interrupt what he called the &apos;flow of support&apos; from Iran and Syria for insurgent attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq. The raid was the second such operation in the past month against Iranian interests in Iraq by US forces.&quot; Two days ago the US blacklisted one of Iran&apos;s largest banks, accusing it of financing the development of nuclear weapons. This unilateral action was taken in the wake of December&apos;s decision by the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions against Iran over its failure to halt uranium enrichment.

Fading luminaries such as Christian Vieri, Roberto Carlos, Edgar Davids, and Clarence Seedorf  may also follow Becks&apos; noble lead. Jose Mourinho is one man who&apos;s had his fill of rich fools, allegedly. The Sun this morning claims the Special One&apos;s told a chum in Spain that he&apos;s going to turn his back on certain interfering, know-nothing suits at Stamford Bridge and join a club in Spain or Italy this summer. Serie A champions by default Internazionale, who are, of course, not rich fools in any way, shape or form, are favourites to give Mourinho the freedom he&apos;s crying for. Before that, however, Mourinho will attempt to land a third straight Premiership title by selling Dutch fall guy Arjen Robben to Bayern Munich. Who will then sell Owen Hargreaves to Manchester United. Who will then win the Premiership, thus foiling Mourinho&apos;s cunning plan. D&apos;oh! United won&apos;t get Hargraves cheaply, though, because Bayern want his transfer to fund not just their move for Robben, but also the purchase of Villarreal&apos;s Juan Roman Riquelme. Meanwhile, poor, neglected Rafael Ben\u00edtez is to miss out on Blackburn defender Lucas Neill, as Liverpool aren&apos;t willing to match the \u00a38m fee West Ham will bid.

His trainer, Mark Johnston, has started a number of his best horses off on the all-weather in the past and this Kempton winner could turn out to be pretty useful.

The retailer returned to the black in the first half of the year thanks to a strong performance in its fashion and soft furnishing divisions. Trendy designer clothing group Ted Baker posted another double-digit increase today, reporting an 11% jump in retail sales between November 1 and Christmas Eve. The group continues to push ahead with expansion overseas and opened a further licensed store in Dubai in December. It now operates six stores under licence across Asia and the Middle East, with further stores scheduled to open in the next financial year. Chief executive Ray Kelvin said the performance &quot;is in line with expectations and we look forward to a successful outcome for the full year&quot;. Chocolate group Thorntons has enjoyed a much-needed Christmas boost after sales melted during the hot summer. Like-for-like sales at Thorntons own stores rose 3.2% in the four weeks to 6 January, leaving the company on track to post overall sales growth for the second half. Sales in the second quarter were down just 0.4%, an improvement on the first quarter&apos;s 3.5% drop. Chief executive Mike Davies said &quot;On the whole, we have made steady progress following a difficult start to the year. The investment made across all the sales channels in the first half produced an improved second-quarter performance. This investment together with new sales and cost initiatives positions us well to deliver overall sales growth in the second half.&quot; The company has revamped 176 stores and invested heavily in its website and marketing, leading to a 19.1% jump in sales of Thorntons Direct over the past half year. Franchise sales mirrored those in the high street stores in experiencing a poor summer and then a pick-up later in the year, with 8 new franchisees being added in the six weeks leading up to Christmas. Fat Face, the trendy lifestyle brand whose philosophy is to live life out of the office, posted a 35% increase in sales during the Christmas period. Louise Barnes, chief executive of the retailer, said: &quot;Christmas was again a good period for us, against strong comparatives and high levels of competitor discounting, and we are encouraged by our results.&quot; The group, which was acquired by private equity group Advent International in April 2005, added that total sales for the first half of the year were up 38% to \u00a351.7m. Earnings for the 26 weeks to November 25 rose 74% to \u00a311.4m. Fat Face, which now has a total of 124 stores in the UK, Ireland and France, said its international expansion was on track, with the signing of a franchise deal in the Middle East, and the opening of its first store in Dubai. \u00b7 Email business.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk", "tags": ["Business", "Retail industry"], "title": "Retail round-up", "sentences": ["The group continues to push ahead with expansion overseas and opened a further licensed store in Dubai in December.", "Fat Face, which now has a total of 124 stores in the UK, Ireland and France, said its international expansion was on track, with the signing of a franchise deal in the Middle East, and the opening of its first store in Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jan/16/retail1", "publicationDate": "2007-01-16T14:40:08Z"}, {"article": "Different but equal. That&apos;s how those in the further education sector would like to categorise their relationship with the higher education world. But, traditionally, FE has faced a problem of presentation. Most students, far from seeing FE and HE as equal, believe the degree to be a far more desirable qualification. However, times are changing. Universities are increasingly offering vocational courses - and, last month, the government announced that FE colleges would be able to award foundation degrees. John Nutt, head of Derby University&apos;s institute for hospitality and tourism, delivers FE and HE on the same site, and is committed to the &quot;different but equal&quot; mantra. &quot;It&apos;s all about tailoring courses to students and their aspirations,&quot; he says, pointing out that a student with the academic qualifications might be better off going on a vocational course if they want to go into a junior management position. But how does it work in practice? If you want to be a chef, is it better to do a degree or a diploma? And is there really a difference? We spoke to two budding Gordon Ramsays to find out. Scott Carlton, 20, is studying for a culinary arts with business studies BA at the University of Derby at Buxton I&apos;ve wanted to be a chef since I was about 11. I planned to go to catering college until my A-level food technology teacher told me I was achieving fantastic results and maybe I should consider higher education. The degree course at Derby is very practical. We spend a lot of time in the training kitchens with the chef lecturers, and on the theory side we focus on kitchen management, how to plan menus, but always linking it to practical situations. So, for example, although I&apos;ve got quite a lot of experience in kitchens and I&apos;ve seen chefs do the costings - buying chicken for \u00a33 and putting it on the menu for \u00a310 - I&apos;ve never done it. On our course, we plan the menu, cost it and work out how much profit we&apos;re going to make. It wakes you up to the realities of the industry. Our chef lecturers have worked in chef brigades with different systems. One of our chef lecturers came from the army, but others have worked in hotel kitchens with 88 chefs. It means we&apos;re constantly picking up different ways of managing kitchens. We take it in turn to be the head chef. It allows you to practise. If you make a mistake, it&apos;s in a closed environment, you learn from it, it helps your self-development. For me, the academic side hasn&apos;t been easy - trying to write essays and referencing was a challenge, but it made me step up to the plate. Next year, I will have to produce a dissertation. I think you have to have some practical experience in a restaurant kitchen, but you also need some of the academic stuff like a food technology or nutrition course at GCSE or A-level. I think someone who didn&apos;t have the academic background might find it difficult. We all want to go on to positions in kitchens where we are managing people, and I think there is that whole thing that you need to have a degree to get a good job. But some people get sucked into the idea that because you&apos;ve got a degree, you can jump straight into a kitchen as a head chef, which is obviously not true. And as to whether it&apos;s better to do the degree or go to college - you could sit and debate it all day. Sometimes you read about 17-year-olds who have been picked up by Gordon Ramsay, which is a bit annoying. But I think doing a degree allows you to explore a lot of different avenues - you could be a food development chef for Sainsbury&apos;s, you could be a chef for Gordon Ramsay, you could be a chef for a magazine. Whereas if you went from college into a restaurant, you could be there for four or five years and not really move on as a person. I wanted to keep my options quite open, so when I get my degree I can think about where I want to go. After I graduate I&apos;d maybe like to go to London, but Buxton is really starting to develop, and there are a lot of career opportunities here and in the Peak district. But I&apos;ll definitely be going straight into a kitchen, with the goal of one day having my own establishment. I believe we have the best chefs in the world, so I&apos;d like to link it back to Derbyshire and champion local produce and cooking. Dewi Lewis, 21, is studying for a culinary arts HND (level 4), Llandrillo College, north Wales I&apos;ve known I wanted to be a chef since I was about 16. I work in the Chainbridge hotel, in Llangollen, north Wales, at a junior sous level. When I left school I did a BTec national diploma in public service because I thought I wanted to go into the police force, but working part-time in catering changed my mind and when I finished, I went into catering full-time. The culinary arts course is two years long and we cover 16 different units ranging from accounts to world cuisine and rooms division, which looks at subjects throughout the hotel trade. I aim to have my own place one day, so the course is definitely helpful. All the business elements we cover are really relevant. And the course is very practical. One thing I&apos;ve already learned is customer care. At work, if chefs stray into the front of house area and come into contact with the customer, we generally put our heads down and walk past. But now I&apos;ve learned the customer-care aspect of the business, I always acknowledge customers. I think it&apos;s rubbing off on everyone else as well. College is on Monday and Tuesday, and I work in the restaurant Friday to Sunday so I have two days for any work that needs doing. At work it&apos;s non-stop. Generally I get there at about 10.30 - we have a coffee and a quick briefing, prepare ourselves for lunchtime, work lunch until two. Then we&apos;ll get another briefing for the evening, prep for the evening, and at 7 o&apos;clock the restaurant opens. I went back to college because I knew I was committed to a career in the industry, but I didn&apos;t have any formal qualifications for it. It&apos;s not just about the piece of paper - I want to go further and work in higher-standard establishments and keep going forward, hopefully. I did look into doing a degree course. I would probably have had to move away to do it, and I imagine I would have to have done one, if not two, A-levels, so that put me off. Also, I think some people are made for sitting in a classroom and listening to someone talking at them, whereas I don&apos;t really suit that sort of education. If you show me how to do something, I&apos;ll do it, no bother. But if you tell me and write it on the board, I cannot really take in that type of explanation. But the most important factor was that I didn&apos;t want to finish work. Going on to degree level would have meant sacrificing my work commitments. I didn&apos;t want to lose touch with the working world and I thought it would be harder to leave work for three or four y ears and then go back. This way I am still involved. Also I didn&apos;t think a degree would be as hands-on as the HND, and that side benefits me as well. My employers have been quite supportive. They weren&apos;t too happy that I resigned from full-time employment, but were happy to keep me on part-time, which has been great. I pitched it to them that it would benefit them in the long run because I would have this extra knowledge - and that&apos;s been true. I definitely learn things in college that I take into the workplace. Once I finish my course, I&apos;d like to travel, maybe go to work in Dubai for six to 12 months. But, ultimately, I&apos;d like to run my own place in Britain, maybe in north Wales somewhere. I don&apos;t think I&apos;d like to do a hotel, it&apos;s a bit too 24/7, but a small restaurant would be great.", "tags": ["Further education", "Education", "UK news"], "title": "Same dish, different recipes", "sentences": ["Once I finish my course, I&apos;d like to travel, maybe go to work in Dubai for six to 12 months."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jan/16/furthereducation.uk2", "publicationDate": "2007-01-16T23:48:07Z"}, {"article": "&quot;This occasion we invited you to is not a pleasant one,&quot; Uli Hoeness told the press gravely at the beginning of Tuesday&apos;s ad hoc press conference. Bayern Munich&apos;s No1 fan and all-powerful sporting director looked tired and defeated, and had come to declare his capitulation. The lengthy battle with Sebastian Deisler&apos;s demons had finally been lost. The 27-year-old midfielder had actually thought of hanging up his boots for good 10 days ago, barely more than 24 hours into Bayern&apos;s training camp in Dubai. Manager Felix Magath&apos;s ultra-punishing fitness regime is known to have that effect on players, but Deisler really meant it. After five serious knee operations, numerous niggling muscle problems and two bouts of clinical depression, Germany&apos;s fragile wunderkind had lost all confidence in his own body. And he couldn&apos;t see the point of it all anymore. Twice he wanted to leave, twice Hoeness talked him into staying the course. Deisler actually looked lean and energetic in Dubai but on the team&apos;s return to Bavaria he told Hoeness that he simply couldn&apos;t go on any longer. The 55-year-old, who had stopped playing at 27 because of recurrent knee problems, spent the best part of Monday night urging Deisler not to quit. But the decision stood. &quot;All the fun and joy has gone out of my game,&quot; the boy once seen as Germany&apos;s answer to David Beckham told shell-shocked reporters on Tuesday. &quot;I don&apos;t want this torture anymore.&quot; Bayern hope he might change his mind again but that&apos;s unlikely. He seemed too relieved and liberated. Germans have been widely sympathetic but they don&apos;t quite know what to make of it all. Unlike the Brits, we don&apos;t usually do tragic heroes. We like them big, brash and megalomaniac, in the Oliver Kahn/Lothar Matth\u00e4us/Michael Schumacher mould, and above all, they must be winners. Deisler, to be sure, won three championships and three German Cups in four seasons but that seems like scant reward for his extraordinary talent. Ever since he bedazzled the Bundesliga with his fearless, instinctive, attacking game as an 18-year-old at Borussia Moenchengladbach in 1998, he had come to epitomise a brighter future for German football. His rise coincided with the country&apos;s demise on the international stage, and perhaps that was his biggest problem. &quot;My misfortune was being singled out after the [failure of the] 1998 World Cup,&quot; he said in a very reflective interview a few years ago. &quot;The need for great German talents was so strong that all eyes were on me.&quot; Some players thrive in the spotlight, but the youngster found it hard to live up to the unrealistic expectations at his second club, Hertha Berlin. A series of horrific injuries that would have made Evel Knievel proud stifled his development further, yet Bayern were sufficiently convinced to deposit a very indecent \u20ac10m into his bank account as a sign-on fee in the autumn of 2001, a full seven months before he had actually left the capital. Another \u20ac9m was paid to Hertha for his transfer. Before the World Cup in Japan and South Korea, there was even a very earnest debate about the merits of playing fellow new recruit Michael Ballack alongside him in midfield - many experts thought Bayern might not be big enough for either of them. In the end, Deisler missed the World Cup because of his fourth knee operation and he arrived in Munich on crutches, his career in limbo. The Bavarian ballyhoo didn&apos;t help his recovery and Deisler became a brooding recluse. Then depression set in. The club didn&apos;t care much for his entourage of arty friends and advisers but they stood by him and supported him in between numerous short-lived comebacks. He in turn sought strength in Buddhism. Late in 2005, his contract was extended until 2009, then he got injured shortly before the 2006 World Cup. In total, Bayern spent close to \u20ac30m on the prodigy. In return they got a mere 62 league games out of him. In November, he had one last great outing, setting up one brilliant goal after another in Bayern&apos;s 2-1 win away to Hamburg. Deisler wouldn&apos;t be drawn on specifics yesterday, but he admitted that &quot;other factors&quot; (his mental state?) played a role in his decision. Without Bayern&apos;s protection, hitherto unreported speculation about other aspects of his private life might well come to the forefront in the following months. Tellingly, Deisler said he would concentrate on spending time with his young family. The obituaries for his career were tinged with heartfelt regret. Deisler will forever remain Germany&apos;s next superstar, a virtual equal of Zin\u00e9dine Zidane, Raul and Francesco Totti in the minds of his many admirers. He resented the comparisons with David Beckham as much as his silly Basti Fantasti moniker, but in the end he shared a somewhat similar fate with the England midfielder. Like Becks, Basti will be remembered as an unfulfilled promise who got distracted by hype and decided he no longer wanted the daily grind. Both retired from competitive football in the same week but here the symmetry ends. While Beckham is off to Hollywood to pursue a career in showbiz, Deisler seeks a life in the shadows as Germany&apos;s saddest and happiest football pensioner.", "tags": ["European club football", "Football", "Sport"], "title": "Raphael Honigstein laments the retirement from football of German wunderkind Sebastian Diesler", "sentences": ["The 27-year-old midfielder had actually thought of hanging up his boots for good 10 days ago, barely more than 24 hours into Bayern&apos;s training camp in Dubai.", "Deisler actually looked lean and energetic in Dubai but on the team&apos;s return to Bavaria he told Hoeness that he simply couldn&apos;t go on any longer."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jan/17/europeanfootball.sport2", "publicationDate": "2007-01-17T13:09:27Z"}, {"article": "The umpire wore dark glasses and last night&apos;s clothes: black shoes, black trousers and a black shirt, loose at the wrists. Hands in his pockets, he walked alone around the field. Past the whitewashed mango tree situated a few metres inside the boundary rope; past the baobab tree so thick that the wall of the Mombasa Sports Ground was built around it. He greeted a group of spectators and stopped to talk to John Blain, the Scotland opening bowler who was fielding at fine-leg. &quot;The bowlers say the wicket is flat,&quot; the umpire, a tall man with a 54-year-old&apos;s paunch, said a few minutes later. &quot;But then bowlers always say that.&quot; Kenya, who England will face in the World Cup in March, looked a decent side, he offered, especially when batting first, as they were doing today. When they had to chase a total it might be a different matter. A wicket fell. He did not seem to mind that it was the umpire Buddhi Pradhan&apos;s finger, not his own, that sent Maurice Ouma on his way, leg before for 12. Today, if his luggage arrives from Dubai, it will be his turn in the middle. He looked towards the pavilion. &quot;I think I need something cold,&quot; said Darrell Hair. For the first time since the fateful Oval Test in August, when his decision to penalise Pakistan five runs for ball-tampering precipitated the first forfeiture in Test history, Hair was back in the cricketing fold. On Sunday the International Cricket Council announced that he was to officiate in the triangular series between Kenya, Scotland and Canada - a decision that caused widespread surprise. It was only in November, after an inquiry had found no evidence of ball-tampering by Pakistan players, that Hair was informed that the ICC board had &quot;lost confidence&quot; in him, and that he would no longer umpire international matches until his contract finished in March 2008. Of the Test-playing nations, only England, where Hair has lived for the past three years, had supported his retention. In a statement, the ICC said that its decision to appoint Hair for the Kenyan series was not contradictory as the tri-series teams were all &quot;associate&quot; countries rather than full members. It also confirmed that Hair would umpire in the six-team ICC World Cricket League Division One series, which begins in Nairobi later this month and also includes Bermuda, Ireland and the Netherlands. Given the controversy his appointment was likely to cause, the choice of Kenya as the venue for his return was ideal. Far from the eyes of the British and Asian media - well almost - Hair would be able to make his return to umpiring without too much scrutiny. &quot;Long way from home, aren&apos;t you?&quot; he said when a British reporter approached him at his hotel. Being only an &quot;associate&quot; tournament, the hospitality was not quite of the standard that Hair would have been used to. A room at the Royal Court, a city-centre hotel hosting the players and officials, costs just \u00a335 a night. Dinish Antony, the hotel manager, said on Tuesday he was surprised when he heard that Hair would be among his guests. &quot;I thought he was still banned from umpiring,&quot; said Antony, an Indian expatriate. &quot;I am going to send a gift basket to Javagal Srinath&quot; - the former Indian bowler who is match referee for the series - &quot;and maybe I&apos;ll send one to Hair&apos;s room too, with greetings from Pakistan.&quot; If he did, it did not seem to have bothered Hair, who looked delighted to be back among friends. Over breakfast yesterday, his voice carried across the restaurant as he joked with Srinath, Ian Gould, the English umpire, and several Scotland players. He explained that he would not be umpiring that day as scheduled because his suitcase had gone missing on the flight from Dubai to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. And borrowing clothes was not an option. &quot;Mate, I am not umpiring in somebody else&apos;s shoes,&quot; he said. &quot;I have got special inserts in the shoes in my luggage that make me comfortable when standing all day.&quot; Back at the Mombasa Sports Club, a quaint setting that makes most English county grounds look like the MCG, a group of local members were knocking back the vodkas during the lunch break. Azad Kara, a Kenyan who supports Pakistan, wished Hair no ill but said that he should be not be umpiring here. &quot;After what happened in England it is better that he doesn&apos;t ever umpire again. Whatever he does from now on people will doubt him.&quot; On the field, Kenya were proving far too strong for Scotland. In their 50 overs they scored 328 for five, with brothers David and Collins Obuya top-scoring with 73 and 68 respectively. By late afternoon they had bowled Scotland out for 138.

But Viscount Linley chose the venue - he wants to meet at his shop in Albemarle Street, off Bond Street - and when I arrive, he parks us on a sofa at the entrance where, he says, we can watch the customers coming in. Actually there are hardly any customers coming in but maybe that&apos;s what it means to be royal - you&apos;re so used to being on display all the time you don&apos;t even notice if people stare. He is 45, but seems much younger, despite his David Gest hair. He is short and dapper, and wearing those peculiar cavalry boots with straps that only seem to exist in SW1. His accent varies like Tony Blair&apos;s - he occasionally starts shedding consonants and going into bloke mode, which sounds a bit odd coming from someone with a socking great gold signet ring on his pinkie. But at least he&apos;s not snooty. I am impressed by his approachability and openness, though I wish he wouldn&apos;t open his eyes so wide and startled at any question that doesn&apos;t relate to the wonderfulness of Linley products. He has an apparently limitless appetite for enthusing about details of marquetry or dovetail joints. If you want to be schmoozed into buying a \u00a335 wooden paperclip, then Viscount Linley is your man. But that is not why I am here. I am here to talk about his new role as chairman of Christie&apos;s UK (announced just before Christmas), which is surely a huge departure - and possibly a dangerous one - for someone with no experience of the auction world. I assume, since he has asked me to his shop, that he has not yet started the job, but he says oh yes he has and, &apos;It&apos;s an enormous amount of work. It&apos;s a full-time job, nine to five, except yesterday it was eight to 10.&apos; So why is he here, in the shop? &apos;Well, to see you.&apos; Yes, but if he has a full-time job at Christie&apos;s, shouldn&apos;t he be there? &apos;I do both. I&apos;ve run Linley for 25 years and we now have a very excellent team, so my involvement is, and has been for the last five years, largely an overseeing role, a marketing role, a design role and a sales role. What I&apos;ve tried to do here is to make what we do fun and interesting, so that is my philosophy which I will try to emulate at Christie&apos;s. It is about giving good service and excellence in what I feel is entertainment. Because as time gets shorter for people, what is it that they really want? They want a quick answer, and professional service, and that is what I am trying to achieve. So yes, it is an inordinate amount of work and travel, but I enjoy it and, funnily enough, the combination of the two jobs together works very harmoniously.&apos; He plans to travel a lot, which must be bad news for his wife Lady Serena and children, Charlie, six, and Margarita, four. But he says that &apos;the world is international, and I am very keen to promote the new markets of Russia, China, Dubai, as well as going to Hong Kong, Paris and New York for the big sales. Because I feel that that is very much part and parcel of what I should be seen to be doing - to be seen going out and being very much the public figurehead, giving people a focus.&apos; I can see the desirability for Christie&apos;s of being able to wheel out the Queen&apos;s nephew when seeking to impress foreign clients. But what&apos;s in it for him, apart from money? Why does he want to risk his reputation in the murky world of auctioneering? Christie&apos;s and Sotheby&apos;s have only just survived the price-fixing scandal of the late Nineties, and the fallout has been long and damaging. At one stage it looked as though both houses could go under. But when I mention it, Linley expresses amazement - &apos;Do people still remember that?&apos; Well yes, actually. It is only six years since the scandal broke, four years since the American anti-trust trial which ended with 78-year-old Alfred Taubman, chairman of Sotheby&apos;s, going to prison. Nobody from Christie&apos;s went to prison, partly because they agreed to give evidence against Sotheby&apos;s and also because Sir Anthony Tennant, the then chairman of Christie&apos;s, wisely refused to set foot in the USA. (Incidentally, I notice that when Linley is telling me the names of former chairmen of Christie&apos;s - Lord Hindlip, Lord Carrington, Christopher Balfour, etc - he completely forgets to mention Tennant.) But what the price-fixing case and all the articles and books about it mainly revealed was what an absolute snake pit the auction world had become - the &apos;chandelier&apos; bids (when an auctioneer appears to take a bid from someone in the audience but actually no one has made one - he is just raising the price), the secret reserves, the interest-free loans to buyers, the undisclosed price guarantees, the &apos;charity donations&apos; to lure big vendors - and none the less snaky for being conducted by old Etonian charmers in Savile Row suits. Even after the trial, the damage continued when clients who had used Sotheby&apos;s or Christie&apos;s during the price-fixing period sued both houses for compensation. (Without lifting a finger, I was a beneficiary of one of these class actions because I happened to have bought a painting at Christie&apos;s during the relevant period and suddenly received a cheque for, I think, $7.) So yes, people do remember, and it seems either naive or disingenuous of Lord Linley to suggest that they don&apos;t. &apos;It&apos;s amazing how it sticks in people&apos;s memories,&apos; he remarks blithely. &apos;Of course I wasn&apos;t there at the time. I&apos;m a new breed. But hearing about the history of it - it was a very delicate time.&apos; Delicate is putting it mildly. Isn&apos;t it a bit scary becoming chairman of Christie&apos;s? &apos;Yes, but I&apos;ve done scary for so long.&apos; But then he smoothly revises his answer: &apos;To me, it&apos;s less scary, more honour. The privilege and honour of working with distinguished scholars and art historians whom I&apos;ve admired from afar, for years, is enormous.&apos; Can I ask how much he is being paid for this privilege and honour? &apos;You can certainly ask,&apos; Linley grins, &apos;but I&apos;m not going to tell you.&apos; His relationship with Christie&apos;s goes back a long way. When he launched his new furniture company in 1985, Jo Floyd, the then chairman of Christie&apos;s, gave him a launch party and let him exhibit his furniture in the auction house&apos;s great rooms. &apos;So the history goes right back. I&apos;ve always had friends at Christie&apos;s and have continuously gone to their events, board lunches and so forth, because I&apos;m interested.&apos; Two years ago he was made a non-executive director, and last summer Christie&apos;s got their reward when he commissioned them to sell his late mother&apos;s effects. The Princess Margaret sale was a huge success financially, raising \u00a313.6m instead of the estimated \u00a33m (three plastic umbrellas went for \u00a32,000), but it also led to much criticism of Linley. He had previously been criticised for selling Princess Margaret&apos;s Mustique house, Les Jolies Eaux, while she was still alive - she had given it to him early to avoid inheritance tax, but he sold it in 1999 for \u00a31.5m - while also selling pictures of the house to Hello magazine. There were reports that Princess Margaret was &apos;heartbroken&apos;, but he claims he would never have sold it without her approval. This time, when he sold her effects, there were complaints mainly from unnamed &apos;friends&apos; about the personal nature of some of the things he sold - the tiara Princess Margaret wore for her wedding, the Snow White breakfast set from her childhood, the Lalique crucifix given her by the Queen Mother in the last year of her life, and the portrait Annigoni painted of her in 1957. There were also complaints from English Heritage that Linley was stripping fixtures that rightly belonged to Kensington Palace, notably some iron railings that Princess Margaret had installed in the garden. Linley responded by graciously donating the railings to the nation, withdrawing the Lalique crucifix and buying the Annigoni portrait himself (he says it is in his living room now and gives him great pleasure), and promising that he would give some of the proceeds to charity. Even so, the sale led to his new press nickname of &apos;the royal Del Boy&apos;. Was he upset by the bad press surrounding the sale or did he regard it as par for the course? &apos;I hope it&apos;s not par for the course! It was deeply upsetting, the most upsetting of all. But it was bound to cause controversy, and I really felt that I did things for the right reasons and that we were setting our children up in the right way educationally, that we can now afford to send our children to the best possible options. So while I can see the reasons for the articles, I can also stand up and say why I did it.&apos; But there were also stories at the time that his father, Lord Snowdon, was &apos;seething&apos; about the sale and had written to the then chairman of Christie&apos;s asking for certain items to be withdrawn. Was that true? For the first time, Linley looks awkward. &apos;Yes and no. It&apos;s a bit of a difficult subject to be honest, but I think at the end he was comfortable with everything.&apos; And they still speak on the phone every day? &apos;Yes,&apos; Linley says, before adding, almost accusingly, &apos;You know him, don&apos;t you?&apos; &apos;No. I&apos;ve interviewed him. I wouldn&apos;t say I know him. We were briefly colleagues on Vanity Fair, but we never worked together.&apos; Linley looks puzzled - I look puzzled - he obviously believes I know his father, but I can&apos;t think why. Anyway, how is Lord Snowdon, I ask, because when I interviewed him he was beginning to develop late complications from his childhood polio and seemed a bit frail. Linley responds passionately, &apos;Don&apos;t say frail. The one thing he&apos;s not is frail. He&apos;s punchy and exactly like his old self. It&apos;s extraordinary how a physical disability makes people think that somebody is frail. He&apos;s not frail at all - in fact he&apos;s one of the strongest people I know. The other day I went round and he was sitting at the kitchen table and said, &quot;Sit down,&quot; and he picked up a chair, lifted it over his head and put it down on the other side. So he&apos;s not frail. And he&apos;s just been round India, come back from America, given an exhibition and will probably do another one next year.&apos; Fighting fit, then? &apos;Well, fighting fit is absolutely not what he is, but mentally he&apos;s alert, he&apos;s taken some charming pictures of our children. I don&apos;t think his portraits have ever been better.&apos; The received wisdom among royal insiders is that Linley takes after his father; his sister Lady Sarah after their mother. But Linley is keen to stress that both parents were equally influential, &apos;Because they gave me such a great start in life. And it wasn&apos;t what you might think of in terms of education or anything like that; it was very much about being your own self and having the confidence to do that. When people narked my mother and said, &quot;It&apos;s all very well, cabinet-maker [sniff],&quot; she would be right in there, saying, &quot;How dare you try and tell people what they can be?&quot; I chose to be a cabinet-maker, which wasn&apos;t the most natural thing, they thought, but she came to every one of my schools, she came to every one of my exhibitions, she opened my second workshop, she came to all my shows. So there was a lot of what I would call background influence - the courage and conviction which gave me the confidence to do it. Because this business is high risk. We make something like that [he points to a vast dining table filling the front of the shop], but you don&apos;t know whether it will sell. A huge amount of money is tied up in stock. Which is a risk, so you do need family encouragement.&apos; And yet his parents were at odds for much of his childhood. They finally separated in 1976, when he was 14, divorcing two years later. Thereafter, Linley and his sister lived between Kensington Palace with their mother and Launceston Place, Kensington, with their father, and although Launceston Place hardly counts as slumming it, it did mark a change in his lifestyle - as Linley once put it, &apos;Sometimes we were in a big house and sometimes we were in a small house. Sometimes lots of people would be looking after you and sometimes you looked after yourself.&apos; The change seemed to coincide with the birth of his ambition: having shown a talent for woodwork at his public school, Bedales, he went on to train at the John Makepeace School for Craftsmen in Wood at Parnham in Dorset. &apos;I didn&apos;t take a year off - I wanted to learn - and after a year we were all tapping our feet saying, &quot;Come on, gotta go, gotta go, want to get started.&quot;&apos; When he was 20, he and a partner set up their own cabinet-making business in Dorking. &apos;I lived in a one-room flat above a fish and chip shop - I don&apos;t care, but I did. I&apos;m extremely resilient, I don&apos;t really care where I live.&apos; The business was so successful that within three years he&apos;d opened his own Linley furniture shop on the New King&apos;s Road, which later moved to Pimlico Road, and then last year opened his second branch in Albemarle Street. He stopped doing woodwork himself in 1983, though he says he still does it at home. &apos;Two years before I started the shop, I made a decision that I wouldn&apos;t make furniture myself any more, because it limits your potential for growth.&apos; So, at the tender age of 22, he made the hard-headed decision to stop being a craftsman and become a businessman. But even before that, at Bedales, he had shown entrepreneurial ambition, selling chocolate to his schoolmates from a stash under his bed, and was successful enough to buy a motorbike with the profits. He does seem surprisingly money-driven. He once said of his shop that he was &apos;in it for the money&apos;, and added, &apos;I&apos;ve always been short of money. Always.&apos; But why? &apos;Because if you can&apos;t pay your bills, you get a nasty call from the bank! It&apos;s very simple!&apos; Money might also explain his enthusiasm for moving house - 12 times in 13 years. He protests, &apos;I haven&apos;t moved for three years!&apos; But in fact his Chelsea flat was on the market last year. In 1999, he sold his Battersea loft literally days before his wife gave birth to their first child and moved in with Princess Margaret at Kensington Palace. While there, he bought a house in Bayswater and sold it without ever spending a night under its roof. After his mother&apos;s death, he bought their present Chelsea flat, but he talks about it with scant enthusiasm: &apos;It&apos;s my first sensible purchase, in a sense. It has the right number of bedrooms, it has a kitchen, dining room, drawing room, it&apos;s in a mansion block with its own car-parking space, and it&apos;s efficient - you can lock it up and leave. But I like the spirit of being able to bicycle round the house, where you&apos;ve got an industrial space with a concrete floor, and a kitchen and a place to sit, and a telly and a card table - all nice things in one space. So if I&apos;m cooking, which I love to do, people can watch you - which they can&apos;t do if you&apos;ve got a kitchen, dining room, drawing room.&apos; The flat he loved most was the Battersea loft: &apos;It was a joyous space - 69ft living room, and it creaked in a wonderful way in the wind.&apos; So why did he sell it? &apos;It was for an immensely practical good reason. Actually I can&apos;t tell you. Or if I tell you, will you not print it?&apos; No, I tell him, I hate being told things off the record. Was it because, as I read, someone made him an offer he couldn&apos;t refuse, namely \u00a31m more than he paid for the flat? &apos;No,&apos; he says smoothly, &apos;it was because it had 73 stairs, and the idea of taking a pram up was impossible.&apos; Really? So was that what he wanted to tell me off the record? And if so, why? This is what makes me slightly distrustful of Lord Linley - he is so smooth, it is impossible to tell when he is lying. He also seems to think he can rewrite history or un-say things that he has said before. Time after time, I quote things he is supposed to have said in previous interviews, and time after time he denies saying them. For instance, in 2001 he gave a great long interview to the Sunday Times about how miserable he was at his prep school, how &apos;I sobbed for the whole of the first year&apos; and how he was bullied and mocked because he was small, and &apos;It was endless humiliation.&apos; But now he says, &apos;I remember the article, but I didn&apos;t say that. What I said was that the first night I wasn&apos;t prepared for what was going to happen and it was lonely - but no, I didn&apos;t cry every night.&apos; So which is the truth? It doesn&apos;t actually matter, but it slightly enhances the impression that the truth is whatever he wants it to be at the time. The other problem with this interview is that all the time I am trying to ask about Christie&apos;s, he keeps talking about Linley products and trying to interest me in Cumbrian hand-blown glass candlesticks or Russian repro desks or whatever. Whenever he has to dart away to greet a customer or take a phone call, one of his minions starts plying me with brochures and showing me his designs, so that my mild indifference to Linley products turns into real allergy by the end. At one point, Linley indicates a customer coming into the shop and whispers, &apos;When people have their hands behind their back like that, it usually means they&apos;re not going to buy anything. You have to engage with them. It would take me three-quarters of an hour to show him round the shop and that would mean keeping you waiting, so I won&apos;t.&apos; But he says it so wistfully it is obviously a real sacrifice for him - he loves showing people round the shop. He talks about expanding the Linley business and opening six more shops, but how can he do that if he&apos;s also chairman of Christie&apos;s? He walks me down to King Street to see his office there, and it&apos;s a lovely room but completely impersonal - I can&apos;t imagine him sitting there for five minutes, let alone nine to five. Surely it is just not possible to do a full-time job for Christie&apos;s while running and even expanding his own business? &apos;It&apos;s amazing what you can fit into a day. And the more busy you are, the more you do. And I love going out, I love meeting people, and so my day is quite long anyway, but it&apos;s nice to be able to see what you can do. I thought: I&apos;m 45 now - I&apos;ve got a fantastic opportunity now and for the foreseeable future to work bloody hard and make a success of both.&apos; We shall see.", "tags": ["Monarchy", "Life and style"], "title": "Lynn Barber meets Viscount Linley", "sentences": ["But he says that &apos;the world is international, and I am very keen to promote the new markets of Russia, China, Dubai, as well as going to Hong Kong, Paris and New York for the big sales."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/21/monarchy.features", "publicationDate": "2007-01-21T00:05:07Z"}, {"article": "Emirates (0870 243 2222) is to launch flights from Newcastle to Dubai on 1 September, which have \u00a3100 off if you book before 31 March.

In only its second year, with a first prize of &quot;only&quot; \u00a3170,000 and an early slot in the European calendar, the desert contest does not register too highly in terms of European tournament prestige, but after Casey produced a closing seven-under-par 65 to win by one shot it deserves a revised ranking. The Englishman had a point to prove here and, while the Swede Peter Hanson and the Spaniard Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez were both only one shot off his winning 17-under 271 aggregate, it was never really going to be their day. Harrington, who went into the fourth round three shots clear of Casey, slipped at the last hurdle and finished three behind the winner, it was only over the closing holes that the issue was settled and it must have afforded Casey huge satisfaction. Last year after his win in the World Match Play at Wentworth the 29-year-old broke clear at the top of the European order of merit, a position he looked certain to hold through the final event of the season at Valderrama. But Casey&apos;s Volvo Masters campaign was wrecked on the opening day by a virulent attack of Spanish tummy and he spent most of his time in the locker room while Harrington achieved the second-place finish he needed to win the money list and earn the title of Europe&apos;s No1. Casey had the consolation of later being voted Europe&apos;s golfer of the year, but with only the fire of revenge burning in his stomach yesterday he turned the tables on his Irish Ryder Cup colleague with a display he later described as his &quot;finest final round as a professional golfer&quot;. Casey only needed four holes to wipe out the overnight deficit, picking up three birdies as Harrington, playing two groups behind him, opened with five straight pars. When Casey gained another stroke on the 6th he went to the top of the leaderboard and never moved from there. When Harrington dropped out of the running at the 11th when he found a greenside bunker and failed to hole from 20 feet, however, a new threat to Casey emerged in the form of the pony-tailed Jim\u00e9nez. The Spaniard birdied the short 15th to move within one shot of the lead and then drew level when Casey produced the one blemish of his round by three-putting the 18th. He left for the practice range expecting a play-off only for Jim\u00e9nez to fail as the pressure was applied and make a mistake of his own when he mishit a simple approach to the 17th, bogeying that and then failing to make the birdie he need on the last. A relieved Casey said later: &quot;I was annoyed to miss that par-five putt because I had played such a great round of golf and that could have cost me the tournament. But it was fantastic to start the year off with a win. I didn&apos;t play very well in the first round but each day my game just got better and today I felt in total control of the golf ball. In my collegiate days I once shot 60 in the final round to come from eight behind to win a tournament by two at Broadmoor in Seattle.&quot; The victory took Casey into second place in this year&apos;s order of merit where he trails the Korean Yong-eun Yang who was the surprise winner of the Tournament of Champions in China. But Casey now has a great opportunity to quickly move in front. Casey&apos;s immediate European schedule involves playing in Qatar this week followed by a third desert outing in Dubai.

But a giant indoor complex in the heart of East Anglia, complete with specially manufactured snow, is not pleasing everyone. SnOasis, a \u00a3350m project to create a snow dome in Suffolk, would include the world&apos;s largest indoor ski slope and facilities for 14 different winter sports. Opponents say the giant refrigerated building - the height of Nelson&apos;s column - would be an eyesore that would buckle the region&apos;s creaking transport infrastructure and encroach on endangered species. The developers say SnOasis would bring 2,000 new jobs and an \u00a380m economic dividend, improve a derelict brownfield site and develop Britain&apos;s medal winning potential in winter sports. The two sides will give evidence at a six-week public inquiry which begins tomorrow. Godfrey Spanner, managing director of developers Onslow Suffolk, said SnOasis would become a focus for athletes&apos; training and had won the backing of the British skiing team, as well as support from the British Olympic Association and the sports minister, Richard Caborn. The developers hope the bulldozers will be able to move on to the site later this year. SnOasis will also target the leisure market. The hard times being experienced by snow-starved resorts makes the proposition even more timely, he believes. &quot;They are importing 4,000 tonnes of snow at Kitzb\u00fchel in Austria for next week&apos;s world cup downhill and Scotland has almost been wiped out this season from a skiing point of view. People are reluctant to book ahead for foreign ski holidays but we can be available all year round.&quot; SnOasis would cover a 120 hectare (300 acre) site in a former quarry and cement works at Great Blakenham, near Ipswich, and be rivalled only by Ski Dubai, an indoor resort with five ski runs. SnOasis would be larger, with a slope 100 metres high and 500 metres long, an ice rink, bobsleigh and speed skating tracks, and a 16 metre ice climbing wall. Its national winter sports academy would include 100 apartments and a 200 bed hostel, there would be 350 self-catering chalets and a 350-room four star hotel and conference centre. &quot;We have spent over \u00a312m so far and the business plan is robust,&quot; said Mr Spanner, who anticipates 650,000 visitors a year. &quot;There are four snow domes in England but there is nowhere where you can stay for three or four days. It will bring people to the area from all over the country.&quot; Konrad Bartelski, who was one of Britain&apos;s most successful downhill racers, has lent his support and points to the success of Ski Dubai. &quot;It has recreated the experience of going on to a mountain ... kids who have never seen snow have been making snowmen and playing snowballs.&quot; Clive Thomas, chairman of the Suffolk branch of the Institute of Directors, said: &quot;It is a rare opportunity to bring inward investment to Suffolk ... if it does not go ahead it would be a disastrous day for Suffolk.&quot; The idea faces opposition at the inquiry from the SnOasis Community Alliance formed by councils, residents and the Suffolk Preservation Society. John Williams, the alliance&apos;s chairman, said: &quot;There is an overall feeling that Suffolk&apos;s attractiveness to tourists is that it is a place to get away to - not a place for big brash developments more suited to sites adjacent to large highly populated conurbations.&quot; Peter Welham, another campaigner, said the alliance was not against development but thought it was the wrong development in the wrong place. The alliance disputes the description of the site as brownfield - although the entrance sits between a landfill tip and underground fuel tanks for the nearby RAF Wattisham. Nearly a third of the site is arable land, lakes and reclaimed grasslands, home to wildlife and surrounded by a special landscape area. An abandoned chalk tunnel nearby contains one of the largest bat roosts in Britain with up to 12,000 bats, including the endangered pond bat, only once before recorded in Britain. The alliance, which has raised more than \u00a3100,000 to field its own barrister and expert witnesses at the inquiry, is most opposed to having an eyesore towering above the villages of Great Blakenham and Claydon. Members claim the main dome, despite being partially hidden in the former quarry, will stand 73 metres (242ft) above surrounding land, higher than 14 double decker buses stacked up. Alliance member Ken Southall, who has helped fly the SnOasis protest balloon above the site to indicate the height and produced illustrations showing the likely visual intrusion of the structure, said: &quot;It is not nimbyism.

Flanked by a cross-party group of prominent New York politicians, Michael Bloomberg delivered a stark message to the White House that the big apple needs urgent help in stemming a loss of competitiveness both to London and to Asian centres such as Hong Kong and Dubai. A report by the consultancy McKinsey, commissioned by the mayor, says a culture of frivolous litigation and excessive regulation is scaring financial institutions away from New York. America&apos;s tough immigration regime is another barrier, making it difficult for foreign companies to bring skilled staff. The study warns that America&apos;s biggest city could miss out on $15bn to $30bn of revenue from financial services annually by 2011 unless it reforms. &quot;Unless we take corrective steps and soon, we&apos;re going to see America&apos;s leadership in global financial transactions dwindle,&quot; Mr Bloomberg said at City Hall, adding that this would cast a &quot;chill&quot; over New York where one in nine people work in financial services.

Between 2002 and 2005, London&apos;s financial workforce grew by 4.3% to 318,000 while New York&apos;s declined by 0.7% to 328,400 jobs. Over the last four years, the value of the shares, bonds, loans and deposits traded in Britain has risen by 8.4%, while America has only managed a 6.5% increase and London is pulling in an increasing share of hedge funds. All the signs point to an acceleration in this trend. Two-fifths of chief executives surveyed by McKinsey said they thought New York would become less attractive in the next three years, while only a fifth saw the city improving. The majority, meanwhile expects London to become more attractive. America&apos;s controversial Sarbanes- Oxley anti-fraud act is partly blamed. The law, passed in the wake of the collapse of Enron, imposed onerous accounting and reporting standards on companies listed in New York - prompting some to opt for the less arduous regime of London.

New Civil Engineer magazine will report tomorrow that South African construction firms are struggling to find enough local engineers and technicians to cope with the building boom in the nine host cities. The South African government has pledged to try to help previously disadvantaged social groups in the country to profit from the tournament and international firms are being required to hire local workers. However, several engineering consultants told the magazine that they were alarmed at the rates of HIV infection among South Africa&apos;s student population. The disease threatened to kill off a generation of young engineers at a time when they were in great demand, they said, on conditions of anonymously. Around 5.5 million South Africans, one in 11 of the population, are infected with HIV. Organisers of the 2010 World Cup - which will be the first finals held in Africa - claim that the preparations are under control for the tournament, which will bring huge worldwide attention to the country. However, the problems of a construction &quot;skills gap&quot; are compounded by the fact that it is also proving difficult for firms to attract foreign engineers and workers because they cannot offer salaries as high as in places like Dubai or China. New Civil Engineer said many South African construction firms were failing to train and educate their workforce about HIV and Aids or provide good health support. The Global Business Coalition charity said only 15% of firms in South Africa&apos;s building trade had HIV policies in place. Last week, in Johannesburg, the main World Cup venue, the FNG Stadium, was handed over to the South African construction firm which has won the main contract to carry out a huge revamp. The plan is to increase its capacity to 94, 000 and create a roof that covers spectators but leaves the pitch open to the sunlight. In total, as well as infrastructure improvement projects in a number of cities, there are plans for the construction of four stadiums and the upgrading of six others, with construction due to start in the next few months. President Thabo Mbeki has a long history of siding with the HIV denialists, who believe that HIV does not cause Aids.

Woods maintains that his brilliant 2006 run came to an end at Wentworth in September, when he lost to Shaun Micheel in the World Match Play, not a PGA event. On his website Woods has said: &quot;My streak ended when I lost in the first round of the world match play.&quot; But the American tour, which has relaunched itself this year in a desperate attempt to recapture the interest of domestic fans, has an obvious interest in promoting this so-called streak. So, too, has the Florida-based Golf Channel, which bought the rights to the tour in the US for the next 15 years and needs all the viewers it can get - for the first two rounds of the Buick, doubtless it will be showing plenty of Woods, who sat out the first three events this year, and his playing partners John Rollins, another American, and the Australian John Senden. What makes Woods&apos; run such a marketing department dream is the fact that if he wins on Sunday at Torrey Pines, where he is defending the title, he will be four victories short of Byron Nelson&apos;s record of 11 successive PGA victories, set in 1945. And Woods is expected to play the next four PGA &quot;approved&quot; events in Los Angeles, Tucson, Florida and Augusta. Since Woods&apos; defeat by Micheel he has been part of the losing US Ryder Cup team at the K-Club, won a World Golf Championship event in the American Express tournament at the Grove near Watford in October, and announced that he is to become a father later this year. He has also finished second twice, at events in China and in Japan, where he was beaten in a play-off by Ireland&apos;s Padraig Harrington, although it would take a very assiduous statistician with a very large magnifying glass to find reference to these defeats in the pre-tournament coverage of the Buick. &quot;If Tiger extends his streak to seven, he will get some more time to work on his game because his appearance at the Dubai Desert Classic won&apos;t count in terms of the record,&quot; one reporter wrote. But to write off the Dubai tournament as nothing more than a chance for the world No1 to fine-tune his game in time for the next PGA tour event is insulting and ignorant: insulting because the Dubai event has long been acknowledged as one of the most prestigious titles on the calendar; ignorant because it fails to recognise the sport has changed enormously since Nelson set his record. As the Ryder Cup has consistently proved, the US circuit is no longer the be-all-and-end-all of world golf. This rush to manufacture history out of thin air is all the more puzzling because 2007 really could be the year in which Woods rewrites the record books. The unpredictable Phil Mickelson aside, the world No1 is now so far ahead of the other competitors that it is difficult to see where his next defeat is coming from. He won two major championships last year, when he was preoccupied for a long period by the illness and subsequent death of his father, Earl. This season there will hopefully be nothing like that. He arrived in San Diego this week fresh from a skiing break, followed by a few days spent in Florida working with his coach Hank Haney where the search for improvement continued, as ever. Even if none were found it is difficult to see anyone beating Woods at Augusta in the Masters during April. From there it is on to Oakmont, for the US Open - a long, attritional course which might suit Woods, presuming that he can drive the ball straight. That would give Woods a repeat of the feat of 2000-01, when he won four majors in a row, and then comes Carnoustie, which hosts this year&apos;s Open in July - another long and difficult track but Woods has played there before, likes the place and will start as favourite. Of the year&apos;s four major championship sites only Southern Hills, Oklahoma, venue for the PGA in August, would seem to militate against a Woods&apos; triumph. It is short by modern standards, narrow and some of the greens are bordering on the silly. But if he can get there having won the other three, it is entirely plausible that he could win the fourth by sheer force of will. Now that really would be history.

But as I pressed my hand against the MiSense scanner at Heathrow, I reflected that I had been fingerprinted at the US border a couple of times already. That biometric data is being held indefinitely. This record, I was assured, would be destroyed at the end of the MiSense Plus trial. After signing a form that gave the Home Office permission to search the national police computer for evidence of any wrongdoing, my passport was inspected and the photo page copied, my irises scanned (twice, because the first attempt failed) my fingerprints read and my face photographed and digitised. Within a minute, I had a card containing all 13 pieces of biometric data. Apart from the lack of a visible mugshot, it was an ID card in all but name. The first string of numbers and letters began &quot;IDGBR&quot;, followed by an identity number, my date of birth, a number from my passport and my name in machine-readable format. It would be activated as soon as the police computer had cleared me and, were I planning to fly Emirates to Dubai or Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong, would enable me to bypass the immigration queue on my return. Instead of queuing to have their passport inspected by an immigration officer, MiSense passengers insert their card into a gate similar to a tube barrier, and then press their right index finger against a pad. This, Stephen Challis of the British Airports Authority told me, is sophisticated enough to detect a pulse and detect a false latex fingertip or - it has been known - a finger that has been permanently separated from its original owner. That should make forging a fingertip using existing techniques extremely difficult. Producing a fake biometric card is, Huw Farmer of the UK Immigration Service admits, &quot;probably not impossible&quot;. But the biometrics industry is, he says, in a state of &quot;continuous evolution&quot;. &quot;We&apos;re not in the business of creating holey sieves,&quot; adds Challis. But why the need to collect so many biometrics, when the MiSense barriers only require a scan of the right index finger? &quot;We are testing equipment reliability, customer experience and staff operation,&quot; says Challis. &quot;Taking all 13 biometrics at the time of enrolment also paves the way - obviously subject to agreements between governments and participants - for some kind of international inter-operability.&quot; That phrase reveals what makes MiSense much more interesting to airports, airlines and immigration authorities. Offering travellers a faster passage through the airport in return for their biometric details is not new: Schiphol airport, in Amsterdam, has been doing it for years, and charging them an annual fee for the privilege. Right now, MiSense is only available on a couple of regular flights from Terminal 3, and so is of little use to the vast majority of travellers, though it does grant you fast-track immigration clearance at Hong Kong international airport. But the next stage, MiSense AllClear, will pave the way for advance passenger information (API) to be shared between the immigration services before a passenger&apos;s flight takes off. Criminal conviction In theory, this would mean that, say, US border control would be able to access biometric and other data about an individual as soon as he or she checked in at Heathrow and scanned their MiSense card and fingerprint. The same would apply for a foreign passenger checking in to fly to Britain. It is not hard to imagine why governments would be keen on a system that screened would-be visitors before they even stepped foot on the air bridge. It is also worth noting that no one with a criminal conviction, no matter how minor, is issued with a MiSense Plus card. That would certainly appeal to countries like the US, which make a clean record a condition of visa-free entry. Collecting all 13 biometrics also means that if Australia wants iris scans and Canada the left index finger, travelling Britons will be able to meet all the possible demands. MiSense, in other words, is not just a useful testing-ground for the forthcoming ID card and ePassport, or even merely a fast track through Heathrow. It is a foretaste of much more stringent, biometrically-driven border controls which, if they work, will make it far harder for a suspect to borrow another traveller&apos;s passport in order to flee the country. Challis compares the scheme to a &quot;powerful magnet&quot; that enables border control staff to find the needles lurking in the haystack while sweeping away law-abiding, low-risk travellers. If an American Airlines and an Air India flight landed at virtually the same time, for example, US passengers armed with their biometric data would no longer have to tap their feet impatiently while the higher-risk Indian passengers were scrutinised by immigration staff. They could pass through immigration without even having to speak to an officer. The MiSense pilot is not the first biometric trial to have taken place at Heathrow. The airport has already experimented with iris scanners, with mixed results. A Home Office report on the pilot quietly filed in the House of Commons library last December reveals that the biometric rejection rate - the percentage of passengers rejected - was well above the target of less than 2%. At the beginning of the trial, the scanners were failing to recognise more than one traveller in every 20, though the software suppliers contended that some of those people might not be signed up to the scheme and could have tried to use the barrier by mistake.

Pearce has been offered the chance to combine his duties as City manager with taking over from Peter Taylor. Nigel Pearson, the Newcastle United assistant manager, has been identified to work alongside him. City&apos;s directors, however, have reservations about Pearce taking on the extra pressure and workload. The chairman, John Wardle, and chief executive, Alistair Mackintosh, met for three hours last night to discuss it in detail and in principle they do not want to deny Pearce the opportunity, but their preference would be for him to be involved only in summer tournaments rather than during the season. The former England captain confirmed yesterday that he had had preliminary talks with the Football Association about filling the void left by Taylor and he is keen to accept the role. He said: &quot;The bottom line is that I wouldn&apos;t do anything that is detrimental to the job I do for Manchester City. I believe that working with the Under-21s would be a benefit for any manager. You would get to know the best young players in the country and, from playing against the opposition, you would also get to know the best young players in Europe.&quot; Asked whether he believed himself equipped to juggle two roles, Pearce said: &quot;I don&apos;t think the word &apos;juggle&apos; would come into it. If you feel you can take on two responsibilities you should do it.&quot; Pearce is the FA&apos;s preferred candidate ahead of Watford&apos;s Adrian Boothroyd and Bolton&apos;s assistant manager Sammy Lee. Edgar Davids looks likely to leave Tottenham for Ajax after the Dutch club renewed interest in the 33-year-old midfielder. Last summer he turned down his former club but he has barely featured at Spurs this season. He has six months on his contract and is understood to have been offered an 18-month deal by Ajax. Fulham are on the verge of completing a move for the former Chelsea midfielder Alexey Smertin, 31. They have agreed a deal with Dynamo Moscow and hope to confirm his transfer before today&apos;s FA Cup fourth-round tie against Stoke. The Premiership club&apos;s manager, Chris Coleman, said: &quot;Alexey had a few contractual problems in Russia and we got in at the right time. It&apos;s a feather in our cap that he chose to come to Fulham. He can play in central midfield, he can play in the centre of defence. I watched him play at centre-back for Russia against Wales and he&apos;s not the biggest of guys but he reads the game well and it wasn&apos;t a problem.&quot; Dubai International Capital hopes to announce it has lodged a formal bid for David Moores&apos; 51.6% stake in Liverpool after the Merseyside derby next weekend. The club have been pressed by the takeover panel to confirm to the Stock Exchange that another suitor, the American businessman George Gillett Jr, has notified his intention of submitting an alternative offer that will value shares in the club at \u00a35,000 each. DIC is offering about \u00a34,500, valuing the club at \u00a3155m, but remains Moores&apos; preference.

Long gone are the days when neocolonial expats toasted the sunset with a G&amp;T from the leafy verandas of upmarket Jumeirah. These days, young Brits must compete with Arabs, Iranians, Antipodeans and South Africans for the best jobs in a booming economy that&apos;s riding the wave of a five-year petro-dollar boom. Fighting gridlocked traffic and ever-spiralling rents, they slip into decent-paying roles across the spectrum of Dubai&apos;s economy: from the ever-expanding Emirates airlines to the myriad international firms setting up regional headquarters in the city, attracted by the liberal, outdoors lifestyle, easy bureaucracy and great communications links. The emirate&apos;s oil is almost spent, but Dubai&apos;s winning hand has always been a laissez-faire attitude to the trade of goods, services and manpower. The Dubai &quot;model&quot; is largely the work of the city&apos;s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, around whom a cult of personality has grown. But little wonder: in a troubled region, he&apos;s turned what was already a successful trading entrep\u00f4t into a global force. Criticism isn&apos;t tolerated. But there isn&apos;t much, anyway. Only China has more cranes: the region&apos;s surplus oil revenues are trickling down into vast clusters of towers and sprawling, suburban developments, where many expats buy their square acre of desert Eldorado. Think a Barratt Homes development, squared several-fold, stretching out for miles into the desert. All-year sunshine - though offset by the five-month grind of the scorching, humid summer - is tempered by a crime-free existence, shopping aplenty and no income tax. Little wonder the Daily Mail is the only UK newspaper on sale at petrol stations, where 92p-a-gallon prices, plus minimal car taxes, encourage expat families to run their kids to school in tank-sized SUVs. The many cultures rub along fine in the workplace, but come home time most people tend to socialise among their own kind. For Brits, that tends to be drinking, for which they are famed in the city, along with fine dining and, above all, the beach. How is it for you? Guido Omissi, 43, is a teacher who has lived in Dubai for four years. Dubai is life in a desert, in more ways than one. Culturally, one thirsts here - everyone misses the cutting edge of real life back home: the music, comedy, sport and politics. Newspapers and the internet can inform, but they can never involve you in the same way as if you were back home. Dubai is a theme park being constructed around you. Sometimes you are seduced by it, but you are never fully convinced by it, rather like the scenery of early Star Trek episodes. But what of a life without culture? As Woody Allen said, &apos;Sex without love is a hollow, meaningless experience; but as hollow, meaningless experiences go, it&apos;s one of the best.&apos; It could be worse, it could be raining. How to do it Residency visas are secured through an employer who sponsors the application, tying the expat to that job for at least a year; temporary visit visas can be granted for those who wish to move to UAE to find work. For British citizens, visas will not be granted to those whose passport is less than six months old or contains an Israeli stamp. Dubai&apos;s high standard of living is reflected in its prices. Despite the country&apos;s status as a tax haven and the government&apos;s restrictions on rent rises, living in Dubai can be expensive. A two-bed unfurnished apartment on the marina costs more than \u00a31,000 a month to rent. But since last March, foreigners have been able to buy property in Dubai, and this automatically qualifies them for a residency visa. There are several British schools - most popular are the Dubai and Jumeirah English-speaking schools. These adhere to the British education system and they are inspected accordingly; they also command fees of around \u00a34,000 a year.

Instead of requesting flowers for the funeral, Harry Plumbley&apos;s family made an announcement in the Lancashire Telegraph asking mourners to place a bet on the 2.30 race. Most plumped for the favourite, the 11-8 chance Time To Regret, who did the decent thing and bolted up. His son Ross told the local paper: &apos;I haven&apos;t a clue about horses but, before we went to the service at Blackburn Crematorium, I backed Time To Regret for him. Dad was never one for the formalities. He liked a bet and he liked a laugh, so we stuck a form guide and a racing paper in his coffin and waited for a bit of divine inspiration from him.&apos; TRAINER ON THE COLD LIST Commiserations go to the top National Hunt handler who was looking a little pastier than normal at Cheltenham yesterday. The trainer had booked his traditional January sojourn to Barbados but has had to make do with the British winter after failing to locate his passport. ONE IN THE EYE FOR BAILEY Kim Bailey&apos;s move to a new yard close to Cheltenham has coincided with a welcome return to form for the trainer. But a trip with his second - and notably younger - wife Clare for an eye test last week did not work out. &apos;The optician thought Clare was my daughter. You can imagine what I said,&apos; rued Bailey on his website. MPS AND THE BOOKIES It is good know that our MPs cannot be bought. Labour&apos;s Alan Meale last week called for an investigation into the new starting price system which is notably more favourable to bookmakers. Meale&apos;s Conservative colleague John Greenway, joint chair of the All Party Racing and Bloodstock Group, says he is open to suggestions. In the latest register of parliamentary interests both Greenway and Meale admit they are paid between \u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000 as consultants to the Tote, whose fixed-odds division is likely to have benefited from the new SPs. It will be interesting to see if anything is heard from ex-Labour minister George Howarth. He confesses that he continues to be paid \u00a325,000-\u00a330,000 annually by bookmakers William Hill. BOWLES BACK IN TROUBLE Trainer John Bowles was fined \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3658) by the Irish Turf Club last week for being abusive to ex-jockey Lorcan Wyer, now a stewards&apos; secretary, at a Downpatrick meeting last year. The County Westmeath handler is one of racing&apos;s controversial characters. He was warned off for 20 years after being caught running a &apos;ringer&apos; in a Newton Abbot seller in 1978. Two horses were killed in an attempt to hide the coup, with one chopped up and seemingly fed to Bowles&apos; pigs. The trainer was given an 18-month suspended sentence. He was again in court in 1992 when found guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl, but was released after a successful appeal. Bowles was eventually granted a licence to train in Ireland in 1998. AMERICANS TAKE ON DUBAI Rivalry between racing&apos;s superpowers was exposed at last week&apos;s Asian racing conference in Dubai. The Dubai World Cup meeting boasts prize money of more than US$21million, but it emerged that the 2010 Breeders&apos; Cup fixture could be worth $30m.

Sales at the firm&apos;s high-street stores have been falling, but on Friday it unveiled the new strategy with bullish comments about &apos;using massive marketing power to take on established firms such as Lastminute.com and Expedia&apos;. The plans revolve around using the Woolworths website to sell discounted hotels, flights and packages from tour operators, but Woolies&apos; bosses are also talking about using their shops.  &apos;We have 821 locations that we can utilise, some of them very large stores,&apos; said a spokesman. &apos;Travel is a booming market and internet technology is allowing us to get into business areas that traditionally we haven&apos;t been able to get into at a low price.&apos; Opening offers included a three-day city break to New York including flights for \u00a3429, a return flight to Dubai for \u00a3241 and a return to Las Vegas for \u00a3298.

Not the most colourful of characters and with a reputation for grinding out results, the South African is often respected only for his past achievement of winning the US Open in 2001 and again three years later. Yesterday, however, Goosen broke the mould with a spectacular last-hole dash for victory just when the Australian left-hander Nick O&apos;Hern thought a par would be good enough to secure his first victory on the European Tour after eight years of trying and six other second-place finishes. Goosen covered the 587 yards of the 18th at the Doha Golf Club with a booming drive that split the fairway and a three-wood from 280 yards out that ran through the back of the green and left his ball in the first cut of fringe grass. A birdie would have forced a play-off but Goosen measured up and then sank a 50ft putt, across two levels with a tricky five-foot swing from right to left, for an eagle finish to take the \u00a3169,000 winner&apos;s cheque. Now, after slipping to eighth in the world rankings after 12 months without a win in either Europe or the States, Goosen feels he is ready to start mounting a serious challenge for the world&apos;s bigger tournaments. &quot;This has got to give a lot of confidence,&quot; said Goosen later. &quot;It feels such a long time since I have won and some of my golf, even here, has been pretty bad. But that&apos;s golf. Sometimes you don&apos;t play well, but score well and win and now I can build on this. Its been my goal to try to climb back up the world rankings and compete in the majors again this is a good way to start.&quot; For O&apos;Hern defeat at such a late hour did little to destroy the belief on tour that when the pressure is on down the stretch it proves too much for him to handle. Although he won the Australian PGA Championship early in December, the way he played the 18th yesterday, with a one-shot lead standing on the tee, confirmed many suspicions. He missed the fairway and could only hack out of the rough; playing his third from 200 yards out he merely went for the middle of the green instead of attacking the pin in the way that Goosen, a proven winner with 32 titles to his name across the world, did to turn the tide in his favour. And if Goosen feels he is ready to become a major force again, the week in Qatar has also proved something of a watershed for Ernie Els who has struggled to play his best golf again after suffering a serious knee injury in a freak boating accident. Four shots off the lead overnight, Els produced a final round 67 to finish third, two shots off the pace. And there was encouragement too for Northern Ireland&apos;s Graeme McDowell who led the Open at Hoylake after the first round but is best remembered for missing seven successive cuts on his first foray on to the US Tour in 2006. After shooting a one-over-par 73 in the opening round he turned in cards of 68, 68 and 67 to climb into joint fourth place.", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport", "United Arab Emirates"], "title": "Golf: Goosen takes Qatar Masters", "sentences": ["For the best part of four days the sight of Retief Goosen&apos;s name hardly did any favours for the promoters trying to convince the outside world that the Qatar Masters should stand alongside next week&apos;s Desert Classic in Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jan/29/golf.gdnsport3", "publicationDate": "2007-01-29T02:36:54Z"}, {"article": "St Helens have suffered a major injury scare one week before they launch their Super League title defence.

Wellens will have X-rays today but initial fears that he had broken his ankle have receded. &quot;We don&apos;t think it is as bad as first feared,&quot; said the St Helens chairman, Eamonn McManus. &quot;It looked bad, especially with the way he reacted but I was with him in the dressing room and he had full movement.&quot; Wellens is thought unlikely to play in Sunday night&apos;s Super League season opener at Huddersfield, leaving him with three weeks to recover for the Carnegie World Club Challenge against Brisbane Broncos on February 23. Saints were already resigned to starting the season without their club captain, Paul Sculthorpe, who is still recovering from his second knee operation in as many years, and Saturday&apos;s friendly threw up another worry as their New Zealand centre Willie Talau was sent off in the 26th minute for punching. He will face a Rugby Football League disciplinary hearing tomorrow night, when any suspension would also rule him out of the Huddersfield game. However, Jason Hooper, the Australian loose forward who missed the Leigh game after returning home early from St Helens&apos; pre-season training camp in Dubai in order to have scans on a shoulder injury, is expected to return to the side at the Galpharm Stadium. The Rugby Football League is thought to have identified John Lang as a potential Australian alternative to Shaun McRae as the next Great Britain coach. McRae, the former St Helens and Hull coach who recently resigned as the director of rugby at South Sydney, has been the strong favourite to succeed Brian Noble since the RFL announced that the job will become full-time until the 2008 World Cup. But Lang, a former Kangaroo hooker who coached the Australian Super League representative team in their 1997 series against Great Britain, is also available after losing his job with the Penrith Panthers, who he led to victory in the National Rugby League grand final in 2003 and is known to be highly-rated by key figures at the RFL and leading Super League clubs. Leigh were this weekend mourning the loss of two of the greatest players in the club&apos;s history.

You might think the BBC&apos;s newly-installed - and first ever - sports news editor would have had his fill of media institutions in the throes of seismic change, after recent tumultuous months at the Daily Telegraph, where he was a columnist, but not a bit of it. Indeed, he laughs at the suggestion that by joining the corporation at a time of radical restructuring, staff bloodletting, and now a licence fee settlement which the director general says has opened up a \u00a32bn funding gap, he has jumped out of a sizzling frying pan and into an inferno. &quot;I&apos;ve only been here three weeks, so it&apos;s hard to judge, but I don&apos;t feel morale is low here, I don&apos;t sense that at all.&quot; Maybe not, but I wonder whether Bose, who spent 12 years at the Telegraph writing the highly-regarded investigative column, Inside Sport, as well as contributing to the rest of the paper, feels a twinge of guilt about arriving at the BBC at a senior editorial - and doubtless well-remunerated - level, in a specially-created post, at a time when many other staffers are flying out the other side of the revolving door? &quot;No, I wouldn&apos;t say guilt,&quot; he replies carefully, &quot;I mean, obviously to appoint me there was a management decision that they wanted somebody from the outside to come in. And that decision was taken before the licence fee [settlement]. I don&apos;t think you can feel guilt about this, but you are obviously aware of the changes and that it could have an impact on how the BBC progresses and how you do your work.&quot; We are sitting in one of those glass meeting rooms - all &quot;soft seating&quot; and primary colours - so beloved by those who gave TV Centre its last makeover. Bose, who is 60, had his first taste of journalism when he worked as a freelance cricket reporter for the London radio station LBC, in the mid- 1970s. &quot;Initially, [LBC] found my name very difficult to pronounce on air and my first broadcasts were under the name of Richard Rose,&quot; he recalls with a smile. &quot;In those days, there were hardly any darkhued people in broadcasting here. Later, I used to go to football matches and I&apos;d be the only brown face.&quot; Did he agree with former director general Greg Dyke, who famously once declared that the BBC was &quot;hideously white&quot;? Aware that he is on highly sensitive terrain - indeed the press officer sitting with us appears to stop breathing momentarily - he replies with a slight sigh: &quot;I haven&apos;t seen enough of the BBC to be able to say that.&quot; Then he departs from the script: &quot;But this is a white-majority country, so I don&apos;t see why there shouldn&apos;t be a majority of white people [at the BBC]. I think it&apos;s a question of whether you are good enough or not. I would hate to think I got my job because of my sun-tan.&quot; While there is no suggestion that Bose got the job for any other reason than simply being the best man for it, it does seem fair to ask why he thinks the BBC suddenly felt it needed a sports news editor at all, having rubbed along perfectly well without one all these years? &quot;I think the BBC recognises that sports coverage has changed,&quot; he replies. &quot;They haven&apos;t covered sports news in the way newspapers have been covering it - in the way I&apos;ve been doing it myself for a long time.&quot; Interest in sport - events in the boardrooms and shadowy backrooms, as much as those on the field of play - Bose argues, is ever-growing and he will be expected to generate original journalism, as well as provide &quot;analysis and context&quot; across the range of news outlets, in his new role. &quot;When I was a kid the only live televised match was the FA Cup final and although I could name the Tottenham double team, I didn&apos;t know who the chairman was, nor did I care to. Today, the board meeting at Liverpool [about Dubai International Capital&apos;s takeover bid for Liverpool FC] is news. Fans follow their sport intimately. &quot;I think the BBC have been covering the &apos;diary&apos; events very well, but I don&apos;t think they ...&quot; he stops, careful not to criticise his new colleagues by implication. &quot;They have done [&apos;off -diary&apos; sport stories and investigations] on Panorama but I don&apos;t think they&apos;ve done them on a regular basis. There are many &apos;diary&apos; stories to be reported and [news bosses] probably wanted somebody to come in as a bit of a pundit and leader of the team, in some ways, and take an overview.&quot; It is interesting that once again - just as in the case of Bose&apos;s friend and former colleague, Jeff Randall, who was appointed the BBC&apos;s first business editor, as well as Randall&apos;s successor, former Sunday Telegraph City editor, Robert Peston - the corporation has turned to the cream of newspaper talent to fi ll a high-profile editorial post. Bose, who has been a regular on the airwaves for more than 30 years and has a natural broadcasting manner, acknowledges that the journalistic culture in newspapers, which allows hacks to nurture contacts and unpick stories in a way that the demands of broadcasting in the era of 24-hour news often do not, may give newspapermen the edge. &quot;[At the Telegraph] I could say &apos;right, this story is the one I&apos;m going to focus on this week&apos;,&quot; he explains. &quot;Newspapers build up to a crescendo round first edition time. Once that is put to bed, you can go to the pub. The BBC isn&apos;t quite like that. There are so many outlets, you can start on the Today programme or 5 Live Breakfast and finish off at midnight and still be doing the same story. And you wouldn&apos;t have time to really go out and find out about the story beyond what is on the wires. The idea is for me to break away from the [news] agency culture. I&apos;ve been told my job is to keep up my contacts and develop stories. It would be a failure if I was doing everyday run-of-the-mill stories.&quot; Bose&apos;s reputation as an investigative reporter means that he will be under pressure to deliver occasional scoops. The 2012 London Olympics, the shortcomings of sport&apos;s governing bodies, foreign ownership of football clubs, as well as that hardy perennial, corruption in the transfer market, will all, he agrees, be fertile territory. However, that type of journalism earns a reporter enemies fast and can cause serious problems for colleagues too. There is no better example of this than Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s steadfast refusal to speak to any BBC journalist since a 2004 BBC3 documentary made allegations about his son Jason&apos;s involvement in transfer deals. Bose claims he is prepared to be unpopular both inside and outside the corporation. &quot;That is the risk the BBC is taking.&quot; But is it a risk worth taking? &quot;Depends how good the stories are,&quot; he laughs. &quot;I was asked this question at my interview. My answer was it lives or dies by the story. The fact BBC Sport&apos;s access may or may not be denied [as a result] is another matter. I will have to try and convince [colleagues] &apos;Listen, this is a good story&apos;.&quot; He quickly inserts a caveat: &quot;I&apos;m not claiming I&apos;m going to break any stories, by the way - that&apos;s something you can&apos;t predict at any time.&quot; If his prolific book-writing is anything to go by - he has written 21 tomes on a range of subjects - the sports community had better beware. One trend on which he will probably be keeping a hawkish eye is the ever-increasing control-freakery displayed by the big football clubs, particularly with regard to the media. Bose&apos;s most celebrated recent book, Manchester DisUnited, examined the business underbelly of the club. He says: &quot;What is already happening is that the clubs now want to control their product and the flow of information. For example, when there&apos;s a big transfer story, they make sure it&apos;s broken fi rst on their website. And the more successful the club, the more they can dictate the terms of trade. That is worrying and we might well see a clash on that front soon.&quot; Born and educated in India, Bose first came to the UK to study engineering at Loughborough University, but left after just one year. Instead, he retrained as a chartered accountant. Under pressure from his family, he returned to India, but his appetite for journalism had already been whetted at LBC. After deciding that he &quot;couldn&apos;t abide accountancy&quot;, he returned to Britain and began freelancing for the business press and the Sunday Times, for whom he had worked as a stringer while in India. By 1989, he was a features writer and sports columnist on the paper, before being lured to the Daily Telegraph to launch Inside Sport. When asked about the recent upheaval at the Telegraph - which included the paper moving from Canary Wharf to Victoria, job cuts and a revolution in working practices - he is surprisingly forthcoming. &quot;The big change fronted by [editor] Will Lewis is the desire to go into podcasting and multi-media. I can understand what is driving it. All newspapers sales are going down and it&apos;s thought that this is how to get a new audience. &quot;But the problem is, when you are doing a story, you are asked suddenly to break away from what you are writing to do a podcast or a click-and-carry story. To get journalists who are used to doing one story [at a time] to multitask is quite a difficult exercise. And also it may be counter-productive for the sort of story I do, because you want to devote yourself to three or four hours of solid talking on the phone or meeting somebody to get a story, so to have to break away and do a separate 400-word piece for the online version is not that easy. &quot;I left the Telegraph on very good terms and have lots of friends there. But I&apos;m not entirely convinced that newspapers can so transform themselves into online versions of themselves. I&apos;m not sure it can be done. As far as I&apos;m concerned, the jury is still out.&quot; Curriculum Vitae  Age 60 Education St Xavier&apos;s School, Bombay and St. Xavier&apos;s College, Bombay University, Loughborough University Career 1974  qualifies as a chartered accountant 1974-78  freelance for LBC, then stringer in India for Sunday Times and Spectator 1978-89 editor, Pensions Magazine and business freelance 1989- 95 feature writer, Sunday Times, editor of Inside Track column 1995-2007  Daily Telegraph, starts Inside Sport column 2007 BBC News, sports news editor", "tags": ["Media", "Sport"], "title": "Interview: Mihir Bose", "sentences": ["Today, the board meeting at Liverpool [about Dubai International Capital&apos;s takeover bid for Liverpool FC] is news."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/29/mondaymediasection.sport", "publicationDate": "2007-01-29T10:37:05Z"}, {"article": "Est\u00e9e Lauder would have loved the German winter break. &quot;I&apos;m not selling beauty products, I&apos;m selling hope&quot;, the make-up pioneer once famously admitted, and the fact that the Bundesliga intermission works in a very similar fashion would not have been lost on her. The players have their tired muscles kneaded and can work on their complexion in sunnier climes, clubs have a chance to make cosmetic changes to their squads and, lamentably, the punters all go into New Labour optimistic mode: &quot;Thiiiinngs can only get better&quot;. Surely. Bayern fans, in particular, have allowed themselves to d:ream a little in the last few weeks. Sebastian Deisler&apos;s shock resignation aside, the Dubai training camp was reportedly a resounding success. Manager Felix Magath, a charming and intelligent man with the press but as grumpy and occlusive with his players as his coaching mentor, the late Ernst Happel, had been, was at last persuaded to open up a little. Bastian Schweinsteiger, the one and only creative force in the side, looked sharp and in the mood again. And Daniel van Buyten told wondrous tales about many happy hours on the training pitch with his defensive colleague Lucio. &quot;We worked on our coordination&quot;, the seventh (approximately) most famous Belgian explained. For anyone who had seen Lucio this season, that came as incredible news. The Brazilian, nicknamed &quot;The Horse&quot; in his home country, has been in a stupor for months, seemingly saddled with a different and deeply strange interpretation of what he is supposed to be doing. Getting him in line again would at least solve some of the champions&apos; problems. Back from Dubai, the Bavarians traveled on Friday night to Dortmund&apos;s gloriously named Signal Iduna Park full of optimism. Borussia had installed J\u00fcrgen R\u00f6ber as manager after the sacking of Bert van Marwijk but the ex-Bayern player is little more than a glorified caretaker. His job is to keep the seat warm for Thomas von Heesen, who is likely to take over the reins in the summer. R\u00f6ber is no tactical genius but he&apos;s an animated fellow who galvanised his players enough to turn in an honest, fighting performance. A  comedy of errors in both boxes lead to Bayern taking a barely deserved 2-1 lead into the break before Dortmund took full advantage of criminally bad positioning, and general apathy. Tinga duly put the home side 3-2 up. The real horror, however, was to come. Bayern didn&apos;t continue where they had left off before the winter break, they were actually worse. For over half an hour, they were so bereft of even a hint of a useful idea that they started hoofing the ball as if they wanted to hit a giant bingo bell high above the centren circle. Borussia keeper Roman Weidenfeller, who harbours not-so-secret desires for Jens Lehmann&apos;s cucumber green Arsenal shirt, did not have a single save to make. Pathetically, Van Buyten blamed the noise of 80,000 fans for the lack of communication at the back. Perhaps Bayern&apos;s telephone sponsors can issue them with headsets in the future. Willy Sagnol owned up to his own faulty marking and Mark van Bommel, who had failed to avenge van Marwijk, his sacked father-in-law, spoke of &quot;tactical errors&quot; and too many gaps in the middle. Magath simply seemed shocked by the whole ordeal. Bayern&apos;s fifth defeat of the season leaves them six points behind the joint leaders, Bremen and Schalke, who both won convincingly. But what worries their supporters is that the abject ordinariness of their squad was once again exposed. Even after Deisler&apos;s retirement, the board has stubbornly refused to give this anemic team a desperately needed transfusion of new blood. They remain, at least publicly, convinced that the current crop is good enough to win a third title in a row. Why, nobody knows. Money is not an issue. Bayern have about \u0080130m in the bank but only zeroes on the bench. There was a time, not long ago, when Bayern players would tell you with a straight face that the training matches between their first and second teams were more demanding than the average Bundesliga game. Their rivals would take one cursory look at Munich&apos;s star-studded squad and be frightened into submission even before kick-off. But over the last two or three years, Bayern have taken their eye off the ball. Their scouting system is actually much better than its reputation, the problem was that the board rarely acted on their recommendations. General manager Uli Hoeness is very risk-averse and strangely parsimonious in the transfer-market. Attempts to sign big names like Deco or Franck Ribery have been half-hearted. Hampered further by the Bundesliga&apos;s lack of allure they have instead preferred to pick up the best of the domestic talent and the odd South American from the bargain basket. Titles won by the individual brilliance of men like Michael Ballack, Ze Roberto and Roy Makaay masked the fact that collectively, they have been regressing. The departure of Ballack, Ze Roberto and Deisler, combined with Mehmet Scholl&apos;s ever decreasing involvement, have now exposed the dearth of real class in the middle of the park. Magath hopes that the imminent return of Owen Hargreaves, who should feature in Tuesday&apos;s home-match against Bochum, will help matters. The Englishman can certainly make Bayern look a tad more attractive but Bayern will need much more than cosmetic improvement and a bit of hope. A completely new squad will have to be built for next season, possibly with a new manager in charge. Meanwhile, direct qualification for the Champions League seems a more realistic aim than the defence of their title, so this seasons will have to be written off as a &quot;transitional phase&quot; - an always convenient word for failure. &quot;Sometimes it&apos;s quite good if you&apos;re forced to make drastic changes&quot;, mused Hoeness, who is belatedly seeing the errors of his ways. For Bayern, things look like gettign worse before they get better.

Ferguson believes Madrid are employing a drip-drip approach and he and his assistant, Carlos Queiroz, have both spoken in private to Ronaldo since he returned from a five-day break to Dubai last Friday. They received assurances that he wanted to remain at the club and emphasised how important he was to their future. Ferguson, who has predicted Ronaldo will soon be recognised as &quot;the greatest player in the world&quot;, is understandably anxious because of the Portugal international&apos;s stated desire last summer to move to Spain. At the time it was put down to his reaction to being demonised for his part in Wayne Rooney&apos;s sending off in the World Cup. Ferguson, however, is aware that the 21-year-old had actually instructed his advisers to explore the possibilities of moving to Real Madrid or Barcelona even before the World Cup started. It needed all of Ferguson&apos;s powers of persuasion to talk him round and since then there have been no signs of Ronaldo pining for a move. On the contrary, he has been United&apos;s best player for large parts of the season, winning the Premiership&apos;s player of the month award in November and December, and is a serious contender to be named player of the season. Ferguson is determined to keep him happy - &quot;we only sell players we want to sell,&quot; says the United manager - but he is realistic enough to know that the lure of Madrid would be difficult for Ronaldo to turn down if a serious offer came in. In the meantime he has instructed his player to avoid saying anything in the media that could fuel stories of a potential transfer saga at the end of the season. &quot;I know of the interest of Real Madrid, but I cannot say anything,&quot; was all that Ronaldo would say yesterday. &quot;I have spoken about this with Carlos Queiroz and Alex Ferguson and they have forbidden me to talk about Real Madrid.

It has been a bad one so far. Even as I was stood at the bus stop, almost alone on the empty streets and contemplating how bad the first cigarette tastes when you&apos;ve only had two hours of sleep, it seemed like an unusually bad one. It got worse when a drunk guy across the road switched his attention, and anger, from a nearby lampost towards me. Lurching across the street cackling maniacally, in between bursts of an ugly rendition of Deeply Dippy, Right Said Fred&apos;s follow-up hit to I&apos;m too sexy, he came right up close to me and vomited, profusely, all over his own shoes.  I would have sulked but the bus came. Anyway, I thought, it&apos;s probably not worse than waking up in Australia and remembering that you are part of this English cricket team.  If anyone out there can tell me a worse start to their day than the ones that Paul Collingwood (five matches, 66 runs at 13 in this series) and Andrew Strauss (five matches, 98 runs at 18) have probably had today, in contemplation of another likely drubbing, another low score, another drubbing from the press, do let me know.  Kicking us off in that regard is Ros Bromwich,  who woke up and faced this advert in her daily paper, The Melbourne Age: &quot;GOOD to see this new home-improvement product in great demand in Australia. No plans for it to be released on English markets, however.&quot; The pic underneath is of a tin of paint with the brand name &apos;Pontings White Wash&apos; and a team shot. Oh, how we laughed.&quot;. Frazer Henderson has clearly been dealing with his own early mornig blues by staring excessively at the back of his cereal packet, where he found this &apos;insight&apos; into that famous ocker mentality: &quot;When shopping for food here in Cambodia, it&apos;s often cheaper to &apos;go Australian&apos; than to buy British. Now, while Vegemite is clearly no match for Marmite, I have found that Weet-Bix is a perfectly acceptable alternative to Wheatabix, and what&apos;s more, its packaging offers a clear insight into the Australian psyche and what our (ahem!) brave boys have been facing during the current (ahem!) campaign, and this is why; the packaging for Weet-Bix contains no less than 17 references to Australia in various forms, from the mundane to the hilariously nationalistic, and I quote: &quot;Made by Aussies. Loved by Aussies.&quot; &quot;Australian Recycled Cartonboard - Even better the second time around&quot; &quot;Weet-Bix proudly supports the Australian Institute of Sport and Cricket Australia&quot; &quot;Ausbuy, Australian made &amp; owned&quot;.&quot; I particularly love the recycled cartonboard one, Frazer. Don&apos;t let it get you down.  Well, there is absolutely no sign of any cricket on the TV, so we may well be offerring the first live Guardian commentary on free-style half-pipe at the X Games, as currently being shown on Channel Five. In fact, the story of Tanner Halls&apos; remarkable Gold will probably turn out to be more interesting than watching England get hammered again.  But I&apos;m here to write about the cricket dammit so here is some team news: England will miss Jimmy Anderson and Jon Lewis again. Apparently Saj &apos;99-for&apos; Mahmood has been looking &quot;spicy&quot; in the nets, so maybe we&apos;ll see him in for that hapless duffer Liam Plunkett. Maybe too, Chris Tremlett will take his first wicket of the series in what would be his third game. Michael Vaughan will have a late fitness Test.  New Zealand recall James Franklin and Bond, Shane Bond. He has hardly played against England, so wefans and writers tend not to have sufficient understanding of just how good a bowler he is. One of the best in the world in fact: try these statistics for size: 54 on-day internationals, 101 wickets at 19 runs each.  While we&apos;re dealing with a little news Tom Moody will surely be the next England coach (as Adrian Hill writes: &quot;Pommies, get your hands off Tom Moody. I know how much you want him, but he&apos;s an Aussie and he&apos;s too good for the likes of you.&quot;). I certainly hope he gets the job, and his refusal to go for the Australian role seems to bode well given that his contract is up after the World Cup.  Oh bugger they&apos;ve started. 1st over: New Zealand 5-0 (Vincent 2 Fleming 0) So New Zealand have won the toss and opted to bat. One wide and two leg byes come from Plunkett&apos;s first over, to which Vincent also adds two with the bat. 2nd over: New Zealand 15-0 (Vincent 2 Fleming 1) And from the other end Chris Tremlett. I can&apos;t believe Sky blindsided me like that! Imagine not having a single minute of pre-match build up! I mean, at least I waffled about some rubbish before I started this. Another wide and a no-ball, five extras in eight balls then. Add a misfield by Dalrymple to make a single into two, a flicked four to leg by Fleming and that was an awful over. By the by here is England&apos;s team: EC Joyce, MB Loye, IR Bell, AJ Strauss, PD Collingwood, A Flintoff, JWM Dalrymple, PA Nixon, LE Plunkett, CT Tremlett, MS Panesar. Depressingly familiar, no? 3rd over: New Zealand 22-0 (Vincent 8 Fleming 7) Plunkett gives up yet another wide. Tom Goodfellow cuts to the heart of the matter: &quot;I have to differ with Frazer Henderson - WeetBix is a vile approximation of the vastly superior British product. A minor point, but living in Sydney, I have to take whatever minor cultural victories I can this summer.&quot; Either way, Vincent looks as though he has had his, with a fine clipped four that speeds to the square leg boundary. Plunkett follows it up with another fine wide. Really menacing the crease here, Plunkett.  4th over: New Zealand 23-0 (Vincent 8 Fleming 7) And here is the rest of the New Zealand side: BB McCullum, RL Taylor, JDP Oram, PG Fulton, CD McMillan, DL Vettori, JS Patel, SE Bond, JEC Franklin. Like Plunkett, Tremlett has a deceptive ability to throw in a jaffa amongst all the dross: one here steeples up from back of a length, and has Vincent in some trouble. And then he follows it up with another appalling wide. Really shoddy stuff: what the hell is Kevin Shine doing with his time? I mean, in case you didn&apos;t know, Somerset just released two more of his young proteges there because they realised that they (Simon Francis and Michael Parsons) were bobbins.  WICKET! Fleming 15 lbw Plunkett: 5th over: New Zealand 32-1 (Vincent 8 Fulton 0) Fleming brutalises two short balls from Plunkett away for four, nearly taking out the square leg umpire. Short on leg stump? Lethal stuff from Plunkett. For the umpire. Lethal. Just to make me eat my words, he then produces one of those rare good balls, pitching on middle, straightening back towards leg and trapping Fleming lbw. Kendall Warren adds &quot;I note that England&apos;s three pool World Cup matches are against NZ, Canada and Kenya, so you should be confident about picking up at least one win there.&quot; Really? Um, where? Did you see what Kenya did to Bermuda today? 6th over: New Zealand 34-1 (Vincent 8 Fulton 0) The cereal debate rages on with all the fire of Chris Tremlett&apos;s bowling: &quot;I cannot believe what I have just read.....you have to be joking! Weetbix as an acceptable alternative to Weetabix! Jack Russell and I are in complete agreement....no comparison!&quot; fumes Melanie Whitaker. Never eaten the stuff Mel, surely it is exactly the same? Or do they put possum in it or something? Two off the over. 7th over: New Zealand 41-1 (Vincent 8 Fulton 4) Ian Bell makes a brilliant piece of fielding at cover, tries to throw out the stumps at the non-strikers end and wangs the ball away for four overthrows. Shocker.  8th over: New Zealand 47-1 (Vincent 12 Fulton 9) All sorts of Aussie turncoats are coming out of the woodwork and admitting they prefer marmite to vegemite, and Wheetabix to Weetbix. Well, ok, two people have. There is also the obligatory Australian menatlist sending me emails about Nazis - I do not need that, leave your keyboard alone and get back to work with the plastic scissors you loon. WICKET! Fulton 15 c Nixon b Plunkett: 9th over: New Zealand 54-2 (Vincent 12 Taylor 0) So, New Zealand&apos;s fifty comes up with a neat little leg glance by Fulton. His following chip to mid-on is a poor shot though, and flies up in the air and over Flintoff&apos;s head. Freddy dives back to make the catch but misses by his fingertips. Plunkett gets his man with the next ball: fuller in length, it takes the outside edge as Fulton attempts to push it through mid-wicket. Nixon pouched a simple catch.  10th over: New Zealand 58-2 (Vincent 12 Taylor 1) Well, who knew that the Weet-bix thing would prove so riveting: ... and if you get bored of reading about how good the Aussies are from just the packet - you can cement their superiority on the Weetbix website with their new Pom-bashing game, and &quot;help Brett smash the English&quot;. Thanks to Richard Puncheon for that. Tremlett coughs up more wides.  11th over: New Zealand 66-2 (Vincent 12 Taylor 1) Plunkett is so infuriatingly erratic. He mixes unplayable full balls that swing away with a wide that lands well out of the crease lines, a leg-stump gimme, and another wide one that is slashed over slip and away to the rope at third man. 12th over: New Zealand 71-2 (Vincent 17 Taylor 9) Flintoff comes into the attack, and he too is glanced away to fine leg for four. Ross Taylor looks a really good player, for a 22-year-old, has anyone seen much of him in the domestic game?  13th over: New Zealand 74-2 (Vincent 17 Taylor 13) And now, as Bumble eloquently points out, &quot;it is Monty time&quot;. And he finds considerable turn with his third ball, his fourth turns even more, too much, and he gets cut for two. Plenty of bounce and turn though, which isn&apos;t something I expected.  14th over: New Zealand 78-2 (Vincent 17 Taylor 17) Good be an interesting day for the spinners, what with the pitch turning and both sides playing two slow bowlers. It may well come down to which side can best survive some slow middle overs when the two spinners are bowling in tandem. In the meantime, Taylor pulls Flintoff away for four through wide mid-wicket.  15th over: New Zealand 84-2 (Vincent 23 Taylor 17) Many thanks to Frank Stark for this: &quot;Ross Taylor has been playing at least two seasons of full time domestic cricket. Unlike Australia we can&apos;t afford to leave them too long to bottle age so he&apos;s up and at &apos;em at 22. He&apos;ll be in the next test team - whenever the bloody IRB allow us to play one. Not the first Samoan-NZer to play, though, That was the elegantly named Murphy Su&apos;a.&quot;  16th over: New Zealand 90-2 (Vincent 23 Taylor 23) Scarcely attracting less comment than the Weetbix debate is the fact that loads of you are saying that the title of this page is wrong, as it refers to Australia. If you really want it fixed, someone tell me exactly which page you&apos;re on about, because I see nothing wrong. The rest of you, sorry about being so bloody mundane. I see nothing wrong either with a tightly clipped four through mid-on by Taylor, who seems to be enjoying facing up to Freddie.  17th over: New Zealand 90-2 (Vincent 23 Taylor 23) What chance of Monty going on the attack? Freddie has a slip in and a short extra-cover, and a nice inviting gap at mid-wicket. &quot;On the whole weet-a-bix thing...if only the difference were the spelling! the weetbix in Australia is so bad that I have to get visiting friends &amp; relies to smuggle in the good stuff whenever they come to visit. I think they may be making the weetbix itself from the Australian Recycled Cartonboard&quot; screams Sally Bond.  18th over: New Zealand 95-2 (Vincent 24 Taylor 24) Kendall Warren fights back for Aus: &quot;There is no comparison - Marmite is runny sump oil, and while Weetabix is only bearable, what&apos;s the story with those rounded edges? Is it so people don&apos;t cut themselves?&quot;. New Zealand sneak a quick single, and Andrew Strauss attempts a Jonty Rhodes-esque underarm diving run-out, but Taylor makes his ground by a foot or so. Another narrow escape follows, and these two are really pushing the singles. Brilliantly, Monty then hits the stumps with an overarm throw, buty alas he gets no reward for it.  19th over: New Zealand 99-2 (Vincent 24 Taylor 28) Taylor drives a really handsome four through long-on. If anyone doesn&apos;t know what Jonty Rhodes-esque means have a look at this.  20th over: New Zealand107-2 (Vincent 33 Taylor 32) Great shot by Vincent, a lofted drive through mid-wicket. Flintoff follows up with a mean cutter that leads to a good lbw shout, sadly it is rejected as too high. Vincent finds an incredible response, with a flat bat baseball shot that runs straight for four. He miscues the next ball but Bell drops him. 21st over: New Zealand107-2 (Vincent 33 Taylor 32) Paul Nixon is shouting so loudly that Sky turn the stump microphones down to protect the viewers&apos; ears. &quot;Me an Colly are here Monty!&quot; he bellows, just before making a sneaky stumping when the batsman&apos;s back foot has levered itself a fraction off the floor. What should be a dismissal is missed entirely by the umpire.  22nd over: New Zealand116-2 (Vincent 34 Taylor 34) Dalrymple comes on and almost manufactures a run-out off his first ball, which turned massively from outside off. Plunkett&apos;s throw came to the wrong end, and by the time Nixon had hurled it back to Dalrymple, the diving batsman had made his ground. Taylor swivel-pulls a four through mid-wicket.  23rd over: New Zealand117-2 (Vincent 35 Taylor 34) Monty tightens it up a little. I&apos;m afraid that on my pages that Australia mistake just isn&apos;t there, so if you&apos;re sufferring from it you&apos;ll just have to cope.  24th over: New Zealand 125-2 (Vincent 39 Taylor 39) A little strangely given the amount it was turning for Dalrymple, Flintoff has given the ball to Collingwood. Tim Murphy speaks the truth: &quot;I&apos;ve eaten both types of dry, tasteless bran biscuits and they&apos;re basically inedible unless coated in milk and fruit. Arguing about which is better is like arguing the relative merits of England wicketkeepers.&quot; Seven from the over.  25th over: New Zealand 134-2 (Vincent 42 Taylor 42) Dalrymple comes on at Monty&apos;s end. &quot;Both the UK and Aussie products are made from Aussie wheat. So any perceived difference in taste must come from whatever additives they put in in the respective countries.&quot; Ray Chan, surely you&apos;re not implying that the Aussies have been contaminating our wheat supply? Is that the secret to their success after all? Like the weetabix, this over has been thoroughly milked.  26th over: New Zealand 139-2 (Vincent 42 Taylor 42) Ok, I&apos;m disappearing for a moment to fix this title problem. No, it&apos;s beyond me. It&apos;ll have to wait.  27th over: New Zealand 143-2 (Vincent 47 Taylor 47) Cathy O&apos;Brien quips: &quot;I expect the reason that Nixon didn&apos;t get a referral for the stumping is that the umpires have tuned him out altogether. I would, if I had to listen to that for hours on end.&quot; Dalrymple is making a hash of this, as if he is surprised by the amount of turn he is getting. New Zealand are doing a fine job of winkling and working the ball into the gaps. 28th over: New Zealand 148-2 (Vincent 51 Taylor 48) Neil McLean speaks for the sceptic in all of us: &quot;Morning from Dubai, if NZ want to make a game of this they really should look at declaring in the next over or so. Sad but true.&quot; A lovely late cut from Vincent brings up his ninth ODI fifty, and his second in this series. 29th over: New Zealand 160-2 (Vincent 56 Taylor 50) A little gem from Janaka Williams: &quot;when Vegemite was being developed, there was a competition to name it: the winner being &quot;Your mar-mite, but your pa-will&quot; which was deemed to racy for the good burghers... &quot;. Dalrymple gives up another wide, as he is turning it too much for the degree of accuracy he can impart on his bowling. He needs to adjust his line. He gives another wide away moments later. Taylor brings up his own fifty later in the over with a single. That gives Vincent a chance to show off a dapper reverse sweep that runs away for four.  30th over: New Zealand 166-2 (Vincent 58 Taylor 52) Cameron Burge has two cents worth and then some: &quot;Sorry to rub salt into those already deep wounds, but what&apos;s the difference between this current England team and a pyromaniac? The latter wouldn&apos;t have lost his last 10 matches.&quot; Nice. &quot;Are there no rousing strikers of a cricket ball in England anymore? The blokes you&apos;ve got aren&apos;t necessarily bad players, they&apos;re just the wrong players for the one-day game. Strauss, Vaughan, Bell et al are pretty good technicians but lack the ability to hit a consistently long ball, which is what&apos;s required in the one day game these days. Twenty years ago when 200-220 was a good score their approach would have been fine, but the game has moved on. Alas, Fletch hasn&apos;t.&quot;  31st over: New Zealand 169-2 (Vincent 61 Taylor 52) Tremlett returns, and England&apos;s spin duo haven&apos;t really done anything for them. &quot;I think you have it wrong. The mistake is using &quot;England&quot; and &quot;live&quot; in the title&quot; suggests Matthew Taylor. Another wide, the 14th of the day for England. Otherwise, as ever, Tremlett was tidy enough. 32nd over: New Zealand 171-2 (Vincent 61 Taylor 52) Jon Skittrall has his fingers crossed for all the wrong reasons: &quot;Can&apos;t one of these get out? I want to see Oram smash this English rubbish all round the park. He looks awesome.&quot; Indeed, and so he is Jon. More pity the foolish sub editor who called him the &quot;poor man&apos;s Chris Cairns&quot;, not to mention whoever it was downstairs at the Guardian who decided he was a &quot;journeyman&quot; in a headline for a David Hopps piece. Colly&apos;s allsorts give away just three runs.  33rd over: New Zealand 183-2 (Vincent 64 Taylor 69) &quot;Andy: this is seeming more and more like some horrid form of torture. NZ will get over 300 and we&apos;ll be bowled in 20 overs for about 108. Why am I wasting my time here?&quot; I don&apos;t know Clare A Davies, nothing to do with the cricket I&apos;d assume: you&apos;re probably just waiting to see exactly how bad it gets (GRR! Can&apos;t this man with his sodding hoover disappear! People are trying to work here for God&apos;s sake) . Taylor hacks away an odd looking hook shot for four from a Tremlett bouncer.  WICKET! Taylor 71 c Panesar b Collingwood: 34th over: New Zealand 194-3 (Vincent 66 McMillan 0) Taylor strides down the pitch and lofts Collingwood for six over long-on. Next ball he thumps one-handed up into the air, and is caught by Monty Panesar at mid-on. A really good innings from Taylor there, from 82 balls. And how sweet to see Monty bag a catch. Though I suppose it is actually just the least he should be doing. Fleming has resisted the temptation to push Oram up the order, so McMillan has come in.  35th over: New Zealand 200-3 (Vincent 68 McMillan 4) &quot;The poor man&apos;s Chris Cairns&quot; may damn Oram with faint praise, but I bet Colly would be very pleased with warrant that description right now. Nixon? The poor man&apos;s Geraint Jones?&quot; More like the poor man&apos;s Bernard Manning, I&apos;d say, Gary Naylor. Jamie Dalrymple = the poor man&apos;s Richard Illingworth? Meanwhile Donuts McMillan batters a mighty straight four back over Chris Tremlett&apos;s head - no mean feat given that he is 6ft 7. Incredibly this chap is still hoovering roundabout my earshot - is he staring at the TV over my shoulder?  36th over: New Zealand 202-3 (Vincent 73 McMillan 7) Flintoff comes back on as England continue their rather desperate efforts to make inroads into this line-up and stop them racking up a score in excess of 300. Vettori and Patel are both stood on the balcony grinning, flicking balls from one hand to the other in that rather cool manner that spinners do. Just a single and a leg bye from the over. 37th over: New Zealand 206-3 (Vincent 69 McMillan 7) Monty returns, seeking to add another number to go in front of his current analysis of six overs for fifteen runs. An lbw shout almost gives him just that, but is turned down as it hit him outside the line. A little edge dribbles away fo four through the vacant slips. 38th over: New Zealand 212-3 (Vincent 69 McMillan 12) And again England are punished for not having a slip, as Freddie&apos;s first ball runs through the same area, still vacant. Sky have just pointed out that Paul Nixon has complained to the umpires about the batsmen running on the wicket and churning it up with their spikes. &quot;If that hoover guy is so keen, can you send him round to my flat?&quot; asks Gary Naylor. WICKET! McMillan 11 st Nixon b Panesar: 39th over: New Zealand 212-4 (Vincent 73 Oram 0) McMillan charges Monty and misses by a mile. Paul Nixon stumps him, and for all the stick I, and everyone else gives him, the good thing about Nixon is that he will take those stumpings, and he will complain about New Zealand&apos;s running. Still, here is Jacob Oram, and this could be decisive. 40th over: New Zealand 219-4 (Vincent 76 Oram 3) Oram is off the mark with a pushed single to the covers. Flintoff has stayed on to come around the wicket at Oram. He tries a yorker and finds a wide. WICKET! Vincent 76 c Dalrymple b Plunkett: 41st over: New Zealand 225-5 (Oram 3 McCullum 2) Plunkett returns and rips out Vincent with his first ball. The batsman plops a meek clip to leg straight into the hands of short mid-wicket. A really good anchorman innings by Vincent there, real Ron Burgundy. As, indeed, is Daniel Vettori&apos;s moustache. About which Gary Naylor says: &quot;Vettori may prove a handful on this strip, and no doubt will excite many female OBOers, but can we all laugh now at that moustache? In the land of David Boon and Merv Hughes, in a match in which England can field the full Monty, all Vettori can squeeze out is a &apos;Gary Neville&apos;.&quot; 42nd over: New Zealand 232-5 (Oram 3 McCullum 7) Thanks to Jerry Dawson and Martin Myers for telling me how to fix the misnomer at the top of the page. Not that I have yet. I have to break off that thought to describe exactly how lame Tremlett&apos;s effort to stop a four on the boundary was: very lame indeed, like a pigeon with a bullet in its brain. Even Monty looks furious.  43rd over: New Zealand 237-5 (Oram 5 McCullum 10) Plunkett coughs some more dross down leg, mixing it up with some filthy wides outside off and a thigh-high full toss. I wonder exactly what he is trying to bowl here?  WICKET! McCullum 19 c Strauss b Panesar 44th over: New Zealand 245-6 (Oram 5 Franklin 0) McCullum drops to one knee and slaps Monty high into the air and over mid-wicket for six. Changing tack, Monty sends the last ball of his spell wide outside off stump. McCullum reaches for it, miscues it high to Strauss at cover, and Monty dances.  45th over: New Zealand 253-6 (Oram 8 Franklin 0) Another wide and we&apos;re up to 21 (and 35 extras in total), as Clare a Davies points out: &quot;as well as losing almost every match we&apos;ve played down under this tour, will this team go down in history as giving away more extras than any other team, anywhere, ever?&quot;. Kevin Shine, Kevin Shine, Kevin Shine.  46th over: New Zealand 263-6 (Oram 14 Franklin 5) Dalrymple has the onerous task of bowling at the close, and to Oram as well. And he&apos;s punished by a mighty six that goes long into the stands over the leg side.  WICKET! Franklin 9 b Tremlett c Plunkett: 47th over: New Zealand 270-7 (Oram 15 Vettori 0) A Hearnz, what the hell does someone who signs themselves &apos;Beedah, Brooklyn&apos; know about literacy and Neville Cardus? Go get a clue and then come back to me. Honestly. Ingrate. Tremlett ha taken a wicket! Amazing. Some steep bounce from a good length and Franklin doffs the ball into Plunkett&apos;s hands with a shoddy drive. 48th over: New Zealand 279-7 (Oram 16 Vettori 6) And a different view to the ones you&apos;d usually read: &quot;I am sick of this &quot;truth&quot; that England&apos;s bowling has suffered because we have lost Troy Cooley. Did Harmison&apos;s decline happen before or after Cooley&apos;s departure? Answer, before. Is James Andersen a better bowler now than 12 or 36 months ago. Yes. Is England&apos;s attack made up of a bunch of green horns who are learning their trade? Yes Troy Cooley went because there was no point paying some guy a fortune to do a job that could be done by someone else.&quot; Can&apos;t say I agree with you Stephen Evans, though you are right about Harmison. Vettori steps away to leg and hits a four through the off.  49th over: New Zealand 302-7 (Oram 40 Vettori 10) Ouch! Plunkett lets the ball through his legs on the boundary, and gives away a humiliating four. Oram responds by going beserk: a six over long-on, a six over long-off and a four to third man brings up the 300. Tremlett is being bludgeoned to bits, and Freddie has his head in his hands. Six balls to come, and this is New Zealand&apos;s highest total against England in ODIs. 50th over: New Zealand 318-7 (Oram 54 Vettori 11) Just 22 off that last over then, giving Tremlett a not-so-tidy one for 72 off ten. Vettori takes a single and gives Oram the strike. A severe wide call is inflicted on Flintoff, takin the extras total to 37. Oh dear. Oram smacks a six off a fine ball by Flintoff. It was a remarkable clipped drive that just flew off the bat. Brilliant batting by Oram. His fifty comes off 32 balls - he was only on 16 a couple of overs ago! 16 runs from this over and New Zealand have a massive total.  Well, that was pretty awful wasn&apos;t it? I&apos;ll be amazed if England get anywhere close. Flintoff finishes with 0 for 66, Tremlett with 1 for 72, Plunkett 3 for 56 and Dalrymple went for 43 off just five overs. Only Monty, with two for 35, emerged with decent figures. And you know what?

That victory in the 1999 Open was achieved at Carnoustie, where the championship will return this summer. It will be a chance for the course, heavily criticised for the way it was set up at the time by the R&amp;A, to prove it is a worthy Open venue and for an under-rated player to prove he was a worthy Open champion. &quot;Of course I was worthy. I won it, didn&apos;t I?&quot; Lawrie said yesterday on the practice range at the Emirates club, where he hopes to continue his solid start to the 2007 European tour at the Dubai Desert Classic which starts tomorrow. If Lawrie sounded a little edgy he should be forgiven, not least because he has spent part of the last seven years apologising for not being Colin Montgomerie, Sergio Garcia, Luke Donald or any of the other so-called top Europeans who have failed to do what Lawrie did in 1999. There was also sniping from the likes of Davis Love, who suggested that Carnoustie had got the major champion it deserved - although the American later denied the comments when confronted by Lawrie. While some people were lining up to belittle Lawrie&apos;s achievement on that Sunday afternoon on Tayside, there was a gathering media storm around Jean van de Velde, who had lost so spectacularly. Judging by the coverage, anyone might have thought the Frenchman and not the Scot had won. A more fragile soul might have been crushed by the lack of respect but Lawrie quietly returned to Aberdeen and resumed his normal life on the European tour, content to fade out of public consciousness. That will all change in the coming months, however, as demands on his time intensify in the build-up to this year&apos;s Open. His agents have already had numerous requests for interviews from around the world. &quot;I&apos;m looking forward to speaking to people again,&quot; Lawrie laughed. &quot;You have got to play good golf to get noticed, and let&apos;s face it, since the Open I haven&apos;t been doing too much of that. As for all the other stuff, I got over it a long time ago. I know what kind of person I am and what kind of golfer I am.&quot; Despite what the critics say about his Open victory, Lawrie is considered by some to be a gifted player who has under-achieved. He has won two events since Carnoustie, the 2001 Dunhill Links and the 2002 Wales Open; on the other hand he lost his place on the PGA tour when his exemption expired in 2004. As for Carnoustie 2007, Lawrie will arrive at the course as he did eight years ago - a rank outsider. He is making no rash predictions, although he claims to be feeling the benefits of a winter fitness programme. He has already played in two European tour events this season, at Abu Dhabi and Qatar, finishing in the top 20 in both. &quot;I just get a feeling that it is really going to happen for me this year,&quot; he said. &quot;During the Open I&apos;m going to stay at home in Aberdeen, like I did in 1999. I like the idea of driving home every night because if it worked for me back then it might work for me this summer.&quot; David Howell, also in Dubai this week, is hoping for a repeat victory of his own at the Desert Classic. The 31-year-old from Swindon, who won the event in 1999, must beat the likes of Tiger Woods if he is to win again this year and is hopeful he can triumph over the world No1 and current Desert Classic title holder. Howell, who outscored Woods to win the HSBC Champions Trophy in November 2005, said: &quot;If you are going to stand up in a tournament against Tiger on the final day you have to keep control of your own emotions, play as well as you can and hope he doesn&apos;t have a great day. &quot;He is the best player in the world - but that doesn&apos;t mean he is unbeatable.&quot;", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport"], "title": "Golf: Lawrie launches season with point to prove", "sentences": ["I won it, didn&apos;t I?&quot; Lawrie said yesterday on the practice range at the Emirates club, where he hopes to continue his solid start to the 2007 European tour at the Dubai Desert Classic which starts tomorrow.", "I like the idea of driving home every night because if it worked for me back then it might work for me this summer.&quot; David Howell, also in Dubai this week, is hoping for a repeat victory of his own at the Desert Classic."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jan/31/golf.gdnsport3", "publicationDate": "2007-01-31T00:16:45Z"}, {"article": "It was eight months ago that West Ham were a minute from beating Liverpool in the FA Cup final but that memorable match must have felt far more distant to them last night. Defeated by the same opponents, the team remain in the relegation zone and show little sign of finding a way out. They have gone seven Premiership games without a win and must end that run next month - when they face Aston Villa, Watford and Charlton. Two excellent goals early in the second half, the first from Dirk Kuyt 10 seconds into it, provided a blow from which West Ham failed to recover. Liverpool, who have moved to within two points of Chelsea, could have put the game firmly beyond the Hammers before their tempo and passing dropped and Kepa Blanco pulled a goal back on his debut. They never looked like equalising, however.  The only plus for West Ham was that Wigan, the team immediately above them, also lost. Today the Hammers have a final chance to strengthen their squad and have not given up hope of getting Matthew Upson from Birmingham City. Their defence was regularly shredded early in the second half as Liverpool injected pace and movement. Craig Bellamy, Kuyt and Peter Crouch were sharp.  Three Alan Curbishley signings - Nigel Quashie, Calum Davenport and Luis Boa Morte - were in West Ham&apos;s starting XI but the manager seems no nearer to finding the needed recipe. The team passed poorly and threatened too sporadically, with some fans chanting &quot;We want our money back&quot; before Kepa scored. Apart from 15-minute periods at the end of both halves West Ham carried no threat and their determination could not compensate for a lack of class or fluency. Having started with victory at home to Manchester United, Curbishley has taken three points from 21. Injuries, especially in defence, have not helped, but the issues run deeper. &quot;They gave their best but it wasn&apos;t good enough,&quot; he said, describing himself as &quot;confident&quot; of staying up but admitting that he had expected better results. He said he does not envisage anyone leaving, though Marlon Harewood has been the subject of an inquiry from Tottenham.  Liverpool now have five successive league wins and will sign Javier Mascherano from West Ham today after Fifa gave the midfielder permission to play for a third club in the space of a year. They are also close to a \u00a32.6m deal for the Deportivo la Coru\u00f1a defender Alvaro Arbeloa, 24, and his 18-year-old compatriot Francisco Manuel Dur\u00e1n, a midfielder from Malaga. Their manager, Rafa Ben\u00edtez, is refusing to get carried away with talk of challenging for the title when his team trail Manchester United by eight points having played a game more. &quot;We are keeping the momentum, that&apos;s the key,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to stay there to the end.&quot;  There had been little to admire in Liverpool&apos;s first-half performance. At that point a three-man forward line was not functioning as intended, with Crouch quiet and Kuyt peripheral from the left. &quot;I came in at half-time and felt quite comfortable,&quot; Curbishley said, but that soon changed. Within 10 seconds Crouch, given space by Davenport, set up Kuyt to strike an unstoppable shot in via the bar from about 25 yards.  The switching of Kuyt to the right had paid dividends and soon Liverpool had a fine second goal. Gerrard picked out Bellamy, whose lay-off found John Arne Riise on the left and the Norwegian&apos;s cutback was swept into the net by Crouch from near the edge of the box. Liverpool were in total control - Bellamy and Kuyt going close - before Kepa scored moments after coming on.  The Anfield board met before the game and while it is yet to receive a formal bid from Dubai International Capital, it is understood to have opted to seek more time as it assesses an approach from the US businessman George Gillett. DIC remains the chairman David Moores&apos; favoured bidder but other shareholders, notably Granada, which owns 9.9%, want to consider a bid which would value shares at nearer \u00a35,000 compared to DIC&apos;s \u00a34,500.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "West Ham United", "Liverpool", "Peter Crouch"], "title": "Premiership: West Ham 1 - 2 Liverpool", "sentences": ["The Anfield board met before the game and while it is yet to receive a formal bid from Dubai International Capital, it is understood to have opted to seek more time as it assesses an approach from the US businessman George Gillett."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jan/31/match.sport4", "publicationDate": "2007-01-31T00:42:00Z"}, {"article": "7pm Evening everyone. I know it&apos;s been a day of unprecedented inactivity, but I hope you&apos;ve been pacing yourselves - there&apos;s five hours of this nonsense still to come. To try to fatten out the newsworthiness of these updates, I&apos;ll be keeping you aware of tonight&apos;s latest scores, with Man Utd and Chelsea among the teams playing in Premiership fixtures this evening. For now though, let me catch up on what hasn&apos;t happened so far today. Shouldn&apos;t take long. 7.10pm With nothing having happened - at all - in the last half hour - here&apos;s a suitable time for Gary Naylor to chip in: &quot;Isn&apos;t Transfer Deadline Day one of life&apos;s great let downs, like every single Sky Showdown Sunday, every Olympics since 1984 and Michael Owen&apos;s comeback (whoops.. that one hasn&apos;t happened yet). What other examples do readers have of great let downs (and, yes, before every single woman e-mails in, I know that one).&quot; 7.15pm TRANSFER Celtic have allowed 22-year-old reserve-team captain Paul Lawson to join St Mirren until the end of the season. Now if that doesn&apos;t get you excited, I don&apos;t know what will. Meanwhile, an Adamson has been named on the Sheffield Wednesday&apos;s bench for tonight&apos;s game at Southampton. He&apos;s no relation - just thought you&apos;d like to know. 7.20pm I should warn you that my tap-tapping at the keyboard might not be as rapid as usual this evening after I chopped half my finger off when trying to slice some bread (to go with my home-made soup, no less). So tonight will be more minute-by-five minutes report than minute-by-two minutes report. &quot;I&apos;m a business journalist and I&apos;m in Lisbon, Portugal, doing an article on Google,&quot; says Carlos Martinho. Sounds quite interesting. &quot;Boring stuff.&quot; Oh. &quot;So I&apos;m refreshing Guardian deadline day every two minutes. Thank you for being there. If you want, I can update you on the Portuguese transfers. Benfica has just signed Chinese striker Yu Dabao, from Qingdao Hailifeng. And Acad\u00e9mica, one of my clubs - Porto is the other - signed Cl\u00e1udio Pitbull from Porto (**** player) and a Joeano from Beitar Jerusal\u00e9m (saved us from relegation last year). That&apos;s about all.&quot; That&apos;s more than enough, Carlos, thanks. 7.25pm TRANSFER Albeit one that everybody already knew about. Still, Everton have confirmed the loan signing of Manuel Fernandes. &quot;Someone queried the authenticity of an earlier anecdote regarding a friend whose head got caught in some bus doors,&quot; says Jon Yeats. &quot;Could you just confirm that Adam Connor is spot on - the doors folded inwards. And also that my name is Yates, not Yeats. As you can tell, the transfer day banter has been riveting.&quot; You really know how to whet the appetite for the next 275 minutes, Mr Yeats. 7.40pm Sorry for the delay - I&apos;ve just been down to the GU canteen, picking up a tuna steak (of sorts). &quot;Did our Portuguese correspondent suggest a player called Claudio Pitbull?&quot; checks Jim Lacey, boosting the worldwide community spirit we have here. &quot;I did a Google, it&apos;s his name. Let&apos;s suggest a tiresome list of footballers with dog related names, to see out this underwhelming transfer day. Ermm. Stephane Dalmat(ian). Ermm... (Jack) Russell Hoult. Ermm... Stan Collymore.&quot; 7.45pm Chelsea&apos;s game with Blackburn is under way. Tonight&apos;s three other Premiership fixtures - United v Watford, Bolton v Charlton, and Newcastle v Villa - all kick off at 8pm. &quot;You are not the only one who can have an accident,&quot; says Dennis Warren. &quot;I was on the bus, and I had my feet up on the back of the seats in front.&quot; Whatever happened, you deserved it. &quot;Unbeknownst to me, my big toe was in a gap under the arm rest. The person in front wanted to get off, so they raised the arm rest, crushing my toe like a floppy walnut in a nutcracker. The driver drove a bit until we got to a fire station (we were driving around the countryside). Got to the firestation and removed the sock. Owwwwwww! The force had ripped the root of the nail out.&quot; Dennis continues, at great length, to reveal how the journey lasted almost as long as his email. &quot;I now have to have the dressing changed each day. And each day the bandage sticks, causing more pain and blood, as it has to be torn off my foot. Can anyone beat that?&quot; 7.50pm GOAL! Chelsea 1 - 0 Blackburn Drogba strikes first this evening - unless you count Steve Fletcher&apos;s goal for the Hibees against St Johnstone, which we don&apos;t - firing home from 12 yards against Blackburn. &quot;What kind of soup did you make?&quot; asks Niall Glynn. Well, Niall, I tried to produce some chicken and sweetcorn soup. Alas, putting in three or four large parsnips made it taste predominantly of, er, parsnips. &quot;I made myself Jamie Oliver&apos;s tomato soup a few weeks back. It was all going well until my virginal use of the hand held blender that I bought the previous weekend splattered the soup all over the kitchen walls, floor and even ceiling. How I laughed as I speculated whether the unkempt abboitoir look was en vogue. Then I felt the scalding sensation on my arm and face.&quot; 7.55pm &quot;After securing the services of Paul Hartley from Hearts this evening, there are strong rumours in Glasgow of a massive signing at Celtic Park tonight,&quot; says John Mallon. &quot;There are rumours that Riquelme or Robbie Keame will sign.&quot; Or J-Lloyd Samuel, maybe? 8pm &quot;You need to mention the fact that QPR have confirmed the signing of Danny Cullip from Nottingham Forrest,&quot; says Jamie Ballantyne. &quot;That&apos;s a transfer.&quot; Call that a transfer? Upson to West Ham - that&apos;s a transfer. Anyway, I&apos;m too busy eating tuna to mention such things, so I&apos;ll leave that to you, Jamie. 8.03pm &quot;When Jim Lacey referred to Stan Collymore, was he referring to dog-related names or dog-related recreational pursuits?&quot; chuckles Gareth Evans. 8.07pm GOAL! Newcastle 1 - 0 Aston Villa James Milner, on loan at Villa last season, strikes. Maybe O&apos;Neill will try to sign him after the match? &quot;See that&apos;s where you went wrong,&quot; says Niall. &quot;Even someone with my limited soup-making talents knows that you should use predominately chicken and sweetcorn in chicken and sweetcorn soup. Not parsnips. Hope this helps.&quot; Thanks Niall. I&apos;ll bear it in mind when I try to make parsnip soup next week with carrots and asparagus. 8.09pm &quot;How about Watford centre-back Danny Shih Tzu?&quot; says David Pierce. He&apos;s talking about dog-related footballers, see? 8.10pm GOAL! Newcastle 2 - 0 Aston Villa When Kieron Dyer scores against you, you know things are bad. If Villa continue to plummet down the league, will people still be banging on about how O&apos;Neill should have been given the England job? Probably, because he should have been. 8.13pm GOAL! Bolton 1 - 0 Charlton Crikey - it&apos;s mayhem all of a sudden on transfer-deadline day (admittedly none of this has anything to do with the fact it&apos;s transfer-deadline day). Henrik Pedersen, the centre-forward-turned-left-back is the scorer, though I have no idea if he managed this from centre-forward or left-back. In other news, my girlfriend just phoned to demand to know why her latest episode of Ugly Betty had been deleted from our Sky+ memory. When I pleaded innocence and told her I had to return to work immediately because there were literally tens of people banking on me to keep them updated for five hours on any transfer activity tonight, she refused to believe me on either count. 8.19pm GOAL! Bolton 1 - 1 Charlton El Karkouri equalises for the Addicks. This is almost quite exciting now. Almost. Oh, and my friend The Rumour Mill tells me that Celtic&apos;s Shaun Maloney will be Aston Villa&apos;s Shaun Maloney before the evening&apos;s out. &quot;What are you wasting time with chicken and sweetcorn for?&quot; says Stephen Hewitt. &quot;Buy a leek and add about four carrots, a spud and a pint of chicken stock. Season. That&apos;s it.&quot; Tomorrow&apos;s minute-by-minute: Mike Adamson tries Stephen Hewitt&apos;s soup recipe. Join us from 5pm for all the live action, all the way through to tasting. 8.23pm GOAL! Man Utd 1 - 0 Watford Cristiano Ronaldo says to Didier Drogba &quot;anything you can do, I can do too&quot;. Now you can add to the list of diving and feigning injury the ability to score from 12 yards. Ronaldo&apos;s was a penalty, mind. &quot;If you&apos;re looking for dog-related footballers (well, you might not have been but Jim Lacey was) how about Ray Pointer, the Burnley centre foward of the 1950s,&quot; suggests Phil Sawyer. Or, indeed, a Dave Bassett Hound? 8.26pm &quot;While I&apos;m tempted by the prospect of joining you as you prepare, cook and consume Stephen Hewitt&apos;s soup, I&apos;m somewhat disturbed that you rather recklessly intend to terminate the broadcast at the point of tasting,&quot; says Steve Arthurs. &quot;Will we never know how it all ends? Seems a bit cruel.&quot; Glendenning will then take you through the main course, Ingle the dessert, and Smyth will slur his way through the Port and/or whiskey at the end of the meal. 8.33pm GOAL! Newcastle 2 - 1 Aston Villa Ashley Young, the biggest signing of this transfer window (the big-boned Ronaldo aside, of course) halves Villa&apos;s deficit on his debut. &quot;I&apos;m glad the transfer window exists, otherwise, living as I do in rugby-obsessed New Zealand, I&apos;d be forced to feign interest in Super 14 rugby, which, unbelievably begins this weekend in such frozen tundras as Brisbane and Durban. Madness, as Im sure you&apos;ll agree. So if you could perhaps even organise another window for this time next month, id be ever so grateful,&quot; says Gareth Evans. All of which ties in excellently to the fact that Coventry have signed New Zealand defender Che Bunce. 8.36pm &quot;Did you know there is a dog called an Affenpinscher, which translates as &apos;Moustached Little Devil&apos;,&quot; says Stephen Molese. Drumroll please... &quot;I wonder if Gary Neville has one.&quot; 8.40pm &quot;Why is every deadline day the same?&quot; asks Chris Langford. &quot;Football managers are like schoolchildren doing their homework in registration when they have had a whole month to do it.&quot; Or in this case, simply not bothering to do their homework at all. 8.48pm It&apos;s half-time at Old Trafford, where United still lead by the odd goal; as do Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. &quot;Never mind the odd dog-related footballer, aren&apos;t there a whole squad of them at Blackburn Rovers?&quot; says Gary Naylor. 9pm Ashley Cole has been stretchered off at Stamford Bridge, where Mark Hughes has been throwing his water bottle onto the pitch after the ref failed to award Blackburn a penalty. 9.06pm Over to United correspondent, Stephen Hewitt: &quot;Just in case anybody is interested in the United vs Watford fiasco. Around the 40 minute mark, Vidic and Henderson went up for the ball in a big idiot contest: Vidic caught Henderson&apos;s face - then promptly fell to the floor to cry 50:50 (as is his wont). Henderson, clutching his face, stumbled backwards and stood on Vidic&apos;s head! Funny all around, until the ref decided to book the pair of them for, er, who knows. Have United signed Hargreaves yet?&quot; Stephen, if United sign Hargreaves, it will be printed here many times in big bold, capital letters. No, the biggest news since I took over this quickly sinking ship is that New Zealander Che Bunce is know a Sky Blue rather than Michael Barrymore&apos;s favourite colour, an All White. 9.10pm &quot;Just how on earth are we supposed to keep a grip on what is happening tonight?&quot; asks a flustered Clare Davies. &quot;Transfer-window closing and hectic action, two matches to follow, and the Scottish one, also taking account of these recipes ideas, and find space in the mind for picking my World Cup side.&quot; Ah, so you&apos;re the one to blame for England&apos;s one-day selection issues, are you Clare? You can cross transfers off your list - there aren&apos;t any. 9.13pm GOAL! Chelsea 2 - 0 Blackburn Lampard secures the three points for the Londoners. Blackburn have given it a real go tonight, with Pedersen, Gallacher, McCarthy, Bentley and Derbyshire all playing, but it looks like Chelsea have eked out another victory. United have a tough run of fixtures coming up, while this win should start Chelsea on a long winning streak. The title race is going to go down to the wire... 9.19pm Only two hours and 41 minutes to go folks. &quot;Surely if popular culture ladies&apos; magazines are to be believed (which they aren&apos;t), Clare Davies, with her female ability to multi-task, should find it a hell of a lot easier than the rest of us to keep a handle on all the action this evening?&quot; says Ronan Hayes. &quot;And if Geoffrey Boycott is to be believed she shouldn&apos;t be involved in picking a cricket team.&quot; 9.23pm GOAL! Man Utd 2 - 0 Watford An own goal from Doyley - which is more of a nickname than a name - gives United some breathing space. They&apos;re going to be six points ahead of Chelsea this evening, just as they were this morning. And yesterday morning. And the morning before that. And etc etc. 9.27pm When I devised this Baldrick-esque plan of writing GOAL at the start of any update detailing news of a goal, and TRANSFER at the start of any update detailing news of a transfer, I thought the latter would feature more regularly than no times in the last two hours. &quot;Can we just go back to the soup-related shenanigans as at least 56 milion people in the UK don&apos;t want to read about Chelsea Mercenaries rolling over the hapless Rovers? How about an All-Time Favourite Soup XI?&quot; Gabriel Heinze tomato soup at left-back? 9.29pm &quot;According to Soccernet&apos;s Gamecast report, Lloyd Doyley just scored an own goal from 60 yards with his head. Is this true?&quot; asks Michael Garton, who should know better than to read Soccernet. It was more like six yards, Michael. 9.31pm GOAL! Man Utd 3 - 0 Watford Larsson makes it three, but more importantly, Mido, who could be on his way to Celta Vigo after the game, has equalised for Spurs against Arsenal. Read all about it here. 9.33pm GOAL! Man Utd 4 - 0 Watford It&apos;s a rout at Old Trafford, Wayne Rooney getting in on the act. &quot;Soup XI?&quot; says the prolific Gary Naylor. &quot;Kevin Campbell and Jim Baxter up front.&quot; 9.35pm GOAL! Chelsea 3 - 0 Blackburn Kalou pops up in stoppage time. &quot;Darn,&quot; says my colleague Scott Murray, or something along those lines. &quot;Mido scoring means I have to hang around for another half hour, doesn&apos;t it.&quot; I didn&apos;t put a question mark on the end there, because it wasn&apos;t really a question. We love our jobs here. 9.50pm This all seemed like such a good idea yesterday. &quot;It appears that Ronan can leaf through Woman&apos;s Weekly, check on live scores and rustle up rib-ticklers simultaneously so he appears to be in no difficulties,&quot; notes William Peake. &quot;Perhaps his name could drop the &apos;n&apos; at the end?&quot; 9.51pm &quot;The Soup XI could play home games at Craven Pottage,&quot; says Gary Naylor. Take a bow, sir. 9.56pm GOAL! Newcastle 3 - 1 Aston Villa Antoine Sibierski hits the target in injury-time to see off Villa&apos;s challenge. I haven&apos;t seen the goal, but Sibierski only deals in headers so that&apos;s my guess. In fact, I can only think of Gus Poyet who has such a large proportion of headed goals. &quot;Just wanted to let you know that David Beckham is going to the LA Galaxy,&quot; says Clint Barnes helpfully. &quot;I know it&apos;s just a little club in the USA and most folks aren&apos;t interested in minor signings like this, but still. Oh, hang on. My electric telegraph is buzzing off the hook! Stay tuned for more scoops!&quot; !!!! 9.58pm The referee blows his whistle very loudly, bringing to an end all of tonight&apos;s Premiership games. There have been wins for Man Utd, Chelsea and Newcastle, defeats for Watford, Blackburn and Aston Villa, and a draw for Bolton and Charlton. &quot;Can you add some Massimo Macaroni in your soup?&quot; asks AJ Bownas. Ah heck, why not? 10pm TRANSFER  Within two minutes of the final whistle, Watford give me something to write about. Ok, so it&apos;s only the signing of Istres midfielder Johan Cavalli on a free, but beggars can&apos;t be choosers. 10.05pm TRANSFER x2 Liverpool have completed the transfers of Deportivo&apos;s Alvaro Arbeloa for \u00a32.6m and Malaga&apos;s 18-year-old Francisco Manuel Duran, whose father was so good they named him twice. As far as I know, Javier Mascherano still hasn&apos;t signed on the dotted line. 10.20pm TRANSFER x2 &quot;I&apos;m worried about &apos;Arry Redknapp,&quot; says Jonathan Hartley. &quot;It&apos;s less than three hours to the end of deadline day and he&apos;s made no signings. Has the master wheeler-dealer lost his touch? Or is it really true he&apos;s satisfied with the squad we&apos;ve got?&quot; He may be satisfied, but Aidy Boothroyd isn&apos;t - perhaps not surprisingly given that they&apos;ve just been spanked 4-0. He&apos;s added to his ever-growing Watford squad French unknown Cedric Avinel on an 18-month loan deal and Brazilian unknown Douglas Rinaldi, also on loan. They&apos;re unlikely to save the Hornets from the drop methinks. 10.30pm Dr Dave has a lot to get off his chest, so let&apos;s just let him get on with it, shall we: &quot;While I am pleased to see Liverpool move their ass on transfer day, I have to wonder if there will be anyone left in the clubhouse that actually speaks English as a first language. Is this Rafa&apos;s strategy to keep Gerrard: &apos;look, everyone here is Spanish-speaking, and you get better beer... why do you want to go to Real?&apos; If this is the plan, it&apos;s inspired. On the bad news front: dumping the Dubai money in favour of Gillette is nigh on the dumbest thing the Reds could do. Trust me, I&apos;m watching the man transform the Habs into a sub-par team in the NHL. It isn&apos;t pretty. Speaking of pretty: is that really Sean Ingle in the photo? She isn&apos;t a man? Now, I don&apos;t entertain any chance that I &apos;have a shot&apos;, but rather will promise in future to use the proper gendered pronoun when I disagree with her live updates.&quot; 10.35pm I&apos;m already looking forward to tomorrow&apos;s MBM. Obviously there will be the whole soup-making farce after 5pm, but before that Barry Glendenning will be here from 10am, running us through the pick of Thursday&apos;s daytime TV - This Morning, Brainteaser, The News, Neighbours, Colombo, Countdown, Ready Steady Cook and Deal Or No Deal. It will be more uplifting than Friday&apos;s OBO on England&apos;s latest debacle in Australia. Ok, I&apos;m off to do some proper work now (aka drink some of these 10 crates of lager I helped the GU sportsdesk win in a media quiz a couple of weeks ago), but please hang around because I&apos;ll be dipping back in now and again until midnight in case someone actually pulls their finger out and buys some players. 10.45pm TRANSFER HOLD THE BACK PAGE!! I tried to leave, but when a transfer of this magnitude takes place, I can&apos;t help but be drawn away from the Carlsberg to tell you all about it. Bolton. Have. Signed. Portsmouth. Midfielder. David. Thompson. The fact that that actually drew a &quot;Thompson? Really?&quot; in unison from my co-workers tells you what a pathetic day of wheeling and dealing it&apos;s been. The fee is &quot;nominal&quot;, ie a bag of footballs or something. Wait, there&apos;s more from Jamie O&apos;Connor: &quot;Everton have sold promising centre-back Mark Hughes to Northampton town. The Toffees are now down to three centre-backs. Well, 2.5 (Stubbs is the half). Really, if you&apos;re not Scottish or if you&apos;re still not old enough to play bridge you don&apos;t belong at Goodison, according to one D. Moyes.&quot; Northampton have also signed Kenny Deuchar on loan from Gretna today. 10.50pm &quot;Having checked my last bank statement, and rifled around the back of the sofa, I have pooled together 219.99 (no pound sign on American keyboards, &apos;interestingly&apos;). I was wondering if you, or any of your readers would be interested in pooling funds with me into a preliminary beer kitty to see if we can&apos;t coax Paul Merson out of retirement for a Sunday runaround for the legendary Sheffield Crew of Wayne, New Jersey,&quot; says Stuart Youngs, Chief Recruitment Officer, Sheffield Crew, before whispering at blistering speed: &quot;Aforementioned player will be reponsible for all airfare, accomodation and living costs.&quot; 10.52pm This straight from the wires: aware of fresh competition for the player, Alan Curbishley has leaped in with a \u00a31,000 offer for Paul Merson. He awaits Merson&apos;s response. 10.55pm &quot;Not that most of your readers will care, but I wouldn&apos;t want them to think that just because no-one challenged Dr. Dave&apos;s assertion about the Habs that he&apos;s correct,&quot; says Paul Connelly. &quot;When Gillett bought the club it was sub-par, but it has been steadily improving ever since. The team hardly made the playoffs in the decade before Gillett bought it, and now challenging for a place in the top 4 (out of 15) in the Eastern Conference. Not exactly sub-par.&quot; Gillett, the best the Reds can get. 11pm If you are a football manager working in the Premiership or Football League, what on earth are you doing wasting your time reading this? You have just one hour left to buy a player from one of your associates. Of course, you could always just wait until tomorrow and buy a free agent if you wanted.  If you are anyone else, what on earth are you doing wasting your time reading this? You have just one hour left of these inane updates. Of course, you could always just naff off now if you wanted. 11.10pm I was tempted to write my thoughts on the plight of both myself and yourselves, but then I remembered that Scott Murray had summed it up more succinctly than I could ever hope to manage. You&apos;ve probably seen this before, but have another look anyway. 11.15pm TRANSFER Charlton defender Jonathan Fortune has joined Stoke on loan for the rest of the season. I&apos;m not kidding. 11.20pm Rumours abound that Juan Roman Riquelme is going to sign for Celtic some time in the next 40 minutes, while Jamie O&apos;Connor is adamant Danny Murphy is heading to Everton: &quot;looks like the toffees are making an 11th hour bid for danny murphy... a perfect prospect for moyes... Journeyman, bald, an Celtic surname and seemingly lacking those skills that destroys everton- Vision, awarness, finesse, dribbling etc.... who needs those skills when you can Hoof,Chop and run to corners.&quot; I think that&apos;s what he&apos;s saying anyway. 11.25pm Chelsea need a centre-half, Titus Bramble needs a new club. Now unless I&apos;m putting two and two together and making five, I think we could be on to something here. Watch this space. 11.26pm I&apos;ve just seen Sibierski&apos;s goal. I was wrong about it being with his head - it was actually a cracking finish with his right foot on the slide. &quot;Feel free to tell me I&apos;m wrong,&quot; says Stuart Youngs, who is always right, &quot;but is this the passage of Mr. Murray&apos;s OBO report that you were referring us to? &apos;Nothing to say about the Indian anthem, but the New Zealand one sounds like the theme tune for an 1960s ATV variety spectacular.&apos;&quot; Spot on as usual, Youngsy. 11.30pm Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock... &quot;Can you confirm if that is the Jamie O&apos;Connor who played for Burnley against Derby last night?&quot; asks Gavin Knight. &quot;And proceeded to hoof, chop and run to corners all night. Reflected self-loathing perhaps?&quot; I&apos;m going out on a limb here, but yes, I can confirm that. 11.32pm TRANSFER Now that the finishing strait is in sight, I&apos;ve found a new lease of life. And so has Martin O&apos;Neill, who continues on his mission to turn Aston Villa into Old Celticians - he&apos;s agreed a fee for Shaun Maloney, a very useful player indeed. &quot;One for your Soup XI - West Ham&apos;s new signing Kepa (soup)!&quot; giggles Mark Coward. 11.40pm &quot;Mike, just to answer Gavin Knight&apos;s question, he was close but I&apos;m actually the other James O&apos;Connor from Doncaster Rovers,&quot; says the fibbing James O&apos;Connor who neither plays for Doncaster Rovers nor for Burnley. &quot;I&apos;m a no-holds barred defender with a touch of flair. Actually as I think about it, maybe I&apos;ll solve the lack of centre-backs problem down at Goodison. Mr Moyes are you listening? You have 20 minutes, get your people to talk to my people!&quot; If this deal goes through, will I get a cut? I&apos;m not a registered agent, so it&apos;ll have to be in brown paper envelopes. 11.50pm 10 minutes to go, and nothing to report. &quot;Speaking of transfers, I am placing my sister on the list,&quot; says Sandip Randhawa. Seems a bit harsh, no? &quot;She tackles like a man and makes Roy Keane seem like a nice guy. I have to get her out the house for my own sanity. I will take any bids.&quot; You may have left it a bit late, Sandip. There&apos;s always Ebay if you don&apos;t get any offers tonight. 11.54pm TRANSFER The yellow ticker on Sky Sports News is going bezerk, which can mean only one thing - another monumental transfer. &quot;What is it this time?&quot; I hear you all cry. I&apos;ll tell you: Derby sign West Ham defender Tyrone Mears on loan for rest of the season. Told you it was a biggun. 11.55pm TRANSFER Gary Dicker has joined Birmingham on loan from University College Dublin. Sounds less like a football transfer and more like a particularly unappealing gap year to me, but what do I know. &quot;I bid AUD$500.00 (for Sandip&apos;s sister),&quot; says Ryan Harrowfield. &quot;But you need to cover all costs to Adelaide. Our team needs tough defence, we have all these slow weak players, some hardness is what&apos;s needed. I also need a height though, can&apos;t be too short!&quot; My illegal agency is making a killing this evening. 11.59pm + 50 secs 10 seconds to go... 11.59pm + 51 secs nine seconds to go... 11.59pm + 52 secs eight... 11.59pm + 53 secs seven... 11.59pm + 54 secs six... 11.59pm + 55 secs five... 11.59pm + 56 secs four... 11.59pm + 57 secs three... 11.59pm + 58 secs two... 11.59pm + 59 secs one... Midnight THUD! That was the noise of a closing transfer window, a sound as undramatic as today&apos;s events have been. To recap, West Ham have paid \u00a36m for Matthew Upson, Liverpool have signed Alvaro Arbeloa for \u00a32.6m, Celtic have nabbed Paul Hartley for \u00a31m, Sebastian Larsson has made his move to Birmingham a permanent one for \u00a31m, and Ryan Harrowfield has taken Sandip&apos;s sister for AUD$500.00. I guess we&apos;ll never know whether Javier Mascherano and Shaun Maloney completed their moves in time. Well, not until later on today anyway. Thanks for your emails, see you when the window re-opens on July 1. I leave you in the capable hands of Gary Naylor. &quot;Yet another good thing about the Soup XI is that we wouldn&apos;t have to put up with the Wags. The players would be Bachelors you see.&quot;", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "title": "Deadline day live - 7pm-midnight", "sentences": ["On the bad news front: dumping the Dubai money in favour of Gillette is nigh on the dumbest thing the Reds could do."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jan/31/newsstory.sport10", "publicationDate": "2007-01-31T00:46:30Z"}, {"article": "LIVERPOOL TEAR FIFA A NEW LOOPHOLE If the Fiver ever goes completely postal - in the Michael Douglas/Falling Down sense rather than through your letterbox - it&apos;ll know what to do. Hire Liverpool FC to defend it. Because the uppity Anfield outfit appear to have a unique ability to twist the long arm of the law. Last season they pestered Uefa into giving them a Big Cup berth they weren&apos;t entitled to and today their incessant whining has forced Fifa into letting them sign Javier Mascherano, despite the rules clearly stating that no player can play for more than two clubs in a single season. Mascherano has already turned out for Corinthians and West Ham this term but Fifa has, for the first time ever, agreed to waive the rule. &quot;Particular emphasis was given to safeguarding sporting integrity and the crucial element of overlapping sports seasons between associations, notably in cases in which a sports season starts prior to, and ends beyond, July 1,&quot; explained a Fifa flunkey, possibly after expressing his relief at finally being able to remove the industrial strength earplugs he felt compelled to buy earlier this month. What Fifa didn&apos;t explain, of course, is why a club that employs Xabi Alonso and Momo Sissoko think they need a central midfielder who is below Nigel Quashie and Hayden Mullins in the West Ham order of merit. Is Rafa Benitez trying to suggest Alan Curbishley doesn&apos;t know a top player when he sees one? If so, the Spaniard surely nodded knowingly this afternoon when he heard that, having already had two bids rejected, the Hammers&apos; head had submitted an \u00a38m offer for Matthew Upson. Seems the fumes from the fire in his pocket have gone to Curbishley&apos;s head. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;Mirandinha played for Brazil and it was just before we signed him. I clattered him. I took him, the ball, everything. When he came to Newcastle, he could not speak a word of English and he was being introduced to everybody by an interpreter. When he got to me, he said something to the interpreter and when I asked him what he had said, he said: &apos;You are a dirty Irish b@stard! That was fair enough. We got on really well after that&quot; - former Magpies defender and now RTE pundit John Anderson recalls doing his bit for Irish-Brazilian relations. ********************* BIND THE GAP With the possible exception of those zesty post-PE showers, the Fiver&apos;s happiest moments at school always came when the teacher had to leave class for an unspecified period. You could have all sorts of fun: inflict a sickening wedgie on old Mickey Robinson; write TAWT DLAB backwards on Sir Slaphead&apos;s blackboard; or even compare the range of your man-ruler with a few peers. Whatever: the point was that you had to take advantage before the teacher came back. Just ask Lord Ferg, because the teacher in the case of this scandalously tenuous intro is John Terry, and he&apos;ll be back to restore order to the title race any day now. We don&apos;t know exactly when that will be - he misses tonight&apos;s game at home to The Artists Formerly Known As Blackeye Rovers with calf trouble - but so far the MU Rowdies have failed to make the most of his absence. When Terry walked off the field after Chelsea&apos;s 1-0 win over Newcastle on December 13, the Rowdies were five points clear. Seven games and one full-blown Chelsea crisis later, they are only six clear. Chelsea&apos;s woes may have subconsciously lulled an increasingly slapdash Rowdies into a false sense of security. &quot;We cannot afford to rely on [a six-point lead] and we must not be satisfied,&quot; said their assistant manager Carlos Queirozeyefora4-5-1athometoWatford, breaking the habit of a lifetime by speaking sense. &quot;We want more and we need more.&quot; Damn straight. When Terry returns to bind the gap, Chelsea will surely go on one of their will-to-live-sapping winning runs, so tonight could be the Rowdies&apos; last chance to extend the lead. Not even Ferg could tinker his side out of a home win over Watford, whereas a Terry-less Chelsea should be given a real test by Mark Hughes&apos;s admirable TAFKABR, even with Claude Makelele returning. Squeaky-bum time is coming, and Ferg might be left to regret not inflicting those wedgies on West Ham, Newcastle and Arsenal while Mr Terry was away. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Teddy Sheringham, 128, will become a Spurs player if he can hobble his way from Upton Park to White Hart Lane before the transfer window closes. Aston Villa&apos;s J Lloyd Samuel has got an even tougher task: he has to make it all the way to Glasgow to sign for the Queen&apos;s Celtic, although he does have the advantage of a fully functioning bladder. And Barcelona&apos;s Xavi has been telling anyone who is interested that the MU Rowdies can&apos;t wait to get their soccerballing mitts all over him. * * * * * * * * * * * STILL WANT MORE?

Liverpool have turned down Dubai International Capital&apos;s \u00a3156m takeover bid for the club. Chairman David Moores has understandably been distracted by the extra \u00a38m that Montreal Canadiens owner George Gillett is waving in his direction. DIC have now pulled out of negotiations. Perhaps having seen the way Theo Walcott has set the Emirates alight, Gareth Bale has decided to keep his apocalyptic left foot in Southampton until the end of the season.

The group, owned by the Dubai government, had been examining the club&apos;s books with a view to a \u00a3156m buy-out, but its decision to withdraw follows the failure of the Liverpool board to accept the offer last night, following a rival bid by American billionaire George Gillett. His bid is understood to be worth \u00a38m more to Liverpool chairman David Moores. &quot;Dubai International Capital LLC today announces that it has decided to end negotiations with Liverpool FC and Athletic Grounds plc about a possible investment in the club,&quot; read a statement. &quot;Having completed due diligence, DIC submitted a comprehensive offer to the Liverpool board. The offer had been accepted in principle by majority shareholder David Moores. It appears that the Liverpool board and the majority shareholder David Moores were unable to approve these terms in order to allow DIC to make a formal offer to all shareholders.&quot; The news prolongs Liverpool&apos;s long search for the outside investment they believe they need to compete at the top end of the Premiership and in Europe. DIC had been their most likely suitor and entered into discussions with the club late last year. The deal would have valued the club at \u00a3450m, but the Dubai group have decided to withdraw following the board&apos;s decision to allow more time to consider the Gillett bid. Gillett, owner of the Montreal Canadiens ice hockey team, has proposed a deal which is thought to offer shareholders more for their holdings. &quot;We are very disappointed to be making this announcement. DIC is a serious investor with considerable resources at our disposal,&quot; said Sameer Al Ansari, executive chairman and chief executive officer of DIC. &quot;At the same time, we are supporters of the game and of the club. Liverpool&apos;s investment requirements have been well publicised and, after a huge amount of work, we proposed a deal that would provide the club with the funds it needs, both on and off the pitch. We were also prepared to offer shareholders a significant premium on the market price of the shares. However, we will not overpay for assets. &quot;Liverpool is the most successful football club in English football history. It exists to win things for its supporters. It deserves to be in the hands of people who support it, who understand its history and legend and who share the enthusiasm and passion of its fans. As businessmen, we move on. As fans, we hope that the new owners would share the same vision as we had for LFC and, of course, in realising the new stadium that is so badly needed to ensure the club can continue to compete at the highest level in the Premiership and Europe.&quot;", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Dubai", "United Arab Emirates"], "title": "Football: DIC pull out of Liverpool deal", "sentences": ["The Dubai International Capital investment group has ended its interest in a takeover of Liverpool.", "The group, owned by the Dubai government, had been examining the club&apos;s books with a view to a \u00a3156m buy-out, but its decision to withdraw follows the failure of the Liverpool board to accept the offer last night, following a rival bid by American billionaire George Gillett.", "&quot;Dubai International Capital LLC today announces that it has decided to end negotiations with Liverpool FC and Athletic Grounds plc about a possible investment in the club,&quot; read a statement.", "The deal would have valued the club at \u00a3450m, but the Dubai group have decided to withdraw following the board&apos;s decision to allow more time to consider the Gillett bid."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jan/31/newsstory.sport9", "publicationDate": "2007-01-31T17:07:37Z"}, {"article": "9.24am: Right so, off we go. With just 14 hours and 36 minutes to go until the transfer window closes, it&apos;s time to get this show on the road. The first big news of the day is that Fifa has given Liverpool special dispensation to sign Javier Mascherano from West Ham on loan, despite the fact that he&apos;s already played competitively for two clubs - the Hammers and Corinthians - this season. The deal hasn&apos;t actually been done yet, but expect the number of sulky Argentinians sulking around Upton Park to have decreased by at least one by close of business today. 9.34am: &quot;You&apos;re not going to be doing it all by yourself until the wee hours of February are you?&quot; asks Jonathan Whiting. &quot;There&apos;s dedication and then there&apos;s sheer recklessness. &quot;To start you off here&apos;s the latest news from within the walls of Villa Park. Martin O&apos;Neill is continuing his raid on old club Celtic with Shaun Maloney apparently having signed something. We&apos;re also trying to nab Alan Smith from Manchester United but he doesn&apos;t seem to understand that playing for their reserve team is not the same as playing in the first team.&quot; Thanks for your concern Jonathan, but I won&apos;t be doing this all day. I&apos;ll probably get 40 minutes off at some point this afternoon to write a story for the Fiver. 9.38am: According to one of the papers, Javier Mascherano may not be the only player to leave West Ham today. The Daily Mail reveals that Teddy Sheringham, 153, could be on the way back to his old stomping ground White Hart Lane, assuming Spurs can offload Mido on loan to Celta Vigo. Then again, the same paper also reveals that most seahorses are promiscuous bisexuals (no, really), apart from the British spiny seahorse which remains faithful to its partner. Do you believe them? 9.44am: &quot;What possible reason can there be for ignoring rules which presumably have some reason and thought behind them so Mascherano can move to Liverpool?&quot; enquires Jamie Perry in Melbourne. &quot;There are no mitigating circumstances other than he&apos;s miserable, are there?&quot; Well there&apos;s that, the famous Scouse wit, 50 years of Anfield tradition and the fact that Fifa rules seem to be more flexible than a Russian gymnast, Jamie. Apparently the official Fifa party line is something to do with the fact that the English and Brazilian leagues do not run parallel. 9.50am: It&apos;s not difficult to see why Liverpool want to sign Javier Mascherano. He&apos;s made seven appearances for the Hammers, against Palermo (twice), Newcastle, Man City, Portsmouth, Tottenham and Everton. West Ham were beaten in every match. 9.53am: &quot;It amazes me that the Grauniad hasn&apos;t yet latched to the finalisation of Ronaldo&apos;s deal with Milan,&quot; writes Gerry Walsh in Madrid. &quot;What&apos;s up Barry, are you all watching your British belly buttons?&quot; You mean this deal, Gerry&gt;? Next!!! Incidentally, for the record, my navel is not British. 9.56am: &quot;Please run a story on Mido going to my beloved NUFC, then Glenn Roeder might read it, pull his finger out and buy someone who can score goals,&quot; writes Edgeley Mags. &quot;I&apos;m not worried about his attitude - it&apos;ll look tame next to Kieron Dyer&apos;s.&quot; I&apos;ve no problem doing my bit to nudge Mido up north, Edgeley, but do you not think that Newcastle might be better off investing in a few defenders? Obviously the lunchtime unveiling of a burley centre-half is unlikely to attract a crowd of 35,000 topless Geordie men with nothing better to do to St James&apos;s Park, but it might help Newcastle to stop conceding goals. 10.02am: Only 13 hours and 58 minutes to go ... 10.03am: &quot;We&apos;ve picked up striker Iwan Redan from Dutch outfit Willem II,&quot; writes Cardiff City fan David Matthew. &quot;He was their captain before he &apos;allegedly&apos; head butted a team mate during a recent cup tie. Willen dropped him and have shunted him out on loan to us. Wahay!! &apos;To be honest, we wouldn&apos;t have been in with a shout of signing Iwan if what happened hadn&apos;t happened,&apos; quipped Dave Jones. that&apos;s great news, David. Those Robert Page or Michael Doyle from Coventry to Cardiff start here. 10.05am: &quot;A great and thoroughly entertaining look at transfer deadline day,&quot; toadies &apos;Chez&apos; from Bristol, who hopefully isn&apos;t a middle-aged chairman with a ridiculous name like &apos;Jez&apos; from Wolverhampton. &quot;More importantly, though, did you know the lives of British seahorses have been shrouded in mystery for a long time? In fact, it took a long time to convince people that the seahorses here were actually native to our shores and not just occasional visitors. This lack of information led in 1994 to The Seahorse Trust setting up the British Seahorse Survey, designed to learn everything we can about our very secretive, enigmatic seahorses. We now know that both species migrate into deeper water (up to 80m) during the winter to overcome the ferocity of the winter storms and come into shallower water in the spring, summer and autumn to breed.&quot; Yes, that and they&apos;ve got a roving eye and can&apos;t be trusted. 10.09am: Our deadline day report is taking a decidedly Liverpool-centric anti-everywhere else bias early doors. It seems that Liverpool football club will not be going to Dubai Holding. 10.11am: Reading are reported to be on the verge of signing yet another Irishman, Alan Bennett, from their unofficial feeder club, League of Ireland outfit Cork City. This is probably because all Irishmen are industrious, skilful, talented, hard-working and desirable. Speaking of which, while I&apos;m very happy at Guardian Unlimited and have no desire to leave, if the Chelsea website wants to come in with a late swoop for me, I would obviously be very flattered by their interest. (Translation: Come. And. Get. Me.) 10.16am: Leeds have signed goalkeeper Casper Ankergren on loan from Brondby until the end of the season. The 27-year-old, who has made over 100 appearances for the Danish side, will see out the remainder of the campaign at Elland Road with the Championship club having the option of making his move permanent in the summer. 10.17am: &quot;I noticed an advert in the Guardian for the fabulous Football Weekly podcast in recent Guardians which have a picture of James and yourself,&quot; writes Andy Cronk. &quot;Are you really a thin chap with a moustache, as I always thought you were more of a rotund chap sans tache, rather than a dark haired Stephen Merchant (with tache) lookalike. Does that advert meet trading standards requirements?&quot; Ah yes, that advert. Some of the finest minds in the Guardian&apos;s &quot;creative&quot; department claim to have slaved over that concept for months, only to come up with a cartoon of me looking like Magnum PI. I can assure you that my upper-lip has never been adorned with a soup-strainer and that I don&apos;t have a mullet. However, Sean Ingle looks exactly like the preposterous image of him that appears in the same ad. 10.24am: &quot;Reading signed Alan Bennett yesterday - the whole shirt-parading shebang - and announced the signing at last night&apos;s home match before kick off, so I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a case of being &apos;on the verge&apos;,&quot; writes Justin Beasley. Finger on the pulse - that&apos;s me. 10.26am: Fascinating stuff: Bjorn Runstrom has gone from Fulham to Luton on a one-month loan, while Nicky Eaden has gone from Nottingham Forest to Lincoln City on a season-long loan. The glamour ... 10.28am: Only 13 hours and 32 minutes to go. &quot;Surely the desirability of Cork City players for Reading would imply that all Corkmen are &apos;industrious, skilful etc&apos; - doubt&apos;cha boy and so forth,&quot; writes Joe O&apos;Shea from Cork, who displays all the attributes of a Corkman by (a) thinking he&apos;s better than everyone else for no apparent reason and (b) being called Joe O&apos;Shea. I think the &quot;Corkmen&quot; he&apos;s boasting about are Kevin Doyle and Shane Long, from Wexford and Tipperary respectively. 10.30am: &quot;Re: the inevitable Mascherano signing. Just thought you&apos;d like to know all the Scousers in the office are being typically sanctimonious,&quot; writes Simon Freer. &quot;&apos;It&apos;s a stupid rule anyway&apos;, seems to be the consensus of opinion from them and they would, I&apos;m assured, make no complaints whatsoever should, say, Chelsea or Man Utd do the same. One statto even had Sheffield Utd&apos;s previous bending of the rule - I haven&apos;t bothered to check if this is true - ready as ammo.&quot; Sanctimonious Scousers? Surely not. 10.38am: &quot;As a Bolton Wanderers fan, I must report the sad news that we have been linked with Aston Villa&apos;s, erm, most mediocre J Lloyd Samuel,&quot; writes Matt Kilsby. &quot;I am hoping that this rumour is just idle press speculation as a Villa friend of mine has told me he would personally drive J Lloyd up to Bolton to sign on the dotted line. Still, I&apos;m sure there&apos;s not much to worry about as, at the age of 25, J Lloyd seems a little too young for us!&quot; I don&apos;t want to disappoint you, but I&apos;m reliably informed by a reader whose name I can&apos;t remember (and this is true!) that J Lloyd Samuel&apos;s young son bid a tearful farewell to his classmates last week - so a move looks likely. We have spies everywhere. 10.40am: What&apos;s this? Jamie England has gone from Brentford to Crawley on a free. 10.42am: &quot;Are they even letting you out for a fag?&quot; asks my Yorkshire friend Alex Hewson, managing to simultaneously show a lot of concern and no concern whatsoever for my welfare. Hopefully I get 10 minutes in a while. Uninteresting story: Hewson&apos;s old man recommended - cue: the Hovis music - Wensleydale cheese and Christmas cake together, washed down with whiskey as a Christmas treat. &quot;Cake and cheese? Together? It&apos;ll never work,&quot; I thought, at the time, while smiling in a bid to humour the peculiar Yorkshireman and his funny Yorkshire ways. But you know what? I tried it and it&apos;s very nice. 10.45am: This just in: Reading are holding talks with Stoke skipper Michael Duberry, who is also not for Cork. But that won&apos;t stop them trying to claim him - wait and see. 10.46am: West Ham are lining up an improved \u00a38m bid to bring Matthew Upson to Upton Park from Birmingham City. 10.53am: &quot;It would be great if you could animate that transfer window pic you have there. Perhaps having the players squeeze under the gap and changing into their new shirts with big comedy smiles?&quot; writes Stephen Hewitt. There&apos;s no pleasing some people. 10.55am: &quot;Any news on Celtic?&quot; asks Chris Black. &quot;Even if it is mere speculation I need to know! Don&apos;t tell me Rangers have stolen all our transfer targets as they did with Kevin Thomson last night?&quot; It&apos;s funny you should ask, Chris. Shaun Maloney is about to do one to the English club where Celtic has-beens go to die: Aston Villa. 10.58am: &quot;I should admit first that I&apos;m refreshing your page at shamefully regular intervals,&quot; writes Daniel Alexander. &quot;I do have an excuse: I&apos;m bedridden with a violent strain of influenza. Anyhow, to the chase: according to Google Images you are in fact Rob Lowe, a rather camp and sad meerkat or Michael Bolton. If pressed, I&apos;d estimate you&apos;re not at all long past 30 with a sloppy athletic build. Maybe ginger too.&quot; I&apos;m not ginger, but the rest of your description is fairly on the ball. Inside, however, I&apos;m a camp and sad meerkat. 11.01am: One small point of information for the many hundreds of you who are writing in looking for clarification on the Alan Bennett-to-Reading transfer. It is not the bespectacled homosexual playwright from Yorkshire who wrote The History Boys, but an Irish footballer of the same name. 11.04am: The yellow Sky Sports News ticker is on the move: &quot;Reading agree fee with Stoke for defender Michael Duberry,&quot; it says. The fee? \u00a3800,000. 11.06am: &quot;Working as I do with Alex Hewson,&quot; begins Simon Robertson. &quot;Can I please beg you to use this moment of heightened public interest to shame him into changing his ridiculous Japanese-Salaryman/1950&apos;s-martian-invader headphones for something less, well...twattish? I suspect only the ridicule of tens (nay hundreds) of window-watchers can manage it. It&apos;s not like he needs them to get to full effect of the subtle musical soundscapes of Iron Maiden is it?&quot; 11.08am: Reading are now holding talks with a pint of Murphy&apos;s Irish Stout, the River Lee, Rafterz nightclub, several hurling supporters in straw hats and the Sultans of Ping FC. 11.12am: &quot;To continue the cheese-and-cake-at-Christmas theme, my Dad always removes the lid of his mince pies and puts a slice of cheddar inside. Like the Wensleydale and Christmas cake it really shouldn&apos;t work but somehow it does,&quot; writes Phil Smith. 11.14am: Hold on to your hats, Canaries fans: Craig Fleming has gone from Norwich to Rotherham on a free. 11.16am: &quot;Re: Jamie England&apos;s transfer from Brentford to Crawley. Yes! This is best news and has distracted me from selling the adverts that pay your exorbitant wages,&quot; writes Jonathan Vincent from the Guardian dungeons. &quot;The rise of Crawley Town ... a wonder.&quot; 11.18am: &quot;Several Dutch media outlets are reporting that Newcastle&apos;s Alberto Luque is heading to PSV Eindhoven for a six month loan period, to give him a chance to shine again,&quot; writes Raymond Strake. &quot;Just waiting for the NUFC chairman to give the green light. But the real touching story over here is that Man City is ready to take Michael Ball from PSV. Makes you wonder how smooth some agents are.&quot; You&apos;ll be a long time waiting to see a green light anywhere near the Newcastle chairman, Raymond. I think you&apos;re more likely to find him basking in the glow of a red light. 11.21am: &quot;Hope you&apos;re well and that you have more pairs of pants then when I last saw you,&quot; writes Gary Grant from Dublin. I think we&apos;ll truncate that email there - suffice to say the anecdote in question involved copious amounts of booze, some lost luggage, a drunken stumble on Dublin&apos;s Wexford Street, a ripped pair of jeans and a knee gushing with blood. 11.28am: &quot;While we are waiting on news to develop and seen as it seems to be fair game to stick on some random news as people will refresh the page no matter what it is, can I say that Stevie&apos;s band (The Midnight Machine) are playing the Buff Club in Glasgow on Saturday night. A fiver a skull on the door. No discount for students,&quot; writes Chris Collins. that&apos;s the only gig advert I&apos;m posting, so don&apos;t send in any more. There&apos;s smoke coming out of my email inbox at the moment - she cannae take the strain ... she&apos;s goin&apos; tae blow! 11.30am: James Constable has gone from Walsall to Kidderminster for an undisclosed fee, while Shaun Lamb has gone from Bristol City to Forest Green on loan. 11.32am: &quot;Reading FC have just changed their nickname from The Royals to The Langers,&quot; writes Ian Lamont, in an amusing reference that nobody outside Ireland is likely to understand. 11.34am: &quot;I reckon you look exactly like Dara O Briain,&quot; writes Steve Arthurs. &quot;Intriguingly, and on reflection, even in the unlikely situation that you provide evidence to the contrary, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever be entirely convinced that you don&apos;t. Isn&apos;t it wonderful when the bubble won&apos;t burst?&quot; I used to know Dara O Briain when I lived in Dublin, Steve, but I haven&apos;t seen him in years apart from on the telly. While he was a very nice fella, I&apos;m sure his success has gone to his head and he&apos;s probably a big primadonna bollocks now, and probably going out with Sienna Miller or Elaine Page or somebody. I can assure you that I have more hair than Dara, weigh about two stone less and, during pauses in conversation, I don&apos;t say &quot;ehhhh&quot; in quite as camp a fashion as he does. 11.38am: It&apos;s not on the Sky ticker, but speculation is mounting that I&apos;m about to buy a can of fizzy pop, a bag of crisps and a Snickers bar from Kay the bonkers trolley-man who&apos;s just pushed his portable conveyance of delights into our office, shouting &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, it&apos;s trolley time!&quot; It&apos;ll be an undisclosed fee, somewhere in the region of \u00a31.25. 11.44am: &quot;Watch out Alan Curbishley doesn&apos;t swoop in for the Snickers bar with an offer of \u00a32.85,&quot; writes Donald Cox. 11.47am: &quot;I worked with Dara O Briain last year,&quot; writes Leon Wilson. &quot;He&apos;s still a nice guy and certainly not a primadonna, but having had to edit his stuff and having heard you on the podcast I can confirm that you do use far less &apos;ehhhhhs&apos; in conversation.&quot; I didn&apos;t say I used less, Leon. I merely made the point that my &apos;ehhhhhs&apos; don&apos;t sound as camp. Still, it&apos;s good to see O Briain hasn&apos;t gone all Elton John. 11.49am: &quot;For what it&apos;s worth, I&apos;ve long suspected you look like the unfunny one from that godawful Channel 4 fiasco The IT Crowd, not that that narrows it down much I suppose,&quot; writes Strath, who&apos;s perilously close to the truth. 11.52am: Kay the snack-purveyor has just come over, kneaded my shoulders, said &quot;I love you man&quot; and nicked today&apos;s copy of the Star off my desk. Like myself, he steals it for the articles. 11.54am: Southampton have signed Polish international striker Marek Saganowski from French side Troyes. The 28-year-old has joined on loan until the end of the season after impressing in a two-day trial, but is not registered in time to feature in today&apos;s clash with Sheffield Wednesday. 11.55am: Sensational news! Lee Canoville has gone from Boston to Shrewsbury on loan until the end of the season. 11.58am: &quot;Re. Jamie England&apos;s transfer from Brentford to Crawley Town,&quot; writes Simon Radford. &quot;Tell the bloke in your advertising department to calm down. He&apos;s rubbish - really bad. In fact, even though it is a free transfer, I still reckon that Crawley paid too much for him.&quot; 12pm: Exactly 12 hours to go ... 12.02pm: &quot;After a self-congratulatory round-robin email concerning getting Stevie&apos;s gig mentioned (11.28am) I have subsequently been informed that it is in King Tut&apos;s and not the Buff Club,&quot; writes the world&apos;s worst concert promoter, Chris Collins. &quot;Apparently most people in Glasgow now take their gig going instructions from the Guardian&apos;s live deadline day special and there is a widespread fear that my japes may leave the venue empty. Any chance of a clarification?&quot; 12.04pm: If you thought me mentioning my old best friend Dara O Briain was a pathetic exercise in name-droppery, you ain&apos;t heard nothing yet. &quot;Just heard from my mate who plays for Motherwell that they are poised to sign Stuart Lapsley from Clyde and that he is undergoing a medical at the moment,&quot; writes Francis McGuire. &quot;It&apos;s not that interesting for most but maybe good for the four Motherwell fans who read the Guardian.&quot; I had no idea that all Motherwell&apos;s fans were also Guardian readers. A coincidence or compulsory? 12.08pm: Reading have released all the Tetley&apos;s teabags in their training ground canteen and replaced them with Barry&apos;s Tea. 12.10pm: &quot;I served Dara O Brain in my bookshop last year,&quot; writes Liam Moloney. &quot;It was a little odd, because I think he expected me to say I knew who he was. But I&apos;m shy. So I didn&apos;t. He bought the Da Vinci Code. Go figure.&quot; I&apos;d imagine he bought it so that he could remove the cover and stick it over the copy of Ulysses he was reading at the time, Liam. The Dara O Briain I know wouldn&apos;t want anyone to feel intellectually inferior to him. He&apos;s good like that. 12.14pm: &quot;Barry, do I recall from the inaugural Deadline Day - Live! that it was the most-read page in the history of the internet ever and that you&apos;re claiming the credit for inventing it?&quot; asks Chris Hamley. &quot;If so, thanks a lot for another working day down the tube. Meanwhile, Kickers Offenbach have signed Germany international Marco Reich from Palace but are releasing ex-Liverpool nearly-man Sean Dundee on loan (destination as yet undisclosed).&quot; 12.15pm: The rumour-mongering continues apace. &quot;A couple of Italian sites are saying Bolton are about to sign defender Cesar from Levante, who are going to get ex-Man Utd ball-boy Kleberson from Besiktas,&quot; writes Edward Bogeira. &quot;Mads Laudrup, son of Michael, is going on trial at Barcelona.&quot; That sounds sinister. What&apos;s he supposed to have done. 12.16pm: My mate&apos;s just seen Alan Smith in a car. Could he be on the move?&quot; asks M Taylor. I don&apos;t know, M. What direction was the front of the car pointing? More importantly, were there loads of Liverpool fans shouting abuse at him while rocking it? 12.21pm: &quot;Re: namedroppery. A mate of mine over here in Ireland played golf yesterday with Lloyd Cole,&quot; writes Paul Little. &quot;Apparently he had met Cole through a golf website they both frequent. The two met for a game yesterday at the Island course in Malahide. To make things stranger, Cole had an injured knee so just walked the course and held the flag.&quot; That&apos;s a fine story, Paul. But I&apos;ll see your mate&apos;s golf with Lloyd Cole and raise you five-a-side football with Andy McCluskey from Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark. Next!!! 12.23pm: &quot;Lee Canoville&apos;s loan deal from Boston to Shrewsbury, done to ensure the Boston players actually get a wage slip this month, might not be sensational news to your readers, but it certainly is to Boston boss Steve Evans, who has embarked on a hilariously self-pitying rant on the official club website,&quot; writes Pete Brooksbank. &quot;Here&apos;s a taster: &apos;I am sick to the back teeth of selling players. It&apos;s not a time for reflection or self pity, it&apos;s about re-starting the motivation engines ... as I asked earlier this season, who motivates the motivator at times like this?&apos; &quot;So football is all about the &apos;motivation engines&apos;, apparently. You might also reasonably ask what&apos;s motivating the Boston fans who have to endure this clown, along with his slapstick behaviour - but you can ask David Conn all about that.&quot; 12.26pm: &quot;I&apos;d like to confirm your assessment of Dara O Briain as a man who &apos;wouldn&apos;t want anyone to feel intellectually inferior to him&apos;,&quot; writes Miguel Delaney. &quot;When we had our &apos;Christmas Party&apos; - on a drab Sunday night in January - we spotted him in Dublin&apos;s worst nightclub: the Viper Room. His presence made us feel only slightly less dirty for being there - it was the only place that was serving until 4am. Irish managerial failure Brian Kerr is also rumoured to be a regular.&quot; Miguel Delaney? Miguel Delaney? I&apos;m going to go out on a limb here and guess your parents might have first met in a bar in Benidorm or Marbella, Miguel. 12.31pm: Everton and some other team that might be Wigan both want to take the world&apos;s most sullen footballer, Andy &quot;Andrew&quot; Cole, on loan from Portsmouth. 12.34pm: &quot;I&apos;ll see your five-a-side football with Andy McCluskey and raise you five-a-sides with all the members of Teenage Fanclub followed by a few light refreshments in the bar afterwards,&quot; writes Chris Black. Nice try, Chris, but you&apos;re sunk now. I&apos;ll see your footie with Scotland&apos;s answer to the Beach Boys and raise you putting Johnny Vegas to bed after a session and asking Jorja Fox who plays Sara Sidle in CSI out for a drink. It&apos;s not as glam as it sounds - he was unconscious and she said no. 12.37pm: Birmingham City have signed winger Pat Kavanagh on a six-month contract. The 21-year-old right-sided midfielder had been on trial with the Coca-Cola Championship club and made two appearances for City&apos;s reserve side. Kavanagh was a free agent after parting company with Irish side University College of Dublin in November. 12.39pm: West Brom striker Stuart Nicholson has returned on loan to Bristol Rovers after agreeing a new deal. The 19-year-old has signed an 18-month contract with the Baggies with the option of a further year. 12.42pm: &quot;I had the fortune to speak to Boston United manager Steve Evans (12.23pm) recently and he described one of his own injury-prone players (who he suspected of feigning these injuries) as having &apos;a heart the size of a gnat&apos;s ass&apos;. The man is replacing Barry Fry and John Beck as the entertaining mouthpiece of the lower divisions,&quot; writes Greg Clayton. 12.44pm: &quot;It was Salou actually,&quot; writes Miguel Delaney (12.26pm). &quot;How disappointingly predictable. It also led to one nickname in college being &apos;Fabian O&apos;Neill&apos;.&quot; On a similar theme, Miguel, I know a Portuguese Mick Caffrey. 12.46pm: &quot;Apparently, Gamst, as he now likes to be known, is at Liverpool for a medical with Kewell going to other way,&quot; writes Jack McGill. &quot;At least one of them knows where the net is.&quot; 12.48pm: &quot;My friend just emailed me to say he&apos;s seen the entire Spurs first team, on a coach, in the vicinity of the Emirates Stadium. Is this going to be one of the biggest transfer coups ever?&quot; asks Dave Vigay. 12.49pm: &quot;Re : Jorja Fox from CSI not going out with you. That&apos;s a great tale,&quot; writes Graeme McPherson. &quot;I never could decide if she was attractive or not. That gap in her teeth was always a bit disconcerting. Was she better looking in real life?&quot; She&apos;s not bad at all, Graeme, though truth be told, I&apos;d have preferred to have met Marg Helgenberger/Catherine Willows out if she&apos;d been there. 12.53pm: &quot;All your attempts at sounding glamorous are frankly pathetic,&quot; writes Nick Pettigrew, failing to tell me anything I&apos;m not painfully aware of already. &quot;I once got drunk with the bloke who played Gonch in Grange Hill. Quite partial to the fruit machines, if memory serves. See? Now that&apos;s a showbiz story.&quot; 12.54pm: Another one of Motherwell&apos;s four fans has written in. &quot;Several reliable sources tell me that Richie Foran, our attacking midfielder/striker, is signing for Southend United for \u00a3150K today,&quot; writes Matt Miller. 12.56pm: &quot;Re: football with tuneful Scottish indie bands. I can claim a kickabout with assorted members of Belle &amp; Sebastian in a sunny Regents Park a couple of years ago,&quot; brags James Hopkin shamelessly. &quot;Bass player Stuart David is quite good,&quot; he adds. 12.59pm: News of an actual move. German winger Marco Reich has left Crystal Palace to join Kickers Offenbach on a free transfer. The 29-year-old penned an 18-month deal with the Eagles little more than a year ago after impressing former manager Iain Dowie, but he has struggled to make an impact under current boss Peter Taylor. 1.00pm: &quot;Regarding Birmingham&apos;s new signing Pat Kavanagh. Is &apos;parting company&apos; with University College Dublin a euphemism for him dropping out?&quot; asks John Glendinning. I don&apos;t know John, with your bastardised surname. But if it does mean what you suspect it does, then I &quot;parted company&quot; with UCD myself back in the early 90s. Best move I ever made - it&apos;s a dreadful place, full of south Dublin ponces whose only interest in life is school&apos;s rugby. As for the blokes ... 1.03pm: &quot;The bloke doing the BBC rip-off of your deadline day extravaganza has wimped off to get some lunch, oblivious to the fact deadline day waits for no man,&quot; writes Nick Clarke. &quot;Are you going to go above and beyond the call of duty on this momentous day and eat lunch at your desk?&quot; Lunch is for wimps, Nick. and besides, they don&apos;t feed me here and the chain shackling me to the desk doesn&apos;t stretch to the canteen. Here&apos;s hoping the Cristiano Ronaldo-to-Real Madrid story breaks just as my BBC nemesis is tucking into his prawn baguette. 1.08pm: Barcelona midfielder Xavi claims Manchester United have spoken to his agent about a possible switch to Old Trafford. The 27-year-old Spain international is under contract at the Nou Camp until 2010 but, according to the player, Sir Alex Ferguson wants him like a desert wants the rain. Or something. 1.10pm: &quot;I would be amazed if Jorja Fox had accepted your offer of a drink, considering she has a female partner,&quot; writes Paul Napper, going some way towards explaining the successful Hollywood actress&apos;s otherwise mystifying decision to repel my ham-fisted advances. That said, I only asked her out for a drink - I wasn&apos;t asking her to move in with me. 1.13pm: Daragh Breen has something to say, and I&apos;m inclined to agree with him. &quot;I&apos;m outraged by that relentless gossip-monger Miguel Delaney&apos;s characterisation of Brian Kerr as a managerial failure,&quot; he thunders. &quot;Kerr did a decent job with a truly awful bunch of players before being discarded by the FAI. The tragic depths to which Irish football has sunk under &apos;world class&apos; manager Stan Staunton highlights this fact. As for being an alleged regular in the Viper Room that only serves to improve the man&apos;s standing in my eyes. Oh yeah and Miguel&apos;s other nickname is Mel Delors.&quot; 1.16pm: &quot;OK, I&apos;ll see your Vegas/Fox doubleheader and raise you with my failed attempts to cop off with three young ladies at a BBC party about 13 years ago,&quot; writes Dave Newsome. It turned out they were the about-to-be-reunited three members of Bananarama. Whether my failed amatory exploits in any way influenced their career choice I cannot say. Are no interesting deals going to be done today and will we all be reduced to childish one-upmanship?&quot; Looks like we&apos;ll have to settle for childish one-upmanship at the moment, Dave. What&apos;s more, you&apos;re winning you lucky sod. I&apos;d much rather not pull Bananarama than not pull Jorja Fox. 1.19pm: &quot;Do you have to wait for the crazy trolley-man to come back to get some lunch, for fear of another Shrewsbury loan signing while you&apos;ve popped out for a sandwich?&quot; asks Sam Huxley. 1.20pm: &quot;I&apos;ve just seen Steve Coppell galloping around the people&apos;s park in Cork, asking what the locals think of his manifesto and whether they&apos;d like to sign for Reading,&quot; declares Ger Coughlan. 1.25pm: &quot;I&apos;m far more flexible than a Russian gymnast, less hirsute than Thomas Gravesen, and foxier than a WAG. Don&apos;t I deserve to get some deadline day action from the fingers of Barry Glendenning?&quot; pleads my stalker Paula Willow, who happens to be the world&apos;s most fickle obsessive. Less hirsute than Thomas Gravesen where, exactly? Actually - Dara O Briain-esque &quot;ehhhhh&quot; - don&apos;t answer that. 1.28pm: Eric Roberts is here and he has an apology for James Hopkin (12.56pm). &quot;We used to play football in Regents Park every weekend or when we weren&apos;t working,&quot; he says. &quot;Whenever someone would come along and ask for a game we&apos;d say we were musicians (rather than wasters without talent). Our favourite was to say we were Belle and Sebastian, as they&apos;re a band people have heard of but wouldn&apos;t recognise. Obviously James Hopkin thought i was the bass player.&quot; That crumbling sound you hear in the background is the last of James Hopkin&apos;s dignity. 1.31pm: Dave Newsome should have realised that it ain&apos;t what you do, it&apos;s the way that you do it. 1.33pm: Motherwell continue to dominate the transfer deadline day headlines. Hungarian U21 midfielder Krisztian Vadocz has gone on loan from Auxerre to Motherwell until the end of the season. 1.37pm: &quot;Where all these transfers then?&quot; asks Michael Crowman. There aren&apos;t any, Michael. Hence all the padding. 1.38pm: There are sharp intakes of breath all around the Guardian Unlimited sports desk: Watford have signed Gareth Williams from Leicester for an undisclosed fee. 1.42pm: &quot; Bosco&apos;s Boys Club in Midleton, County Cork, have announced that they are now Reading&apos;s official feeder club because Cork City have no players left,&quot; writes Keith Parker. 1.44pm: &quot;I&apos;d be quite interested to hear how James Hopkin is bearing up after Eric Roberts has just torn him a new one! Any news about Bury would be greatly received too, does anyone want Chris Brass?&quot; writes Alan Horrocks. I&apos;d be interested to know how stupid James Hopkin feels too. The only way he can possibly emerge from this situation with any dignity is if the Eric Roberts who pretended to be the bass player for Belle &amp; Sebastian turns out to be the not-very-successful brother of movie actress Julia.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "title": "Deadline day live - 9am-2pm", "sentences": ["It seems that Liverpool football club will not be going to Dubai Holding."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jan/31/newsstory.sport8", "publicationDate": "2007-01-31T17:13:19Z"}, {"article": "2.03pm: It&apos;s official, James Hopkin&apos;s dignity is in tatters. &quot;I&apos;m not that Eric Roberts,&quot; writes Eric Roberts. &quot;My sister is called Sara, not Julia.&quot; 2.06pm: &quot;How could you run out of space?&quot; asks Conor Walker. &quot;Did you just break the Internet?&quot; 2.07pm: This just in: Bayern Munich manager Felix Magath is now former Bayern Munich manager Felix Magath. &quot;Perhaps it was due to a rift over selling Owen Hargreaves to United?&quot; writes Mike Gibbons. &quot;Let&apos;s hope so as it might liven up a day that was supposed to be filled with a blizzard of transfer activity.&quot; 2.10pm: &quot;Liverpool player Danny O&apos;Donell (currently on loan) is rumoured to be signing on the dotted line for Swindon,&quot; writes Nicky Howells. 2.12pm: &quot;I&apos;m willing to bet pence that you are the spitting image of that Justin Lee Collins bloke off the television (though not sure what he does)&quot; writes Si Chlopas. &quot;However, where he has a folksy burr you have a soft lilt. Just to add to the tension, I have no transfer speculation whatsoever.&quot; You owe me pence if we ever meet, Si. I owe you a slap for the vile suggestion that I am anything like that hairy Bristolian moron. Come orn! 2.15pm: &quot;Is there a bell that sounds &apos;last orders&apos; just before the transfer window shuts?&quot; asks Paul Cihlar. I don&apos;t think there is Paul, but there certainly should be. 2.17pm: &quot;To stick up for James Hopkin, I too have played football with Belle &amp; Sebastian in Regents Park. And I know who they are, so the cunning Eric Roberts and his pals wouldn&apos;t have been able to pull the wool over my eyes,&quot; declares Matt Powell, who is probably James Hopkin writing in under a pseudonym in a futile bid to salvage his last remaining vestiges of cred. Do the kids even use the word &quot;cred&quot; anymore? I don&apos;t know. What word would Peaches Geldof use? 2.20pm: Could all the pedants out there stop mailing me with anoraky emails about the year Bananarama formed. James Newsome made a mistake - I&apos;ll fix it in 10 minutes when my happy-go-lucky colleague Scott Murray takes over from me and I go back to correct all my typos and insert jokes and comebacks to make myself look more witty than I actually am. 2.22pm: &quot;Gentlemen, the kickabout in question was Thursday April 4 2002, the day after I saw the band play at Brixton Academy,&quot; writes James Hopkin. Ah, so Belle &amp; Sebastian were in London, the kickabout was in London ... who else could it have been. That&apos;s my mum&apos;s birthday, too. 2.24pm: &quot;Brighton. Have they signed anyone? Are they looking like signing anyone? Namely Micky Adams? Or are we to be condemned to free-fall like a seagull hit by a mid-air breeze block?&quot; asks Giles Page. 2.30pm: Right, that&apos;s me done for the day. Scott Murray is taking over from me now, so you can start bothering him now. Thanks for your time and your emails, many of which I haven&apos;t opened yet and will probably end up binning without reading. Sorry about that. And sorry for the complete lack of transfer news. Still, Michael Duberry and the entire population of Cork to Reading ... it&apos;s better than nothing. 2.35pm DISCLAIMER: Right, Roy from The IT Crowd&apos;s off for cigarettes, coffee and a good old sob in the toilets. Now, I haven&apos;t had too much time to bone up on this morning&apos;s themes, riffs and crowbarred-in conceits - and indeed the transfers so far - so bear with me while I get up to speed on what the hell&apos;s going on. So apologies if I tediously repeat things you&apos;ve heard 100 times before... though then again that is house style. 2.40pm: Michael Ball has joined Manchester City from PSV for an undisclosed fee (that&apos;s shorthand for far too much). Andy Taylor has moved from Blackburn to Huddersfield on a one-month loan - neither Baz nor myself are sure whether that one&apos;s gone in already. 2.45pm: Nothing much doing at the moment. &quot;Boston have signed Lincoln defender Colin Cryan,&quot; writes Alan Horrocks. &quot;They&apos;ve been Cryan out for another defender. Ha ha, I&apos;m so witty. Any jobs in the headline-writing dept. down at Fiver Towers?&quot; Not for the likes of you, Horrocks, that&apos;s a wee bit too sharp for us. 2.53pm: Sebastian Larsson has signed a full-time deal with Birmingham; one million pounds that&apos;s cost them. &quot;Is there actually any confirmation from Reuters (or whoever provides this stuff) as to whether Colin Cryan has actually joined Boston?&quot; asks Matt Kilsby. &quot;I suspect that Alan Horrocks has made up said transfer to showcase his rather &apos;unique&apos; comedic talents.&quot; I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re mistaking me for a scrupulous journalist, Matt. Oh alright, I&apos;ll find out if I must. 3pm: Still no word of Matthew Upson&apos;s rumoured switch from Premiership hopefuls Birmingham to Championship-bound West Ham, but Sky Sports News keep droning on about it and I&apos;ve got bugger all else to write, so you&apos;re going to have to share my pain. They really reckon it&apos;s bound to happen because he didn&apos;t train this morning, or something. Anyway, there you have it. Incidentally, Steve Bruce was insisting that Upson should do the &quot;honourable thing&quot; and see out the contract he signed. Steve Bruce. Seeing out contracts. Honour. It&apos;s so relaxing when you don&apos;t even have to join the dots... 3.05pm: Michael Ball / Love Changes Everything gags so far: 13. Emails asking if I have been the subject of a deadline day transfer from Bristol City to Guardian Unlimited: lost count. Please make it stop. 3.15pm: There&apos;s nothing going on whatsoever, so let&apos;s just make things up to while away the time. Tom McKay can start; he&apos;d like to move quickly to quash the Pedersen/Kewell swap rumour: &quot;My mate Deano works as an asphalt distribution operative in Liverpool and is currently doing up Rafa Benitez&apos;s driveway. Over a morning latte just yesterday, Rafa let it slip that Harry Kewell was on the verge of signing a lucrative contract with Speke Utd, who are currently flying high at the top of the Frank Armitt Liverpool County Combination League. Gamst is going nowhere, this is mere wishful thinking dreamt up by some scouser who&apos;s been hit round the head too many times by his girlfriend&apos;s Louis Vuitton hand luggage.&quot; 3.20pm: Right, I&apos;m going to make something happen. Here&apos;s how: I&apos;m off for a cigarette. If that doesn&apos;t guarantee a couple of \u00a330m shocks in the next five minutes, nothing will. You&apos;ll thank me for this. 3.30pm: Well, that didn&apos;t work, I couldn&apos;t smoke out any more transfers. There&apos;s still been no news - although Ottmar Hitzfeld has taken over at Bayern Munich from the sacked Felix Magath; he&apos;ll be there until the summer. &quot;My mate&apos;s just seen the ENTIRE Aston Villa team on their way up to Newcastle,&quot; reports Jamie Mecken, to a backdrop of tom-tom rolls, cymbal crashes and xylophone trills. &quot;Are they going to sign them all?&quot; 3.35pm: Some more Euro news: striker Fabrice Pancrate has moved from PSG to Real Betis, Italy goalkeeper Ivan Pelizzoli has left Reggina to Lokomotiv Moscow, and Monaco lend young striker S\u00e9bastien Grax to Alain Perrin&apos;s Sochaux, where he&apos;ll no doubt form a dazzling partnership with Anthony Le Tallec. 3.40pm: Boston&apos;s big Colin Cryan move is ON for sure, I&apos;m reliably informed. Additionally, according to Gerry Murphy, there&apos;s a track on the magnificent &apos;Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era&apos; called Sugar &amp; Spice by Cryan Shames. &quot;They were, amazingly, from Boston.&quot; 3.45pm: &quot;Surely this is a spectacular waste of the Guardian&apos;s money and resources?&quot; asks the perceptive Ben Watson. You&apos;ll be pleased to know, Ben, that the Guardian won&apos;t be going bankrupt any time soon: the moneymen have got an outrageous scam going downstairs with a Coke machine that doesn&apos;t dispense any tins of delicious teeth-and-bone-powdering syrup drink, but keeps the money you put in it nevertheless. I&apos;m wise to their game, and will be going for cigarettes at regular intervals to redress the balance. 3.50pm: Not sure if this has been up already or not, but just in case: Gareth Bale is staying at Southampton until the end of the season, at which point there will be six weeks of speculation that he will join Tottenham, culminating in a sudden transfer to Manchester United or Arsenal. 3.55pm: Tottenham midfielder Reto Ziegler is off to Sampdoria on loan until the end of the season. Meanwhile, there&apos;s more regarding Colin Cryan, Boston, the Cryan Shames and Nuggets: &quot;Most of that box-set&apos;s content is 1960s garage rock,&quot; notes Clarry McDonald. &quot;London&apos;s hotbed for 1960s to modern-day garage rock is The Dirty Water Club at... The Boston Manor Arms.&quot; 4pm: Eight hours of tedium to go until this farce is all over, and as Middlesbrough unveil South Korea international Dong Gook Lee in a press conference, they confirm there will be no more new faces at the Riverside until the summer. Meanwhile in other news, Dubai International Capital have pulled out of their proposed takeover of Liverpool. By the time LFC finally get the money together to build a new Anfield, half of Stanley Park will be under water. 4.05pm: &quot;Given that the only transfer to affect one of the top clubs (Mascherano to Liverpool) happened before you or Glendenning started,&quot; writes Nath Jones, &quot;do you reckon your bosses are regretting the decision to pay both of you a day&apos;s wages to watch Sky Sports News?&quot; Very possibly, though I refer you to the aforementioned Coke machine scam; the suits are clawing it back hand over fist, Nath, hand over fist. And they&apos;re not the only ones! &quot;You think you&apos;ve got problems,&quot; begins Jason Knight, teeing himself up for an elongated whinge. &quot;On my recent sojourn to the vending machine downstairs I failed to make the Maltesers drop out. Undeterred, I put another 40p in for the Twix I wanted, hoping it&apos;d dislodge them. It didn&apos;t. So then I had to get ANOTHER packet of Maltesers, which is at least twice as many as I wanted in the first place.&quot; Can anyone put a stop to these footpads? 4.10pm: After the this-is-futile jazz-riff stylings of Ben Watson and Nath Jones, Nick Pettigrew becomes the latest person to tell me something I don&apos;t know. &quot;It comes to something when you&apos;re reduced to talking about transfers that aren&apos;t happening.&quot; Preach on, brother. &quot;In addition to Gareth Bale not leaving Southampton, I can also confirm that Ronaldinho will not being joining Watford and Harry Kewell will not be signing for Real Madrid (worse luck).&quot; 4.15pm: Sayed Shah writes in to say that when he was a kid, he once got his hand stuck in the change slot of a vending machine in a sports centre for nearly an hour. It speaks volumes that this tale genuinely piqued my interest for a couple of minutes. 4.25pm: The striker Richie Foran has moved from Motherwell to Southend in a \u00a3200,000 deal. Brendan Hallissey wants to join in the great Boston co-incidence riff, so much so he&apos;s too excited to communicate in proper sentences: &quot;Boston FC -&gt; Boston MA -&gt; Boston Manor Arms -&gt; Boston, a village in Co. Clare... which is also largely rock (though not garage) - and stuck in the 60s.&quot; 4.30pm: Once again, nothing&apos;s going on, so I might as well attend to my nicotine habit. I may give that vending machine a proper shoeing when I go past as well. 4.37pm: There are claims that West Ham are after Andy Cole. Is that new? I don&apos;t know. If it is, my plan to smoke out an interesting rumour has borne fruit. No need to thank me, it&apos;s all part of the service. 4.40pm: GUARDIAN UNLIMITED REPORTER&apos;S INTEREST PIQUED AT TEDIOUS ANECDOTE (WHICH SAYS IT ALL) DEPT. PT.II When John Malcolm was a kid, he once got his laces stuck in the top stair of an escalator. 4.50pm: Lawrie Sanchez insists he wasn&apos;t trying to convince someone - anyone - to take Northern Ireland&apos;s David Healy away from Leeds, and has sort of apologised to Dennis Wise for, er, not doing it. Healy&apos;s staying put, anyway. That&apos;s sort of transfer news, isn&apos;t it? &quot;You may be onto something with the vending machine / transfer window connection,&quot; writes Gregor Ramsay, crediting me with far too much intelligence as I was simply moaning about being grifted by The Man. &quot;Both are designed to satisfy that instant need, but you usually end up disappointed, paying inflated prices for something that has passed its sell by date.&quot; Ladies and gentlemen, please be upstanding for The Weaver. 4.55pm: &quot;Instead of tarting around discussing &apos;great vending machines I have known&apos;, how about keeping your nose to the ground and reporting THE story of the day?&quot; demands Bill Richards, who has for some reason come to Guardian Unlimited Sport expecting proper journalism, but in truth also makes a fair point. So here goes: &quot;Northampton Town have signed 20 year old Everton central defender Mark Hughes for an undisclosed fee.&quot; Thanks for that. 5pm: News is what we&apos;re all about, so here we go: Grimsby have landed Cambridge United defender Matty Bloomer on loan until the end of the season, while Stoke have signed married netminder Russell Hoult from West Brom on a free transfer. 5.05pm: SOME PROPER EXCITEMENT!!! Heart of Midlothian&apos;s flying winger Pele Hartley - who had been somewhat improbably linked with Rangers - has agreed to join Celtic, subject to a medical. 5.10pm: It&apos;s all happening. Everton have finally got their loan deal for Benfica midfielder Manuel Fernandes sorted out; he&apos;ll be at Goodison until the end of the season. Two sizeable deals in five minutes; I really don&apos;t know how to react to this. 5.20pm: The calm after the storm: Si Wilson writes in to point out that Sky Sports were first with the Matty Bloomer to Grimsby news, a mere five hours ahead of your super soaraway Guardian Unlimited. Meanwhile Jon Yeats&apos; friend Richard has never got any of his appendages trapped in the orifices of a vending machine, but did once get his head stuck in the doors of a bus. &quot;Alas, it was stationary. The driver waited until everyone alighted before releasing him.&quot; 5.30pm: Everton might not be stopping their shopping with Fernandes; rumours abound that David Moyes is thinking about taking Andy Cole off Portsmouth&apos;s hands. Meanwhile Chesterfield - who let&apos;s not forget were recently totally owned by Franny Vines&apos; yellow-and-blue Basingstoke Town army - are improving their lot with Torquay United forward Jamie Ward and Mouscron defender Sebastien Grimaldi. 5.35pm: A brief flurry of deals: Geoff Horsfield has joined Leicester on loan from Sheffield United. Brighton have signed Le Harve&apos;s Alexis Bertin; he&apos;s contracted up until the end of the season. Coventry look like they&apos;ll pip Dundee United to New Zealand international defender Che Bunce. And Norwich have signed winger Simon Lappin from St Mirren. 5.45pm: More action at Leicester, where Spurs winger Mark Yeats turns up with the express intention of sticking around until the end of the season. Meanwhile Steve Coppell&apos;s defender spree continues apace, as Michael Duberry joins Reading from Stoke for an undisclosed fee. It&apos;s six hours and 15 minutes until we can all stop this dance; a mere 45 minutes until a replacement turns up for your jaded hack. 5.55pm: OK, this is probably the biggest deal of the day so far: West Ham have signed Matthew Upson for an initial \u00a36m fee. Honour-and-contract-obsessed Birmingham boss Steve Bruce simply won&apos;t be able to understand it. Oh Matthew, how could you! 6.05pm: Another lovely lull. &quot;So how exactly did the passengers alight from the bus if Jon Yeats&apos; friend Richard had his head stuck in them?&quot; asks Roger Hughes. &quot;It all sounds quite implausible to me.&quot; I&apos;m only guessing, Roger, but perhaps the bus boasted two sets of doors. 6.10pm Still no more news, but at least here&apos;s the first vending-machine related email for one hour and 20 minutes. &quot;We found out at university that if you tip the machines to a 45-degree angle, you&apos;d get a free can,&quot; claims educated thug Simon Atkinson. &quot;We used to do it quite often until my mate Mike was found trapped under it.&quot; It gets easier by the day to understand what made Paul Calf tick, doesn&apos;t it. 6.15pm: All I can offer here is Southampton boss George Burley on Sky Sports News, looking smug over Gareth Bale&apos;s decision to stay put at St Mary&apos;s, as well as his capture of Polish striker Marek Saganowski on loan from Troyes until the end of the season. Meanwhile Adam Connor is on hand to further ease Roger Hughes&apos; bus-door confusion: &quot;Bus doors fold as they open. Jon Yeats&apos; friend Richard could have got his head stuck as they opened, thereby allowing the passengers to alight around him and the fable to remain true.&quot; 6.20pm: Chalk up another story which could have been reported earlier but I wasn&apos;t here and have no way of knowing: Preston have bought Brighton goalkeeper Wayne Henderson for a fee which could wheech up to \u00a3200,000 depending on whatever. 6.30pm: Derby have signed Jon Macken from Crystal Palace; it&apos;s a free transfer. Mike Shallcross wishes to report another run-in with a moody vending machine (of sorts): &quot;I was \u00a34 up on the quiz machine in the pub on London Bridge station that smells of sick, and it switched itself off when I went to collect.&quot; Maybe you should have got educated thug Simon Atkinson and his uni goons to smash it up, Mike. 6.40pm: Nothing to see here. But I can report that Mike Adamson will be along in a couple of minutes to take up the very long lengths of slack. Send your emails to mike.adamson@theguardian.com - he&apos;ll be taking you all the way up to midnight here. Thanks for all your emails on what has been a stunningly tedious afternoon of transfer non-frenzy.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "title": "Deadline day minute-by-minute", "sentences": ["Meanwhile in other news, Dubai International Capital have pulled out of their proposed takeover of Liverpool."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jan/31/newsstory.sport5", "publicationDate": "2007-01-31T22:53:58Z"}, {"article": "Liverpool are on the verge of following Manchester United by slipping into the hands of an American billionaire after Dubai International Capital, dismayed at what it considers unacceptable procrastination by the Premiership club&apos;s board, decided to withdraw its takeover bid. DIC, the state-owned private equity firm given exclusive rights to negotiate a takeover and scrutinise the club&apos;s books last month, announced yesterday it was &quot;disappointed&quot; but felt compelled to break off talks. The decision is understood to have been taken by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and imposed on DIC&apos;s chief executive, Sameer al Ansari, who had issued a 12-hour ultimatum to Liverpool to make a decision in its favour. DIC were frustrated by the decision on Tuesday by Liverpool&apos;s chairman, David Moores, to examine a \u00a3175m counter bid by George Gillett Jr, owner of the Montreal Canadiens ice hockey team and formerly of the Harlem Globetrotters, at a board meeting at a Docklands hotel before the Premiership match at West Ham. That offer will now be pursued and is likely to be agreed within the next few days. That will infuriate DIC. Al Ansari&apos;s group believed Moores had agreed in principle to its \u00a3155m package, which valued club shares at \u00a34,500 each, with assurances that it would fund the \u00a3180m new stadium on Stanley Park and cover the club&apos;s \u00a380m debts. However, relations became strained recently with Moores arguing with DIC officials at the recent home game with Chelsea. The emergence of Gillett&apos;s bid, submitted last week, has offered Liverpool a convenient alternative, valuing the club at nearer \u00a35,000 a share. Moores would stand to make some \u00a38m more if he sold his 51.6% stake to the American with shareholders, including Granada and the building tycoon Steve Morgan, anxious to examine a better financial offer. The feeling within Liverpool was that the offer from Gillett - whose initial interest, expressed last year, the board felt significantly undervalued the club - was moving ahead of DIC, with Moores impressed with the 69-year-old&apos;s focus and enthusiasm. One lingering fear over the American&apos;s designs on the club&apos;s new stadium were allayed when Liverpool received written assurances that Gillett - who amassed his fortune through the food industry - would not pursue the option of a shared arena with Everton. Liverpool officials have insisted privately that DIC merely jumped before it was pushed. The validity of that argument rather overlooks the fact that the board were deeply shocked when informed the Dubai group was to withdraw its offer. &quot;Having completed due diligence, DIC submitted a comprehensive offer to the board,&quot; said the group in a statement. &quot;The offer had been accepted in principle by majority shareholder David Moores but it appears that the Liverpool board and Mr Moores were then unable to approve these terms in order to allow DIC to make a formal offer to all shareholders.&quot; &quot;We are very disappointed,&quot; added Al Ansari, a long-standing supporter of the club. &quot;Liverpool&apos;s investment requirements have been well publicised and after a huge amount of work we proposed a deal that would provide the club with the funds it needs, both on and off the pitch. We were also prepared to offer shareholders a significant premium on the market price of the shares. However, we will not overpay for assets. As businessmen we move on.&quot; Liverpool released their own statement last night in an attempt to reassure fans and shareholders that the takeover process had not been derailed by DIC&apos;s withdrawal. &quot;The process of seeking new owners for the club is still under way and a decision on the future will be taken in the next few days,&quot; they said.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Liverpool", "Dubai", "United Arab Emirates"], "title": "American takeover likely as Dubai group dumps Liverpool", "sentences": ["Liverpool are on the verge of following Manchester United by slipping into the hands of an American billionaire after Dubai International Capital, dismayed at what it considers unacceptable procrastination by the Premiership club&apos;s board, decided to withdraw its takeover bid.", "The validity of that argument rather overlooks the fact that the board were deeply shocked when informed the Dubai group was to withdraw its offer."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/01/newsstory.sport6", "publicationDate": "2007-02-01T00:50:27Z"}, {"article": "&quot;Tiger Woods versus Ernie Els - who will emerge as king of the desert?&quot; asks the programme for this year&apos;s Dubai Desert Classic. As an exercise aimed at drumming up interest in a tournament this was a perfectly reasonable question to ask, but as a genuine sporting conundrum it promised about as much cliff-hanging drama as the fourth round of the FA Cup. Ask anyone here this week - caddies, players, officials - and you will find no one who is prepared to bet against Woods retaining the title he won at the Emirates club last year. Even Els, who has won here three times in the past but never when Woods was in the field, seemed doubtful about his hopes of beating the world No1 over four rounds. &quot;I&apos;ve got to play really well, to the best of my ability, to try and beat him. And even then, hopefully he&apos;s not the guy to have to beat on Sunday,&quot; he said yesterday, before adding the rather doleful conclusion. &quot;But he probably will be.&quot; If the South African sounded somewhat downbeat it was with just cause. Many world-class players have suffered at the hands of Woods&apos; brilliance over the past decade but perhaps none as much as the talented Els, who carried an eight-shot lead over the American at the 1998 Johnnie Walker Classic in Thailand and still lost to him in a play-off. Els has gone on to win many tournaments around the world since then, including the 2002 Open Championship, but never when Woods has been in contention. This litany of misery was made even more painful in Dubai last year when Woods, playing well below his best, still managed to edge the South African in a play-off. &quot;The last year and a half I haven&apos;t been quite up to my highest standard, partly due to injury,&quot; Els said. &quot;But this year I&apos;ve got some clear goals and I want to climb back up the hill. I feel like I&apos;m energised again.&quot; He will need to be. Woods arrived in the Gulf at 4am on Tuesday morning after a 16-hour flight from San Diego, where he won the Buick Classic on Sunday afternoon, and spent yesterday glad-handing with the tournament sponsors, who have paid him a reported $3m (\u00a31.5m) to show up here. He was also scheduled to visit the site of a course he has signed up to design. Yet he still seemed full of energy. &quot;Whatever tournament I enter, I am going to try and win it,&quot; he said when ask to explain his plans for the season ahead. This sounded ominous for the likes of Els. Woods&apos; seven-tournament winning streak in the US might not be much more than a PGA Tour-inspired effort to drum up interest in the game in a era when the competition from other American sports is ever more intense, but there is no denying Woods has surpassed even his own extraordinary standards in recent times. Since missing the cut at the US Open in June last year, the worst he has finished in a 72-hole tournament anywhere in the world is joint second place - an eight-month stretch covering 12 events, including two majors, the Open at Royal Liverpool and the PGA Championship at Medinah, both of which Woods won. Apart from rewriting the records books and accumulating many millions during this astonishing run, Woods has also converted most of his rivals into awe-struck admirers.

Was it the weather? Is everyone still skint after Christmas? Did somebody die? Why, even Harry Redknapp, the wheeler-dealer other wheeler-dealers call The Closer, didn&apos;t surface until late last night, when we&apos;d spent the day worrying about his whereabouts and general wellbeing. Then just as we were ringing the dairies to see about getting his picture printed and distributed on milk cartons nationwide, it emerged that the Portsmouth manager had actually been keeping his hand in by trying to sign Fulham&apos;s Senegalese midfielder Papa Bouba Diop on loan, only to see the deal collapse around his ears late doors due to work permit problems. Oh Harry. It&apos;s not as if we&apos;ve much else to write about here today, now that the transfer window&apos;s slammed shut leaving only Javier Mascherano and the runts of Frank Lampard&apos;s litter of French mastiff puppies with their cute moist noses pressed up against the glass. Of course it would be remiss of us not to devote a bit more of the word count to ridiculing the howls of anguish with which Birmingham City boss Steve Bruce greeted the sale of Matthew Upson to West Ham, even if it does mean going over old ground. &quot;Matt was crucial to our Premiership ambitions and I expected him to see out his contract,&quot; wailed the Birmingham manager, who numbers both Wigan and Crystal Palace among the clubs he had left high and dry in the past. So, then ... rumours. Eh, despite seeing their advances repelled by Liverpool, the Dubai International Consortium has decided it still wants a Premiership club, and has turned its attentions to Newcastle United in the Premiership bargain bin. Buying Newcastle would be a lot cheaper for Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, and not just because he wouldn&apos;t have to spend any money on polish for the St James&apos;s Park silverware. Major shareholders the Hall family are desperate to get rid of their shares, and only the very stout, immovable force that is Freddy Shepherd prevented the club from going the way of Manchester United and Aston Villa and falling into American hands late last year. And with today&apos;s excuse for a Rumour Mill drawing to a close, let&apos;s all spare a thought for unemployed snake-oil merchant Sven-Goran Eriksson who, according to today&apos;s Mail, will have to scrape by on half-pay from now until the end of June.

One of our many lovable national customs demands the use of a phrase unique to German football terminology; the voice on the radio or TV will always insist (with a hint of regret) that both sides &quot;trennten sich unentschieden&quot;. They &quot;parted company undecided&quot;. It is unsure if this quirk can survive much longer after Wednesday&apos;s extraordinary hat-trick: three trite, uneventful draws decided everything - or, to be more precise, the fate of three managers at three of the league&apos;s most successful clubs. At Gladbach, Jupp Heynckes&apos; unhappy tenure was brought to an end following another drab draw in the relegation battle. Shortly before midnight, Thomas Doll had lost the last remnants of sympathy on the Hamburg board. Their 1-1 draw with Energie Cottbus leaves them holding the &quot;red lantern&quot; - the German version of the wooden spoon - in the dark hole at the bottom of the table. But the biggest drama was naturally once again played out under the sunny Bavarian sky. The morning after a thoroughly depressing 0-0 stalemate with lowly Bochum at the Allianz Arena, after which Bayern were booed off, Felix Magath took training and left, only to be asked back to S\u00e4benerstrasse for a meeting with the board in the afternoon. The 53-year-old went to have his hair cut and returned to find his head on the chopping block. Afterwards, chief-executioner Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, known as &quot;Killer Kalle&quot; for his cold and sometimes downright ruthless demeanour, told the press about a &quot;regretful move&quot; that had been necessary in view of the club&apos;s league position. After one point from six in 2007, Bayern find themselves in a fourth spot that would entitle them only to participate in the Uefa Cup: &quot;the losers&apos; cup&quot;, according to president Franz Beckenbauer, and obviously quite beneath them. Bild, Germany&apos;s biggest tabloid, first broke the news of Magath&apos;s marching orders. Their columnist Beckenbauer, who is away on business in Dubai and was not consulted before the decision, had tipped them off. The paper described the event as &quot;a panic move&quot;, but in fact only the timing really surprised. Magath was always likely to be relieved of his position at the end of the season. Despite winning unprecedented back-to-back doubles, he had long lost the faith of his players and the board. It wasn&apos;t so much the two bad results after the winter break but the veritable smorgasbord of inadequacies on show that hastened his departure. Systematic play was nonexistent. The entire team looked befuddled, gripped by a sense of insecurity. Magath is not to blame for the disastrous transfer policy that is the root cause of Bayern&apos;s malaise - that responsibility lies with the board. But he compounded matters by not talking enough to his players. His policy of professional distance did not lend itself to the integration of new, young recruits like Lukas Podolski and it precluded the implementation of a modern tactical concept. &quot;Not the end of an era,&quot; wrote S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung  today in recognition of the team&apos;s arrested development under Magath. In fairness, Magath&apos;s emphasis on physical fitness did enable Bayern to overrun their rivals. At their best, in the spring of 2005, they played a powerful, muscular attacking game. That might have been enough to &quot;dominate a domestic competition who are falling behind in Europe by the minute&quot; (K\u00f6lner Stadt-Anzeiger) but, in the Champions League, Magath&apos;s tactical shortcomings were sadly evident. After the humiliating 4-1 defeat by AC Milan last season, a number of senior players privately complained about the lack of a coherent strategy. Magath &quot;the Lord of the Medicine Balls&quot; (SZ), failed to see the point. &quot;Tactics are something for bad players,&quot; he quipped a few weeks ago. It&apos;s easy to forget that Magath was hailed as &quot;the super-brain of the Bundesliga&quot; when he took over in Munich in 2004. A well-read, incredibly charming and witty man, he could talk for hours about football&apos;s similarities with chess, a game he taught himself in the late 70s. He had a reformist agenda; his declared aim was to shake Bayern out of their passive, slow style that characterised the last year of his predecessor Ottmar Hitzfeld. He managed to do that in his first season but then everything started to fall apart in the Dubai training camp of January 2006. Inexplicably, Magath spent 10 whole days without speaking to anybody - not to the players, not to the board - and, after the Milan debacle, relations had become so strained that the board were debating his replacement. In one episode, he spent a whole hour in a car next to general manager Uli Hoeness without saying anything, then snapped: &quot;If you want to fire me, you only have to tell me.&quot; Winning a second German Cup final in May narrowly saved his neck but, in November, Hitzfeld was already quietly offering his services before an impressive win away to Leverkusen convinced Hoeness to stick with the current regime a bit longer. But Bayern&apos;s football only became more horrid and totally devoid of any vision. &quot;Bayern&apos;s ambitions are global, yet the means and the football remain German,&quot; criticised the Stadt-Anzeiger. For Frankfurter Rundschau, Hitzfeld&apos;s return only proves &quot;Bayern&apos;s lack of imagination&quot;, but there were hardly any alternative candidates of the required stature. The club hope that the new old boss will be eager to prove a point after almost three years in semi-retirement. &quot;I feel at home here, as if I&apos;d never been away,&quot; he said at his first press conference today. Bayern have not ruled out prolonging the engagement beyond this season; worryingly for their supporters though, the names of Sven-Goran Eriksson and Gerard Houllier have also been mentioned. In the end it&apos;ll certainly need more than one new body to reanimate the comatose giant; Bayern will have to ditch their prudent attitude and start spending big on players. Der Tagesspiegel puts it succinctly: &quot;Instead of changing the manager, they will only be helped by a change of ideology.&quot; Results: Bayer Leverkusen 0-2 Werder Bremen, Bayern Munich 0-0 VFL Bochum, Borussia Monchengladbach 0-0 Nurnberg, Hamburg 1-1 Cottbus, Hannover 96 5-0 Hertha Berlin, Mainz 1-0 Borussia Dortmund, Schalke 04 2-1 Alemania Aachen, VfB Stuttgart 3-2 Arminia Bielefeld, Wolfsburg 2-2 Eintracht Frankfurt.", "tags": ["European club football", "Football", "Sport", "Bayern Munich"], "title": "Football: why Bayern had to sack Magath", "sentences": ["Their columnist Beckenbauer, who is away on business in Dubai and was not consulted before the decision, had tipped them off.", "He managed to do that in his first season but then everything started to fall apart in the Dubai training camp of January 2006."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/01/europeanfootball.bayernmunich", "publicationDate": "2007-02-01T16:59:10Z"}, {"article": "PEARCE WINS, ENGLAND AND CITY LOSE? When Stuart Pearce announced he was taking over from Peter Taylor as England Under-21 manager on Sunday, his employers at Manchester City donned their tin hats, took cover and announced that he was not. They were worried Pearce couldn&apos;t serve two masters, clearly unaware that in his early days at Brian Clough&apos;s Nottingham Forest, their minion used to advertise his services as an electrician in the matchday programme without ever compromising his progress as an uncompromising left-back. But today it was announced that blazers from City and the FA have thrashed out a compromise that will allow Pearce, assisted by Nigel Pearson, to take over the U-21s for next Tuesday&apos;s friendly against Spain and this summer&apos;s European Championships, where it is expected their dressing-room walls will reverberate to the raw punk frenzies of The Lurkers, instead of the wishy-washy R&amp;B noodlings most young footballers seem bewilderingly keen on. However, as a sop to his bosses at City, Pearce will sit out a proposed friendly in March, staying at Eastlands to rewire the volt supply wires on the floodlight circuit boards instead. &quot;It is a fantastic honour for me,&quot; roared Pearce, gritting his teeth and pumping his fist so triumphantly that the earth sped up briefly. &quot;I was planning to attend the June tournament for scouting purposes and now I will have an opportunity of getting more out of the competition by working with the best youngsters in this country and pitting my wits against coaches from different nations.&quot; But while thoroughly competent FA supremo Brian Barwick claims to have &quot;enjoyed polite and amicable conversations with Manchester City&quot;, the club&apos;s fans are reported to be less polite on the subject of Pearce&apos;s moonlighting. &quot;Andy Cole will never leave Man City. His heart is in it too much and he wouldn&apos;t leave England for Ghana anyway,&quot; thundered Jake D on the most up-to-date chat forum the Fiver could find that didn&apos;t require a lengthy form-filling process to gain access.

I try very hard to give these people a sense of the heart and soul of our game, what it means to people here. I&apos;m sure at some stage I will be able to offer the same invite to whoever eventually invests in Liverpool and they will be bored stiff for about 20 hours while I tell them about the first game I went to in 1961 and every game I&apos;ve been to subsequently. Obviously Liverpool Football Club is very precious and pertinent to me&quot; - FA chief suit Brian Barwick offers to give the new owners at Anfield a crash course in the extensive heritage and history they&apos;ll be buying into. ********************* GOING FOR A BARTON Like sobriety and having to converse with beautiful women sober, watching Frank Lampard fill his face is not something the Fiver has traditionally aspired to in life. But we wouldn&apos;t mind being a fly on the pie-rack when Frankie sits down for supper at England training next week - because it looks like he&apos;ll be sharing it with his bete noir, Joey Barton. Tomorrow, Steve McClaren will take time off from soaking his teeth in a vat of Dulux Solid Emulsion Cream Finish to announce his squad for the friendly against Spain - and Barton, English football&apos;s very own Mini-$tevie-Me, is going to be in it. Lampard was upset with Barton&apos;s witheringly succinct summary of England&apos;s World Cup fiasco (&quot;I played $hit. Here&apos;s my book&quot;) and criticised Barton for criticising his critically unacclaimed performances during the critical stages of Germany 2006. But, to be totally frank, a greater problem than ego knack might be the very real threat that Barton could pose to Lampard&apos;s place. As Dwight Yorke&apos;s brother Thom sang recently, &quot;You cannot kickstart a dead horse&quot;, and, in international terms, Lampard has been ready for the knackers yard for a couple years. Not that Barton will displace him just yet. You can never really tell how players from small clubs will take to the waters of international football: some, like Paul Parker, Gareth Southgate and, briefly, Steve Stone, play better because they are around better players; others are called Michael Ricketts. But Barton has the tools - most notably that rare $tevie MbE-like ability to locate the scruff of a game&apos;s neck as instinctively as a lothario does a G-spot - to be a very good player. &quot;I don&apos;t see too many reasons why he shouldn&apos;t get picked on Friday,&quot; said his club manager Stuart Pearce, coincidentally stubbing a Cuban out on some mince pies. &quot;Joey deserves it,&quot; concurred Barton&apos;s team-mate Micah Richards, sadly without adding: &quot;It&apos;s the best comedy I&apos;ve ever seen, apart from Everybody Loves Raymond, and I&apos;m well chuffed it&apos;s won an Emmy.&quot; ********************* THE MOST RAMSHACKLE RUMOUR MILL EVER After being spurned by Liverpool, the Dubai International Consortium has downgraded its interests to Newcastle.

Liverpool may have snippity-snipped their way through Fifa&apos;s red tape to get Javier Mascherano on loan, but the Premier League will not allow the move to go through until they&apos;ve approved the deal. Burnley striker Gifton Noel-Williams, given the option between lumping around Turf Moor or sunning himself in south-east Spain, has taken the sensible choice and done one to Segunda Division Real Murcia for \u00a350,000. &quot;I&apos;ve always wanted to play in Spain. La Liga is where all the big boys are and it&apos;s every boy&apos;s dream when they&apos;re growing up because clubs like Barcelona and Real Madrid are massive,&quot; said Noel-Williams, clutching a chorizo and a straw donkey.

But I&apos;ve not heard anything. You start wondering &apos;does he [Staunton] know I&apos;m Irish?&apos;&quot; said Geary, discounting the possibility he might not be good enough. Jupp Heynckes has revealed he received death threats before quitting as manager of Borussia Moenchengladbach. &quot;I received three death threats in the last two months,&quot; Heynckes told the Rheinische Post. &quot;They were so serious that I was protected by several plain-clothes policemen at games in Bochum and Cottbus.&quot; Bernard Cribbins has admitted a charge of improper conduct towards doping control officials after Bongo FC&apos;s Championship game with Plymouth in November. &quot;I&apos;ve been charged for my remarks to the doping control people who were on the pitch,&quot; said Cribbins. &quot;I&apos;m disappointed and I&apos;ll be going for a personal hearing.&quot; West Ham&apos;s plans to move to London&apos;s Olympic stadium may have to be reconsidered after it was revealed its capacity may be reduced to 25,000 after 2012. Tory pin-up Lord Coe said today: &quot;At Games time the stadium will hold 80,000. But afterwards it will have 25,000 seats.&quot; Which doesn&apos;t sound too bad an attendance for a Championship game. Knee knack has ruled out Reading defender Ibrahima Sonko for the rest of the season. And Chelsea and Arsenal fans have been invited to help plan this year&apos;s Carling Cup final. Fans will be invited to have their say on stadium music, pre-match presentation and hospitality, although anyone who&apos;s ever enjoyed the hospitality of 17 drunk Arsenal fans on the Picadilly line may not see that as a positive thing.

The Swede&apos;s decision came after a series of meetings with Platini, who has spent the last two days at Uefa headquarters in Nyon near Geneva outlining his plans to senior staff. Olsson will be missed by many in the European game and his exit will be felt at Westminster inside the department of culture, media and sport, where his support for the European Sports Review was pivotal in getting the controversial document off the ground. He also worked to dilute breakaway tendencies, inviting Chelsea&apos;s Peter Kenyon among others to join a club forum intended to outflank the powerful G14 group. But there will be no tears shed at the Premier League, where the European review is fiercely opposed and Olsson was seen as driving Uefa&apos;s attempt to take greater control of club football. Sky brightens for FA As the FA sends out tender documents for FA Cup and England broadcast rights it will be encouraged by comments yesterday from James Murdoch, the Sky chief executive, speaking as the company revealed its annual results. Murdoch confirmed that the broadcaster was interested in retaining the rights. &quot;The FA Cup is a great product for us and clearly we will be in there, but exactly what way will emerge over time,&quot; he said.

Mapp&apos;s wife and two children also own a share each in Liverpool. Nike puts boot in Nike has launched perhaps its most audacious attack yet on rivals Adidas with a $648m (\u00a3330m) bid to oust it as kit suppliers to the German national football side, which was captained at the World cup by Michael Ballack, right. Adidas, founded by the German Horst Dassler, has sponsored the team since its first World Cup victory in 1954, but the US firm&apos;s offer of an eight-year contract worth six times the current Adidas deal has turned heads at the DFB, the German FA. Theo Zwan-ziger, president of the DFB, confirmed he was considering the Nike bid, and that the DFB was in dispute with Adidas. The DFB wants to cut short the current contract in 2010, while Adidas want to extend to 2014. Talks between the two sides broke down yesterday, and discussions will continue. Jowell digs in on stadium Tessa Jowell&apos;s opposition to West Ham moving to the London Olympic Stadium will be met with disappointment at the club and by sports minister Richard Caborn, who has been a vocal sup-porter of a football solution to the stadium legacy problem. Caborn has lobbied for a football tenant along the lines of the Common-wealth Games model which saw Manchester City move into the stadium after the 2002 event. West Ham have expressed interest in one of two solutions, the use of retractable seats or building up the warm-up track into a permanent athletics track with the main stadium a football-only facility. Consultants PMP, preparing a report for the Olympic board, have reflected their interest, but barring a last-minute change of heart by the culture secretary it seems sure to be rejected.

Gillett, who formerly owned the American football club the Miami Dolphins and currently the Montreal Canadiens ice hockey team, talked with Hicks at last week&apos;s NHL All-Star game and the partnership idea hardened. Hicks, 60, was in England this week for discussions with Liverpool before returning to the United States last night. The club&apos;s owners are encouraged by Gillett&apos;s new business partner&apos;s extensive experience in sport - his Southwest Sports Group bought the Rangers baseball side for $250m (\u00a3125m) in 1998 and the Stars ice hockey franchise in 1995 ,and they also own Mesquite Championship Rodeo - and are reassured that there would be two backers so they would not be at the whim of just one. The chairman, David Moores, will sell his 51.6% shareholding, receiving about \u00a388m for a stake he bought for nearer \u00a312m in 1991, but will remain on the board under the new owners, as will Rick Parry, the chief executive. The club are attracted to Hicks&apos;s background in the construction industry. Although the tender has already gone out for the building of the new Anfield they would lean on Hicks&apos;s experience, given that he is overseeing the development of land between the Rangers stadium in Arlington, Dallas, and the new adjoining $1bn (\u00a3500m) Dallas Cowboys arena. A formal announcement is expected next week- Hicks will be back in the country on Monday - and confirmation of the Americans&apos; joint venture has appeased shareholders, supporters and the manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, as the war of words with DIC rages in the background. A source close to Sheikh Maktoum said yesterday that DIC had become &quot;fed up with Liverpool&apos;s attitude&quot; and that the club&apos;s board had behaved &quot;dishonourably&quot; in switching their sights to Gillett&apos;s revised proposals, submitted last week. A source close to the sheikh said: &quot;We do a lot of deals and if we&apos;d allowed the people at Liverpool to mess us around then the next person we do a deal with would do the same thing.&quot; Parry spent yesterday trying to reassure all comers that the surprise severance of talks with DIC, which he had described as &quot;ideal partners&quot; only a few weeks ago, would not have serious long-term repercussions. He insisted Moores had not rejected DIC at the last because a deal with Gillett and Hicks would swell the price he received for his 51.6% stake by \u00a38m. &quot;We had a duty as directors to consider a very interesting bid from George Gillett,&quot; said Parry. &quot;The price is not the factor in David Moores&apos; mind. He is not after cash for himself, absolutely not, but he felt compelled to consider the rival bid. The DIC response was to give the club 12 hours to make a decision but the chairman was not prepared to have the club bullied like that. The only thing David is concerned about is the club being in the right hands for the future.&quot; Other shareholders, such as Granada are anxious to secure the best financial return on their investment, and the third-biggest stakeholder, Steve Morgan, a vocal opponent of Moores and Parry, is understood to share Gillett&apos;s vision of the future. &quot;George Gillett has made it absolutely clear to us he will not be in favour of a groundshare,&quot; added Parry. &quot;There will be funding for the new stadium and a proper commitment to investment in the team. While there are other expressions of interest [in the club], we hope to conclude a deal going forward with George Gillett.&quot; He has told Ben\u00edtez as much. &quot;Rick Parry said they [Gillett&apos;s people] were nice people who are experienced in sport,&quot; said the Spaniard.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Liverpool", "Dallas Stars"], "title": "American alliance moves closer to Liverpool deal", "sentences": ["The alliance between the American franchise owners was revealed as Liverpool&apos;s former suitor, Dubai International Capital, launched a scathing attack on the Premiership club for the breakdown of talks, with Liverpool accusing the group backed by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum of attempting to &quot;bully&quot; them into agreeing a deal."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/02/newsstory.sport10", "publicationDate": "2007-02-02T02:00:46Z"}, {"article": "Alinghi, the Swiss defenders of the America&apos;s Cup in July, are holding trials for the helmsman and crew at the end of their winter training in Dubai.

His opening 65 left him at the top of the leaderboard and contemplating the prospect of competing against the world No1 on Sunday afternoon for one of the European tour&apos;s most prestigious titles. &quot;Hopefully, it&apos;ll happen,&quot; the young Englishman said after finishing the day on seven under par. &quot;The closest I&apos;ve ever come to meeting him was when I was picking up his balls on the range at the World Match Play at Wentworth.&quot; As fairway chit-chat goes Fisher&apos;s anecdote might make Woods smile but it will not frighten him. Nothing does, of course, not even playing well below his best on an Emirates course that was playing just about as easy as it can. &quot;I hit a few loose shots, but overall I feel OK. I just didn&apos;t putt well all day,&quot; Woods said after stepping off the 18th green. When other players talk in such downbeat terms, it usually means they have scuffled the ball round the course in level par or worse. Woods scuffled the ball round in 68, four under. That left him tied for 10th place and perfectly placed to ease his way to the front of the field. Victory is not guaranteed, of course, not even in Woods&apos; world, and there is enough quality to ensure a few detours in the script before Sunday&apos;s d\u00e9nouement. Ernie Els, for one, looked every inch a worthy challenger on his way to a six-under 66 - an impressive round in any circumstances but doubly so in this instance because he got off to such a shaky start. After almost hitting his opening drive out of bounds, he bogeyed his second hole, the 11th. A lesser competitor might have buckled but Els stood up on the next tee, smashed his drive down the middle of the fairway then hit his seven-iron second shot into the cup for a two. &quot;That got me into a nice stretch,&quot; he said with a smile - an early candidate for understatement of the year. Eagle, birdie, birdie, birdie, two pars and a birdie saw him cover the first nine holes in 32, five under. The front nine - his back nine - was playing tougher but he still managed to get round in one under. A Woods-Els finale would be just what the tournament organisers and public want, although it would be rash to rule out the Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell, who is tied for the lead on seven under alongside Fisher. Like the young Englishman, McDowell emerged from the amateur game with a big reputation and won the Scandinavian Open in his first year. But over the last couple of seasons his formed slumped precipitously. Out went the batchelor pad in Manchester, grand plans to play on both sides of the Atlantic and his old coach. He returned to his family home in Portrush, decided to play almost exclusively on the European tour and found himself a coach and a new caddie in Ken Comboy, one of the tour&apos;s most experienced bagmen. &quot;Last year I was a completely different player than I am now. I had just beaten myself up. I was not the player I knew, not the person I knew I was,&quot; he said. &quot;Ken has helped me a lot. He&apos;s been a big influence on me as far as getting me back to where I want.

Apart from that, though, he seems to have adapted to his new life rather well. Through four turbulent years as the chief executive of the British Horseracing Board, he was never one to carry his cares too obviously. Now, though, there is a bouncy air about him again that was there when he arrived at the BHB, but generally missing in action by the time he left. The result is that it does not seem quite as strange as it might have done to find him sitting next to the chief executive at Betfair HQ. This, after all, is the man who once told the BHB&apos;s AGM, in regard to potential integrity issues, that &quot;the scale of this threat is unprecedented&quot;. For some at the BHB, his choice of new employer was baffling, to say the least. Nichols, however, does not see a contradiction, though he admits to &quot;disappointment&quot; that he was recently barred from addressing an international racing conference in Dubai when a number of delegates objected to his Betfair links. &quot;I don&apos;t think I was ever strident or antagonistic about exchanges,&quot; he says. &quot;From early on, the argument for me wasn&apos;t about integrity, I think that&apos;s a very shallow argument for rejecting exchanges. For me it was about revenue for racing, and that wasn&apos;t just discrete to betting exchanges. I wanted more money from bookmakers too. &quot;I thought for a while before accepting the job here, but that was nothing to do with any worries about what people might think. I know that I always gave 110% at the BHB and I believed in what I did, and I was proud of what I did. &quot;I could have gone back to Australia, but with all due respect to Australian racing, British racing is the pinnacle and they can&apos;t come within lengths of what we come up to in this country.&quot; Nichols&apos; new job - as Betfair&apos;s managing director (sporting affairs) - casts him as something of a missionary for the exchange, using the contacts and experience of two decades in racing administration to open up new markets. His Dubai experience showed the sort of resistance he may encounter, but he seems confident that the momentum is with him. &quot;People are averse to change, so we need to persuade them that this is not the devil incarnate, and that exchanges will drive revenue and more importantly bring new people to the product. Countries that use a betting model based on a pari-mutuel and high takeout rate are neglecting what the customer wants. That&apos;s where we come in to challenge the status quo and do it with something novel, that can have an adverse reaction in some people&apos;s minds.&quot; New Zealand, Singapore, India and America - where Betfair has carefully avoided any involvement until now - are among the markets considered as ripe for the exchange revolution. &quot;The States would be the pinnacle because of the immense wealth,&quot; Nichols says. &quot;America is a market that&apos;s there, you just have to build the right partnerships with people and we&apos;re doing that at the moment. Whether we break in or not in the next six or 12 months will depend a bit on luck and a lot on strategy, and we&apos;re working on that.&quot; If there are any pangs about leaving the BHB, Nichols keeps them well hidden. &quot;One of the big differences working here is that you don&apos;t have to be a diplomat and a politician all the time,&quot; he says. &quot;Results are judged on a financial basis, and no idea is ever ridiculed. &quot;When you presented an idea to the BHB board, people would ask, does this suit my constituency, when they should have been asking, is it to the benefit of horse racing? Here, there are no egos. People have differences of opinion, but at the end of the day, there&apos;s no rancour. &quot;I think that the British Horseracing Authority [which will replace the BHB later this year] will be a success, and I&apos;ve got immense respect for Nic Coward [who will take on the Nichols role of chief executive]. A lot of people go through life and give up something, and then someone else comes in and they think, &apos;I hope the bastard fails&apos;. That&apos;s just so destructive.

Tiger Woods kept his side of fate&apos;s bargain during the second round of the Dubai desert classic, shooting a five-under par 67 on the Emirates course to edge closer to the head of the leaderboard and so, too, Ross Fisher, who once acted as a ball collector for Woods on the driving range at Wentworth. Fisher returned his second consecutive 65 to finish with a 36-hole total of 130, 14-under par. That left the 26-year-old Englishman two shots ahead of Ernie Els, who will complete his second round this morning after lightning interrupted play in the desert. Common sense, and the returning swagger in Els&apos;s step, suggests the South African world No4 will be the man most likely to resist the challenge of Woods tomorrow but sporting romantics will hope that Fisher has the gumption to handle the pressure that comes with leading one of the best fields of the European tour year. &quot;That&apos;s absolutely great golf,&quot; Woods said when asked about the Englishman&apos;s efforts over the first two days - effusive praise from a man not known for throwing around compliments in the direction of anyone standing between himself and the head of the leaderboard. If anything the world No1 might have been even more expansive. For the second successive day Fisher played beautiful, controlled golf as he shot eight birdies, nine pars and one bogey. It was an estimable performance, more so given that the 26-year-old from Wentworth is unfamiliar with the spotlight. &quot;I&apos;ve only ever led one tournament before which was in China - the Volvo Open - and it was my first tournament,&quot; he said. He led that event by one shot going into the final day and eventually finished fourth. He could hardly be faulted if, privately, his ambition for Sunday was to finish fourth again - an outcome that would earn him \u00a361,000, by far the biggest cheque of his nascent career. In public, however, he set his goals considerably higher. &quot;I know deep down that I&apos;m good enough and that I feel like I belong here. I feel like I am ready to win,&quot; he insisted. &quot;It would be an absolute thrill to play with the best player in the world. Obviously all the pressure will be on him because he is expected to win.&quot; Fisher probably is ready to win sometime soon, although perhaps not in such esteemed company. Woods looks imperious. After a decade in the professional game Woods is arguably the best player ever. He even does self-deprecation like a champion. &quot;My distance control with the irons wasn&apos;t all that great and I didn&apos;t make any putts,&quot; he said after yesterday&apos;s round of 67.

Each season, Ferran Adri\u00e0&apos;s restaurant, which overlooks the pretty, breezy bay at Cala Monjoi, north of Barcelona, has tables for only 8,000 diners. So far this year, 430,000 have attempted to book.  Adri\u00e0&apos;s reaction to his success is honest, and brilliantly subversive. Rather than following the well-trodden celeb-chef path of cloning El Bulli in Japan, New York or Dubai, his mission is instead to bring better burgers to the masses. His Fast Good concept already has two branches in Madrid, plus one in Santiago de Chile, and another four in Spain on the way. &quot;Why shouldn&apos;t you be able to eat decent food at a decent price?&quot; Adri\u00e0 demands, before adding: &quot;What we need is to get young chefs to do more simple things.&quot; This from the chef whose reputation is predicated on serving such dishes as gnocchi of rose-scented air in tarragon soup, or pairs of thyme-poached rabbits&apos; brains with deep-fried rabbits&apos; ears. &quot;I just want to make people happy through food,&quot; he says. Thus, Fast Good. The outlets, all apple green and Warhol pink, have funky acrylic seats and lighting. Plasma screens flash TV news, and the staff are young and dressed-down. The soundtrack is Madonna. There are walls of fridges of fresh sandwiches, drinks and lunchboxes, and a counter where hot food is served. &quot;The rule is that Fast Good uses the same quality of ingredients that we use at El Bulli,&quot; says Adri\u00e0. &quot;That means pedigree DOC beef from named estates, baking our own buns on the premises every day and only Iberico ham for the sandwiches.&quot;  The execution is exemplary, too, Each burger is cooked to perfection and, rather than the sad, damp salad usually served up in burger joints, Fast Good offers mixtures of perky fresh leaves such as baby rocket and dandelion. Relishes are made from fresh chopped tomato, although there are bottles of ketchup and HP on the table. Chips are never frozen, but hand-cut from fresh potatoes and fried in first-press olive oil. Kids run about and there&apos;s no hushed, grand gourmand reverence, simply the buzz of people enjoying great, affordable food. Burgers cost around \u20ac5.50.  &quot;You first have to learn how to do the simple things well,&quot; says Adri\u00e0. &quot;If more young chefs would do this type of business, it would be amazing. No reservations needed, no Michelin stars wanted, no emperor&apos;s new clothes.&quot;  Over in Barcelona, Ferran&apos;s brother Albert (who runs the kitchen at El Bulli) has pulled another surprising rabbit out of the Adri\u00e0 hat. In the Sant Antoni district, surrounded by flourescent-lit old men&apos;s tapas bars, Albert has opened Inopia - a flourescent-lit, old man&apos;s tapas bar. Granted, the crowd is hipper (Ferran himself eats there most Tuesday nights), the serving staff are dressed in Hugo Boss, and it is slightly pricier than some of its neighbours, but Inopia is as far from molecular gastronomy as El Bulli is from the Old Bull and Bush.  Wine is \u20ac1.75 a glass, and tapas are properly un-primped but, as at Fast Good, impeccably sourced. Tuna and tomato, for example, is a dish of plump, ripe Montserrat tomatoes with ventresca - fish from the best cut of the tuna&apos;s belly. Croquetas, which so often elsewhere approximate to deep-fried breadcrumbed Polyfilla, here are light and studded with Iberico ham. Callos (tripe) is bought in from Juan&apos;s Bar in L&apos;Hospitalilet, the suburb where the brothers grew up.  This is not the only ready-made tapa on the menu. Albert, like his brother, can&apos;t resist a gentle joke, and Lay&apos;s &quot;pollastre a l&apos;ast&quot; patates xips are a fast seller at \u20ac2 a go. Peek in the tiny kitchen, though, and you&apos;ll see them popping bags of roast chicken flavour crisps. &quot;Great crisps!&quot; exults Ferran. &quot;This flavour&apos;s only available in Spain.

He also fancied a chance to live and work in Barcelona. But when his dream job combining both came up, he found himself in a &quot;boiler room&quot;, selling worthless investments to people in Britain and all over the world who were sucked dry of their savings. Now, as the Office of Fair Trading launches Scams Awareness Month, he wants to warn others not to trust those beguiling phone calls. This is his story. In early 2004, I told a friend at a party that I was fed up selling advertising in Leeds. I fancied working in finance - and somewhere warmer. He said he would help. A week later, he got me a job in Barcelona with Windsor Advisory Services. Most people there were my age - a few older who turned out to be the real big earners. I&apos;d arrived thanks to my mate, but most co-workers had seen adverts in Barcelona&apos;s English language magazines offering &quot;high commission&quot; from &quot;an international finance company seeking highly motivated people&quot;. My friend was taking home \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000 a month - paying little tax, as he had set up an offshore company in a false name for most of his take. He told me the top people earned \u20ac100,000 (\u00a366,000) a month. But they mostly spent it as fast as it came in. Some big earners (all single men) spent huge amounts on drugs, prostitutes, casinos and weekend trips to Dubai. My first month was a guaranteed \u20ac1,500 (\u00a31,000). The first four weeks were training: lots came and went but a few of us lasted. My trainer gave me a script to learn. We had to cold call investors, mostly in the UK. We would never call anyone in Spain - at this stage, as I thought I was working for a legitimate company, I thought leaving the Spanish alone was due to some law. Later on, I realised that scamming the locals could bring real trouble. I still had illusions early on. I would always start off by telling cold call targets they had responded to a marketing survey in the past year - never true, as we got names and numbers from UK shareholder lists. Especially Anglian Water&apos;s list, which was swapped between all the boiler rooms (around 50 in Barcelona), or &quot;shops&quot; as we called them. Some punters slammed the phone down, saying they knew it was a scam, but most said they couldn&apos;t remember the survey and let you carry on. You would always ask them how their investments had been performing and would they like to make more in complete safety. They could hardly say no. And if they said they had lost money, then we said the currency options we sold would put them back into profit. You always asked them to get a pen and paper so they could write down the numbers - this reinforced the huge profits we promised, but also put you in charge: you were dictating to them. Officially, I was a junior analyst but I only parroted the script. But we would all become senior analysts when needed to impress punters. For the first few months, I did not see anything wrong - I thought we were helping people earn money with strategies involving the dollar and the euro. Later, I realised that we asked people how much they could afford to invest to ensure we sucked them dry rather than to protect their savings. Some of the top people worked in side offices. They&apos;d come out and say they&apos;d just taken $200,000 or $500,000 from a punter and we&apos;d all stand and cheer - it meant a big party that night with drink, drugs and women. It finally dawned on me that the whole thing was a sham. Oddly enough, it was because Windsor&apos;s boss, Jayson Scott Kline, would come in on a Monday morning and rage about UK press coverage - in particular, articles in the Guardian Money section. He would shout and swear, deny everything and claim he would set his UK lawyer on to the Guardian and sue the paper for millions. But he never did. In any case, I was by now so used to big money that I put my scruples aside. We sold currency options - later, I discovered the paperwork came from a Cayman Islands company which did not exist. The contract notes were phoney. We would always tell punters early on that they were ahead and that gave them the confidence to put more in. You would say anything to get money; the trick was to sound as though you knew what you were talking about. But it was just reading from a prompt. We&apos;d all watch the Ben Affleck film Boiler Room often - we learnt the lines and repeated them to punters. No customer ever got a cash return unless they threatened violence or legal action. Any so-called winnings were rolled into new deals - with even more fresh money if we could get it. Jayson was always &quot;bigging&quot; himself up. He went everywhere in a chauffeur-driven BMW 7 series. The chauffeur, who slept in Jayson&apos;s Barcelona flat, doubled as his full-time bodyguard. He never went anywhere without his bodyguard - several Middle East big-time losers had threatened revenge. You&apos;d promise complainants anything including refunds just to get rid of them, but you never paid them. I was picking up \u00a35,000 or more a month. But I started to feel sorry for the victims - one was aged 90. I decided to get out when rumours about Jayson&apos;s ability to pay us started to circulate in the bars. I had felt untouchable and invulnerable but now I knew the game was up. I worked for a few months at another boiler room selling worthless shares but this did not last as I started to feel totally ashamed, which demotivated me - many others sometimes felt this way, but lots of lines of coke helped them forget. I never did drugs. \u00b7 &quot;Robert Clarke&quot; asked us not to use his real name. He has offered to share his insights into boiler room culture with watchdog the Financial Services Authority. The FSA has so far not taken up his invitation. He is currently unemployed and living in London. The Guardian did not pay a fee for this article. Murky history of the main man Jayson Scott Kline, the driving force behind now-defunct Windsor, was charged in the US with the fraudulent purchase and sale of futures and options contracts and churning customer accounts. A &quot;cease-and-desist&quot; order in Ohio in 2000 effectively banned him from the US. In 2003, US watchdog the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a complaint against Kline and his Gibraltar Monetary Corporation for &quot;allegedly lying when pitching foreign currency options to customers.&quot; The CFTC said: &quot;Gibraltar fraudulently solicited investors through aggressive, high-pressure sales tactics, including promises of large profits and material omissions about its trading practices, the inherent risks associated with foreign currency options, and the disciplinary history of Kline.&quot; The US regulators secured a restraining order freezing Kline&apos;s assets and stopping him shredding documents.

Run by South African billionaire Sol Kerzner, the gaming company has properties as far afield as Dubai and Morocco. But in the US, Mr Kerzner has stirred up anger over its involvement in one of the country&apos;s biggest casinos - the 300,000 sq ft Mohegan Sun on land owned by the Mohegan native American tribe in Connecticut. Though Mr Kerzner lost out this week when the Casino Advisory Panel recommended to ministers that Britain&apos;s first supercasino should not be built in Greenwich, next to the redeveloped Millennium Dome, he still gained when Manchester was selected. He would have been the preferred operator in south-east London. But the consortium including Mr Kerzner is now frontrunner to run the regional casino in the north-west. Yesterday the Bishop of Hulme, the Rt Rev Stephen Lowe, said local people would want rigorous checks on the suitability of the chosen operator. &quot;I am very nervous about the multinational operators involved in the world of casinos,&quot; he said. &quot;It will be vital that the process for examining the bids and conducting due diligence on the operators is carried out with care.&quot; While Manchester won the right to host a supercasino largely because of the case made for regeneration and a promise to carefully monitor the social impact of gambling, Mr Kerzner&apos;s activities in the US have provoked controversy over whether the best interests of a host community are being properly considered. A popular weekend destination for New Yorkers, the Mohegan Sun boasts a 17-metre (55ft) waterfall, a 34-storey tower containing 1,200 hotel rooms and a 10,000-seat arena where stars such as Rod Stewart and Justin Timberlake have performed. Its gambling floor contains 6,000 slot machines - almost five times the proposed number at Manchester&apos;s new venue. It was built 10 years ago by a consortium called Trading Cove Associates, which was led by Mr Kerzner. Trading Cove has long exited the project but it is still scooping millions of dollars every year from the Mohegan tribe under a deal which entitles it to 5% of revenue, amounting to an estimated $1bn (\u00a3508m), until 2011. The National Indian Gaming Commission described the casino developer&apos;s deal with the Mohegans as egregious and politicians, including John McCain, the Republican now running for president, protested at the way the tribe had been treated. Kevin Gover, who headed the US Bureau of Indian Affairs at the time of the deal, told the Guardian that any British authority dealing with Mr Kerzner should scrutinise every possible eventuality and incorporate a clear exit strategy to ensure that benefits flow to local people. &quot;If, for whatever reason, the government chooses at some point in the future to move Mr Kerzner out then that arrangement should be done up front,&quot; said Mr Gover. &quot;The problem at the Mohegan Sun was that Mr Kerzner ended up with all the leverage.&quot; Mr Gover was so shocked at the amount of money Mr Kerzner made out of the tribe that he called for changes in the law. &quot;I think Mr Kerzner got an awfully sweet deal at Mohegan,&quot; he said. &quot;Excessive profits are a matter of a degree and opinion but that&apos;s certainly what I thought.&quot; The Interior Department&apos;s inspector general launched an inquiry and concluded that no laws had been broken although it noted that the bulk of profits from casinos sanctioned on tribal lands are supposed to go to native Americans. Mr Kerzner, who made his name running Sun City during the 1980s in South Africa, was the preferred bidder in Manchester&apos;s original application to host Britain&apos;s first Las Vegas-style supercasino. The specifications have since changed and tendering is to re-open but Kerzner International is considered to be in pole position. Manchester was a 20-1 longshot as the venue for Britain&apos;s first casino. But it fought off stiff competition from Blackpool and Greenwich to be named as the site this week. The city&apos;s plans are for a 5,000 sq metre \u00a3265m complex containing 1,250 gaming machines with no statutory limit on jackpots, creating up to 2,700 jobs. Niall Cooper, coordinator of the Manchester-based Church Action on Poverty, said: &quot;We need real assurances and transparency about the process for appointing an operator here and workable mechanisms by which local people can voice their concerns or request an operator&apos;s removal if they don&apos;t come up to scratch.&quot; Paul Dworin, publisher of the magazine Global Gaming Business, said Mr Kerzner was second only to Steve Wynn - builder of the Bellagio and the Mirage in Las Vegas - among global casino developers. &quot;He basically builds an artificial world, a fantasy,&quot; said Mr Dworin, who has visited Mr Kerzner&apos;s flagship Atlantis destination in the Bahamas. &quot;He&apos;s brilliant at creating an atmosphere, an ambience.&quot; Representatives for the Mohegan tribe did not return calls for comment this week but at the time of the Mohegan Sun deal was approved, the Boston Globe newspaper reported that two former chairmen of the tribe were paid salaries funded by the Kerzner consortium. A former top tribal official, Carlyle Fowler, had claimed in the paper that the Mohegans had overpaid Mr Kerzner to the tune of $450m (\u00a3229m).", "tags": ["UK news", "Politics", "Communities", "Gambling", "Society", "Immigration and asylum"], "title": "Be vigilant when dealing with Kerzner, gaming chief tells Britain", "sentences": ["Run by South African billionaire Sol Kerzner, the gaming company has properties as far afield as Dubai and Morocco."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/feb/03/communities.gambling1", "publicationDate": "2007-02-03T23:49:09Z"}, {"article": "Golf is one of the quieter sports and its galleries tend to be respectful and dignified, clapping only when appropriate and speaking only when allowed. There is one exception that proves this rule and it is happening this weekend at the FBR Open in Scottsdale, Arizona, which lays fair claim, particularly at the 16th, to be the world&apos;s most raucous tournament. It has the atmosphere of a Pentecostal Church in frenzy rather than the more usual Puritan church at prayer. One reason for this is the fact that it is the PGA&apos;s best-attended event, with 536,767 going through the turnstiles last year. And this figure was achieved even though Sunday&apos;s play was on the same day as the Super Bowl and the attendance was less than half what it had been on Saturday. Another is that the 16th, with its sky boxes and bleachers and hill, resembles an outdoor arena that can accommodate 35,000 spectators, many of whom are local university students. &apos;It&apos;s like playing a golf shot in a football stadium,&apos; said Tom Lehman, who won the tournament in 2000. &apos;It&apos;s unlike any place that you&apos;ll ever go.&apos; &apos;It&apos;s awesome,&apos; said reigning US Open champion Geoff Ogilvy, who lives 10 minutes from the course. &apos;I mean, 16 is even bigger than it was before. It&apos;s like hitting a shot in a baseball stadium. &apos;It&apos;s a build-up all day to get to 16. Seventeen is the hardest tee shot there because the people on 16, they&apos;ve forgotten about you, they don&apos;t care. They&apos;ll make as much noise as they can while you&apos;re hitting. It might get old if it was every week, but it&apos;s fun once or twice a year.&apos; Lowlights or highlights at the 16th have included Mike Weir being serenaded by the crowd with an off-key rendition of &apos;Oh, Canada&apos;, which, since being spoofed on The Simpsons, is probably the world&apos;s most ridiculous national anthem - &apos;Oh Canada, your great red leaf we praise&apos;. Then, in 2002, a fan quoting from a pivotal moment in the film Caddyshack shouted &apos;Miss it, Noonan&apos; just as Chris DiMarco was putting, which appalled as many as it amused. When commentator Judy Rankin turned down a marriage proposal from a member of the gallery, the crowd burst into &apos;You&apos;ve Lost That Lovin&apos; Feeling&apos;. The high jinks continued last Wednesday when Hollywood star Bill Murray celebrated making a par in the pro-am event by thrusting a fist in the air, walking into the bunker, falling to his knees and bursting into tears. The crowd loved it. One person with more mixed views is Tiger Woods. In 1997, he had a hole in one there and fans showered the green with hundreds of beer cups, few of them empty. &apos;It was the most incredible, magical sports moment I knew at that point I would participate in personally,&apos; said Jock Holliman, a member of the Thunderbirds, the charity organisation that operates the tournament. &apos;It sounded like a 747 taking off.&apos; Two years later, however, a fan heckling Woods was arrested and police discovered that he was carrying a gun, although the police determined that he had not intended to use it. In 2001, as Woods was preparing to putt on the 9th green, someone hurled an orange over his head and the world number one, who is playing in the Dubai Desert Classic this weekend, having signed a new five-year deal with tournament officials, has not been back since. So riotous have matters become that the Scottsdale Police Department is concerned that someone might die. &apos;We just want to make sure everyone&apos;s safe on their way home,&apos; a spokesman said. &apos;We&apos;re hoping that people make that decision on how they&apos;re going to get home before they take that first drink. Hopefully, we&apos;ll be able to say we had no fatalities - that&apos;s our goal.

The honour and the \u00a3204,000 winner&apos;s cheque fell to the Henrik Stenson, who birdied the final hole at the Emirates Golf Club to finish on 19 under par, one shot ahead of Ernie Els. The world No1, meanwhile, finished two shots behind the winner, tied for third - his &quot;worst&quot; finish in 13 72-hole strokeplay tournaments since missing the cut at last year&apos;s US Open. Seemingly unbeatable on American soil, where has won seven successive PGA Tour events, Woods looks almost mortal when he travels elsewhere in the world. He has now failed to win three of his last four European Tour events; the World Match Play at Wentworth, won by Paul Casey; the Champions tournament in China, won by YE Yang of Korea, and now in Dubai. &quot;It is probably the first tournament I&apos;ve won that Tiger has been playing in. He&apos;s a great player, obviously, so that gives me extra satisfaction to beat him,&quot; Stenson said. The 30-year-old Swede has long been viewed as a player capable of great things, not least by himself, and his victory against one of the strongest fields of the year lends weight to the theory that he is a prime candidate to end Europe&apos;s seemingly interminable wait for a major winner. &quot;My main goal is to try and challenge for one of the big ones,&quot; he confirmed. Stenson will get his chance at Augusta in April, but for the time being he was more than happy to bask in the glory of a hard-won victory achieved on a course he knows as well as anyone. Based in Dubai, the Swede is a member of the Emirates Golf Club and spends his winters playing and practising here - an invaluable edge on a day that came down to the most marginal of decisions. One shot ahead of Els on the par-five 18th, he decided against going for the green in two, judging that the wind would push his ball into the water, and laid up instead. He then hit a wedge to eight feet and rolled in the birdie putt to win his fifth event on the European Tour. &quot;The conditions were exceptionally tough, so it was all about trying to stick in and give yourself a chance on the back nine. Being based down here, this place is like a second home to me and to win in front of my friends and family is unbelievable. I&apos;m so happy,&quot; he said. The Swede did not have the monopoly on satisfaction. Despite his second-place finish, Els declared himself content with his performance in the first week of his bold three-year plan to usurp Woods as the world No1. The South African got off to a poor start yesterday, bogeying the 2nd, but gradually pulled himself back into contention. He holed a bunker shot on the 14th for a birdie to pull within one shot of the leader but, needing an eagle on the last, he could only produce a birdie. &quot;I played well and just wanted to give myself a chance coming down the stretch, which I did,&quot; he said. &quot;But Henrik played great for four days, and there was only one shot between us at the end. I had a good time.&quot; Unlike Els, Ross Fisher is a long way from challenging Woods regularly, or even contemplating the possibility, yet the young Englishman could be justly proud of his performance on a day when he was paired with the world No1 and withstood all the scrutiny that it entailed. Indeed, for a spell it seemed he might pull off the unlikeliest of victories, not least when he captured the lead on the par-five 10th by holing an eight-foot putt for birdie. His downfall came with three holes to play when he failed to get up and down for par on the relatively straightforward 16th, then hit his tee shot on the next into a bunker from where he could only make bogey. Redemption of sorts came on the last hole when he out-drove Woods off the tee - not for the first time during the round - and then made birdie to finish with a four-round total of 272, 16 under par. His fifth-place finish earned him \u00a351,923 - the biggest pay day of his nascent career, for the time being at least. As for Woods, there was a cheque for \u00a368,945 - small change for a man of his means and scant consolation for an athlete who cares only about winning. &quot;Hopefully, I&apos;ll get my putting organised before I compete again,&quot; he said. Even if he does not, he can take comfort in the knowledge that his next event will be on the PGA Tour in America - and no one can beat him over there.

Fisher&apos;s fifth-place finish at the Dubai Desert Classic was hardly the fulfilment of his boyhood ambitions but it was nevertheless a hugely significant step in his career, not least because he produced a calm, accomplished performance playing alongside Woods in the final round of a big tournament.

Even Woods was impressed. &quot;Ross played well, and he handled himself well too. He hit a lot of wonderful shots until the 16th and 17th holes got him,&quot; he said. Woods was even kinder out on the course - laughing and joking, according to Fisher, although it was noticeable when it came down to the crux that Woods wore the 100-yard stare familiar to all his opponents. &quot;Believe it or not I felt a lot less nervous than I thought I was going to be,&quot; Fisher said. &quot;Tiger was just a perfect gentleman.

Capuano explains, in an online Q&amp;A about the redesign process, that although the two differing royal crests used in the print editions are central to the identity of each paper, the same rules don&apos;t necessarily apply online.

Photograph: Manish Swarup/APYou view Kabul differently if you were there before the fall of the Taliban. If it&apos;s your first trip to the city, then it looks pretty dismal, despite the pure aesthetics of the hills, the snow and the sky.  Rubbish in the streets, hideous traffic, desperately poor beggars, erratic electricity, meat hanging on hooks outside the butchers&apos; for want of refrigeration, one-legged mine victims hobbling along potholed roads, entire families piled into one- or two-roomed mud-walled homes without proper sanitation and without proper food either.  But if you were in Kabul under the Taliban, you have different eyes. All the above existed then - except the traffic - but much has changed. So I drive past the Olympic stadium and remember the two executions I saw there.  Now the stadium is empty. I walk down Jaid-e-Maiwand, a main thoroughfare, and think of the expanse of rubble that it once was. Now it is a bustling bazaar and main road. The grim misery that was Kabul in the 90s has gone. The problem is that in the capital - as elsewhere - there are huge disparities in terms of development. There is a brash nouveau-riche middle class, for example. When I ask an Afghan friend where such people go shopping, he answers: &quot;Dubai.&quot;  The differences nationwide are vast, too. Towns to the north of Kabul like Pul-e-Khumri are now secure and relatively prosperous. The Shomali plains are transformed, too. Once, six or seven years ago, I sat with fighters of the Northern Alliance watching shelling across mined and devastated villages and orchards. Now the farmers have returned to their homes and the fruitbasket of Afghanistan is coming back to life. But then, away from the main roads, in the rural areas, there is dire poverty that is a disgrace to the international community. Much of the aid money channelled to Afghanistan has been misspent. Local government is corrupt and often the Taliban are the &quot;least worst&quot; option in terms of providing security. It is not quite fair to call President Hamid Karzai, &quot;the mayor of Kabul&quot;, but central government does not have much influence beyond the capital and regional centres of population. One interesting anecdote may indicate that some things in some areas are going in the right direction - or perhaps are not. On Jaid-e-Maiwand I spoke to a contractor from the eastern Paktia province, usually seen as a hotbed of warlordism. I asked him how security was in his hometown. &quot;Not bad,&quot; he answered. Who is the local commander, I asked.  Previously, this was a standard inquiry as it was always the local warlord who was seen as the biggest power in any given location. However, the contractor, a craggy-faced elder with a henna-died beard and a superb turban, looked perplexed.  Then he gave me the name of the local police chief. Did he mean that the police chief was a warlord? Or that the police actually have some degree of authority where he lived? Difficult to say. What is clear however is that things, for good or ill, are changing in Afghanistan.  The real question is whether the coalition and the central government, having in 2002 missed the fantastic opportunity to better the lives of 20 million people and make themselves more secure into the bargain, are going to be able to make up for lost time.  As we wait for the spring offensive - whether that of Nato or of the Taliban - the jury is still out.

The pair arrived in England for talks with the Liverpool board yesterday and it is believed that the deal is now regarded as a formality, paving the way for a takeover that will see Liverpool become the third Premiership club to fall into American hands after Manchester United and Aston Villa. The Liverpool board convened yesterday to discuss the offer which the chairman and leading shareholder, David Moores, is poised to accept. It is also understood that Gillett and Hicks both held discussions with the Liverpool board last night, with the deal set to be rubber-stamped, possibly today. Both Moores and Rick Parry, Liverpool&apos;s chief executive, are expected to retain positions on the board once the takeover goes through. It is understood that Hicks and Gillett will split the cost of taking over the club down the middle, with around \u00a3175m securing the club&apos;s shares and \u00a3215m going towards the new stadium. The latter appears to have been central to the success of the proposal, with Gillett and Hicks, who both have extensive experience in American sport, providing assurances that Liverpool&apos;s new home at Stanley Park would not be shared by any other team. That promise represents a change from Gillett&apos;s original proposal. Having approached the Liverpool board with his plans for a solo takeover, Gillett sought a ground-share agreement that would limit costs and maximise income revenue. However, he has been able to revise that strategy through Hick&apos;s involvement, with the 60-year-old not only providing considerable financial support but also bringing a reputation for developing state-of-the-art stadiums, which has met with Liverpool&apos;s approval. Moores is understood to be ready to agree to sell his 51.6% stake, which will lead to a recommendation to shareholders being issued when the stock exchange has been informed. Gillett and Hicks hope then to be in a position to proceed, with the Americans needing to acquire 90% of the shares before they can purchase the remainder compulsorily. Hicks, owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team and ice hockey&apos;s Dallas Stars, joined forces with Gillett, who owns Montreal Canadiens and formerly the American football club the Miami Dolphins, last week. Their alliance presented Liverpool with an alternative to the interest from Dubai International Capital. The group, backed by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, had accused the Liverpool board of acting &quot;dishonourably&quot; when the deal collapsed last week after they had appeared close to reaching an agreement. News that this deal is near completion will come as considerable relief to Rafael Ben\u00edtez. The Liverpool manager has been concerned that the speculation about the club&apos;s future has provided a distraction from events on the pitch. &quot;If it is sorted out this week, then that will be better because we can start talking about the game and the players rather than other things,&quot; said Ben\u00edtez. The Republic of Ireland&apos;s trip to San Marino has begun in farcical circumstances, with their plane forced to return to Dublin airport after 90 minutes in the air above the Irish capital. The pilot on the Czech Airlines flight to Rimini discovered he was unable to raise the undercarriage after taking off but could not land again immediately until a slot became available.

The American entrepreneurs described Liverpool, perhaps a touch unfortunately, as a club of &quot;outstanding historical wealth&quot;. They would, they said, &quot;do everything in their power&quot; to uphold its &quot;cherished traditions&quot;. This has been the language of Liverpool&apos;s three-year worldwide search for cash, in which the chairman and 51% owner David Moores, and chief executive Rick Parry, have offered the shares to investors, while trying to console themselves that they were not selling its soul. Yesterday, the two rich men who will pay David Moores \u00a388m for the shares he bought for around \u00a312m, promised to respect the Liverpool legend. In another phrase, which read like an emotional pledge written by an accountant, Gillett and Hicks promised theirs would be &quot;a multi-generational family commitment&quot;. That, presumably, means they intend to pass the club down to their children, not make a quick buck out of it. With businessmen from Dubai to Dallas promising to honour Liverpool&apos;s tradition, it is worth recalling what that actually means. There is, of course, Shankly, the Kop and You&apos;ll Never Walk Alone, but Liverpool, like no other top club, embodies English football before the big money poured in - its glory, with Dalglish, Hansen, Rush and the rest winning six League championships and three European Cups in the 1980s; and its tragedy, at Heysel and Hillsborough. That 1989 disaster, in which 96 Liverpool fans died, has not only sunk deep into the club&apos;s culture, but was English football&apos;s watershed. The Taylor Report a year later, and \u00a3200m in public money to help clubs make their grounds all-seater, laid the foundations for the modern era of safety and the game&apos;s unrecognisably glamorous image. Rick Parry was instrumental in the other key development, advising the top clubs on their breakaway from the Football League, then becoming the Premier League&apos;s first chief executive, negotiating the \u00a3305m TV deal from 1992 which the clubs would no longer have to share with the smaller clubs in the other three divisions. Moores, part of the Littlewoods dynasty whose wealth is inherited, sees himself nevertheless as a Koppite. Under his ownership, Liverpool have had much less enthusiasm for the game&apos;s money age than Manchester United under Martin Edwards, who was always eager to cash in. United took Old Trafford to its current 76,000 capacity, but Liverpool have lagged behind for years. Moores paid around \u00a38m for new shares in June 1994, money used to redevelop the Kop, but even with the Anfield Road development in 1998, Liverpool have been stuck on 45,400. It dawned on them almost eight years ago that for all the investment, they were going to have to demolish the ground and move. But they lacked Arsenal&apos;s ruthless focus on leaving their ancestral home. They decided they could not borrow millions to build the stadium, because Moores has nothing like the personal wealth of Arsenal director Danny Fiszman, so three years ago Parry began to offer to sell the club. Again, they never appeared to approach the task with any relish, even though Moores stood to make so much money, and pictures of an uncomfortable Parry, in May 2004, discussing a possible deal with the Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra can still make you wince. Then came a genuine offer from a more likely suitor, the building and hotel entrepreneur Steve Morgan, a Liverpool fan. A self-made multi-millionaire, he had none of the sheepishness about moneymaking and the obsession with tradition, which have characterised the club under Moores. The deal is remembered for the culture and personality clash between Moores and Morgan, but it collapsed ultimately because Morgan wanted more of the \u00a370m he was putting in, for 60% of the club, to be invested towards the new stadium, not to go to paying Moores and others handsomely for their shares. From some Morgan sympathisers came grumblings that Moores&apos; emblematic love for Liverpool was not quite as pure as the myth. The deal, at \u00a34,500 per share, agreed in principle with Dubai International Capital in December after 18 months of talks was to pour \u00a380m into Moores&apos; pocket. Parry worked hard to explain to Liverpool fans why he believed the Dubai owners would be good for the money and safeguard the club&apos;s traditions, but the two sides disagree about why the deal collapsed last week. From Liverpool, there is the view that DIC&apos;s commitment was not as wholehearted as promised, that the due diligence took too long, that Moores, even on the threshold of banking his fortune, was having sleepless nights about whether he was doing the right thing, and DIC&apos;s ultimatum backfired. Under pressure, he and Parry fell back on their concept of respect, the Liverpool way, that they weren&apos;t going to be bullied. DIC, for their part, complained that after 18 months of courtship, they were not told clearly enough that Gillett Jr had returned to make a bid. They sought clarification, and when they didn&apos;t get it, pulled out. Though the Morgan camp will never accept it, inside the club they say Moores is still not motivated by the \u00a388m he will now make from the higher offer (\u00a35,000 a share) Gillett and Hicks are to pay him, and he would have loved to have held on. Parry, too, a Liverpool fan, has been exceptionally keen to safeguard his own future as chief executive. While the two wavered over DIC, Gillett teamed up with Hicks, and Moores and Parry seem to have leapt gladly into their arms, embracing the promise to buy the shares, build the stadium, provide money for players, safeguard the club&apos;s traditions and generally make everything all right. Parry knows the prospect of two Americans owning the club outright is harder for fans to swallow after the talk about not being a rich man&apos;s plaything and the careful preparation of sympathy for DIC. Hence the pledges set out in their offer about upholding Liverpool&apos;s traditions. In 1992, when Parry took the top clubs into the money, nothing solid was done to safeguard the traditions.

I&apos;ve listened to a lot of radio phone-ins in the build-up to the takeover and there has been an element of trepidation, a lot of hopefulness and a huge eagerness to find out what the future holds. But the bottom line is that this was a scenario that had to be faced because financially Liverpool have been getting left behind by the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United. From a financial point of view Liverpool haven&apos;t been able to go that extra mile. I hope Rafael Ben\u00edtez and whoever becomes chairman are given the backing to compete at the top end of the transfer market. I&apos;ve been a Liverpool fan for more than 40 years and I never thought I&apos;d see this day. I&apos;m happy and sad to say I&apos;ve been through most of the good times but also the bad times. I&apos;m hopeful yesterday&apos;s news will be the start of a successful era. The takeover has caught most of us unawares because everyone was of the opinion that Liverpool were going to be bought by Dubai International Capital. It then came as a shock that George Gillett and Tom Hicks were announced to be involved, let alone that the takeover had been agreed. We just have to place our trust in Rick Parry, the chief executive, and David Moores, the chairman, that this is the best thing for the club. But with all this money coming into the club it is vital to keep the club&apos;s heritage and roots. The true fans must not be forgotten amid the takeover. Our message to Mr Gillett and Mr Hicks is, please don&apos;t forget our history, please don&apos;t forget that Liverpool has been a grassroots club. Since Bill Shankly, through Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish, the supporters have been thought of as part of Liverpool. The club shouldn&apos;t be run entirely as a business; first and foremost Gillett and Hicks must run it as a football club. The heart and soul of Liverpool Football Club has been built by success on the field and whether we have American or British owners, foreign players or English players, tradition must prevail. I would like to think this takeover could bring the good times back to Anfield but nobody can predict the repercussions it will have. Who would have guessed that Chelsea, in view of their financial state before Roman Abramovich took over, would have won the Premiership twice, been in contention for the Champions League and regularly challenged for the two domestic cups? You just do not know what is around the corner and I think, in the case of yesterday&apos;s takeover, if everybody pulls in the same direction then in the long run it will be a good thing for the club.

We understand that he is still being investigated by the Dutch police, has posted bail and surrendered his passport, but has not been charged with any offence.  The government&apos;s fight against multi-billion pound &quot;carousel&quot; fraud stepped up a gear yesterday as customs officers arrested 10 people after raids across Britain and Europe and said they had frozen dozens of bank accounts in Dubai. Revenue &amp; Customs said the arrests followed a five-year investigation into a systematic attack on the VAT system which is thought to have cost the taxpayer a quarter of a billion pounds. Ten men were being questioned in police stations in London last night after raids in south Wales, the West Midlands, Cheshire and Buckinghamshire. Four European warrants were issued for arrests in France and Spain. Paymaster general Dawn Primarolo said yesterday that the government&apos;s efforts to contain the fraud had led to a &quot;massive drop&quot; in the attempted levels of fraud since their peak last summer. The amounts, she told a House of Lords committee, were now &quot;minuscule&quot; - something confirmed in official data. In an operation with Dutch authorities last autumn, Revenue &amp; Customs closed a bank in the Caribbean which turned out to have been used by all of Britain&apos;s estimated 2,500 carousel fraudsters. The First Curacao International Bank (FCIB) was owned by oil trader John Deuss, who was subsequently arrested by Dutch police and charged with money laundering and running a criminal organisation. With an increase in the number of VAT investigators, the government feels the FCIB closure dealt a hammer blow to the alleged fraud.Ms Primarolo told the Guardian the government&apos;s focus, now that the huge tax losses had been stemmed, was on recovering some of the billions stolen by organised crime gangs in recent years. Much of the stolen tax ended up in Dubai, where accounts, related to those in FCIB, have been frozen while investigations continue. Under new laws, the government has sweeping powers to force financial institutions to reveal details of suspect transactions. Carousel fraud occurs when someone imports small expensive items such as computer chips or mobile phones free of VAT, sells them on with the VAT added but pockets the VAT and disappears. The goods often pass through a chain of companies and are re-exported with the VAT reclaimed. They are then re-imported and spun round the so-called carousel again. Tax losses spiralled out of control before the FCIB raids as ingenious fraudsters developed &quot;virtual carousels&quot; with computer programmes that did not need any goods to be actually traded. Customs officers admitted at that point they were losing &quot;two Tonbridge robberies&quot; worth of money, or \u00a3100m every week. Losses have fallen by more than 90% since the FCIB raid. Following a series of raids in July 2003 in which 42 people were arrested, Customs investigators have been examining more than half a million documents that were seized, along with the hard drives of 391 computers with a combined data capacity of 28 terabytes. Euan Stewart, deputy director of criminal investigation at HMRC said carousel fraud was now the organisation&apos;s top priority. &quot;The sophistication of the organised crime gangs behind these frauds means that our investigations are increasingly complex but we are committed to bringing the criminals behind it to justice and to recovering the money stolen from the British taxpayer, wherever in the world our investigations lead. This is not victimless crime, it&apos;s organised crime that causes real harm.&quot; Revenue &amp; Customs has carried out a string of raids and arrests in the past six months and succeeded in prosecuting far more fraudsters than it used to, thanks to improved knowledge among judges and juries of what the fraud involves. Sentences have got longer too. Ms Primarolo denied reports that the Revenue&apos;s increased vigilance on VAT repayments was harming legitimate businesses. In the last nine months of 2006, she said, Revenue &amp; Customs had received 284,000 applications for new VAT registrations by companies. It had rejected only 1,000 of those. &quot;We are trying to strike a balance between protecting revenues and facilitating business activity. We have got that balance right.&quot; She insisted HMRC was acting completely within UK and European law and was confident it would not lose lawsuits brought by firms claiming VAT reclaims had been wrongly withheld &quot;These people trying to steal tax money are highly litigious. They have some of the best legal minds and best accountants.&quot; Longer sentences Sentences for carousel fraud have been rising sharply, reflecting increased awareness of the seriousness of the crime and the growing expertise of prosecutors. Big fraudsters who would once have escaped with light sentences now face jail terms in double figures. Last month saw the longest sentence yet: Emmanuel Hening, a mobile phone trader with dual Belgian-French nationality was jailed by Worcester crown court for 15 years for masterminding a \u00a354m fraud.His gang of eight got a total of 38.5 years.", "tags": ["Business"], "title": "Ten held after VAT fraud raids in Britain and Europe", "sentences": ["The government&apos;s fight against multi-billion pound &quot;carousel&quot; fraud stepped up a gear yesterday as customs officers arrested 10 people after raids across Britain and Europe and said they had frozen dozens of bank accounts in Dubai.", "Much of the stolen tax ended up in Dubai, where accounts, related to those in FCIB, have been frozen while investigations continue."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/07/5", "publicationDate": "2007-02-07T11:25:58Z"}, {"article": "George Gillett and Tom Hicks may have talked evolution rather than revolution when they were introduced as Liverpool&apos;s new owners on Tuesday but the two Americans may prove rather more radical than they initially appeared. Rafael Ben\u00edtez yesterday revealed that the two regard wholesale change as imperative if the club are to produce a team fit to grace the new stadium in Stanley Park which they hope will be ready for the start of the 2009-10 season. Reflecting on an hour spent discussing the future with his new bosses, Liverpool&apos;s manager said: &quot;They recognise they need to change a lot of things. There are some aspects of Liverpool which must always remain the same but it is clear where we can improve. This is a club which has a great history but also has great potential.&quot; Exploiting such promise may involve an overhaul of the academy- a generously funded but apparently underachieving arm of the Anfield operation, frequently criticised by the manager - senior player recruitment policy and overseas marketing strategy. &quot;We spoke a lot about the future of the club,&quot; said Ben\u00edtez. &quot;I was very happy with what they said. I was convinced they want the best for the club.&quot; Judging by their track records of often substantial investment in the US the new owners certainly seem anything but &quot;tightwads&quot; and Ben\u00edtez hinted that they might &quot;speculate to accumulate&quot;. &quot;We spoke about bringing through players for the future from the academy and how we can sign players for the present,&quot; he said. &quot;They are successful businessmen and they realise the real business of a football club is the business of the first team. We need a strong first team to make the [new] stadium successful and for all the other areas of the club to work.&quot; Even so, Gillett and Hicks are not prepared to offer the Spaniard a blank chequebook. &quot;They have a clear idea of what we can achieve. It was not a meeting where we discussed how much we will spend on a transfer or where we were promised \u00a3100m, though - to be a successful club is not just about spending a lot of money on new players,&quot; said Ben\u00edtez, who believes the Merseysiders could do worse than emulate Real Madrid&apos;s merchandising tactics. &quot;Liverpool can improve and grow by keeping the ideas which have made us strong and making improvements where they are needed. For example, how many club shops do we have around the world? We should be doing more in areas such as Asia and even Spain where we are popular. Liverpool can learn from the work clubs like Real have done and become one of the biggest clubs in the world off the pitch as well as on it.&quot; Ben\u00edtez also paid tribute to his out- going chairman. &quot;I want to say thank you to David Moores, for the support you have given me, for bringing me to Liverpool and for everything you have done for the club. It was not an easy decision for him to sell Liverpool but he has shown he is a good person and a nice person.&quot; Similar sentiments about Moores were voiced by Kenny Dalglish, the club&apos;s former striker and manager, who likewise expressed optimism about the new owners. &quot;While there&apos;s obviously going to have to be some changes I don&apos;t think they&apos;ll mess with the traditions too much,&quot; he said. &quot;In fact I think they&apos;ll see the traditions as a great selling point.&quot; In order to benefit from European Union and local grants, work on the club&apos;s proposed \u00a3215m, 60,000-capacity ground must start within 60 days and Liverpool were yesterday in talks with Laing O&apos;Rourke, a Kent-based construction company responsible for the building of Cardiff&apos;s Millennium Stadium, the new Ascot and the snow centre in Dubai. The project, which is due to be completed in summer 2009 and will create hundreds of jobs as the surrounding area is regenerated, has been broadly welcomed by locals, whereas there was more mixed reaction to yesterday&apos;s news that Everton plan to leave Goodison Park for a site alongside a giant supermarket at Kirkby. Everton and Tesco have submitted outline proposals to Knowsley council about sharing and developing vacant land next to Knowsley community college. It was unclear yesterday whether Steve Morgan, the high-profile Liverpool shareholder involved in previous takeover attempts, will voluntarily sell his 5.1% stake in the club to Gillett and Hicks. As the dust settles on the takeover, it is expected that the Football Association&apos;s chief executive, Brian Barwick, a lifelong Liverpool fan, will talk with Gillett and Hicks in the near future. Barwick has met the Glazer family and West Ham&apos;s chairman, Eggert Magnusson, and told the Liverpool Echo last week: &quot;I am sure I will be able to offer the same invite to whoever eventually invests in Liverpool.

He flaunts the ostentatious humbleness that comes with great wealth. He refuses to trade in his Upper East Side apartment for the 18th century splendour of the official residence, Gracie Mansion, and rides to work by subway every morning despite having been valued at $5bn (\u00a32.5bn). Even by his own unorthodox standards, though, what the mayor did earlier this week was surprising. Other leaders might have been tempted to bury the news delivered recently to Mr Bloomberg by the McKinsey consultancy: that New York was in danger of being toppled from its throne as the world&apos;s financial capital by a rival city. He did the opposite. He trumpeted the report in front of the New York press, then flew to the very city that was threatening Wall Street&apos;s supremacy and trumpeted the findings all over again. That city was London. According to McKinsey, which based its conclusions on a survey of top financial executives from around the world, New York&apos;s longstanding pre-eminence can no longer be taken for granted. Within 10 years the city which has been the headquarters of modern capitalism for most of a century could sink to the rank of a &quot;secondary city&quot;. Secondary. The word is enough to send New Yorkers shrieking down Fifth Avenue. In his counter-intuitive championing of the McKinsey findings, Mr Bloomberg went even further. He implied that should Wall Street fall from the number one slot, the whole of New York, indeed the entire United States, could come tumbling after. &quot;Let&apos;s be clear: The financial services industry is one reason that the 20th century was the American century and that New York became the world&apos;s capital,&quot; he said. So just how vulnerable is the Big Apple to its traditional rival? Is London really poised to take over as capital of the world? In financial circles, there are clear signs that London is tearing up on the sidelines. Almost half of the respondents in McKinsey&apos;s survey thought New York had shed some of its appeal as a financial centre in the past three years, and that the reverse applied to London. About 13,000 new jobs, or 4.3% of the total, were created in London in the three years to 2005, while Wall Street lost 2,000 in the same period. Stringent regulation of financial markets, together with tight immigration laws post September 11 which inhibit importation of skilled labour, are dragging Wall Street down. The avant garde of banking, hedge funds, have started migrating to London. And how symbolic that the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, standard bearer of capitalism, has a duplicate office in the City of London where he now spends half his time. Look down on the two cities from a great height though, and what is striking is how much they have in common. Their respective populations are London 7.7m, New York 8.1m. They are both enjoying boom times and are projected to put on a further 1m each by 2030. They are, says Tony Travers, an expert on cities at the London School of Economics, competitive but complementary. &quot;The most interesting thing about the two places is how like each other they are. They have more in common with each other than with anywhere else in their respective countries.&quot; But the assumption of superiority - bigger, better, richer, faster - that has attached to New York at least since the second world war is being threatened on several levels. Let&apos;s start with the frivolous. Here&apos;s Audrey Saunders, owner of the celebrated Pegu Club in downtown Manhattan, telling the New York Times this week that: &quot;I hate to admit it, but London is the best cocktail city in the world.&quot; Cocktails! More substantially, bastions of New York culture have come under fire from the city&apos;s own critics. The 2004 expansion and renovation of the Museum of Modern Art was heralded as a triumph at the time, but is now being damned as a failure. The New York Times has compared the new Moma very unfavourably with Tate Modern, a gallery which it says is &quot;working beautifully&quot;, while the New Yorker says the musuem&apos;s status as the prophet of the modern spirit is now in doubt. You can dismiss all that as the carpings of the miserabilist liberal media. But the malaise goes further. A comparison of Broadway with the West End speaks volumes. Again, statistically the two theatre districts are at level-pegging. Both attracted a record 12m people to their shows in 2005, with box-office takings of about \u00a3400m each. But the headline figures belie important differences. Broadway&apos;s 39 theatres are dominated by big, long-running shows which bring in guaranteed profits but clog up the system and block new work. The West End, by contrast, has many more productions on shorter runs, nourished by subsidised works emerging from the National Theatre. &quot;What you get is a healthier theatre in London,&quot; says a leading player on Broadway, who asked not to be named. &quot;It&apos;s frustrating but there&apos;s not much that can be done about it.&quot; British playwright David Hare has spent a lot of time in Manhattan recently, transferring Stuff Happens to Broadway and opening his new play The Vertical Hour there. He reflects that New York is aesthetically a much more dazzling city. &quot;You turn a corner and there is another extraordinary view, but it&apos;s also artistically much more conservative. There is a definite feeling - in music, in theatre, in opera, especially - of being bored with the old, and yet even more terrified of the new.&quot; Hare adds that he finds London &quot;much more genuinely cosmopolitan&quot;, which is revealing because London appears to have stolen from New York the mantle of the quintessential multicultural city. Forty per cent of London&apos;s population is foreign born, only slightly more than New York&apos;s 36%. But unlike Manhattan, even the prosperous areas of inner London are ethnically mixed and this has enabled London to claim the diversity high ground. Early on in their Olympic presentation, New York told the IOC that there were &quot;over 200 languages spoken in New York&quot;. The boast was dropped from the latter stages after the London bid informed the committee there are &quot;over 300 languages spoken daily in London&quot;. The London Olympic bid team specifically attributes its victory to the city&apos;s extraordinary diversity. One analyst said: &quot;We see New York as a great American city with lots of foreigners, and London as an international city. We promised the &apos;world games&apos; with London as the backdrop.&quot; The prospect of the 2012 Olympics, coupled with the confident - some would say cocky - demeanour of mayor Ken Livingstone, have given London&apos;s current buoyancy a focus. Mr Livingstone gave a keynote address at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos in which he was described by the television network CNBC as the &quot;mayor of Europe&apos;s megacity&quot;. His congestion charge, which so confounded his critics and has provided a template for gridlocked capitals the world over, is about to be extended into west London, despite public resistance. Though many Londoners were suspicious of his brashness when he became mayor in 2000, his popularity ratings rose to be, and remain, highly favourable. Which brings us back to Bloomberg. His style could not be more different from his counterpart&apos;s across the Pond. Quietly spoken, polite, almost meek, there is none of the Livingstone grandstanding. And yet their trajectories have been the same. Mr Bloomberg was elected in 2001, just after September 11 at a time of deep crisis for the city, needing to win the trust of New Yorkers. He has done that, and grown very popular too. As Mitchell Moss, professor of urban policy at NY university, puts it: &quot;Bloomberg is the only mayor in 60 years who doesn&apos;t have anyone who hates him.&quot; True, there has been no congestion charge and New York remains traffic bound for it. Rush hour now lasts up to eight hours a day and is projected soon to stretch to 12 hours. But Mr Bloomberg can point to his own act of daring: the 2002 ban on smoking in restaurants and bars that has also set the world agenda and had an enormous impact locally, with smoking deaths down 10% saving 800 New Yorkers&apos; lives a year. So how do Manhattanites react to the suggestion that their city has lost its edge to London? With laughter, principally. Sir Harold Evans, once editor of the Sunday Times and author of The American Century, who has lived there since the 1980s, says the city&apos;s traditional ebullience is more evident than ever. &quot;The energy in New York exceeds anywhere else in the world, even Dubai. You can&apos;t touch London for its cultural brilliance, but compare the two cities and the feeling is that if something big is going to happen, in a benevolent sense, it is going to happen here.&quot; The loss of the Olympics has not dampened that spirit. Jay Kriegel, president of New York&apos;s bid team, points out that with the exception of the Olympic stadium that was to have been built on the West Side, all the other elements - from a subway extension in Manhattan to low-cost housing in Queens - are going ahead. In sporting terms, the success of Arsenal&apos;s Emirates stadium in north London is being topped by two new homes for New York&apos;s big baseball teams, the Yankees and Mets, both coming in on time and on budget in contrast to the fiasco of Wembley. New York has had its building troubles. Ground Zero, the symbol of the city&apos;s darkest hour, has become its greatest embarrassment. Five years on it is still a gaping hole in downtown Manhattan. But Bloomberg, backed by the New York and New Jersey state governments, has now taken over the project and the Freedom Tower is rising. Mr Kriegel also emphasises that with crime down to levels not known for decades, notorious no-go areas are vanishing. &quot;The city is entering a golden era. Neighbourhoods that have been stagnant for 50 years are being transformed.&quot; Though New York remains the most expensive city in America, it has one overwhelming advantage over London in its lower cost of living. The Economist Intelligence Unit ranks London as the seventh priciest city in the world, New York as 27th. London may be catching up, but there&apos;s still clear blue water between the cities in several other regards. Take the three Fs: film, fashion and food. London is becoming ever more desirable as a movie location, with 12,655 shooting days in 2005, but that&apos;s still only a third of its rival&apos;s activity. New York remains the undisputed power house of the fashion industry, with (Briton) Anna Wintour its queen. And though London&apos;s food has improved beyond all recognition in recent years, it has a way to go before it matches the range and quality packed into Manhattan. You could feel chefs on either side of the Atlantic wince when Gordon Ramsay&apos;s new restaurant on West 54th, provocatively named the London, was met with the ultimate putdown from New York Times critic Frank Bruni. It suffered from a &quot;dearth of inspiration&quot;, he said. So don&apos;t be fooled by Mr Bloomberg&apos;s disarming self-criticism. This mayor, and the town he represents, hasn&apos;t given up its crown yet. Nor will they. Not, at any rate, without a fight. \u00b7 London v New YorkThe extraordinary strength of London&apos;s property market continues to be driven by demand from the top, and luxury apartments are achieving the highest prices in the world with four new penthouses at the Lord Rogers-designed One Hyde Park reported to be on sale for \u00a384m each. New York still has more billionaires, with 40, but London has moved into third place on Forbes magazine&apos;s billionaires league table, with 23 (Moscow, in second place, has 25). Workers in the City of London last year took home \u00a38.8bn, with 4,000 employees receiving bonuses of more than \u00a31m. Last year foreign firms spent \u00a397bn buying British companies, while 367 companies came to the London stock exchange, compared with 270 on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq combined. Between 2002 and 2005, London&apos;s financial workforce grew by 4.3% to 318,000 while New York&apos;s declined by 0.7% to 328,400 jobs. And London&apos;s share of the top 50 hedge funds is growing, from three in 2002 to 12 in 2006, while New York&apos;s declined over the same period from 28 to 18. London salerooms continue to break records with new buyers including Russians and Chinese. Sotheby&apos;s sold \u00a3167m worth of art in the past week. The weakness of the dollar has meant American collectors are choosing to sell in London while New York dealer Andrew Fabricant was named as the buyer of Francis Bacon&apos;s Study for Portrait II, sold for a record \u00a314m at Christie&apos;s on Thursday night. While the reopening of New York&apos;s Museum of Modern Art was initially regarded as a success, critics have since turned on it and pointed out that while Tate Modern attracts 3.9m visitors, Moma can only manage 2.7m. Both cities shuttled 12m people through the doors of their theatres, but artistically the iniative is with the Brits. David Hare and Tom Stoppard both have shows on Broadway while Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was one of several West End musicals to make the transfer. Neither city scored well on a quality-of-life survey conducted among expatriate staff in which Zurich and Geneva scored highest. London managed 39th place, but New York was even lower at 46th.", "tags": ["US news", "World news", "Travel", "London holidays", "New York holidays"], "title": "New York v London: the battle to be the world's capital", "sentences": ["&quot;The energy in New York exceeds anywhere else in the world, even Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/10/usa.travel", "publicationDate": "2007-02-10T01:07:52Z"}, {"article": "The war is a long way from Kabul&apos;s butchers&apos; bazaar. Just off the Jaid-e-Maiwand, the avenue named after the defeat of a British force 127 years ago, skinned sheep carcasses and bloody sides of beef hang above the heads of the crowds around the narrow stalls. Meat, once a luxury for many in the bustling capital, has become a staple. While southern Afghanistan is racked by a violent insurgency, Kabul is thriving. The bazaar is humming with activity. The crowd is mostly male. Any women weaving between the barrow boys, the old men selling boiled eggs and the little girls with trays of sticky home-made cakes, are veiled. Most wear the full burqa, although some have hauled the stitched face grille back on their foreheads to turn it into a cape. A few wear just a headscarf. None will talk to a Westerner. What the Taliban had enforced was merely a stricter version of an entrenched social code, and the ragtag Islamic militia were easier for Western governments to remove from Kabul than the burqas. Yet the relative economic stability and security in the capital - though by no means equally shared - means support for the Nato peacekeepers is relatively robust. A pause in the suicide bombing and rocket attacks of the past 18 months has helped, too. &apos;The bombings last year... shook everyone, but things are better now,&apos; said Muqib Jamshady, a Kabul businessman who has seen his hopes of converting his homeland into a prime tourist destination disappointed in the short term, but remains sanguine about the future. &apos;Business is good,&apos; said Matiullah, a money changer standing with thick wads of notes - dollars, Pakistani rupees, afghanis - in his hand. &apos;The currency has been stable for a long time.&apos; Certainly, for anyone who knew Kabul under the Taliban, much has changed out of all recognition. Before the regime fell in 2001, Jaid-e-Maiwand was a wasteland of rubble. It has been totally rebuilt, largely by private entrepreneurs. Rubbish still lines the streets and most of the city is without a reliable supply of electricity, but there are glaring signs of burgeoning wealth. Outside a Dubai-style shopping centre, a woman in heels steps out of a new Mercedes, a sight that stops traffic. Inside, bored teenagers in denim talk hair gel. One trader , Mohammed Aman, says he sells a dozen new mobile phones each day for up to $200. . But if support for the coalition remains strong, few doubt it can rapidly evaporate. &apos;If the foreigners do good, people will support them,&apos; said Haji Chenar Gul, 55, from the eastern province of Paktia, who had travelled to Kabul hoping to find someone to hire his truck. &apos;But if they don&apos;t... &apos; One problem is the city&apos;s progress, its population swollen to more than two million by returning refugees. Professor Ashraf Ghani, a former Finance Minister, saw a &apos;huge gap between the capital and the rest of the country&apos; as &apos;very destabilising&apos;. &apos;The gap between the haves and have-nots is getting very large,&apos; he said over lunch . Many here remember that violence long preceded the 1979 Soviet invasion, seen as the start of nearly three decades of conflict that devastated the country. In fact, Moscow sent its troops to bolster a Marxist Afghan government threatened by a vicious rural insurgency provoked by radical reforms, including the compulsory education of women. In the longer term it was fuelled by an &apos;economic gap&apos; between the capital and the desperately poor provinces and a &apos;culture gap&apos; between a capital where girls in miniskirts drank coffee with men in suits and a deeply conservative countryside. Kabulis see a danger of that situation being reproduced. The insurgents of today, like those of the Seventies, invoke religion, talk of &apos;moral corruption&apos; resulting from &apos;Westernisation&apos; and burn schools. Nowhere are the risks being run by the new Afghanistan clearer than at Kabul University. Yes, there are books on the newly restored campus, and teachers are not vetted by a repressive religious regime. Yes, there are far more female students. But, as in the Seventies, it is full of hardline Islamists. &apos;I am scared,&apos; said Ghani, who is now the university chancellor. &apos;We don&apos;t need nice warm buildings built with foreign aid, we need the capacity to give jobs to school-leavers and graduates. This country is not poor. It is potentially very rich. But it takes time and effort and international support.&apos; February in Kabul is cold, with snow thick on the hills surrounding the city on its high plateau. The sky is eggshell blue during the day and filled with stars at night. The lack of electricity means the lights in individual areas flicker into life at haphazard intervals. For the many without heating or enough food, the dark hours are long. Though the fear and pessimism of last summer, when the Taliban offensive in the south was at its height, have largely gone, the present optimism is guarded. No one knows what spring will bring. \u00b7 Five years after the invasion of Afghanistan, what next for the region?

Quite simply, it was the thing to do; it gave them a buzz. Then there was the stampede for stock market listings in the mid-1990s as City investors realised that football was a business, not just a sport. But when prices got toppy, the bubble burst and several clubs, such as Bolton and Sunderland, delisted. Today, it is the turn of foreign tycoons to wade into the UK soccer arena: the latest target is Liverpool, which has agreed a \u00a3174m takeover by US sports moguls George Gillett and Tom Hicks. On Friday, Arsenal forged an alliance with US Major League Soccer club Colorodo Rapids, owned by billionaire Stan Kroenke. Chelsea, of course, has fallen to Roman Abramovich and Manchester United to Malcolm Glazer &apos;The clubs used to be seen as a British secret, but the success of the Premiership, linked in no small measure to lucrative television rights to screen live games, has put British football onto the radar screens of overseas investors,&apos; says Dan Jones, head of Deloitte&apos;s sports research arm. For several years, Premiership clubs have looked ripe for foreign takeover as the realisation dawns that they are global brand names with supporters in cities as far-flung as Beijing, Seoul, Los Angeles and Sydney. Paul Rawnsley, who works with Jones at Deloitte, says: &apos;Soccer is the fastest growing sport in the US, and while it will never replace American football or baseball, there are commercial opportunities in the States that people like the Glazers have used to their advantage.&apos; Rawnsley mentions the shirt sponsorship coup at Manchester United, when the Glazer family replaced Vodafone with US insurer AIG, which agreed to pay significantly more than the UK phone giant. And just as conventional British companies are more open to takeover than their counterparts on the continent, so British football clubs are easier to acquire than French, Spanish or even American teams, where potential purchasers are more likely to face protectionism or regulatory obstacles. Then there are the British game&apos;s attractive spin-offs. In the US, for instance, owners in the NFL, the American football league, are not allowed to offer branded credit cards or have links with bookmakers. &apos;But there are a couple of other important points to consider,&apos; says a City sports analyst. &apos;First, there is a much bigger pool of wealthy foreign investors than there was 10 years ago. Second, you get people like Glazer; he realises that he is making more money from a brand like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers than the owners of United, even though it is a global name with millions of fans around the world - far more than Tampa.&apos; So who is on the prowl at the moment? Dubai International Capital, which was pipped at the post by the Americans for Liverpool, may turn its attention to the 10 per cent stake that ITV owns in Arsenal. Robert Earl, of Planet Hollywood fame, recently took a stake in Everton and may try to increase his exposure. Oleg Deripaska, a Russian tycoon, is said to have a penchant for soccer - much like the American Kraft family. Recently, Newcastle held takeover talks with Belgravia Group, a Jersey-based investment firm, and US hedge fund Polygon. As most British clubs are in private ownership - rather than listed on the stock market, where there is intense public scrutiny - owners such as the Glazers or Abramovich can make investments in players or new stadiums without shareholders jumping up and down demanding short-term results. &apos;It is a boon to be free of having to explain every measure to City investors, always worried about the effect on share prices,&apos; says one broker. Interest in Premiership clubs is unlikely to abate. A report by Deloitte last week pointed out that the Premiership remains &apos;the largest and most profitable league in world football&apos;. Premiership revenues were about \u00a31.33bn in 2005/6, well ahead of top divisions in other European countries. And the English clubs&apos; revenues will grow sharply in the 2007/8 season when new, more lucrative broadcasting contracts should increase annual revenue to \u00a31.7bn. BSkyB and Setanta Sports are paying \u00a31.7bn (a 67 per cent rise) to screen matches in Britain for three seasons from August, while channels in 208 other countries more than doubled their payments to \u00a3625m, reflecting demand in Asia, where English clubs such as Chelsea and United have a growing fan base. Only last month, Chelsea&apos;s chief executive Peter Kenyon was promoting the club in Beijing with the launch of a Mandarin-language website in partnership with China&apos;s biggest portal, Sina. United are also jostling for position in the world&apos;s biggest market. Deloitte says: &apos;Football remains a growth sport, especially at the highest level. This year, collective revenues of the top 20 European clubs were more than \u20ac3.3bn after growing by 7 per cent. Next year, we expect them to generate three times their revenue of 10 years ago. Eight of the top 20 are English and that figure could go higher following recent broadcast deals.&apos; The Premiership&apos;s collective revenues are 40 per cent ahead of Italy&apos;s Serie A, its nearest competitor. True, the prospect of higher income has helped to inflate player transfer prices, although Deloitte says there are signs that average sums are moderating - vital if the clubs are to turn a decent profit. But tycoons with big chequebooks are always welcome. At Liverpool, Gillett and Hicks are believed to have guaranteed to invest over \u00a3200m. Hicks, who owns the Dallas Stars ice hockey club and the Texas Rangers baseball team, confirmed that cash would be available to invest in players and build a new stadium in Stanley Park. The English Premiership remains both the most lucrative and the most popular league internationally so foreign interest persists, Jones at Deloitte says: &apos;It dominates the sporting agenda in parts of the world that its European counterparts and the American superleagues have failed to reach. So it&apos;s hardly surprising that overseas predators are circling.&apos;", "tags": ["Business", "Football"], "title": "Top of the takeover league", "sentences": ["Dubai International Capital, which was pipped at the post by the Americans for Liverpool, may turn its attention to the 10 per cent stake that ITV owns in Arsenal."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/11/football.theobserver", "publicationDate": "2007-02-11T00:21:36Z"}, {"article": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez has recently taken up residence in a \u00a34.5m home on the Wirral. Although the Liverpool manager&apos;s decision to install his family in Merseyside&apos;s stockbroker belt was made well before George Gillett and Tom Hicks moved into Anfield&apos;s corridors of power it was apparently heavily informed by the promise of an impending takeover. Significantly, Ben\u00edtez might now have been enjoying a more enviable lifestyle in one of Madrid&apos;s most sought after addresses, sipping Rioja while mulling over whether to give David Beckham a game for Real. Indeed Rick Parry, Liverpool&apos;s chief executive, yesterday reiterated that Ben\u00edtez had received an offer to fill last summer&apos;s managerial vacancy at the Bernabeu. &quot;Rafa clearly had to consider the approach from Real Madrid,&quot; Parry told Radio Five Live. &quot;In his position it would both appeal to the heart and the head; it would be very, very tempting.&quot; So tempting, in fact, that Liverpool&apos;s board spent an entire day persuading the Spaniard to stay. &quot;We sat down for a day, we re-affirmed our commitment to making progress and continuing to invest in the team,&quot; said Parry who told Ben\u00edtez that the club was likely to shortly change hands. &quot;Of course, we believe it [the take-over] will be a major factor in reinforcing his view that he made the right decision last summer.&quot; Unlike his predecessor G\u00e9rard Houllier, Ben\u00edtez does not always appear the warmest of men. Yet his sometimes diffident demeanour should never be confused with indifference and it was instructive that Liverpool&apos;s manager spent part of last week extolling the virtues of Real Madrid&apos;s global marketing operation to Gillett and Hicks. If Ben\u00edtez&apos;s willingness to put down roots on the Wirral was inspired by faith in his directors, it seems the promise of silverware prompted David Moores, Liverpool&apos;s out-going chairman, to hand the Anfield keys to American owners rather than Dubai&apos;s Maktoum family. &quot;They [Gillett and Hicks] talked about winning trophies,&quot; said Parry. &quot;The debate wasn&apos;t really about money. It was about passion, excitement and trophies.&quot; Nevertheless, Parry stressed that relations with DIC, who fronted the Maktoum bid, had ended on a civilised note. &quot;We have enormous respect for DIC,&quot; he said. DIC have discounted a bid for Newcastle United but the advent of direct flights daily from Tyneside to Dubai could yet provoke alternative interest from the Arabian gulf. Gillett and Hicks, meanwhile, will refrain from schmaltzy posturing as adopted Scousers. &quot;They&apos;ve been very honest, they don&apos;t pretend to be lifelong fans,&quot; said Parry. &quot;They&apos;re not about to come in and change things for the sake of change. Our supporters will not let them. The new owners will quickly get the message if overstep the mark.&quot; Accordingly, Parry suggested ticket pricing was likely to remain &quot;affordable&quot; at Liverpool&apos;s new ground and also allayed fears that the club&apos;s, arguably, under-achieving academy may be sacrificed. &quot;We have invested as much, if not more, than just about any other club in our academy and will continue to develop young English players,&quot; he insisted. &quot;We&apos;re still very, very committed to it.&quot; Ditto Ben\u00edtez to Liverpool.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Liverpool"], "title": "Ben\u00edtez likely to stay after takeover", "sentences": ["If Ben\u00edtez&apos;s willingness to put down roots on the Wirral was inspired by faith in his directors, it seems the promise of silverware prompted David Moores, Liverpool&apos;s out-going chairman, to hand the Anfield keys to American owners rather than Dubai&apos;s Maktoum family.", "DIC have discounted a bid for Newcastle United but the advent of direct flights daily from Tyneside to Dubai could yet provoke alternative interest from the Arabian gulf."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/12/newsstory.sport6", "publicationDate": "2007-02-12T02:08:57Z"}, {"article": "An NHS hospital with an international reputation for medical excellence has been thrown into financial disarray by the government&apos;s health service reforms. After overspending by about \u00a3900,000 in the first half of the year, Moorfields eye hospital in London got a risk alert from the regulator and had its borrowing limits halved. The hospital is recognised as one of the world&apos;s premier centres of ophthalmic expertise. Last week it opened a new children&apos;s complex, the largest in the world for paediatric eye care. Moorfields was in the first wave of NHS trusts to gain independence from Whitehall when it was awarded foundation status in 2005. It is well connected.

On February 28 the Prince of Wales will visit the &quot;health city&quot; in Dubai, where Moorfields is planning to set up an offshoot eye hospital to develop its corporate brand in the expanding Middle East healthcare market. But the trust&apos;s connections could not protect it from a collapse in income. The foundation trusts regulator, Monitor, issued a financial warning in December, saying Moorfields was at risk of breaching its operating licence if it did not act quickly to restore stability. It halved the trust&apos;s borrowing limit to \u00a312m and invited it to call in the consultants KPMG to help devise a recovery plan. Ian Balmer, the trust&apos;s chief executive, said it was caught up in a financial maelstrom caused by deficits in other parts of the NHS. Under the government&apos;s payment by results system, hospitals are paid for each treatment according to a national tariff. Payment is made by the local primary care trusts, which commission care for patients in their areas. This year many PCTs are struggling to avoid going into deficit and are entitled to set restrictions on the speed at which hospitals work. Moorfields was told by the PCT it would not pay for non-emergency treatment unless patients had been on the waiting list for at least 10 weeks. The hospital had been working on an average four weeks&apos; waiting time, so the restriction caused an immediate loss of workload. Mr Balmer said: &quot;For a period we were operating at 12% below our surgical capacity. That meant our income dropped below the level planned.&quot; The trust also lost \u00a3315,000 in August when the London strategic health authority cut allocations for training junior doctors.", "tags": ["NHS", "Health", "Politics", "Society", "Health & wellbeing", "UK news", "Health policy"], "title": "Health reforms cause financial disarray at top eye hospital", "sentences": ["On February 28 the Prince of Wales will visit the &quot;health city&quot; in Dubai, where Moorfields is planning to set up an offshoot eye hospital to develop its corporate brand in the expanding Middle East healthcare market."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/feb/12/hospitals.health", "publicationDate": "2007-02-12T10:22:44Z"}, {"article": "The Canadian luxury hotel chain Four Seasons is to go private by accepting a $3.8bn (\u00a31.75bn) takeover bid from Bill Gates and the Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.

Morgan, whose only challenger is his Indian counterpart Sharad Pawar, faces an uphill battle to gather sufficient support to defeat the Asian power bloc on the ICC. Pawar was a late arrival in the battle to succeed the South African Percy Sonn and has been president of the Indian board for only 15 months. Morgan, by contrast, has been an ICC member for four years. Despite this disparity and the fact that the last but one ICC president was also Indian, Pawar is guaranteed at least four votes from the nominations committee, chaired by India&apos;s AC Muttiah. Five members of the committee each represent two territories, with a sixth representing the associate members, so to win the recommendation Morgan will need the support of Australia-New Zealand and South Africa-Zimbabwe as well as that of Stephen Camacho from West Indies. Camacho holds the key, because despite also representing England on the committee he is not certain to support Morgan. West Indies have been courted by the Indian board, with the recent one-day series in India interpreted in some quarters as a favour to the cash-strapped WI board.

Commenting on how much she had missed the event when absent last year, Balding said: &quot;It wasn&apos;t the same without the usual misogynist abuse from Ginger.

His father, Milkha &quot;The Flying Sikh&quot; Singh, was and remains India&apos;s most famous sprinter courtesy of his exploits on the track back in the late 50s and early 60s, when he was recognised as one of the best 400m runners in the world. &quot;Even now he can&apos;t go anywhere in India without being recognised - train stations, airports, anywhere, people shout out to him. He&apos;s a legend,&quot; says a proud son, whose own exploits in the world of golf have earned him a few shouts of his own. When Singh won the Volvo Masters at Valderrama at the tail-end of last year he did so on a day when the India cricket team lost, prompting one newspaper to carry the front-page headline &quot;Indian team loses but Jeev makes up for us&quot;. Singh, who became the second Indian to win on the European tour when he headed the field at last year&apos;s China Open, climbed up the world rankings to 37th place and was named his country&apos;s 2006 sportsman of the year. He was no longer the son of a famous athlete but a famous athlete in his own right - a transition that will be acknowledged in April when he becomes the first Indian to compete at the US Masters. &quot;It has been my dream to play there since I was a boy,&quot; Singh says, repeating the mantra of anyone who has received the tap on the shoulder from the men in green blazers. Needless to say, the invitation has been framed and hangs on the wall at home. Singh may be the first player from the subcontinent to tee it up at Augusta but it is safe to assume he will not be the last. Currently India has two players in the top 100 (Singh at 42 and Jyoti Randhawa at 88), while the promising Shiv Kapur has moved up to 182. If two in the top 100 does not exactly spell global domination it is at least one more than Scotland (Colin Montgomerie at 19) and there is a sound explanation as to why there have not been more top-class Indian players. Golf is a rich man&apos;s sport in India. Currently, there is one only course in the country allowing full access to the public. If you want to play you either need to become a member of a club (which is tough unless you come from the right social background) or you need to be invited to play by a member, which is hardly a practical arrangement for a promising player looking to make it as a professional. &quot;I was lucky. My father was a member of the club in our home town, Chadigarh, and I was able to cycle down there every day and play whenever I wanted,&quot; Singh says, adding that only a handful of the bigger cities have public driving ranges. &quot;Until we have driving ranges in every town and city in the country we will have a problem. We need to get to the stage where the common man can walk in off the street and try out the game.&quot; That might take longer than Singh would wish. A booming economy means there will be money available to expand the game in India but if the experience of China - where club memberships can run to \u00a3100,000-plus - is repeated there will be precious little money spent taking the game to the common man. The leisure needs of the newly wealthy classes need to be catered to and already the big names are circling. &quot;We are in negotiations about moving into India,&quot; Greg Norman said this month. The Great White Shark charges around $2m (\u00a31m) to design a course and his fee is reflected in membership fees. It is an all too familiar story, depressingly so, but Singh refuses to be pessimistic. The achievements of the current Indian professionals will provide enough inspiration for the country&apos;s young players, even if they do find it hard to find a place to play the game. &quot;There will be a wave of Indian golfers coming through over the next decade or so,&quot; Singh predicts. &quot;The big difference from the past is in the parents, who are now ready to give their kids what you could call a &apos;free go&apos; at professional golf. There is a lot of emphasis in Indian culture on education and getting your degree, then going on to a good job like doctor or in hi-tech. But the parents are seeing guys doing well in professional golf and they&apos;re saying to their children - OK, study hard but if you want to make a career in golf, go and do it.&quot;  Stars of the subcontinent Jeev Milkha Singh Age 35 Turned pro 1991 Singh, currently 42nd in the world ranking, is India&apos;s best ever player. He won his European tour card in 1997 after finishing 13th at qualifying school. Although a consistent performer on tour, his career only took off in 2006 when he won the China Open and the Volvo Masters. In April he will become the first Indian player to compete at the Masters. Arjun Atwal Age 33 Turned Pro 1995 Atwal, pictured right, was the first Indian golfer to win a European tour event, the 2002 Singapore Masters. Won again in Europe the following year before moving to the United States, where he finished seventh in the PGA tour qualifying school. The first player in the history of the Asian tour to win over $1m (\u00a3500,000) in a single season (2003). Jyoti Randhawa Age 34 Turned pro 1994 The son of a retired army general, he made his name on the Asian tour and in 2002 was the first Indian player to win its order of merit. Randhawa moved full-time on to the European tour in 2005 and had three top-10 finishes. He was in contention at the recent Dubai Desert Classic before slipping back on the closing day. He is currently ranked 11th in the European tour&apos;s order of merit. Shiv Kapur Age 25 Turned pro 2004 The youngest of the Indian contingent on the European tour, he has perhaps the most impressive pedigree. He was an outstanding amateur, winning the individual gold medal at the 2002 Asian Games. Was 2005 rookie of the year on the Asian tour.

After topping the FTSE 100 gainers on talk of private equity interest yesterday, today it led the fallers, down 32p at \u00a313.75.   The leaders board top spot went to business and science publishing giant Reed Elsevier. It rose 40p, or 6.6%, to 644.5p after announcing it wants to sell off its education division. Analysts say the sale, announced alongside Reed&apos;s latest results, could raise some \u00a32bn.   Shares in rival publisher Pearson were up 15p to 831.5p. Further down the market, publishing and conferences group Informa was up 26p, or 4.6%, at 595p.   Back on the FTSE 100, Diageo was one of the biggest risers as the drinks group raised its full-year growth guidance.

The shares were up 8.25p, or 3.9%, at 219p as speculation of a takeover bid for the world&apos;s third-largest music company provided support. EMI&apos;s weaker share price and news of a continuing struggle in North America was also seen as making a Warner Music takeover more likely once the regulatory situation becomes clearer.

Credit Suisse cut its target to 280p from 300p and Panmure Gordon cut its target to 181p from 225p. Lehman Brothers kept its &quot;equal-weight&quot; recommendation but cut the price target to 230p from 255p.   &quot;Given that weaker releases appear to be responsible for only a small part of the weakness so far this year, and the physical declines for retailers in other markets are likely to follow those in the US, without a significant reduction in internet piracy, this would imply the market could remain tough for the next couple of years,&quot; said Lehman&apos;s Richard Jones.

If Henin can get to the final again, she may find herself facing Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, who beat her both in the Wimbledon final and in last year&apos;s Australian Open final, from which she controversially retired. The atmosphere between the two has been strained ever since. Life may not get any easier this week. Eleni Daniilidou of Greece defeated the seventh-seeded Li Na of China in the first round yesterday. Daniilidou, the world No42, beat the 16th-ranked Li 6-7, 7-6, 6-3 in a match lasting just over three hours. Maria Kirilenko of Russia advanced to the second round after beating the wild card Monica Niculescu of Romania 6-3, 6-0. &quot;It was a really easy match for me.

Thus it was that following Wednesday&apos;s Brit Awards, though she failed to win any of the four gongs for which she was nominated, the 21-year-old singer still managed to secure widespread coverage thanks to a striking green silk strapless number, worn, uncharacteristically, with smart stilettos rather than her trademark trainers. Now Allen&apos;s idiosyncratic sense of style is set to boost her career yet further, with the announcement that she is to design a collection for a high street fashion chain. She has collaborated with the women&apos;s clothing retailer New Look to create &quot;an exclusive range of signature dresses and accessories&quot;, to be launched on May 9 in 312 of the store&apos;s outlets, including shops in France, Dubai and Belgium. The Allen/New Look collaboration is the latest in what has become an important tool for high street retailers seeking to give their brands the edge. Next month, H&amp;M will launch M by Madonna, a clothing line co-created by the singer and the chain&apos;s head of design. Madonna, according to a spokeswoman, &quot;has chosen the best pieces from her wardrobe and we have recreated them&quot;, resulting in a collection that the company promises will &quot;reflect Madonna&apos;s fashion sensibilities, modern elegance and femininity&quot;. On May 1, the model Kate Moss is releasing her 90-piece collection with Topshop, described by one newspaper yesterday as &quot;the most eagerly awaited clothing line ever&quot;. As a trend, City analysts said last night that celebrity collaborations were almost certain to increase. Rita Clifton, chairman of the brand consultancy Interbrand, said: &quot;The idea of using celebrities in some way is as old as marketing itself ... What is interesting is the movement from endorsement [by celebrities] to active engagement.&quot; Celebrity itself, Ms Clifton said, is &quot;fragile&quot; - in other words, if your star falls from favour, so can your fashion label. The advantage for fashion chains is that they are so fast moving: if Allen&apos;s collection flops, New Look can have another to replace it in a matter of months. The appeal of big-name capsule ranges to retailers whose bread and butter lies in cheaper fashion basics has not been difficult to fathom since Stella McCartney&apos;s November 2005 collection for H&amp;M - the collection had sold out of the 25 stores in which it was released within an hour. Ranges by Karl Lagerfeld and later Viktor and Rolf for H&amp;M, Celia Birtwell for Topshop and Roland Mouret for Gap all sparked similar frenzies. New Look is banking on the hope that Allen&apos;s collection will have the same effect. &quot;Lily is young, very talented, gorgeous, opinionated and feisty, and we think a lot of our custom ers will identify with that,&quot; said Sarah Walter, head of fashion communication at the chain. Peter Ruppert, who runs music consultancy Entertainment Media Research, said Allen&apos;s current &quot;emotional attachment&quot; rating was well above average for 13- to 19-year-old females and also above average in the 20- to 29-year-old demographic, making her a good fit with New Look. &quot;It could be good for New Look that they got in now. She&apos;s still got a lot of growing to do. She needs a second album to show she&apos;s for real,&quot; he said. But not all industry watchers are convinced that attaching a celebrity name to a collection is enough. &quot;Apart from a very few other instances, the British high street is unique in the world in getting respected designers to collaborate, and that has been hugely successful,&quot; said Paula Reed, style director at Grazia magazine. &quot;That wide access to high fashion at a really low price is phenomenal, and we have seen people go totally gangbusters for it. But the celebrity designer is a slightly unknown quantity.&quot; The release of a single Madonna-designed tracksuit through H&amp;M didn&apos;t really work, she said. Nor is every launch quite the success that the attention it attracts would suggest. Gap&apos;s flagship London store may have sold 500 Roland Mouret dresses within two hours of their launch, but racks of them were hanging unloved and hugely discounted in the January sale. The collaboration may have freshened Gap&apos;s image but it made scarcely a dent in its dreadful Christmas sales figures, and last month the chain issued its third profit warning in six months. The results of Moss&apos;s hiring by Topshop for a reported \u00a33m may be eagerly anticipated, but the company could yet come to view the departure at the same time of its style director Jane Shepherdson as more significant. In her eight years in the job, she increased profits from \u00a39m a year to \u00a3110m. The factors behind high street success are complex: one of the reasons that Gap has struggled against leaner European competitors is that with the majority of its stores in the US, it cannot react to trends with the same speed. H&amp;M&apos;s focus on designer collections disguises the fact it has been overtaken as Europe&apos;s biggest fashion chain by Zara, which relies on an old-fashioned policy of opening more stores rather than buying celebrities. &quot;The PR machine behind these launches is very sophisticated,&quot; said Lorna Hall, executive editor of the fashion industry magazine Drapers. &quot;Retailers boost the pent-up demand before the launch, and the fashion cognoscenti get excited. But these things are really self-perpetuating. The media frenzy creates customer demand, and if we&apos;re honest, a lot of that demand is people buying racks of the stuff and putting it up on eBay - people seeing a commercial reason for buying it rather than anything to do with the designs. &quot;The PR worth of the sort of coverage they get ... is astronomical. Retailers all err on the side of making too few of the collections so that they remain in demand. But one consequence of it being so limited is that the real worth is really only in the publicity.&quot;", "tags": ["Retail industry", "Business", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Music", "UK news", "Lily Allen"], "title": "After Moss and Madonna, Lily Allen tries to make the high street smile", "sentences": ["She has collaborated with the women&apos;s clothing retailer New Look to create &quot;an exclusive range of signature dresses and accessories&quot;, to be launched on May 9 in 312 of the store&apos;s outlets, including shops in France, Dubai and Belgium."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/20/retail.musicnews", "publicationDate": "2007-02-20T09:03:13Z"}, {"article": "The world No3, Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, flew in at short notice yesterday to help save the Dubai Open after the late withdrawals of Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams and criticised some of her fellow players.

The Australian and US Open treat both sexes as equal and last year the French decided that only the respective champions should receive the same. However, if Wimbledon follows the limited line of the French, it can expect further criticism from the WTA Tour. Last year Billie Jean King, six times the Wimbledon singles champion and a pioneer for equality in the women&apos;s game, pleaded with the All England Club to change its mind. &quot;It&apos;s just the right thing to do in the 21st century,&quot; King said. &quot;I would hope they would find it in their hearts and minds.&quot; Should Wimbledon, like the French, fudge the issue, then the voices raised against it will become ever more virulent. Wimbledon has come under increasing pressure to change its mind, although Tim Phillips, chairman of the All England Club, has always cited the various polls that the club has conducted which he claimed showed that the men gave better value for money. King has regularly dismissed such arguments as an irrelevance. &quot;Women&apos;s tennis is the leader in women&apos;s sports. Equal prize money is a no-brainer.&quot; The American also discounted the argument that men got paid more because they play best-of-five sets while the women play three. &quot;Entertainers don&apos;t get paid by the hour. They just get paid, period. It&apos;s a done deal.&quot; Last year the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, called for the abolition of pay differences between men and women players at Wimbledon, expressing &quot;deep concern&quot; over the disparity in prize money. Last year Roger Federer, the men&apos;s champion, earned \u00a3655,000 while his female counterpart, Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, took home \u00a3625,000. Larry Scott, chief executive of the WTA Tour, said that, with the championships making \u00a325m annually, it was clear that the small disparity was &quot;a social and political statement&quot;. Jowell added that it was anomalous than women should receive less prize money than men and that it was tarnishing Wimbledon&apos;s image: &quot;Nor does the gap reflect the society of equal opportunity that the UK has become in the 21st century.&quot; Justine Henin, last year&apos;s defeated Wimbledon finalist, was forced to recover from close to defeat against a 16-year-old qualifier before surviving in a tournament in which she has never lost.

Had Henin lost that rally, the Austrian teenager would have been serving for the match and might well have gone on to complete one of the tour&apos;s biggest upsets. &quot;She was playing very well and I was not feeling comfortable on court,&quot; said Henin. &quot;I was very nervous and I was way from my best level but I kept a good attitude and that was important for me. &quot;I knew it might be difficult because she is young and with nothing to lose and I am coming through a very, very difficult time in my life,&quot; Henin added, referring to the recent split with her husband. &quot;It takes time to find myself again.

Young Arabs identify with the resilience and irrepressibility of a man who struggled up from an incredibly difficult life and rose to the top against all odds - not to mention his swagger, quick tongue and irresistable beats. Their experiences often resonates with rap&apos;s depictions of oppressed communities struggling against poverty, absence of opportunity, political impotence, street violence, indifferent government and a hostile mainstream culture. Arabs bitter over American foreign policy could relate when Kanye West electrified a televised Hurricane Katrina relief program with his outraged cry that &quot;George Bush doesn&apos;t care about black people&quot; or when Eminem denounced Bush and the Iraq War (&quot;No more blood for oil, we got our battles to fight on our own soil&quot;). Hip hop&apos;s popularity in the region might seem like an opportunity for some &quot;cultural diplomacy&quot;, a notion that harkens back to the brilliant officially sponsored jazz tours by Louis Armstrong in the 1950s. American Arabic language Radio Sawa has won a sizable audience with a steady (if bland) diet of popular hip hop songs, and the US State Department has recently sponsored some hip hop cultural diplomacy tours. But, frankly, hip hop makes a poor candidate for official cultural diplomacy. Its blistering social and political critiques (to say nothing of the materialist, violent, sex-and-drugs drenched lyrics of too many rappers) clash rather starkly with the image that the US govenrment would prefer to convey. That the descendents of Public Enemy&apos;s call to &quot;fight the power&quot; find an eager audience in the Middle East might rightly worry American policy makers. If the Federal Communications Commission can&apos;t handle Eminem&apos;s albums at home, it&apos;s hard to see how the government could, would (or should) promote them abroad. I would not envy the State Department official trying to explain to Congress why taxpayers sponsored a tour by, say, Outkast (sample: &quot;basically America, you got f***ed&quot;). But forget governments. The popular American Muslim rapper Mos Def doesn&apos;t need the American government to play Dubai. American Hip hop is already big in a Middle East - which is increasingly drenched in music videos and hybrid pop music - as well as homegrown hip hop. For some, that&apos;s part of the problem. American conservatives like Dinesh D&apos;Souza see American popular culture as a major source of anti-Americanism, and claim Muslims are rightly offended by the perceived relentless assault on traditional family values. Is there a solution? I recently sat down in Doha with Ben Chaviz, President of the Hip Hop Summit Action Network, which has worked with hip hop artists to channel energy into transforming the very communities whose problems they so graphically depict. The hip hop community&apos;s political consciousness is turning increasingly global, he said, pointing to Jay Z&apos;s work as a UN Goodwill Ambassador as one example. This kind of non-governmental activism is an interesting alternative to both official cultural diplomacy and D&apos;Souza&apos;s tiresome conservative grousing. Nobody seriously thinks that pop culture is going to solve the world&apos;s problems, or even America&apos;s political problems in the Middle East. (50 Cent&apos;s popularity in both Lebanon and Israel didn&apos;t stop the countries from going to war.) But what hip hop can do, perhaps, is build political awareness and engagement across the Western-Islamic divide. D&apos;Souza may hate it, and it won&apos;t help Bush. But the angry, diverse and mobilized voices of hip hop show Arabs a side of American culture that resonates, and gives young Arabs and Americans something in common to talk about.

And so are the carbon offsets. The 2007 Business Travel Show is as good a place as any to find out how seriously the industry is taking climate change, and it was certainly making a special effort this year. The whole event was declared carbon neutral - even those of us who travelled to Earl&apos;s Court by tube were urged to offset our emissions - and the usual array of travel booking databases was joined by this year&apos;s must-have add-on: a carbon emissions calculator. With it, companies can track their emissions, offset them and declare them as such in the annual corporate social responsibility (CSR) report. On an artificial-turfed, planted-up podium, rail booking site TheTrainLine.com was basking in the satisfaction of being the greenest option at the show. Its sales director, Adrian Watts, said the publication of the Stern review in October &quot;had quite a marked impact&quot; on businesses&apos; attitude towards climate change and their willingness to go by rail. &quot;A lot of our corporate customers adopted a policy of only travelling by train domestically.&quot; They also wanted to be able to calculate their emissions more easily, which is why TheTrainLine has added a calculator to its business travel arm. Like most of the carbon calculators on show at Earl&apos;s Court, TheTrainLine&apos;s version draws on the Department of Environment&apos;s emissions data. It can distinguish between a trip to Glasgow on the east and west coast mainlines, but not between, say, diesel and electric trains. &quot;As demand grows it will become more sophisticated,&quot; Watts says. Corporate travel managers Hogg Robinson said they intended to expand their airline emissions calculator to include rail and car travel and hotel stays. Clients will also be able to look for a tree icon denoting a &quot;greener&quot; hotel that meets the International Organisation for Standardisation&apos;s criteria. Commendable - except that if you want to find out exactly what the ISO&apos;s standards are, you&apos;ll need to pay \u00a342 to download the 22-page document. For air travellers, the rough and ready Defra statistics are better than nothing. But they do disguise considerable variation in carbon emissions between different planes, the altitude at which they fly and the load factor on any given flight - not to mention the amount of space allocated to each passenger within the cabin. The airlines deplore the recent hike in air passenger duty, but it does take account of the greater contribution that those flying business make to a plane&apos;s overall emissions. Most of the carbon calculator tools do not. Whether you regard this as proof of the industry&apos;s willingness to subsidise economy passengers or evidence of a deluded, quick-fix approach to global warming probably depends on which side of the cabin curtain you sit. Indeed, business class was where the cracks in the industry&apos;s green face paint really began to show. Environmental credentials are newsworthy, but long-haul business travellers are lucrative, and they increasingly regard cabin space as the trade-off for the indignities and inconveniences of airport security. British Airways was showing off its new flat bed with extra shoulder room. Launched last year and currently available on a few planes - most of them into and out of New York JFK - it should be rolled out to the whole of the long-haul fleet by the end of the year. Regular fliers will also appreciate the screen divider between facing seats, which is a considerable improvement on the old blue fan. Cabin crew can see through it, but seated passengers can&apos;t. The TV screen is also bigger, the choice of films much wider, and the quilted eiderdown doesn&apos;t seem to accumulate static as the blanket did. Palpable buzz There was a palpable buzz around 16-month-old Eos Airlines, one of the new breed of all-business class transatlantic airlines that tries to evoke the atmosphere of a private jet. (It also, through a quirk of the legislation on air passenger duty, pays the economy rate.) Winner of the Best Longhaul Business Airline award in the 2007 Business Travel World awards, it only flies to JFK at the moment, although Washington DC and Boston are possible future destinations. Director of marketing, Ian Scott, admits it is impossible for Eos to offer the same frequent flyer perks as BA or Virgin Atlantic, but insists that NY-LON commuters who try the service are converted. Many of them prefer flying out of Stansted, he says, because they work in the City or Canary Wharf and appreciate the 45-minute check-in at the Essex airport - particularly the fact that Eos will meet you at the kerb to hurry you through security if you call to say you&apos;re running late. Silverjet, which is trying to capture the north London transatlantic market with all-business flights from Luton to Newark, was trying to go one better by declaring itself carbon neutral. The offset is included in the price of the ticket. The other attraction is a 30-minute check-in that bypasses the main security queues. Like Eos, it is also trying to make a virtue out of its lack of slots at Heathrow. &quot;Airports like Heathrow and JFK in New York have become too big and too congested to cope with passenger volumes,&quot; says Silverjet&apos;s CEO. Unfortunately for the airline, the ongoing M1 roadworks have forced Silverjet to advise passengers to allow extra time to get to Luton airport. This unfortunate state of affairs will continue until autumn 2008. Of course, the show isn&apos;t just about planes and trains, and the hotel chains were out in force. Premier Travel Inn was working particularly hard to differentiate itself from Travelodge - promising &quot;Marriott-quality&quot; beds and more Wi-Fi internet. The chain is also trying to attract women travelling alone on business by vaunting its 24-hour reception desk and a policy of not assigning women ground floor rooms. &quot;Further to new research into women&apos;s concerns&quot;, cleaners have also been instructed to leave the shower curtain half-open. One can only assume that the memory of Hitchcock&apos;s Psycho still haunts Premier Travel Inn guests. It will be interesting to see whether the chain will make a particular effort to cater for women business travellers when it expands into Dubai later this year. Jumeirah, which was also at the show this year, reserves the 40th floor of the city&apos;s Emirates Towers Hotel for women - but its spa, H20, is exclusively for men. New technology at the Business Travel Show \u00b7 Omneport is an online storage space that lets you scan in travel documents and share Word, Adobe, PowerPoint and Excel files with colleagues.

His sudden departure is something of a mystery, though it may be connected to the coverage of racing from Nad Al Sheba. In his Racing Post column yesterday, we were intrigued to see Willoughby highlight the poor form of the Godolphin stable at the Dubai Carnival so far. Robert Winston is not appealing against the one-year suspension he received at the conclusion of a Horseracing Regulatory Authority enquiry last week, but his legal team are active on another front. We gather Winston is taking action against the Racing Post arising from the latter&apos;s reporting of the case, ahead of the HRA findings, in last Friday&apos;s paper. Winston was found guilty of passing on information for reward, but was not in breach of failing to ride his mounts on their merits in the 21 races under investigation. Smoothly Does It did it - twice - but it will be a while before the gelding is adding to his brace of Wetherby wins, as he is sidelined with leg trouble. Bad luck for the syndicate of Timeform employees, who did so well with Saif Sareea and saw the potential in Smoothly Does It by claiming him out of a seller and sending him to Richard Fahey. Former Newmarket trainer Sean Woods, currently plying his trade in Hong Kong, could be set for a return to racing&apos;s headquarters.

It went unnoticed at the time. But for Mr Livingstone&apos;s opponents, fuming still at the international &quot;oil for brooms&quot; deal he signed this week with Hugo Chavez, of Venezuela, and smarting over his claim that the mayoralty is as much about international diplomacy as municipal stewardship, it should now be taken as a sign that things are only going to get worse. The Guardian has learned that officials at City Hall, central London, have begun &quot;scoping&quot; work on the prospects for international cooperation between the capital and Brazil. Mr Livingstone&apos;s team are concentrating in the short term on relations with China, India and Russia as well as on the nuts and bolts of the deal with Venezuela. But Brazil has also been identified as another rising force with which London must make common cause. &quot;Lula thinks London is a very important place and we are looking closely at the situation there,&quot; a source said. &quot;It may be four or five years down the road but Brazil has many things going for it. It is a major manufacturer of cars and steel. It is also the biggest producer of ethanol, which will be a key commodity in the fight against climate change.&quot; London considers itself well placed to provide municipal consultancy. &quot;If you went to one of the big consultancy firms and said &apos;let&apos;s rebuild a city&apos; the cost would be colossal. We have over 100 years experience of running a successful city,&quot; the source said. Unveiling his Venezuela deal this week, the mayor trumpeted the benefits for 250,000 poor Londoners, who will get half-priced bus and tram travel using the \u00a316m saving via the receipt of cheap oil from Hugo Chavez. But Mr Livingstone also said the deal was part of a strategy and wider philosophy. &quot;We will work with cities right the way across the world. People see themselves as partners on one planet and we either save the world together or die together.&quot; He said the notion particularly applied to the response to climate change. Mr Livingstone believes that for a city like London international diplomacy by the mayor is a matter of necessity. Next week, he plays host to the mayors of Paris, Moscow, Berlin and Beijing. The leaders of other devolved administrations also venture further afield. Last year Rhodri Morgan, the Welsh first minister, went to China, Dubai, Brittany, Brussels and Latvia. Jack McConnell, Scotland&apos;s first minister, took six foreign trips between April 2005 and 2006, including Canada, Australia, Malawi, China and Belgium. London&apos;s mayor has been abroad 20 times since 2004, on visits including tips to Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, Singapore, and Moscow. Last year he famously tried to visit President Chavez in Caracas but returned home because the Venezuelan leader could not see him. London has &quot;embassies&quot; in Brussels, Beijing and Shanghai with offices in Mumbai and New Delhi due to open in November, all of which the mayor claims are cost effective. &quot;We don&apos;t have a foreign policy,&quot; a source said. &quot;We have a domestic policy that requires us to have these international links.&quot; But Mr Livingstone&apos;s macro approach to the job of municipal leadership is controversial and the Venezuela deal has particularly infuriated his critics. Hours after the accord was signed, the London Assembly announced an investigation. Members have also been forcing his administration to justify the travel bill. The policy also carries the risk of guilt by association, particularly for a mayor who so guards his political reputation. The mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delano\u00eb, is a political ally but the mayor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, who signed a partnership agreement with Mr Livingstone, is seen by some as a rightwing nationalist. President Chavez is also both loved and loathed. Referring to his relations with Venezuela&apos;s media, this week&apos;s Economist magazine accused the president of &quot;silencing dissenting views little by little&quot;. Angie Bray, Tory leader at City Hall, said the international links required scrutiny. &quot;I can see the logic of deals with major cities but what has happened with Venezuela is basically the politics of the pirate. What next? Cheap rice from Cambodia? Cheap cigars from Havana? In any event, I am not sure people in London would think the mayor and his team run our services so efficiently that they have time to run them anywhere else.&quot; She added: &quot;He wasn&apos;t elected to have a foreign policy. He has very specific areas of responsibility.&quot;", "tags": ["Local government", "Brazil", "London politics", "Politics", "Travel", "Brazil holidays", "Rio de Janeiro holidays", "UK news", "Hugo Ch\u00e1vez", "Venezuela", "World news", "Americas"], "title": "After Caracas deal London mayor sets out to build links with Rio", "sentences": ["Last year Rhodri Morgan, the Welsh first minister, went to China, Dubai, Brittany, Brussels and Latvia."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/feb/24/localgovernment.brazil", "publicationDate": "2007-02-24T23:57:53Z"}, {"article": "Secret plans by London Mayor Ken Livingstone to create central London&apos;s first purpose-built international convention centre (ICC) have been uncovered by The Observer. The spectacular proposal would see a world class 5,000-seat facility built on land around Centre Point along New Oxford Street in the West End . The plan would involve persuading the landlord of Centre Point, tycoon Ardeshir Naghshineh, to convert the listed tower into a luxury hotel. A convention centre would boost the West End&apos;s retail and leisure sector and help regenerate Oxford Street. Though one of the world&apos;s most famous shopping streets, its east side in particular has grown markedly tatty. Although Livingstone&apos;s staff have been working on the plans in secret for years, it is understood that the four landowners affected have been sounded out. There are still plenty of obstacles to be overcome if the convention centre is to be built. Ultimately, the mayor could purchase the land compulsorily to push the plan through, but that is an option of last resort. Apart from former civil engineer Naghshineh, a key landowner is Lawrence Kirschel, a former business partner of Paul Raymond who has a fortune estimated at more than \u00a3200m. James Bidwell, chief executive of Visit London, the city&apos;s official tourist body, said: &apos;A central location for a convention centre is attractive because it would have direct benefit to the retail, restaurant and theatres. This would be a tremendous asset for our tourism economy.&apos; The plan would take years to bring to life. Insiders say it is unlikely to be built until after the 2012 Olympics. Plans for a new international convention centre come as London&apos;s tourism sector has enjoyed a record year.

Henin&apos;s 6-4 7-5 win over her great rival maintained a 16-match winning streak at the Dubai Open and was achieved by courage, a little luck, and growing confidence in her ability to impose the best all-round game on the women&apos;s tour. The luck came from surviving a shaky near-defeat in her opening match against a 16-year-old qualifier, Tamira Paszek, and the courage from her determination to fight through only the second tournament of the year since the break-up of her marriage. &apos;I found I could deal with my emotions in the last two matches,&apos; said Henin. &apos;But I still have to improve. I still have to find some stability. I have had a difficult time and it is going to take a while.&apos; But Mauresmo, who still has not forgiven Henin for retiring in last year&apos;s Australian Open final because of illness, had a different view. &apos;I don&apos;t really see a difference in her [before and after the marriage break-up],&apos; she said. Certainly Henin was nearly back to her best yesterday. She attacked Mauresmo&apos;s second serve at every opportunity, broke straight away, risked more net attacks than she once did and hurtled to a 4-1 lead. The Wimbledon champion recovered well enough to earn three points for 4-4 but her inability to take them was crucial. Henin squeezed out the set, saved another break point at the start of the second and then held serve right through, jumping into topspin drives with increasing energy. She then pinched the match-winning break in the penultimate game with the help of a Mauresmo double fault on game point.

Yesterday he walked away from the Gallery club here in Arizona as the World Match Play champion, Europe&apos;s highest ranked player and the man most likely to thwart Tiger Woods&apos;s hopes of rewriting history this season by winning all four majors. Modern professional golf is awash with players who mouth defiance in the face of Woods&apos;s dominance but few mean it, and those who do rarely deliver. Stenson stands out from this meek-willed crowd. He can play, obviously, but more importantly he has the mental strength to stand up to the world No1. His comeback from the depths of despair at the K Club in 2001 proves this, as does his performance in holding off a charging Woods at the Dubai Desert Classic this season.  Even when he performs fitfully - as he did for long stretches during yesterday&apos;s 36-hole final against the defending champion, Geoff Ogilvy - the Swede seldom takes his eye off the prize. When it came to the crux yesterday he was more than up to the task, hitting a nine-iron at the par-three 16th hole of the afternoon round to less than two feet for a conceded birdie. He ended the match at the next, a 600-yard par-five, when he reached the green in two shots then rolled a long, arcing putt to within tap-in distance to claim the $1.3m (\u00a3660,000) winner&apos;s cheque. Stenson is now up from eighth to fifth in the world golf rankings. That position, the highest of the 30-year-old&apos;s career, is a real achievement and no doubt his bank manager will be delighted. But the Swede is a man with his eyes fixed on horizons far beyond such prizes. Golfing historians demand meatier fare than world golf championships and ranking points. &quot;I want to be as good as I can be in the majors,&quot; he said yesterday. Translated, that means he wants to win the Masters or the Open Championship and he wants to do it this year. The prospect of watching him strive for his goal is a lip-smacking one but for the time being there was yesterday&apos;s contest to savour. In truth, it fell short of expectations - hardly surprising given that both players had come through five matches to reach yesterday&apos;s final and were then sent out again for 36 holes.  Stenson had the best of the morning&apos;s play and headed into lunch two up. Whatever was on the menu clearly didn&apos;t agree with the Swede because on the opening nine holes of the afternoon round he had four bogies and five pars. That kind of scoring might win an umbrella in the Saturday morning medal but in the final of the world matchplay championship it is liable to earn you nothing but trouble. Sure enough, Ogilvy took advantage and opened up a two-hole lead of his own. But just when the Australian appeared to have the match within his grasp he faltered, bogeying the ninth and 11th holes to restore parity. The Swede took the lead at the next hole and never lost it. However the rest of the season turns out, Stenson can content himself with the knowledge that he is now considered by many to be Europe&apos;s best golfer although he would be advised not to rest long on his laurels because the chasing pack is eager, young and talented, with the likes of Paul Casey and Justin Rose to the fore. Rose, in particular, has caught the eye in a week which has seen Europe&apos;s old guard of Darren Clarke, Thomas Bjorn and Colin Montgomerie continue their seemingly inexorable descent towards irrelevance. All departed earlier in the tournament while the 26-year-old Englishman Rose, who was eventually beaten in the quarter-finals by Trevor Immelman, has finally come of age.  Casey is another who continues to improve. Like his countryman Rose he succumbed at the quarter-final stage but there is no denying his lofty status in the European game these days, as his 4&amp;3 victory over Montgomerie illustrated all too well. Once upon a time, such a result might have raised an eyebrow or two.

Her opinion, expressed yesterday on Radio Five Live, suggests she agrees with those who reckon that, if women are now to be paid the same as men, they should play best -of-five set matches like men. The Wimbledon champion was speaking after last week&apos;s decision by the All England Club to award equal prize money to men and women. Whether five-set women&apos;s finals would produce a better spectacle is questionable, as Mauresmo&apos;s oft-repeated view implicitly makes clear. She repeated it on Saturday, after losing a sparkling final 6-4, 7-5 to Justine Henin in the Dubai Open. &quot;Most of the people agree that it&apos;s not a matter of how long we women spend on court,&quot; Mauresmo said. &quot;The men are always going to play longer because they play best-of-five sets. It&apos;s just a principle of being equal.&quot; Had Mauresmo and Henin played more than best-of-three sets, their high-standard contest might have deteriorated. Tennis makes grinding demands on physical strength, and the beauty of this match was in escaping that constriction. Both players produced a range of strokes before Mauresmo&apos;s tiredness, perhaps the result of a hectic schedule, caused her to produce a poor penultimate game, allowing Henin to make the only service break of an excellent second set. Henin said: &quot;I&apos;m very happy the way I played. A fourth title here in Dubai is an amazing feeling. It&apos;s only my second tournament back after such a long time, and I could play my best tennis.&quot; For Mauresmo, winner here in 2002, the match proved to be one too many as she was seeking to claim back-to-back titles following her triumph in Antwerp last week. &quot;I came a little short physically, especially in the second set,&quot; said Mauresmo. &quot;I said at the beginning of the week it was going to be difficult to get through to the end.

Such is the dominance of the triple grand-slam titleholder that he is allowing himself to consider the possibility of overtaking Pete Sampras&apos;s record of 286 weeks in total as No1. Whether Federer is entirely wise to do so is questionable, although it is good for the promotion of the game that such records have a fascination for him because he is likely to have many more opportunities to talk about them. &quot;This is definitely going to stay maybe for quite some time,&quot; he said about today&apos;s great statistic. &quot;I&apos;ll definitely keep it for three years. It&apos;s a nice record to have and it&apos;s very hard to beat. It&apos;s not something you do overnight. It&apos;s a long hard-working process. I&apos;ve known I am going to break it ever since I beat Andy Roddick in the Masters Cup - Jimmy Connors being there - so it&apos;s actually quite ironic. &quot;I&apos;ve been looking forward to this day. Even if I lose it eventually I still think I will be very high always up in the record books and that is very nice to see. And hopefully I can break the all-time record [Sampras&apos;s total of 286 weeks]. This is just the one in a row, you know.&quot; It is testimony both to the Swiss&apos;s ability and style that he somehow manages not to sound arrogant when discussing something which is at least another two years off and maybe longer. He is still only 25 and there other stats suggesting he is building irresistible momentum. Recently he also set a record for the most ranking points - 8,370 - held at any time by a player, he is the only man in the open era to win 10 or more titles in three consecutive seasons, and he has an astonishing 94.5% winning record from 264 matches. Perhaps it is safe to lift his eyes to the horizon occasionally. Federer was also savouring to his comfortable-looking first-round match with Kristian Pless today in the Dubai Open, in contrast with the difficult one Rafael Nadal, the title-holder here, has landed with Marcos Baghdatis, the world No17. &quot;Yeah, he probably has the toughest,&quot; agreed Federer. &quot;It&apos;s actually fun him [Nadal] drawing Baghdatis.

In the tie-break I missed one bad shot at 4-3, a forehand that hit the tape, and to be fair to him he came up with some big shots and big serves and deserved to win the match, but I definitely didn&apos;t play my best today.

Rahan Arshad, 36, fled to Thailand after the killings, using a plane ticket he had booked in advance, and was arrested at Heathrow when he returned voluntarily. The court heard that he told police there: &quot;I confess to murder.&quot; He then added: &quot;My beautiful kids ... I don&apos;t regret killing that fucking bitch. But my kids ... killing my kids.&quot; Mr Arshad denies murdering his sons Adam, 11, and Abbas, eight, and daughter, Henna, six, and his wife, Uzma Rahan, 32. The court was told that he made a statement that he was provoked into killing his wife when he found her with the bodies of the children at their home in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, in July 2006, and believed that she had murdered them. A distressed woman member of the jury at Manchester crown court wept as Paul Reid QC, prosecuting, gave details of the repeated blows suffered by the family. On the advice of the judge, Mr Reid moved on to a more general account of the injuries. Mr Arshad sat impassively in the dock as he listened to Mr Reid&apos;s account of the head wounds and of how the bodies were found by three police officers who broke into the house after a neighbour reported smelling decaying flesh and seeing a large number of bluebottles inside. The jury heard that not long before she died, Uzma had told her brother: &quot;Count the days until he [Arshad] kills me.&quot; Mr Reid said Uzma and the children were killed late on July 28 or early on July 29. On July 28, Mr Arshad told the same brother of the \u00a330,000 BMW he claimed to have bought as an early birthday present for his wife. He then added: &quot;Well just wait - there will be a much bigger surprise.&quot; Mr Reid said Mr Arshad and his wife, who were cousins, had an arranged marriage in 1992. Mr Arshad, described as &quot;jealous and possessive&quot;, later began to believe his wife, who liked western fashions, was having an affair. After a separation, they began living together again at the Cheadle Hulme house in May 2006. The jury heard that Mr Arshad booked his flight from Manchester to Bangkok on July 11, originally for travel on July 31. He later transferred the booking to a July 29 flight from Heathrow. In the days before the killings, he showered his wife with presents, including jewellery, a TV and the BMW, and told his family he had booked a holiday for them in Dubai. He said Mr Arshad bought the rounders bat on July 27 and on the following day took some or all of the family to Blackpool. &quot;Wristbands were issued to at least two of the children at Blackpool Pleasure Beach,&quot; said Mr Reid. &quot;The wrist bands were still being worn by Henna and Abbas when their bodies were discovered.&quot; The children were found in the lounge. Adam, wearing an England football shirt, and Abbas were both covered by sheets and Henna by a pink duvet cover: her head was resting on a cushion and covered by another. Uzma&apos;s body, covered by a towel, was on a bed upstairs. There were 23 lacerations to her head. The court heard that at about 7am, a motorway camera recorded the BMW heading south. The car was parked in the short-stay car park at Heathrow at 10am and Mr Arshad checked in for his flight 10 minutes later. When police examined the car, they found in the boot swimming costumes and buckets and spades presumed to have been taken to Blackpool.

For a while it looked as though Nadal might fall at the first hurdle, but the revival which enabled him to come up with a 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 win over Marcos Baghdatis provided proof that he has recovered from the injury to what he called &quot;my famous arse&quot; at the Australian Open. To spend that amount of time off the tour and immediately manage such a hard-fought win over such an in-form player was a special achievement. Nadal not only got the gluteus maximus in gear but his mind into the focus needed to fight back against a dangerous opponent. It kept alive the possibility of a repeat of last year&apos;s Nadal-Roger Federer final, in which Nadal surprisingly beat the record-breaking world No1 on a hard court, something Federer would very much like to avenge before the two hard-court Masters Series events in the US next month. Federer reckoned Nadal&apos;s first round would be &quot;fun&quot;. The Spaniard thought it would have been much more fun had it been in the quarter-finals - probably alluding to his likely encounter with Tomas Berdych, to whom he has lost all three of their hard- court meetings. But Nadal can take comfort from having played much more aggressively than he did in Australia and the fact this was, he thought, his best performance of the year so far. In the first set Baghdatis was full of velvet variations from behind the baseline; then when he got something shorter he would pounce with slashing angled drives which brooked no answer. Once Baghdatis had let Nadal in, however, with indifferent service games early in both the second and third sets, it all became so different. &quot;When you let an opponent like him into the match and he gets confident and he starts playing deeper and making you move more, mentally you say &apos;shit&apos;,&quot; said Baghdatis.

A knee problem and a bout of flu had kept the Wimbledon semi-finalist out of action since October but he took just over an hour to see off the world No78 in his first round-robin game. Henman, the seventh seed, was taken to deuce in his opening service game but eventually held and then broke the 25-year-old in the fourth game to lead 3-1. He broke again in the sixth to move into a commanding position and served out to take the first set. The British No2 looked ready to reassert his authority in the opening game of the second but after claiming three break points he squandered all of them to allow his doubles-specialist opponent to hold. The veteran again went to 0-40 on Mahut&apos;s serve in the fifth game, and this time he made no mistake to claim an all-important break. A further hold and break took the world No37 to 5-2 and he fended off two break points to claim victory with his first match point.

For a while it seemed the world No2 might fall at the first hurdle, but the revival which enabled him to come up with a 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 win over Baghdatis provided proof that Nadal has recovered from the injury to what he called &quot;my famous arse&quot; in the Australian Open. To spend that amount of time off the tour and immediately manage such a hard-fought win over such an in-form player was a special achievement. Nadal not only got the gluteus maximus in gear but his mind into the focus needed to fight back against a dangerous opponent. It kept alive the possibility of a repeat of last year&apos;s final against Roger Federer, in which Nadal surprisingly beat the record-breaking world No1 on a hard court, something Federer would very much like to avenge before the two hard-court Masters Series events in the US next month.

Despite being described just this week as Liverpool&apos;s best finisher by manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez, Fowler&apos;s future at Anfield is looking increasingly uncertain, with Andriy Voronin set to arrive in the summer and Ben\u00edtez still pursuing another striker. Fowler&apos;s Liverpool contract is currently set to expire at the end of the season, and Nicol would be only too keen to offer him a fresh start in the MLS. &quot;We&apos;d be interested in Robbie,&quot; said Nicol today. &quot;But at the moment the first thing is the financial side. We&apos;ve spoken, but as of yet nothing&apos;s been settled. He&apos;s really just dipping his foot in the water here. It&apos;s something he&apos;s thinking about. He&apos;s getting his ducks in a row. Whether he gets a contract at Liverpool or whether he moves on, he&apos;s dipping his foot in the water.&quot; Fowler&apos;s agent George Scott doubted the veracity of Nicol&apos;s claims, however, saying: &quot;I don&apos;t think [New England] could afford him anyway.

But with star player Clint Dempsey having moved to Fulham in January, Nicol knows there is a need to rebuild, and has money generated by the Dempsey deal available to invest in wages. Nicol - who fended off a $1m offer from Celtic for midfielder Shalrie Joseph this winter - is in a strong position to make an impact signing using the designated player slot, the mechanism which allowed the Galaxy to sign Beckham to a contract which could be worth up to $250m in salary and endorsements over five years. &quot;Through the sale of Clint we have some money available,&quot; he said. &quot;But the problem we have is that, because of the type of money David Beckham has got, a lot of people think everybody has that kind of money which is not the case. At the present time speaking to some people we&apos;re pretty much miles apart in terms of the financial side. We&apos;re certainly interested in getting somebody in, but we&apos;re not going to do anything stupid. &quot;We&apos;re not going to sling ridiculous amounts of money at just anybody.

In our predictably fruitless search to see if the Fiver had made it into Pseuds Corner in the current issue of Private Eye, we chanced across an article in which the satirical fortnightly magazine takes a swinging haymaker at the Federation Internationale de Football Association.

So it was little surprise that, after watching 21 men meekly sleepwalk for 90 minutes - Brad Friedel being the honourable exception - last week, the press pack concentrated instead on a mildly amusing post-match quip from Cesc F\u00e1bregas, who told Mark Hughes that an ex-Barcelona man should be ashamed of playing so negatively. And then everyone quickly moved on ... except, it seems, Mr Hughes of Blackburn, England. &quot;The young man came into our dressing room to apologise. He meant it with sincerity, so I accepted it readily,&quot; patronised Hughes ahead of tonight&apos;s replay. &quot;It was a confidential conversation,&quot; the Rovers boss added, before revealing that it was anything but. &quot;We discussed the situation, how it arose, and the feelings behind it, and I accepted what he had to say.

That means it&apos;s the kids again - so why they are 5-4 favourites against Blackeye, a team that&apos;s proud to be rock bottom of the Fair Play League is beyond us.

Your assertion that on 89 minutes two teams would &apos;merely collude with each other to quickly score one each&apos; (yesterday&apos;s Fiver) is impracticable. Game Theory (no pun intended) dictates that neither team would engage in this act because of the no-trust element. If team A was allowed to score first, would they honestly then let team B score?

How does he find himself, soon after, being dined by MI5 officers at a Nairobi hotel one moment, then imprisoned underground in the desert the next? The story of Shahajan Janjua, a British Asian, is a little window into the &quot;war on terror&quot;. As with the cases of the three young men from Tipton who ended up in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, MI5 officials in this case showed themselves apparently incapable of making a judgment of young British Asian men&apos;s likely links to terrorism. So, another has come back from an innocent overseas trip traumatised. Would it have happened if he had been white and middle-class? The backstory is to be found across Kenya&apos;s eastern border, in Somalia. That country&apos;s state weakness, acute poverty, and strategic position on the Red Sea made it a handy client for both sides in the cold war. In 1993, 18 US soldiers were killed there in an ill-advised UN mission. Subsequent years of warlordism and state collapse were ignored abroad. Then, last year, came six months of peace under the Union of Islamic Courts. The US responded recklessly, instigating - and aiding with spy satellites and a special operations unit - an Ethiopian attack that involved airpower and 15,000 troops. The Islamic government was brought down in days. Needless to say, it was all cast as a war against terrorism. On Christmas Day, Janjua was in Mogadishu for the wedding of a childhood friend to a Somali woman. He was the only guest from London. Janjua, a young man who had put a troubled inner-city past behind him, planned to leave the country on December 31, stopping over in Dubai to see friends before returning to London to celebrate his 22nd birthday in January. But he fainted at the wedding on Christmas Day, and was admitted to hospital with malaria. Mogadishu was under bombardment, and his passport was stolen. Within days he was taken from the hospital, still linked to his drip, and put in a van with cans of tuna, a gravely wounded Zimbabwean on a stretcher, another wounded Somali, and foreign fighters. It was a grim two-day trip to the southern port city of Kismayo, where the Islamic Courts were still in control and the streets seethed with men carrying AK-47s. When Janjua was offered the chance to head for the Kenyan border, he leapt at it, desperate as he was to find a British consulate. Still weak from malaria, he was put in one of two crowded vans along with the two wounded men. The border was closed and they split into three groups to walk. As an argument broke out about carrying the stretcher case, the Zimbabwean took a direct hit from Ethiopian troops. Janjua saw a Tunisian and Swede dead, too. Everyone ran. Janjua&apos;s group of 13 then began a two-week walk with no food and only muddy water to drink. After two days, during which time he heard them speak nothing but Arabic, he discovered that three were British. They were arrested by the Kenyan military after villagers turned them in. Janjua was smashed in the face with a rifle and his nose fractured. In police cells in Nairobi those in authority assaulted and interrogated him. Next he was taken to expensive hotels and quizzed by six different British MI5 officials. They showed him pictures of British men he mostly did not recognise, and asked him repeatedly: &quot;Who sent you? Who funded you? Who are your friends? Which mosque did you go to?&quot; His lucky break came when he persuaded a Kenyan policewoman to lend him her phone and alerted lawyers in London. Kenyan lawyers then tried to visit the prison, but were not allowed in. MI5 had ample time to confirm his account of his visit to Somalia, but on February 2, police in London were telling his family that he had been caught on the Kenyan/Somali border with guns. Janjua and three other British men were flown back to Somalia and held for three days in an underground desert cell. Then he was flown back to Kenya, and on to London, where he was questioned by police, but not charged. It should all be over, but he has nightmares and headaches, and is haunted by the men he left in Kenyan or Somali jails. He, and they, are yet more casualties in a mindless, misbegotten &quot;war on terror&quot; which the US and Britain cannot win militarily. \u00b7 Victoria Brittain is the co-author, with Moazzam Begg, of Enemy Combatant: A British Muslim&apos;s Journey to Guant\u00e1namo and Back.

The British No2 should not be too disheartened, however, by his return to competitive play: had he built on a promising opening, which saw him take the first set in a tie-break, he could readily have stepped up his comeback with a place in the last eight. As it was, the Spaniard&apos;s service game proved the 32-year-old&apos;s undoing. Henman may now consider a Masters Series event at Indian Wells next week before his eagerly awaited return to Davis Cup action over Easter weekend. Last night both men held serve in the first set, forcing a tie-break which Henman took at a canter by 7-1. The second set started in similar fashion to the first before Henman surrendered serve, paving the way for Lopez to go 4-1 up before taking the second set 6-3. Another tie-break beckoned in the third only for Henman to wilt, gifting Lopez a 5-4 lead and the opportunity to serve for the match. Lopez sealed victory in style with an ace. Thousands of miles away and several hours earlier, Rafael Nadal&apos;s defeat in Dubai was a far noisier affair. The Spanish world No2, who has not reached a final for eight months, launched into an attack on the Hawk-Eye system after losing both his quarter-final to Mikhail Youzhny and his title at the Dubai Open. The 20-year-old&apos;s 7-6, 6-3 defeat by the unseeded Russian was a repeat of the result in their quarter-final of the US Open in September. But the match hinged on the first set tie-break which Youzhny won 7-5 after successfully appealing an &quot;out&quot; call on his drive down the line. The original decision would have made the score 6-6, and Nadal threw a ball angrily and argued with the umpire. &quot;I said &apos;Look, the ball is out&apos;,&quot; he explained. &quot;And the umpire said &apos;I know&apos;. The mark [of the ball&apos;s bounce] was clearly still there and the challenge said it was in. It&apos;s unbelievable. I know it&apos;s good for the spectators, but we should have Hawk- Eye at the French Open on clay [where marks are clear] and then we will see what happens.&quot; Youzhny, who agreed he thought the ball was out, now has a great chance of reaching his second successive final - he won in Rotterdam last week - because he plays the unseeded Robin Soderling. Roger Federer also finished with a frown, despite scoring his 39th straight win as he reached the semi-finals 6-3, 6-7, 6-3 against 19-year-old Novak Djokovic. The result kept Federer on course to equal Guillermo Vilas&apos;s 30-year-old win-streak record - 46 successive victories - at Indian Wells, he let slip a lead of a set and 3-1, lost a tie-break for the first time in seven months and began to look uncomfortable in the final set. Later, when asked to compare Djokovic with his fellow 19-year-old, Andy Murray, Federer said: &quot;In my opinion Murray is doing more at the moment and improving quicker but Djokovic is on the move as well.

Now training in Ireland, Culloty, we hear, has high hopes for Madroos in the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle. Twice placed fourth in decent company since winning a Gowran maiden race by a wide margin, Madroos is considered nicely weighted with 10st7lb. General can take command A couple we should mention for the Pertemps Final following the publication of the weights this week, are Monolith, trained by Len Lungo, and Jim Old&apos;s Attorney General. The latter has a good record at Cheltenham and has come down the weights to an attractive mark. Of Nicky Henderson&apos;s many options in the handicaps at the Festival, All Star, in the Jewson Novice Chase, is particularly intriguing. Things have conspired against this gelding since he won on his chasing debut at Ascot, but we are strongly advised not to give up on him. Henderson, who will give his Arkle contender Jack The Giant a racecourse gallop tomorrow, will be looking for a big run from Copsale Lad. He will run in the Coral Cup if the ground is testing, otherwise he will return to fences. Irish Hussar (William Hill Trophy) and Tysou (Grand Annual) are also in good order. Procas de Thaix (4.55), on course for the Champion Bumper at Cheltenham, is expected to underline his claims at Newbury today. One to note is stable companion Theft, whose home work has been highly encouraging. La Dame Brune (1.35) can book her Cheltenham ticket with a third consecutive victory in the Newbury opener. The Brit Insurance Novice Hurdle at the Festival is the target for Henderson&apos;s mare, who stays well and relishes soft ground. Charlie Mann&apos;s seven intended entries for Newbury and Kempton today missed the deadline, but he can find consolation at Southwell via Alphabetical (2.35) and Haggle Twins (4.10). The promising Mobaasher, who had to sidestep Newbury yesterday after rapping himself in schooling, will not be out for long. Ante-post interest in the Lincoln Handicap has been minimal but we can put in a good word for Very Wise in the Flat turf season&apos;s traditional curtain-raiser four weeks today. The William Haggas-trained runner has been in good form on the all-weather. Gallops work at Newmarket remains low-key, but we are told to make a note of Gold Prospect, an unraced three-year-old trained by Michael Bell. Jeremy Noseda&apos;s Secret World is back in training and looking well, but Sixties Icon will not run in the Dubai World Cup. Seen and heard Owner Graham Wylie and trainer Howard Johnson recently went point-to-pointing in Ireland in search of young horses. They came away marvelling at an 11-year-old, the prolific Arctic Times, who notched up his 21st point-to-point victory last weekend. Owned by Trevor Hemmings, Arctic Times is pencilled in for the Fox Hunters&apos; Chase at Aintree but after this easy win, the veteran could prove a threat to Whyso Mayo in the Cheltenham equivalent at the Festival. Michael Dickinson, forever associated with his feat as trainer of the first five home in the 1983 Gold Cup, will be a welcome guest at Cheltenham in two weeks&apos; time. Due to arrive on Tuesday from his Maryland base, Dickinson, as well as attending a school reunion in the Lake District, will catch up with old friends at Catterick on Wednesday - where he may even be roped in to presenting winners&apos; prizes. Cheltenham&apos;s Festival information booklet, handed out to the media this week, had much to recommend it, but some of the content begs the question as to who on earth is the intended audience. Question one, for example, asks: &quot;Where is Cheltenham?&quot; while the answer to question two (how do I get there?) begins: &quot;The smartest way is to drop in by helicopter.&quot; As for &quot;Where can I recover?&quot; it seems there is now a Pamper Zone on-site, offering massage, reflexology and manicures. It was never like this in Arkle&apos;s day. Cheltenham&apos;s decision to resite the 14th fence on their New Course at the start of this season has had a dramatic result. Having been the obstacle which claimed most victims, its faller-rate has been reduced by 67% according to clerk of the course Simon Claisse.

Federer completed his straight-sets victory despite being broken in the first game. He broke back at 2-1 down and did so again to lead 5-3. The Russian fought back to 5-4, but lost his serve again and Federer did not look back. The Swiss dropped just three points in the first three games of the second set. Youzhny saved five match points at 5-2 down, but the result was a formality. It was Federer&apos;s fourth Dubai title in five years and his forty...#8209;first consecutive victory. But this tournament was overshadowed by a fiasco in Las Vegas, in an event run under the round-robin system. James Blake was first told he had not advanced to the last eight, then reinstated, then told that in fact Evgeny Korolev would take his place, after confusion surrounding the rules regards what happened in the event of a walkover. Federer said of the round-robin system: &apos;Everybody knows I was against it in the first place.

Kuznetsova&apos;s only win against Henin came in the semi-finals of the 2004 Qatar Open. &apos;Maybe I have a mental block when I play Justine,&apos; said Kuznetsova, who has lost 14 of their 15 clashes. Henin was broken in the sixth game but broke back immediately and then again two games later before taking the set after saving three break points on her own serve. An immediate break gave the Belgian a quick advantage in the second set and she never relinquished her grip. India&apos;s Sania Mirza will be unable to play for at least four weeks after it was confirmed that she tore a ligament in her right knee during her first...#8209;round match in Qatar.

Trainer Mouse Morris said: &apos;Unfortunately after exercise this morning he was found to have heat in his leg. Everything has hit me, as I lost my mother last night as well. I&apos;ve got to get my head around it all myself. I&apos;m devastated. The horse has heat in his leg, but was sound. He is not lame or anything. We had it scanned and he needs to rest.

Rugby union Stormers lead the way for South Africa It was a good Saturday for South Africa in the Super 14. All three of their touring provinces notched up wins. The Stormers managed to register an unexpectedly easy win over the lacklustre Hurricanes of Wellington. Despite having lost all of their games at home this season and in defiance of the axe over the coach&apos;s neck, they walloped their hosts 30-17 in Palmerston North, picking up a bonus point for scoring four tries. The Bulls from Pretoria have also had a poor time in their homeland, yet chose the first match of their tour of Australasia to burst into life. By half time they had built up a 19-0 over the Brumbies, which proved enough for a 19-7 win, the first by a South African side in Canberra since 1998. The Lions completed a hat-trick, although their 26-20 win over the Queensland Reds in Brisbane comes hot on the heels of victory in Perth last weekend. The Sharks, who were playing at home in Durban, rounded off the perfect day by beating the Crusaders from Christchurch with a touchline conversion at the death for a 27-26 win. Golf Wilson pulls in Wi Mark Wilson made a strong move in round three of the Honda Classic in Palm Beach, going three under par after 15 holes to draw level with the overnight leaders, Charlie Wi and Robert Allenby. They were both level par on the day, five under for the tournament, after 12 holes. Boo Weekley was three under after 16, to move to within one shot of the leaders. On Friday, Wi had recovered from a shaky start to shoot an level-par 70 and maintain a share of the second-round lead.

England v Scotland in front of a 60,000 all-ticket crowd, the opening game at the new Wembley Stadium, with footage on all the news bulletins throughout the day and night, and coverage shown all around the world. But the stadium is not ready, so instead it is England v Scotland at Adams Park, the 10,000-capacity home of Wycombe Wanderers FC. Talk about what might have been. The Wembley match should have provided the platform from which to launch the women&apos;s game to a mainstream audience. This is the most important year yet for English women&apos;s football: in September England travel to China to compete in the World Cup for only the second time, while next month Arsenal take on Sweden&apos;s Umea in the European Cup final, the first time an English team have made it to the pinnacle of the club game. These achievements may not convince the sceptics to watch or support the women&apos;s game. Even top performances in international competition rarely make a difference. The England women&apos;s cricket team won their version of the Ashes in 2005; barely a hundred people were there to see them do it and you still cannot watch their matches on TV. The England women&apos;s rugby union team made it to the World Cup final last year, but how many sports fans could name one member of that side? While their male counterparts lived it up in luxury training camps in Dubai, or boozing and battering each other with golf clubs in Portugal, England&apos;s top women players travelled 26 hours to take part in a four-nation tournament in Guangzhou, China. Over 10 days in January the team dealt with a gruelling training and playing schedule that left no time for sightseeing, lounging by the pool, or misbehaving. The annual China Cup was the perfect opportunity for England, ranked twelfth in the world, to test themselves against the international heavyweights of Germany and the United States - the top two teams in the rankings - and China, ranked eighth, ahead of the World Cup. Before the tournament, England were seen as the whipping girls; since 1993 their record against these three teams combined was abysmal: played 15, lost 15, goal difference minus 43. Dawn Scott, England&apos;s exercise scientist, said that as little as five years ago most of the team trained only twice a week and had high fat levels. Now individuals train up to eight times a week. &apos;Fitness levels were poor when I started,&apos; said the Arsenal defender Mary Phillip, one of the oldest members of the squad at 29 and stand-in captain for the injured Faye White. &apos;We&apos;d struggle with a three-mile run. Now we are competing with the rest of the world and people no longer use us as shooting practice.&apos; The game has come a long way in recent years. With playing numbers up from 11,000 in 1993 to 150,000 in 2006, England have a team sponsor in Nationwide and the FA are looking at ways to improve competition in the domestic league. But the FA began promoting women&apos;s football only in 2001 and their own national survey revealed that of one million girls who played recreational football last year, 52 per cent never had the opportunity to play in a team. Money is still in short supply and the FA Women&apos;s Football Committee fail the representation test with one woman to 11 men. Arriving late at night at the Guangdong Olympic Hotel, England&apos;s players are given an uncomfortable welcome - cold food and no heating in their rooms. The evening meal is deep-fried chicken wings with sweet and sour sauce - not the diet for a squad of international athletes. Breakfast the following morning is an intriguing assortment of broccoli, cold fried eggs, chicken porridge and last night&apos;s cold French fries. Striker Rachel Yankey&apos;s cold boiled egg is green. The players shiver in their England fleeces. &apos;I feel like I&apos;m on a different planet,&apos; says Eniola Aluko, the 20-year-old Charlton forward. The girls watch enviously as the American team snack on Pizza Hut deliveries. Hope Powell, the England coach, fumes as the queue for the two-slot toaster threatens to make the squad late for training. In her nine-year tenure as head coach, Powell has fought to overhaul the entire national-team structure and bring it to a professional level, although the game remains amateur in name and finance. Thanks to Powell&apos;s lobbying of the FA, funds were made available for a full-time psychologist, performance director and team of medical staff. The mood in the squad remains upbeat despite the food and the weather. But two of England&apos;s footballers are mothers and by the second day Arsenal&apos;s midfielder Katie Chapman, 24, is desperately missing her three-year-old son, Harvey. &apos;It was hard to leave; he&apos;d just started nursery,&apos; she says. &apos;I was in tears the night before we went, but wanting to do well for Harvey drives me forward. On the phone I told him I&apos;d gone to China. He said, &quot;You&apos;ve gone to get takeaway?&quot; He thinks it&apos;s taking them 10 days to cook it.&apos; Phillip has two boys, seven and 11. &apos;It&apos;s hard being away,&apos; she says. &apos;I&apos;m a single mum and I&apos;m constantly ringing home to check on them. The FA don&apos;t provide support for families. If I didn&apos;t have my mum and dad to help out I wouldn&apos;t be able to play international football. I just about make ends meet as it is.&apos; Phillip is angry about the limited financial support. &apos;You&apos;ve got to give us credit the way we handle our situation. I don&apos;t believe any male player would do it at this high level. Give those Premier League players our wages and send them out to a full-time job, as well as training and playing, getting the kids to school, doing the cooking, cleaning and shopping. They wouldn&apos;t manage.&apos; Phillip&apos;s thrill at competing in a World Cup is tempered by worries of how her family will cope in her absence. &apos;The FA don&apos;t support the men&apos;s teams with their families so they won&apos;t support us. The difference is they&apos;re on a hundred grand a week and we&apos;re on a couple of hundred quid. People assume we&apos;re loaded, but I live on a council estate. It would be four months&apos; wages for me to save up to bring the kids out.&apos; On the morning of the first game against China, the kitman, Tom Patterson, is preparing the dressing room. Patterson has done 1,300 games for the FA, from men&apos;s seniors to youth internationals. It takes him around two-and-a-half hours to set up the kit, snacks, tactics sheets and motivational quotations on the walls. There is just one hairdryer. &apos;Oh, they never use that,&apos; says Patterson, &apos;not like the men. England v Italy at Wembley, the Italians were complaining there weren&apos;t enough hairdryers. The men are more fashion-conscious than the women, who are just grateful for their kit. Only around half of them even have boot sponsors.&apos; Against China, England concede an early goal and fail to recover. The final score is 2-0. Powell wears a weary smile. &apos;We were naive, uneasy and nervous,&apos; she says. At dinner the players eat in silence and later that evening they call a private meeting with Misia Gervais, the team psychologist for the past two years. Gervais has worked with a top men&apos;s side and is still the only woman to have taught on the pro-licence coaching course. She is the first psychologist to work with any England team. &apos;Sven had a psych,&apos; she says, &apos;but that was for himself.&apos; Gervais is frustrated that sports psychology is still seen as mumbo jumbo. She speaks critically of the high-profile sports psychologists without proper qualifications. Following the defeat, Gervais asks the team to focus on loss. &apos;Every time you lose something you grieve. It&apos;s the same in football,&apos; she says. &apos;You go through stages of denial, anger, blame and depression before reaching acceptance. Different people progress through these stages at different rates and that can cause friction in the team. During the World Cup qualifying campaign we didn&apos;t lose a game for 18 months. Then we were beaten by Germany in a friendly and it was a shock we found difficult to overcome.&apos; Forty-eight hours later and the collective efforts of the staff and players pay off as England earn an impressive 1-1 draw with the US, with chances enough to have won. It is a rousing performance. An American journalist unused to the women&apos;s game is impressed. &apos;Wow, you&apos;ve really got some incredible players there. That Karen Carney, she&apos;s like Cristiano Ronaldo - stepovers and zipping up the wing.&apos; Anita Asante, 21, the England defender, thinks that having the Premiership to learn from is an advantage. &apos;The American girls may have the athletic edge, but we have the flair and natural technique. We have more varied types of players. America don&apos;t even use wingers. Hopefully, that will help us come September.&apos; With a positive result behind them, the mood lifts - even for the dreaded ice baths. Jill Scott, a leggy midfielder nicknamed &apos;Crouchey&apos;, echoes the screams up and down the corridor as the girls submerge themselves in ice for 10 minutes. The Everton goalkeeper, Rachel Brown, sits in the bath with a stopwatch, a novel and a mobile phone &apos;to phone my boyfriend and distract myself&apos;, she says, grimacing. Players gather in their rooms and relax. A birthday card for the Everton midfielder Fara Williams is passed round for signing, and draws damning comments on the FA&apos;s sexist attempts at birthday presents: a mirror compact and atomiser for the women, a watch for the men. They would rather have had the watch. Next door a game of cards is in full swing. Jody Handley, the Everton striker, is sent round to beg for spare 5p and 20p coins for the pot. The Leeds striker Sue Smith is already down 50p - a far cry from the thousands of pounds routinely gambled in the men&apos;s game. Aluko, Asante and the 18-year-old Arsenal striker Lianne Sanderson sit watching a replay of a men&apos;s game, Arsenal v Manchester United, on TV. Hot topics for debate include Arsene Wenger&apos;s passing game; who they would rather go out with, Ronaldo or Wayne Rooney; and whether either of them is gay. Aluko and Asante share a West African heritage. Asante&apos;s parents are Ghanaian while Aluko&apos;s Nigerian father is a successful politician in Abuja and her younger brother, Sone, 18, is breaking into the first team at Birmingham City. Aluko is taking a law degree. &apos;Sometimes it&apos;s hard for me to see my brother as a professional footballer,&apos; she says. &apos;He gets paid a very good wage, whereas I have to do a degree to invest in my future, to fill the gap where women&apos;s football is not professional. It&apos;s a balancing act the whole time. &apos;Sone and I encourage each other. He appreciates women&apos;s football and tries to promote it in his team. He sees at close quarters how much effort we put in. Attitudes have definitely changed. When I was younger I was better than the lads I played with, but I was embarrassed to say I played football. I used to say I played tennis instead. The next generation are the lucky ones. They have female role models like [England midfielder] Kelly Smith to look up to.&apos; In the build-up to the final game against Germany, word gets out that England are the team to watch and the locals flock to the stadium. England draw 0-0 with Germany, their best ever performance against the world number ones, and Smith wins player of the tournament. The girls are buoyant, even the evening meal becomes a source of entertainment. &apos;Bushtucker trials,&apos; yells Jill Scott, fishing out a duck&apos;s neck from a murky-looking broth. The women are looking forward to going home. This week England play three internationals in seven days: Russia at Milton Keynes, Scotland at Wycombe and Holland at Swindon. Most likely they will not get the coverage they crave. &apos;There are so many TV channels out there,&apos; says Phillip, &apos;surely one of them can show our sport?&apos; For September, the BBC will do its best to win the World Cup rights and plans to screen games on BBC2 as well as stream them live on the internet. But will viewers be impressed with the standard of football they see? Phillip&apos;s response is diplomatic. &apos;It&apos;s like with ISA savings,&apos; she says, &apos;you&apos;ve got to wait five years for a return. How many years did the men&apos;s game take to evolve? This is a young international team. Nothing happens overnight.&apos;", "tags": ["Women's football", "Football", "Sport", "England women's football team"], "title": "Anna Kessel joins the England women's football team", "sentences": ["While their male counterparts lived it up in luxury training camps in Dubai, or boozing and battering each other with golf clubs in Portugal, England&apos;s top women players travelled 26 hours to take part in a four-nation tournament in Guangzhou, China."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/04/womensfootball.sport", "publicationDate": "2007-03-04T01:34:32Z"}, {"article": "Oliver Wilson, a former Walker Cup player from Mansfield with a house in Augusta, Georgia and a taste for big, bling belts from Covent Garden, was one of several up-and-comers upstaging the established stars after the third round of the Johnnie Walker Classic at the Blue Canyon Country Club. Wilson, 26, sweated his way to a battling 70, two under par, for a total of 204, 12 under, one shot behind Richard Sterne, of South Africa, who made the game look easy with a second successive round of 64, the course record. His compatriot Anton Haig, about whose prospects the sponsors were suitably vague, was third, on 205 and Richard Lee, a New Zealander who has missed his last four cuts on the Asian Tour, was lying fourth, on 207. Retief Goosen, the world No 8, who won this tournament in 2002, was the leading notable, a disgruntled fifth after an erratic 72 that started brightly with three birdies in a row from the 2nd, then fell into rapid decline with three consecutive bogeys at the 5th, 6th and 7th. The two-time US Open champion managed three more birdies, but they were negated by three more bogeys, including one at the last. &apos;The tournament is pretty much gone for me,&apos; Goosen said, but he knew that wasn&apos;t necessarily so. In reality neither he, nor Colin Montgomerie, who finished hot, bothered and &apos;knackered&apos; after a 70 that left him six shots adrift of Sterne, nor Ernie Els, who was seven behind after a classy 67, was beyond redemption. Els, who has won this event twice, is loathe to recall the 1998 edition here at Blue Canyon, but he has never forgotten it. He lost to Tiger Woods in a play-off after leading the American by eight shots with a round to play. Sterne, a stocky 25-year-old from Pretoria, who packed up and brought his bags to the course on Friday after a first round of 75, has not put a shot wrong since with 16 birdies and no bogeys in 36 holes and his confidence is high after finishing first and second in his last two tournaments, in South Africa. &apos;I&apos;m quite excited,&apos; he said, &apos;because I&apos;m playing pretty well, but anything can happen and hopefully I just handle it well and take whatever comes.&apos; Sterne won the Madrid Open in 2004, but Wilson has yet to win on the European Tour, although he came close at the Volvo China Open just over a year ago, when he lost to Paul Casey in a play-off. &apos;I learned a lot from that,&apos; he said, &apos;and I&apos;ve improved and hopefully I can keep doing that.&apos; Wilson, who was at college in Augusta, has been inspired by the example of fellow English Walker Cuppers Casey and Luke Donald and by how well Ross Fisher, with whom he played a lot of junior golf, coped with playing with Woods in the recent Dubai Desert Classic. &apos;It was great to see Ross down the stretch, being in the hunt, playing with Tiger and competing and he didn&apos;t back away at all. To see that, somebody who you know quite well do that, it gives you confidence. &apos;It&apos;s great that the European Tour seems to have quite a lot of players up and coming. There&apos;s a lot that hopefully can keep pushing each other and competing against each other to sort of become the best.&apos; Wilson, who led Haig by a shot after 36 holes, started brightly with three birdies in the first six holes, but he was not striking the ball well and struggled with his concentration - and his grip on the club - on the back nine in the sapping heat and humidity.

Federer, who currently holds three of the four majors, regained his Dubai Open title with a commanding 6-4, 6-3 win over the Russian Mikhail Youzhny, and afterwards revealed the change in his training and preparation. &quot;Previously I always thought it was just tactical and technique,&quot; Federer said, &quot;but every match has become almost mental and physical - I try to push myself to move well. I try to push myself not to get upset and stay positive, and that&apos;s what my biggest improvement is over all those years. Under pressure I can see things very clear.&quot; Federer arrived in Dubai having just broken Jimmy Connors&apos; record of 160 consecutive weeks as No1 and he equalled Bjorn Borg&apos;s record of 41 consecutive wins on Saturday. His accumulation of records continues apace - his last defeat was against Andy Murray in Cincinnati in August - and he dismissed the suggestion that he might be nervous about the chance to overcome Vilas&apos;s mark. &quot;Not one bit,&quot; he retorted. &quot;Because I am not playing to beat that record - I am playing to win the tournament. Unfortunately we can&apos;t look 10 years ahead and say &apos;This is what I want to achieve in tennis&apos; - we are very short-sighted.&quot; After an indifferent start against Youzhny, during which he trailed 0-2, Federer was too good at everything - and he attempted everything. The backhand topspin cross-court drive, which may be one of the keys if he is to steal Rafael Nadal&apos;s French Open title in three months&apos; time, was working well. His volleys were significantly improved, too. &quot;It&apos;s always what I&apos;ve been dreaming about, playing in big tournaments like this and in front of crowds like this,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s how my motivation remains so high. And it&apos;s nice to get the feeling that I am on the right track.&quot; The volleying has gone up a notch with the help of Tony Roche, who has advised him on how to move better at the net, something Federer says he forgot over the years as the game became increasingly played from the baseline. Federer was as penetrating with his words during the post-match press conference as he had been with his shots. He predicted the abandonment of the experiment with the round-robin format, which had led to farcical scenes at another ATP tournament in Las Vegas last week. There was confusion over who should take someone&apos;s place when a player withdraws. &quot;Everyone knows that I was against it in the first place,&quot; Federer said. &quot;It&apos;s very disappointing that things like this have to happen before you realise that, actually, this system was not going to work.

As chief executive of the Financial Times, he had been hosting a celebration in New York to mark the 10th anniversary of his newspaper&apos;s US launch. &quot;It was fantastic,&quot; he says, talking excitedly of &quot;the fulsome tribute to the FT brand from Mayor Bloomberg&quot; and &quot;the wonderful guest list&quot;, before pointing to &quot;the happy coincidence&quot; of the American edition achieving a new circulation record of 157,000 copies a day. Ridding was also smiling for a slightly more personal reason. After spending seven hours on the plane at his computer he experienced one of those digital nightmares in which all his work vanished. Then, just before his plane landed, he found it all again. That incident could be a metaphor for Ridding&apos;s own career at the FT: he spent nearly 20 years as a journalist before becoming chief executive last May, rode out a difficult period in his early days as CEO when painful staff cuts were made, then had the intense pleasure of seeing a risky strategy succeed. Success indeed. Last week the FT reported a leap in profits for 2006 from \u00a32m to \u00a311m, with sales up 8% to \u00a3238m and advertising revenues rising 9%. So Ridding has a good story to tell, and he tells it with enthusiasm. In his sixth-floor office overlooking the Thames at Southwark Bridge, he talks animatedly about the paper&apos;s new-found sense of purpose under his leadership and the editorship of Lionel Barber, who was appointed in November 2005. He argues that the FT&apos;s strength is its ability to be both global and niche. In other words, it has a global presence and reports on global events, but it does so from the perspective of a niche audience - decision-makers in business and government. &quot;We are very targeted in terms of our audience to ensure that we can offer a very effective sale for advertisers&quot;, he says. &quot;We aim for a C-suite readership.&quot; For those, like me, who have yet to catch up on this piece of American jargon, &quot;C-suite&quot; refers to the high end of business chiefs: chief executives, chief operating officers, chief financial officers, chief technical officers, and so on. Ridding is, of course, a C-suite chap himself these days. Now 41, he has spent virtually all of his working life at the FT. He spent much of his journalistic career abroad, in Paris, Korea and Hong Kong, where he was bureau chief. This was in many ways a return to his roots; when he was seven his father&apos;s business relocated to Malaysia and the family lived in Kuala Lumpur, later moving on to Hong Kong and Singapore. Before his Hong Kong appointment Ridding had already shown his management skills as the FT&apos;s managing editor and deputy editor. If those stints had not sufficiently impressed Pearson, the paper&apos;s owner, then his work in setting up the FT in Asia in 2003 certainly did. When he arrived, in the immediate wake of the Sars epidemic, the future looked bleak. He recalls phoning Pearson&apos;s chief executive, Marjorie Scardino, from the empty lobby of the Conrad Hotel in Hong Kong to say: &quot;It&apos;s pretty tough out here. The economy has ground to a standstill.&quot; She told him she remained committed to the strategy. There was a core belief that the FT&apos;s audience was &quot;going global&quot; and this bit of the jigsaw was essential. Though its circulation, at 40,000, appears small, the FT&apos;s Asian edition has already secured the highest readership among international titles across the continent. Then there is the Chinese-language website, launched in 2004, which now has more than 800,000 registered users. Ridding led the development of the site, working closely with Ien Cheng, who is now overseeing the development of the FT site in London. Pearson had enough confidence in his abilities to appoint him as its chairman in Asia. But Ridding seems genuinely modest about his own achievements as he enthuses about the paper&apos;s change in fortunes. Just a couple of years ago commentators were pointing to the FT&apos;s ominous sales problems, particularly in Britain where circulation had slipped close to 100,000. Now it is touching 130,000. There was also a belief that the US operation was a mistake. &quot;We had to take heat on that,&quot; says Ridding. &quot;There were plenty who thought it was way too bold and risky. It hasn&apos;t always been easy but it has worked out well.&quot; So how has the FT pulled itself round? Throughout our conversation he returns to the same themes: staying close to a targeted audience, listening to their needs, stimulating their needs, and then &quot;selling&quot; that audience to advertisers. He says that &quot;the journalistic team are on fire&quot; - pointing to web innovations such as Alphaville, the blog that targets private equity and hedge fund players, and the &quot;view from the top&quot; video interviews - and emphasises the effectiveness of marketing initiatives, particularly the prioritising of subscriptions. But it is the creation of the global franchise that he sees as the key to understanding the paper&apos;s turnaround. It has been important to revenue too, with 74% of the paper&apos;s advertising carried in at least two editions and 50% carried in all four. The How To Spend It magazine, the FT&apos;s home for luxury goods advertisers, is also in rude health. Originally a Saturday supplement, it is now published occasionally on Fridays. But it would be misleading to see the paper&apos;s success through rose-tinted spectacles, even if it is printed on pink paper. Its rise has not been smooth; when the management announced last July that 51 jobs would have to go to accommodate the integration of print and online operations, the reaction from the journalists was unsurprisingly hostile. In announcing the move, Barber - at Ridding&apos;s request - said that if the cuts could not be achieved voluntarily there would be compulsory redundancies. That went down very badly indeed. Ridding chooses his words carefully to explain why the cuts were necessary. &quot;Our industry is clearly in a state of upheaval, and the ability to adapt is crucial,&quot; he says. &quot;The editorial management team had a clear vision of the integrated operation that we need to drive our digital ambitions and worked long and hard on how best to achieve it. That kind of reorganisation is clearly difficult, and painful. But it was handled sensitively and we were able to manage the restructuring entirely through voluntary means.&quot; And neither has every new editorial initiative been a success: FTpm, an afternoon freesheet launched in 2005, was quietly dropped last September, in favour of email alerts and other online developments. In spite of those difficulties, it is clear from FT staff I have spoken to that Ridding is well-liked. They appreciate that, as a former journalist, he understands their problems. There have been persistent rumours that Pearson would like to offload the FT. Until recently it seemed like a logical move - after all, the title was losing money. Analysts now claim (anonymously) that, despite the return to profitability, it does not fit with the rest of the company&apos;s educational publishing portfolio. Ridding brushes aside the speculation. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be here if I thought we were going to be sold,&quot; he says. He talks of &quot;substantial&quot; investment in digital innovations and refers to this being &quot;the year of ft.com&quot;. Then there are the other plans to &quot;unleash the brand&quot;, such as the FT&apos;s move into staging conferences. All of this will culminate in an ad campaign in April with the slogan, &quot;We live in financial times&quot;. Ridding is clearly comfortable with his transformation from reporter to chief executive. As he says: &quot;I&apos;m loving it.&quot; But he tells an anecdote which says a lot about his continuing love of journalism and about the FT&apos;s growing status in Asia. At a conference in Dubai he met a vice-chairman of China&apos;s National People&apos;s Congress, Cheng Siwei, who said he thought there was a bubble in the Shanghai market. When that remark appeared in the FT&apos;s Chinese edition the market immediately fell by 5%. Ridding says: &quot;On the one hand I thought, &apos;how fantastic, the power of journalism&apos;. On the other, I wondered how that was going to go down with the Chinese authorities. But we heard nothing back.&quot; It also suggests that the FT&apos;s growing presence in China gives a whole new meaning to C-suite.

But if the queues snaking down Marylebone High Road in London were not convincing enough, then the enduring appeal of the waxwork dummy was evident yesterday. The Tussauds Group was bought for more than \u00a31bn by Merlin Entertainment, the owner of Legoland, Sea Life and the London Dungeon. The merger of Merlin and the Tussauds Group, creates a business with 50 locations attracting 30 million visitors a year, making it the nearest rival in the world to Walt Disney. Tussauds also owns the London Eye, as well as the theme parks Alton Towers, Thorpe Park and Chessington World of Adventures. The combined business overtakes Universal Studios, which draws 24 million people a year to its movie-themed resorts. The 11 Disney parks remain the clear leader, pulling in 100 million visitors a year. &quot;We still have a little way to go yet,&quot; said Nick Varney, Merlin chief executive. Merlin aims to open five new attractions a year, and is moving in on Disney&apos;s backyard in the US. On one side is a huge American corporation, with Hollywood film studios, massive financial firepower, a television network and one of the richest libraries of characters in popular culture. On the other, waxworks and brightly coloured plastic bricks. There is already a Legoland in California, north of San Diego, with a second soon to open in Missouri. There are five Madame Tussauds overseas, in New York, Las Vegas, Shanghai, Amsterdam and Hong Kong, with new locations planned for Washington DC and Hollywood. Although Tussauds and Legoland are the flagship brands, the company sees potential in Sea Life (22 locations attract 4 million visitors) and in the London Dungeon (there are sister attractions in Edinburgh, York, Hamburg and Amsterdam). It hopes to build more hotels linked to its sites, taking a leaf from Disney&apos;s book. &quot;I don&apos;t see us as being in competition with Disney,&quot; Mr Varney said. &quot;We are not about $2bn theme parks on the scale of Disney in Orlando. We are pursuing a very different model with very different brands. Ultimately though, Legoland and Madame Tussauds can stand shoulder-to-shoulder alongside Disney and Universal.&quot; Peter Phillipson, Tussauds&apos; chief executive and chairman-to-be of the enlarged group, calls his waxworks &quot;portraits&quot;. The company has tried to capture the interest in celebrity culture with models of Kylie Minogue and David Beckham. &quot;Consumers love celebrity and famous people,&quot; he said. In 2002, Tussauds decided not to feature a dummy of Iain Duncan Smith, the first time the leader of the opposition had not been represented in Tussauds&apos; history. Customer research found that few had heard of him and even fewer wanted to see a wax likeness. Repeat visits The company has also introduced more temporary exhibits themed around events like the World Cup to encourage repeat visits and has introduced more interactive elements. The consolidation of the leisure industry across Europe has been driven by private equity firms, trading companies like playing cards in a high stakes game. They are looking to build bigger businesses that can be sold on or floated at a profit. Two years ago Tussauds Group was bought by Dubai International Capital, an investment arm of the government of Dubai, for \u00a3800m. It is selling the business for \u00a31bn and a 20% stake in the combined company, making itself a tidy profit. The American private equity firm Blackstone, which bought Merlin two years ago from another private equity owner, will retain control of the group. It expects to float the business on the stock exchange in three to four years time, Mr Varney said. Tussauds goes back to 1770, when Philippe Curtis opened a waxwork museum in Paris. After he died, Marie Tussaud, His housekeeper&apos;s daughter, inherited the collection and brought it to Britain in 1802. The museum has been in its current building in London since 1884. Lego opened its first park in 1968 in Denmark and its second in Windsor in 1996. The Danish toymaker sold its theme park business to Blackstone in 2005 and it was injected into Merlin, which is run from offices in Poole, Dorset. John Lord, an expert in the leisure industry at the University of Wales, saw a number of factors behind the growth in leisure attractions. &quot;We perhaps go out more as a family than we did in the past and we are more mobile. That means resorts can be developed on out-of-town sites without needing to worry about being close to town or to bus stops and train stations. Increased leisure time and wealth are also playing their part. These attractions are getting ever more expensive ... but that doesn&apos;t seem to put people off.&quot; Fun factories Tussauds group: 14m visitors a year \u00b7 London Eye: adult \u00a314.50/ child \u00a37.25 \u00b7 Madam Tussauds: \u00a323/\u00a319 \u00b7 Chessington World of Adventures: \u00a329/\u00a315 \u00b7 Alton Towers: \u00a332/\u00a322 \u00b7 Thorpe Park: \u00a322/\u00a315 \u00b7 Warwick Castle: \u00a315.95/\u00a39.95 \u00b7 Heide Park (Germany): \u00a318.40/\u00a315.70 Merlin: 16m visitors a year \u00b7 Legoland: \u00a331/\u00a324 \u00b7 Legoland Discovery Centre (opening Easter) \u00b7 Sea Life: \u00a312.75/\u00a39.75 \u00b7 London Dungeon: \u00a320/\u00a316 \u00b7 Gardaland (Italy&apos;s leading theme park): \u00a318.40/\u00a315.70 Walt Disney: 100m visitors a year \u00b7 Disneyland, California: adult 10+ \u00a332.75/age 3-9 \u00a327.55 \u00b7 Walt Disney World, Florida: \u00a334.85/\u00a329.10 \u00b7 Disneyland Paris: adult 11+ \u00a331/ age 3-10 \u00a325 \u00b7 Tokyo Disney \u00b7 Hong Kong Disneyland", "tags": ["Business", "Travel", "UK news"], "title": "\u00a31bn merger creates leisure empire built with wax and plastic bricks", "sentences": ["Two years ago Tussauds Group was bought by Dubai International Capital, an investment arm of the government of Dubai, for \u00a3800m."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/06/travel.travelnews", "publicationDate": "2007-03-06T00:14:52Z"}, {"article": "Arsenal&apos;s board could be heading for some difficult political explanations with the club&apos;s title sponsors, Emirates, if talks between ITV plc and the Qatar royal family come to fruition this week. It is understood the broadcaster, long known to be looking for a buyer for its 9.9% stake in the club, is in talks with three suitors. The sticking point for two of the purchasers is ITV&apos;s desire to achieve about \u00a38,000 a share - or \u00a350m - for the equity. Given that Sir Chips Keswick, a non-executive director at Arsenal, paid \u00a35,300 for each of the 20 shares he bought last week that price would seem aspirational. But the Qatari royals believe at \u00a350m the deal is good value. They are not interested in taking over the club but consider the market capitalisation of \u00a3326.65m to be massively undercooked. It is felt that, with the Highbury Square redevelopment expected to produce \u00a3100m in profit, Arsenal&apos;s attractiveness will soar. But the presence of Qatar&apos;s royal family, even as sleeping investors, is unlikely to make Emirates feel comfortable. The airline, which is owned by Dubai&apos;s ruling Al-Maktoum family, will spend more than \u00a3100m over 16 years in sponsoring a club that would be part owned by a regional rival. Qatar has set itself up as a competitor destination to Dubai for tourism and high finance, meaning there could soon be some interesting exchanges around the Emirates Stadium&apos;s executive boxes. Jowell fails to inspire Government officials refused to provide details for Tessa Jowell&apos;s defence of the government&apos;s progress in seeking \u00a3100m in private-sector funding for the London Olympics. The minister yesterday came under fire from the Liberal Democrat culture spokesman Don Foster and the Conservative party&apos;s Hugo Swire during parliamentary questions. Their attacks followed the National Audit Office&apos;s report last month that stated there is &quot;little prospect of securing significant private-sector funding&quot; for Olympic Park. Jowell responded that no money is needed until August 2008 and that anyway &quot;discussions are in train&quot;. However, her department&apos;s refusal to discuss which companies are in talks, for fear of &quot;prejudicing negotiations&quot;, hardly inspires confidence in her claims. Caborn&apos;s all-weather storm Richard Caborn yesterday blamed &quot;one or two nimbies&quot; for the under-use of all-weather sports facilities around the country. The sports minister called for MPs to conduct a nationwide lobbying campaign to ensure that the \u00a358m of National Lottery funding and \u00a350m investment from the Football Foundation in all-weather pitches is justified by extensive use of the facilities. Caborn wants planning restrictions associated with the use of floodlights that are in place at such sites to be lifted. Spur of the moment Tottenham will take the unusual step of dispatching officials to Braga ahead of the Uefa Cup round of 16 match against the Portuguese club on Thursday to distribute the 2,500 allocated match tickets in person after receiving them in the post only yesterday.

He is leaving behind roles in period films such as Becoming Jane and the forthcoming adaptation of Ian McKewan&apos;s novel Atonement, out in the autumn, to star in the action thriller Wanted. The film, which is a comic book adaptation and starts production next month, is being directed by Kazakh filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov, who directed the 2004 cult fantasy thriller Nightwatch. &quot;Apparently he first spotted me in the television version of Macbeth,&quot; said McAvoy. &quot;I play a young man called Wesley Gibson who was brought up in an orphanage and finds out that his life wasn&apos;t what he thought it was. His father, an assassin, is murdered and he is offered the opportunity to gain revenge.&quot; That offer comes courtesy of his father&apos;s former partner, Sloan, played in the film by Morgan Freeman, who gives Gibson the chance to undergo training to be an elite killer. The role will include a number of fight scenes, and McAvoy, who is already a skilled gymnast, acrobat and martial arts expert, is busy getting into training. For McAvoy, though, it was not just the chance show off his fighting skills that attracted him to the part but that it offered the chance to portray a different sort of action hero. &quot;The reason I wanted to play this character is because it adheres to what I believe in - that heroes shouldn&apos;t always be perfect.&quot; Philip Glass&apos;s birthday bash Composer Philip Glass is celebrating his 70th birthday by collaborating with his friends Patti Smith and Leonard Cohen as part of the Glassworks programme in London in October.

The first of the concerts will be an intimate gathering at the 18th-century church LSO St Luke&apos;s, where Smith and Glass will share their mutual love for the work of beat poet Allen Ginsberg. In the second, Glass will be playing a newly commissioned work based on the poetry of Leonard Cohen, The Book of Longing, which will be performed with an ensemble of singers and musicians.

Conveniently located on Martyrs&apos; Square - the scene of most of the demonstrations - it offered an occasional respite from the hubbub outside, and from the windows of its top-floor coffee bar you could also get a bird&apos;s eye view of events in the square. Some of the more image-conscious young protesters, sleeping out in Tent City just across the road, used to sneak in too and use its toilet facilities to wash, shave and gel their hair. That aside, the shop sells a vast range of Arab and western music, plus videos and DVDs, and also has an excellent book department with titles in English, French and Arabic. In 2002, shortly after the shop opened, it was raided by the S\u00fbret\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale - which in Lebanon is in charge of &quot;morality&quot; and censorship - and a number of items were seized on that grounds that they &quot;slandered religion and public decency and contravened the ban against Israel&quot;. Three unidentified music CDs were also confiscated because they allegedly &quot;encouraged young people to commit suicide&quot;. Since then, the Lebanese seem to have got used to having Virgin in their midst, though by the standards of the Middle East as a whole, a lot of what it sells would be considered risque or even shocking. Last year, for example, it gave a prominent display to my book, Unspeakable Love - with the result that it spent several months in their &quot;Mega Top 20&quot; sales chart. As far as I know, Beirut is the only place in the Middle East where that happened, and in Dubai sales were officially prohibited. I was rather intrigued, therefore, by a report in the Lebanese Daily Star yesterday that Virgin (which operates on a franchise system in the Middle East) has big expansion plans. It will be opening up in Jordan and Qatar in the next few months, in Syria towards the end of this year, then next year two stores will open in Saudi Arabia. This is in addition to recently established ventures in Egypt and the Emirates. It may not be earth-shattering news but I think it&apos;s significant and shows which way the wind is blowing. Never mind if the people behind the Virgin franchises are mainly in it for the money; it&apos;s a sign that the restrictions on what Arabs can read, view or listen to are gradually breaking down. It&apos;s a curious thought that if expansion continues at this rate, it won&apos;t be many years before there are 72 Virgins in the Middle East - but I&apos;ll let readers work out the implications of that. Although it&apos;s easy to sneer at music megastores for their commercialism, they are one of the forces chipping away at official repression, and we should give them some credit for that. In the long run, the idea that Arab countries can be shielded from international culture on the grounds of religion or &quot;traditional morality&quot; is unsustainable - though there may be a lot of resistance along the way. An example which highlights the authorities&apos; dilemma is the decision to establish a branch of the Louvre in Abu Dhabi. A branch of the Guggenheim is also due to open there in 2012. Abu Dhabi - one of the Gulf emirates - has loads of money and prides itself on being modern. As often happens with the nouveau riche, it&apos;s also desperate to acquire culture with a capital C - and that&apos;s where the problems start. It&apos;s great to have your own branch of the Louvre if you can afford it, but what exactly can you put on display? According to the report:  Yesterday&apos;s agreement sets the stage for the establishment of a universal museum dominated by classical western art covering &quot;all civilisations and all eras, including the contemporary era&quot;, while respecting the two sides&apos; &quot;cultural values&quot;. This last clause has led to questions about which works can be exhibited in a country in which all nude representations or crucifixion scenes would be deemed offensive. &quot;Thank goodness Monet painted waterlilies,&quot; quipped the left-leaning daily Liberation.  As yet the authorities in Abu Dhabi have no clear answer, except to say that &quot;art selection will be done by a committee including Abu Dhabi&apos;s rulers, who understand the sensitivities ... &quot;", "tags": ["World news", "Virgin Group", "Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Land of the 72 Virgins?", "sentences": ["As far as I know, Beirut is the only place in the Middle East where that happened, and in Dubai sales were officially prohibited."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/08/landofthe72virgins", "publicationDate": "2007-03-08T12:18:35Z"}, {"article": "A father-of-three accused of murdering his wife and family yesterday claimed he had returned home to find the battered bodies of his children then fled the country leaving his wife dead with no recollection of how she was killed, a court heard yesterday. Former taxi driver Rahan Arshad, 36, who denies murdering his sons Adam, 11, and Abbas, eight, daughter Henna, six, and his wife, Uzma Rahan, 32, described how he &quot;blanked out&quot; after making the discovery at the family home in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, on July 28 last year. He told Manchester crown court that he found his children dead in a downstairs room, then went upstairs to confront his wife, who said to him in Urdu: &quot;Are you satisfied?&quot; Mr Arshad said this was the last thing he could remember until he found himself in the bath holding a rounders bat, which has since been identified as the murder weapon. He said: &quot;I just blanked out.&quot; Mr Arshad then put the bat in the garden bin, covered the children&apos;s bodies with blankets, packed a bag and drove to Heathrow to board a pre-booked flight to Thailand. The bodies were discovered a month later. Mr Arshad&apos;s counsel, Ian Glen QC, asked him to explain why he had bought the single plane ticket two weeks previously. &quot;It would have been a holiday,&quot; he said. &quot;Uzma had been to Pakistan in February on her own and I needed a break as well.&quot; He said he did not tell his wife because he did not think she would let him go. Mr Arshad said that on the evening of the killings he had been arguing with his wife after he admitted that the family were not going on a holiday to Dubai the following week. Uzma was hoping he would buy her gold there, he said, and &quot;went crazy&quot; when he told her the truth. He had previously led her to believe that the trip was booked for the children&apos;s summer holiday, when in reality he had booked a single ticket to Bangkok, with the return leg booked for August 18. The Dubai trip was too expensive at \u00a37,100, Mr Arshad said. The court had heard earlier that Mr Arshad went to Bangkok with \u00a33,000 and the equivalent of \u00a31,160 in Thai currency. Mr Arshad said he did not return to Britain on August 18 as planned because he panicked. &quot;I didn&apos;t know what I was doing. I couldn&apos;t believe what was happening. I wanted to commit suicide actually,&quot; he said. When asked why he had told a Thai immigration official that he had phoned his wife after arriving in Bangkok, Mr Arshad said: &quot;I didn&apos;t know what to say. I was really scared.&quot; Mr Glen then asked what he had meant, when he reportedly told police: &quot;I confess to the murder ... but my kids, killing my kids.&quot; Mr Arshad said that he meant that he had killed Uzma, but that she had killed the children. He then denied murdering his daughter and two sons. Before Mr Arshad gave evidence, Mr Glen took the unusual step of directly addressing the jury. &quot;The question is, which one of them killed the children?&quot; he said. &quot;If the defendant returned home to find his wife had killed his three children, you can&apos;t imagine a better case for provocation for killing her. It is an unusual case, it is a shocking case.&quot; &quot;You may debate the possibilities. What mother, no mother could possibly kill her children? Leaving the slightly greater possibility of the father. It is no more likely that a father would do it than a mother would do it.&quot; &quot;We would say this- we have a father, or a mother, who was mentally ill. Only one of these two was mentally ill unfortunately, and that was Uzma, and that tends towards concluding she did it.&quot; The case continues.", "tags": ["UK news", "Crime"], "title": "Man accused of murdering family claims wife killed their children", "sentences": ["Mr Arshad said that on the evening of the killings he had been arguing with his wife after he admitted that the family were not going on a holiday to Dubai the following week.", "The Dubai trip was too expensive at \u00a37,100, Mr Arshad said."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/mar/08/ukcrime.uknews4", "publicationDate": "2007-03-08T23:49:13Z"}, {"article": "An Identikit image of the ideal football manager would surely bear more than a passing resemblance to Stuart Pearce. Passionate, honest, often humorous, enviable international playing pedigree and every available coaching qualification, the former England left-back ticks all the right boxes. But, to the great dismay of his many advocates, he is nevertheless floundering at Manchester City. City&apos;s board discussed Pearce&apos;s future on Monday after the four successive Premiership defeats that have placed the club in peril of relegation. Although John Wardle and his co-directors eventually offered their manager the benefit of the doubt, Pearce is particularly vulnerable as his contract states he will not receive a pay-off if dismissed. Two years after succeeding Kevin Keegan, his job is in jeopardy and it is understood that FA Cup defeat at Blackburn on Sunday could prompt a change of boardroom heart. Yet if Wardle and company lose patience it would not merely spell bad news for Pearce. Something of a poster boy within the Football Association and League Managers&apos; Association he has been hyped as a role model for aspiring young English managers and both organisations have invested much faith in fast-tracking him. Much to City&apos;s consternation, the FA has appointed Pearce part-time England Under-21 coach and he will lead that team during this summer&apos;s European Championship finals. Some influential figures at Soho Square see him as a viable successor to Steve McClaren and he is also one of a handful of Englishmen to have gained the LMA-sponsored diploma in football management from Warwick University, where, coincidentally, he studied alongside Blackburn&apos;s Mark Hughes. The game&apos;s blue riband qualification, the diploma was devised with the intention of grooming a new, more cerebral, breed of British manager, finally capable of competing with Europe&apos;s finest. Certainly it would be no exaggeration to say that, should Pearce fail at City, the cause of English coaches - routinely shunned by top clubs - could be set back further. Ironically, Pearce looked abroad recently for the solution to City&apos;s ills, taking his squad for a &quot;bonding&quot; break to Dubai only to find his players losing at home to Wigan on Saturday in such alarmingly laissez-faire mode that they might as well have still been on Jumeriah beach. Peter Beardsley, his former England team-mate, believes City&apos;s disgruntled fans should see the bigger picture. &quot;His players haven&apos;t been performing and his strikers haven&apos;t been scoring anything like enough goals, but I&apos;m still convinced Stuart has all the qualities to be a great manager,&quot; said Beardsley yesterday. &quot;There&apos;s been a few difficulties over contracts with players like Joey Barton and Sylvain Distin, but that&apos;s not his fault. City definitely won&apos;t regret sticking with Stuart.&quot; Pearce&apos;s critics claim while his &quot;professionalism&quot; is beyond reproach he combines a lack of tactical nous with an intense approach to man-management which does not always play well with modern players who require more sophisticated handling. Beardsley demurs: &quot;A lot of people don&apos;t realise Stuart&apos;s very funny and he&apos;s absolutely brilliant at bringing young players through. City have an excellent academy. The future looks bright.&quot; Pearce&apos;s plight is complicated by take-over talks involving a mysterious American consortium, members of which were taken around the club&apos;s training complex by the manager this week. While Wardle fears relegation would kill any deal, Pearce mainly cites a lack of funds for the plunge. He has spent \u00a311m since succeeding Keegan - \u00a36m on the underachieving striker Georgios Samaras - but has been allowed to reinvest only around half the \u00a321m from Shaun Wright-Phillips&apos; sale. &quot;If I had \u00a370m of talent and it wasn&apos;t happening I might say &apos;hang on a minute, son, you haven&apos;t done it&apos;, but that&apos;s not been the case,&quot; said Pearce.

Jonjo O&apos;Neill&apos;s six-year-old is on the upgrade and it was significant that Tony McCoy was prepared to get down to his 10st5lb minimum to take the ride - a 4lb rise in the weights means the champion jockey doesn&apos;t have to sweat unduly for this one, although he will have to do 10st5lb in any case, having been booked to ride Gaspara in the Imperial Cup. Mann may be in form with weekend double Merchants Friend (2.35) is a bit of a character, but a spell in the hunting field has put Charlie Mann&apos;s veteran in good shape and he faces only four rivals in today&apos;s staying handicap chase. At Market Rasen tomorrow, look out for his stable companion Haggle Twins (3.50), who is back over a more suitable trip after failing to stay 3m last week. The most significant aspect of the valuable mares&apos; bumper at Sandown today could be the absence of One Gulp. Connections have passed up the chance of the four-year-old competing against her own sex in order to go for the Champion Bumper at Cheltenham on Wednesday. Paul Webber&apos;s filly was hugely impressive at Haydock last time and it will be interesting to see how Castlecrossings, the runner-up that day, fares in today&apos;s Sandown race. On the subject of bumper horses, do not miss the Nicky Richards-trained Jorveybrook when he makes his debut. This Alderbrook gelding has created a striking impression, both at home and in racecourse gallops. Gaspara (3.10) looks good at the weights in today&apos;s Imperial Cup for David Pipe, who expects to send a strong team to Cheltenham for his first Festival as trainer at Pond House. We understand stable insiders reckon the two outstanding prospects for the meeting are Buena Vista, in the Arkle Chase, and Pablo Du Charmil. The former was particularly slick when schooled earlier this week. Pablo Du Charmil is also in the Arkle, but his target is Friday&apos;s Grand Annual. The setback to Macs Joy is a bitter blow for the Jessica Harrington stable, but they may yet make their presence felt at Cheltenham. Callow Lake, who has been chasing recently, is expected to switch codes to contest Friday&apos;s County Hurdle. He is considered to be on a good mark and confidence in his chance will increase if the ground dries out. Kasbah Bliss is quietly fancied to add to Baracouda&apos;s two Stayers&apos; Hurdle wins for trainer Francois Doumen. The gelding shaped well under a big weight behind Taranis at Sandown and is ready to peak in Thursday&apos;s race, now run as the Ladbrokes World Hurdle. The Nicky Henderson team remain confident that Amaretto Rose will deliver the goods in the Supreme Novices&apos; Hurdle. The mare did her best work yet at Lambourn last Tuesday. Best Actor (2.40) may not figure in Cheltenham plans for Carl Llewellyn, but the eight-year-old deserves another chance at Warwick tomorrow when he will be suited by the return to a left-hand course. On the same card, Mountain Approach (4.10), trained by Jean-Rene Auvray, is worth an interest. She won well at Newbury and there should be better to come now that she has had a wind operation. At Wolverhampton today, we have good marks for Elyaadi (1.50) and Chicken Soup (2.20). Seen and heard If Kauto Star is going to win next week&apos;s Cheltenham Gold Cup, don&apos;t expect to see him hit the front until jumping the last fence. Jockey Ruby Walsh intends to wait as long as possible on the 6-4 favourite, as he feels Kauto Star&apos;s concentration goes walkabout when he is in front for too long - hence the hair-raising blunders. A major blunder was made by the Metro newspaper yesterday, when a story about Khalid Mohammed (accused of involvement in the September 11 2001 attack on America) was illustrated with a mugshot of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai and Vice-President of the United Arab Emirates. His Highness&apos;s reaction is not known but a grovelling apology for this mistaken identity is surely on the cards.Ruby Walsh is warm favourite to be top jockey at the Festival. But what about Mick Fitzgerald at 14-1? He has a strong book of rides for Nicky Henderson, whose William Hill Trophy runner, Juveigneur, was put up by Fitzgerald as his charity bet at a recent Cheltenham preview night. A good Festival for Fitz, and plans for retiring will be put on hold. Sir Michael Stoute&apos;s association with Cheltenham was forged by the victory of Kribensis in the 1990 Champion Hurdle. The grey is still active at Stoute&apos;s Newmarket yard, but the trainer&apos;s hack these days is another jumping stalwart of yesteryear, Spendid, who ran at three Festival meetings and finished third in the 2003 Scottish Grand National. A crack at jump racing could beckon for Daniel Robinson, son of top Flat jockey Philip. Increasing weight has forced Daniel, 17, to give up any thoughts of following in his father&apos;s footsteps, but he is keen to pursue a riding career. Philip, meanwhile, is on the mend after undergoing major hip surgery around Christmas time and hopes to resume riding out shortly at Newmarket. Ascot, where the builders are back in working on the \u00a310m refit to sort out the chronic viewing problems at the track, need to spend money in another area according to Timeform&apos;s respected annual, Racehorses of 2006.

I&apos;ve never lost my love for cricket and I stuck with football for the best part of 30 years. I played in the local leagues, coached the kids I was teaching by day and watched Portsmouth&apos;s home matches every fortnight. By the time they finally won promotion to the top division in 1987 I was increasingly disenchanted with self-interested directors, misbehaving, overpaid players, violent and abusive fans and all the hype. On the day Pompey celebrated that promotion, their fans ripped down the fences and invaded the pitch, halting what should have been a joyous occasion. That was it for me. I gave back my season ticket, went very occasionally for a few years and finally gave up altogether. Pompey now have their best team since the year of my birth when they were champions, but they can never be champions or FA Cup winners again and neither can anyone else outside the top four. It is a matter of supreme indifference to me which of that lot wins anything. My message: regardless of how long you&apos;ve cared passionately for football, you can escape and it&apos;s a great relief and a lot of fun when you finally figure that you are free. Every time you pay to watch them you condone their behaviour. Don&apos;t do it. Dr Dave Allen, University of Portsmouth Stay home, James I&apos;m sure I am not the first to point out the irony of David James discussing his rapeseed oil engine (last week) in the same piece as a training trip to Dubai. What is wrong with Eastleigh in March, anyway? Or you could improvise on the car park behind Fratton Park. It was very gratifying to hear the players discussing giving fans their money back. If you could have a word in anyone&apos;s ear about reducing season-ticket prices next season, that would be lovely, too. Finally, I was surprised the Blackburn fans gave James grief about his shorts. I&apos;ve been checking very carefully and could see nothing wrong with them. Ever so slightly see-through under the floodlights, I noted, but nothing wrong at all. Claire Perry, Southsea, Hampshire Standing up for sitting Older fans like me and those suffering physical incapacity are giving up going to away matches because they cannot sit and watch the game as so many away fans are standing up. Why should they pay a large amount of money, only to have their day ruined because the law of the land is not enforced. At the Watford v Charlton game last week I was sat behind two tall, fat fans who refused to sit down as the game kicked off. I remonstrated with them and got a load of abuse back. But they had a point because the person in front of them had similarly remained standing for many minutes after the game kicked off. But that person had no excuse for standing as he had 10 or so clear rows of seated people in front of him. I asked him to sit down, but he refused. The authorities should either enforce the ban on standing or bring back standing so that those who want to stand can and those who want to sit can without having their experience ruined. Richard Redden, West Wickham, Kent Cap ticket prices The issue of ticket prices is currently being highlighted in relation to the Premiership, but it extends throughout the Football League. I am a season-ticket holder of many years at Huddersfield and the current price is \u00a3320 to watch poor, bordering on terrible, third-division &apos;football&apos;. If I was not a season-ticket holder, the walk-up price could be as much as \u00a321. Huddersfield are by no means the most expensive club in the division and the average price is around \u00a319. There should be a price cap throughout the divisions: \u00a325 in the Premiership, \u00a320 Championship, \u00a315 Leagues One and Two. Last week I paid \u00a322.50 to watch us get beaten 5-1 by an average Nottingham Forest side. The players looked bored and half the team couldn&apos;t be bothered to acknowledge the travelling support (around 2,000). The manager could only talk about disappointed he was. I wonder why I bother, but I&apos;ll still be there next week and next season. And the one after that. As long as clubs have mugs such as myself, they will be able to charge as much as they like. Andrew Kendall, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire Don&apos;t know nuffin Paul Wilson&apos;s look at the issue of what constitutes cheating (last week) explored just one part of a wider problem. Far too many people with views on the laws of the game don&apos;t, in truth, know them. Ex-players are treated as experts but didn&apos;t know the laws when they were playing and have failed to learn the changes made since. Lille&apos;s recent reaction to a quick free-kick - something covered in Fifa&apos;s extensive guidance to referees on their website - shows it&apos;s not just a problem here. Too often the ignorant views put forth by the professionals are treated as gospel by fans, who should instead try reading the rules themselves.

Even a bookshop might be a good idea. But this week Dubai - best known for its golf courses, its opulent hotels and its lack of taxes - acquired an art fair, which, a little presumptuously, is intended to establish this sand-blown outpost as &apos;the most important centre in Asia, likely to rival London and New York within a decade&apos;. Dubai&apos;s neighbour, Abu Dhabi, has more oil, which it is shrewdly trading for culture. An island off the coast is to house a tumbling pile of boxes that will be Frank Gehry&apos;s latest Guggenheim, a pinioned performance centre by Zaha Hadid, a mollusc-shaped Maritime Museum by Tadao Ando, and a hovering disc by Jean Nouvel filled with loans from the Louvre. President Chirac charged Abu Dhabi $1 billion for access to the Louvre brand; the United Arab Emirates further ingratiated by spending $10bn on French armaments. French critics complain that the nation&apos;s heritage is being bartered for petrodollars. What antiquated idealism! We used to think that art enshrined values that were universal. Now all we ask is that it should be global, as instantly convertible as all other currencies. The Dubai International Financial Centre, which sponsors John Martin&apos;s fair, ignores the French aspersions about sleazy deals and kick-backs. Last Tuesday evening the governor of the centre, his excellency Dr Omar Bin Sulaiman, emerged from his headquarters to offer a casually aloof greeting to a group of free, dishevelled spirits whose work is a prolongation of childhood play. The building that houses the centre resembles Marble Arch after a course of weight training. Around it, the invited artists had planted a garden of unfunctional whimsies: floor lights that supposedly represented &apos;multiverse perceptions&apos;, a mirrored kaleidoscope containing a tunnel of private reminiscence, a clump of ceramic columns like blue decapitated palms. &apos;I don&apos;t understand what you do,&apos; drawled his excellency as his draperies flapped in the wind, &apos;but welcome anyway.&apos; At that, a long chorus line of grizzled men dressed in towels and sheets filed from an office lobby, shuffled into a semi-circle, and began a tribal chant, rhythmically jabbing the air with canes that should have been used to discipline their camels (which had been stabled, I assume, by the platoon of valet parkers who were on duty). The mesmeric chant went on for 10 minutes. The performers had their hands round each other&apos;s waists to form a phalanx, and I saw that one, though pretending to be a Bedouin who had ridden in from the desert, sported cufflinks encrusted with diamonds. The next day Bin Sulaiman drove his own sports car to a beach hotel to open the fair. John Martin ushered him in, recommending the wares in terms that a specialist in asset management, capital markets and financial flows between East and West could understand. &apos;There&apos;s a hundred million dollars worth of art in there,&apos; said Martin, &apos;and it&apos;s all for sale.&apos; The defining exhibit was Andy Warhol&apos;s silk-screened dollar sign, its curves bouncing with rapacious energy, its pigment oozing like ketchup or blood. Striding through a booth occupied by a local gallery, his excellency ignored the works that scratch at the East&apos;s resentment of the invading West: a redesigned American flag with Arab calligraphy in place of the stars and stripes, a plastic Snoopy accessorised with a machine gun. He paused beside a slab of gold with &apos;NATION OF ISLAM&apos; embossed on it, perhaps unaware that it was a work of art. &apos;How much is that?&apos; he asked, and was answered by the gallery owner&apos;s polite, fearful titters. As he swept off with an entourage that resembled a laundry load of linen drying in a stiff breeze, I noticed that one of his hands clutched a set of prayer beads. It was sunset, the hour of the muezzin, and while his eyes wandered over trophies he did not covet, his fingers - dispensed from their usual work of calculation - were busy praying. It was lucky that Bin Sulaiman kept up such a brisk pace. He perhaps did not notice Gavin Turk&apos;s bronzed bin bags, which joke about art as surplus or wastage, expensive trash, and he probably also didn&apos;t see Ed Burtynsky&apos;s photograph of a Chinese graveyard for rusting ships, or Wang Qingsong&apos;s photographic triptych of Chinese villagers rapturously welcoming McDonald&apos;s, which in its middle panel studies the plastic refuse that festers beneath the golden arches. Artists are refugees from the regime of getting and spending, more likely to bemoan its miseries than to celebrate the joys of consumerism. John Martin preaches a creed he calls &apos;art commerce&apos;. I hadn&apos;t heard the two words coupled before; to me, they still sound oxymoronic. At the opening, Martin declared: &apos;The art world, like finance, is moving east.&apos; In the 17th century, what Bishop Berkeley called &apos;the course of empire&apos; seemed to be set inevitably westwards, as civilisation crossed Europe towards America. Now our depleted world has drifted to the margins; the Emirates value their closeness to Asiatic metropolises like Moscow, Mumbai and Beijing. Commerce has greedily gravitated here. At a forum organised by the fair, Bob Monk of the Gagosian Gallery in New York enthusiastically assessed the Middle East&apos;s contribution to &apos;global art production&apos;. Camilla Canelas, a curator from Barcelona, chided museums that mistakenly invested in Latin American painters for &apos;betting on a different horse&apos; with supposedly &apos;higher odds&apos;. The Lebanese &apos;art expert&apos; Saleh Barakat rallied artists to act as &apos;creative entrepreneurs&apos;, and recommended that Arab societies should &apos;hedge on art&apos;. His metaphor was not horticultural: in an auditorium next to the fair, hundreds of besuited stiffs had gathered for a conference on hedge funds. Art, however, resists this crass valuation of its benefit to the global economy. In a tent on the beach, with choppers buzzing overhead to deposit celebrities on the helipad that juts from the spinnaker of the Burj Al Arab hotel, I heard grumblings from artists who resented their enslavement to the market and rebuffed the new breed of stock-trading curators. Jan Fabre explained why he stopped making saleable objects in favour of ephemeral performances. &apos;You do a theatrical piece and after two hours it has no economic value at all,&apos; said Fabre. &apos;I find that beautiful.&apos; Kader Attia, an Algerian brought up in Paris, described his installation in St Germain des Pres, where he set up a shop called Hallal, crammed with Muslim fashion redesigned for the suburban proletariat: tacky sneakers, slicky synthetic T-shirts. Whenever customers took an item to the cashier, they were told &apos;Oh no, it&apos;s not for sale. It&apos;s art!&apos; Then a mogul, immune to irony, offered Attia a fortune to license the Hallal clothing line for distribution in the Arab world. Attia refused, thus defining the difference between an artist and a &apos;galleriste&apos;. Attia showed a recent video documenting the fate of some sugar cubes that melted and fell apart when sprayed with black oil. His audience included a gaggle of Dubai matrons swathed in burkas, with jewels glinting in their head-dresses and flowers of henna traced on their hands. &apos;What is your concept?&apos; asked one of them from behind her veil. Attia played the short video again, and the sludge once more soiled and corroded the clumps of crystalline sweetness. The woman still did not get the point, or perhaps was reluctant to admit that the alliance between art and petrol might be contradictory. Attia explained it for her benefit. &apos;The white cube,&apos; he said, &apos;is maybe drinking too much oil.&apos; Artists, like holy fools, specialise in dangerous jests: at the fair, the most conspicuous position had been commandeered by the London gallery that calls itself White Cube. British artist Sarah Strang devised her own wry joke about art commerce in &apos;Marketplace&apos;, commissioned by the fair. Signs in Arabic and English explained the protocols of art auctions, and defined the meaning of &apos;hammer price&apos;. (Christie&apos;s held their first sale in Dubai recently, disposing of most lots to Indian bidders. &apos;The Emiratis,&apos; an insider told me, &apos;are loaded, but my God they&apos;re clueless!&apos;) Strang&apos;s placards - though this is not their intention - serve an instructive purpose. Beneath them, craftsmen conscripted from the souk chisel, file and hammer strips of 18-carat gold into postcards that boast &apos;MADE IN DUBAI&apos;. Is aesthetic value a matter of carats? Aren&apos;t the merchants who sell art the enemies of those who create it? In the hand of a craftsman, the hammer is a delicate aesthetic implement. Gripped by an auctioneer impatient to secure his profit, it&apos;s a bludgeon. The fair was held in a hotel that a resembles a fortified sandcastle. On the terrace below we all ate smoked salmon, pasta, Peking duck and other non-indigenous treats, while drinking wine, which Emiratis regard as a heathen abomination. Tirdad Zolghadr, a curator from Zurich who spoke at the forum, explained this culinary Esperanto by remarking that art must nowadays be &apos;multi-ethnic, widening the choice of flavours on the smorgasbord&apos;. But the medium of continuity and communication in our global world is money. Culture, like food, relies on a rooted idiosyncrasy, and dies when reduced to gabbling in pidgin. Dubai is re-inventing itself in steel and glass, and the nodding cranes work all night long to conjure elastic skyscrapers out of the monotonous desert. Nature and locality have been eliminated by engineering: a diagonal slab on the skyline, pitched at a sick angle, contains a piste where you can ski all year on manmade snow. Home-grown art, unlike that freighted in from the West by curators and auctioneers, struggles to find a footing in the sand. On an industrial estate, between a cement works and a warehouse stocking fuel-injection parts, I groped through a sandstorm towards a shed marked &apos;Progressive Art Gallery&apos;, inside which the Palestinian painter Jeffar Khaldi displayed canvases streaked with gore. Can art really guarantee progress? Down the road, a Ferrari and Maserati showroom seemed to be doing better business than the gallery. Further off, on a building site surrounded by piers of reinforced concrete, a banner proclaimed &apos;The Most Prestigious Square Kilometer on the Planet&apos;. This is where Burj Dubai, which will be the tallest building in the world, twists upwards like a corkscrew puncturing heaven. &apos;Live the Life,&apos; shrieked another billboard, on which happy expats advertised an existence that consists of consuming. &apos;History Rising&apos; yelled a third sign: history here means the future not the past. But behind the mirrored facades of the new Dubai, which vaporise in the humid haze like the mirages they are, something has been lost, or at least sold for a price that may be in the billions but is still too low. Anxious to see remnants of the fishing village that existed here until the British occupation ended in 1971, I asked the concierge in my hotel how to get to the river. Despite his Frenchified function, he had a grave Arab dignity, and he corrected me. &apos;We do not have a river in Dubai, sir,&apos; he said. &apos;What we have is the Creek.&apos; His smile proudly, sadly, remembered a time when Dubai was a backwater. Setting off for the Creek, I expected a dribble. What I found was a thoroughfare of emerald water down which gnarled, weathered, wooden dhows - barges like the one Cleopatra sat in - hauled bales of rugs or crates of fruit whose squatting owners sipped tea while they haggled over prices. At last I felt some reality, some connection to place and to the past. Shouldn&apos;t commerce concern itself with necessities, not luxuries like Gavin Turk&apos;s expensive bin bags or Warhol&apos;s inflated dollar? The dhows, which perfectly integrate form and function and beautifully stripe the water with bands of blue as their painted bellies lunge below the surface, were the finest works of art I saw all week.", "tags": ["Art", "Culture", "Art and design", "Dubai", "United Arab Emirates"], "title": "Peter Conrad: When oil and paint mix...", "sentences": ["&apos;What Dubai needs,&apos; he declared to his fellow sunbathers, &apos;is an international art fair.&apos; I&apos;d say there were other things Dubai needed first: roads perhaps, or traffic regulations for its marauding jeeps.", "But this week Dubai - best known for its golf courses, its opulent hotels and its lack of taxes - acquired an art fair, which, a little presumptuously, is intended to establish this sand-blown outpost as &apos;the most important centre in Asia, likely to rival London and New York within a decade&apos;.", "Dubai&apos;s neighbour, Abu Dhabi, has more oil, which it is shrewdly trading for culture.", "The Dubai International Financial Centre, which sponsors John Martin&apos;s fair, ignores the French aspersions about sleazy deals and kick-backs.", "His audience included a gaggle of Dubai matrons swathed in burkas, with jewels glinting in their head-dresses and flowers of henna traced on their hands.", "(Christie&apos;s held their first sale in Dubai recently, disposing of most lots to Indian bidders.", "Dubai is re-inventing itself in steel and glass, and the nodding cranes work all night long to conjure elastic skyscrapers out of the monotonous desert.", "This is where Burj Dubai, which will be the tallest building in the world, twists upwards like a corkscrew puncturing heaven.", "But behind the mirrored facades of the new Dubai, which vaporise in the humid haze like the mirages they are, something has been lost, or at least sold for a price that may be in the billions but is still too low.", "&apos;We do not have a river in Dubai, sir,&apos; he said.", "&apos;What we have is the Creek.&apos; His smile proudly, sadly, remembered a time when Dubai was a backwater."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/mar/11/art.features4", "publicationDate": "2007-03-11T00:08:41Z"}, {"article": "The following correction was printed in the Observer&apos;s For the record column, Sunday June 10 2007 The article below quoted \u00a3310 per night for a family room at Bonchurch Manor, Isle of Wight; this is actually for three nights, with children under three staying free and older children at 60 per cent of the adult rate. And baby comes too Ninder Billing, a company director, and Ajay Khandelwal, a team manager for a drugs intervention programme, both 37, had their first child, Priya, in January. They live in London and want a baby-friendly holiday by the sea. The brief: &apos;We want to go on holiday for a week: somewhere far enough to feel like we&apos;re away and it was worth packing all the baby kit, but not so far that we get frazzled trying to navigate the new experience of travelling with a baby. We are finding that securing cheap flights is not the &quot;log on and surf&quot; doddle it used to be now we have a child. We have no preference for home or abroad but, as we are both of Indian heritage, we are always drawn towards the sub-continent. But we are also conscious of trying not to leave a carbon footprint the size of Cornwall. Dilemma! We would love somewhere by the sea.&apos; The budget: \u00a31,000 The solution Ronnie Haydon of Time Out says: Being across the water, the Isle of Wight would give you a sense of &apos;abroad&apos; as well as the feeling of security all young families need. The poshest hotel is Bonchurch Manor (01983 852868), which, at \u00a3310 and upwards for a family room, is on the expensive side, but it&apos;s fantastically friendly towards babies and has an amazing Southern Indian restaurant (The Tiffin Room, where the menu is inspired by the family recipes of one of the owners, Shuba Rao). If that&apos;s too pricey, the Farringford Hotel (01983 752500; from \u00a366 per night, or garden suites from \u00a3142 per night) has an outdoor pool with a separate paddling pool for tinies. Michelle Leonard of Travel Counsellors says: Coral do Vau apartments in Praia do Vau in Portugal are well managed, low rise flats 50 metres from one of the best beaches on the Algarve, with the larger resort of Praia da Rocha, below, less than a mile away. The Algarve has many great places to visit; all the resorts are within a short distance of each other, which is ideal with an infant. The Algarve is only a two-hour flight from London. The area is extremely peaceful; the baby can get to sleep while you enjoy the sea view with a drink on the balcony. A package would easily be possible for \u00a31,000, depending on the time of year. Toby Sawday of Sawdays says: Why suffer from carbon guilt when all the ingredients for your holiday can be found without crossing borders? Self-catering in Britain is undergoing a revival, and there are some fantastic places along the British coast. You could look at Camber Barn (01797 225202), slap bang on the Camber Sands in Sussex. Driftwood has been taken from the beach and used to great effect for shelving; quirky old furniture has been mixed with new; and the wooden deck for al fresco meals is an attraction in itself. And if you want a complete break, Georgina will cook you a delicious dinner and bring it to your door. It costs between \u00a3275-\u00a3850 per week. The budget family break Twins Adam and Imogen, eight months, their sister Ellie, five, mum Lisa Falshaw, 41, and dad Howard, 48, live in Crofton, Yorkshire and are in real need of a break. Howard is head of English at Heckmondwike Grammar School in Kirklees, and Lisa who has suffered from ME for 12 years, has taken early retirement. The brief: &apos;Any type of holiday would appeal to us right now, but the emphasis should be on sunshine and thrift,&apos; says Howard. &apos;Lisa craves warmth and sunshine as it makes her feel a little better. We need somewhere that&apos;s good for the children but also somewhere Lisa can manage on limited energy. We don&apos;t have the time or energy to arrange a trip ourselves so would love some feasible suggestions. We are also limited to school summer holidays.&apos; The budget: \u00a31,000 The solution:  Toby Sawday of Sawdays says: I would keep things simple with a week in a gite near the east coast of the Manche peninsula of Normandy. Le Manoir, a former bakehouse cottage hidden in the grounds of a 16th-century manor house, has peace in spades. With a walled rose garden and vine-covered terrace to the front and lawns and patio to the back, Lisa can catch the sun all day and Ellie will have plenty of space to roam free. The bedroom is a family room with two doubles, though the nearby barn is split into two rooms, if you prefer. If you&apos;re feeling energetic, fishing ports and the landing beaches are close by, but you could just wallow in the scented peace of the garden. A crossing with Brittany Ferries from Portsmouth to Cherbourg for the whole family costs \u00a3386. The accommodation is \u00a3425 for one week. Sarah Johnstone of Lonely Planet says: For budget holidays in Europe with loads for kids to do, you can&apos;t beat Eurocamp (0870 901 9410), which does ferry and accommodation packages at camps throughout France and Italy, starting at \u00a3551 for seven nights in a three-bedroom tent. Your budget would also run to some of their spacious mobile homes, left, in many camps. Michelle Leonard of Travel Counsellors says: Within five hours of leaving home, the family will be sitting by the pool at the self-catering Vistamar apartments in Benalmadena on the Costa del Sol. Self-catering is a must with the infants for the use of a fridge, and the apartments have a playground and kids&apos; club . Benalmadena is a good family resort with a nice beach and also a vast choice of reasonably priced restaurants. They can fly out of Leeds Bradford on 7 August, returning to Manchester on 14 August, and stay for a week, for \u00a31,069. The shoestring honeymoon James Almond, 33, and his wife Denise, 30, are primary school teachers in Bristol and they got married in December, when James sprung a surprise ceremony on Denise while they were in San Francisco to attend his sister&apos;s wedding. They will be celebrating the union with a party in the UK on Easter Sunday and want to take a delayed honeymoon. The brief: &apos;We are looking for a relaxing beach holiday in luxurious accommodation and surroundings; somewhere warm and a bit different. It should be peaceful, without too many noisy children as there are plenty of those at school! We like the idea of Jamaica or the Maldives but don&apos;t want to fly so far for a week. We&apos;ve been considering Egypt, Cape Verde and Morocco. We like snorkelling and swimming and exploring the local area. The earliest we could leave would be Easter Monday, and we&apos;d need to be back for school on 19 April.&apos; The budget: Around \u00a31,200 The solution  Sarah Johnstone from Lonely Planet says: The water will still be a bit too cold in Morocco in April and while Cape Verde has the beaches for a sun and sand holiday, there aren&apos;t really those special romantic nooks on the main tourist islands. Egypt fits the bill. There&apos;s no shortage of affordable hotels. Longwood Holidays (020 8418 2525) suggests the Sheraton Miramar in El Gouna, 15 miles north of Hurghada. A week&apos;s B&amp;B costs from \u00a3459pp. If you&apos;d prefer to set up your own trip, XL Airlines (0870 320 7777) flies from Bristol to Hurghada for pounds 231 return including taxes, but only on Fridays, so you&apos;d need to miss two days of school if term starts again on the 19th.  If you&apos;re prepared to fly a little further, there are very good deals in Dubai. Lastminute has plenty of options, including the al-Hamra Village Townhouse for \u00a3609pp including flights with Qatar Airlines.  Mark Brock of Barrhead Travel says: I recommend that you spend a week in Gambia, West Africa, which offers tropical sunshine, beautiful beaches and a warm welcome. There&apos;s a direct six-hour flight from Bristol on 10 April. The four-star Ocean Bay Hotel is in Cape Point, Gambia&apos;s most refined resort. There&apos;s a large pool area at the hotel and the beach is nearby so you can swim and snorkel by day, and spend your evenings admiring the sunset at the beach bar. A package comes in at just under \u00a31,100.  Michelle Leonard from Travel Counsellors says: Sharm el-Sheikh offers fantastic weather and is famous for its snorkelling and diving. The region is also great for sightseeing, both within Sharm and on short trips to Luxor or Cairo. The Calimera Royal Moderna Hotel is not in the centre of the resort but there is a courtesy bus several times a day into bustling Naama Bay. You could fly from Gatwick on 10 April, return on the 17th, stay all-inclusive, and stay overnight at a Gatwick hotel the night before, for \u00a31,190.  The hen weekend Gabrielle Orcutt, a 24-year-old publishing assistant from Oxford, wants to book a cheap spa weekend with her friend Katie Howie, also 24, a student from London who is due to get married this summer. The budget: &apos;My best friend is getting married and, before she does, we have our hearts set on a weekend break together. We thought it would be fun to spend time at a spa, but when I looked at prices, they seemed completely out of reach. We would really like to stay somewhere overnight and for it to feel like a real treat. London prices don&apos;t look promising but maybe you know of something further afield?&apos; The budget: \u00a3300  The solution Toby Sawday of Sawdays says: I would recommend Red Roofs at Oldfield (01628 621910) - a dazzling film-set of a house and garden in Maidenhead, 35 minutes by train from London. Built in the 1890s, it now houses a canny collection of Victoriana and some indulged guests. Bedrooms are packed with gleaming wood, watercolours, and old knick-knacks. There&apos;s a relaxation room for massage, reiki, and stone therapy. It is a B&amp;B, but Heston Blumenthal&apos;s Hind&apos;s Head is a five-minute taxi-ride away for a terrific and well-priced dinner. Twin rooms cost from \u00a3150 a night, leaving enough for therapies (from \u00a335) and that dinner.  Peterjon Cresswell, editor of the Time Out Budapest guide, says: Budapest has plenty of spas, above right. Stay at the Danubius Grand Hotel (00 36 1 889 4752) on Margaret Island in the city. It is slightly cheaper than its sister establishment, the Thermal Margitsziget, which is connected by a heated underground tunnel. Guests are free to use the facilities at either venue. You can usually find a room for about 140 euros (\u00a3100). The island is traffic-free and has a memorable view of the Pest embankment. Easyjet (0871 244 2366) and Wizz (00 48 2 2351 9499) serve the city. Sarah Johnstone of Lonely Planet says: You might consider a day and a night in Bath sampling the Thermae Bath Spa. A two-hour session costs \u00a320, four hours \u00a330; facials start at \u00a335, massages at \u00a338. Book into a nice B&amp;B such as the Town House Bath (01225 422505; twins from pounds 90). In the evening, try Number 5 Bistro (01225 444499) in the centre of town. Alternatively, www.spabreak.co.uk offers packages around the country from around \u00a3119pp for accommodation, use of spa facilities and a treatment or two.

Mr Ahmadinejad wanted to &quot;defend the rights of the Iranian nation in exploiting peaceful nuclear energy,&quot; state TV quoted the Iranian government spokesman, Gholam Hossein Elham, as saying. The president would attend if the security council holds a meeting on Iran&apos;s nuclear programme, the TV said. South Africa&apos;s ambassador, Dumisani Kumalo, whose country holds the council&apos;s rotating presidency, said that if Mr Ahmadinejad made a formal request, &quot;it would be very difficult to deny him that opportunity&quot;. The US said it was not aware that any such request had been made. Western countries, led by the US, insist that Iran&apos;s nuclear programme is a covert attempt to produce atomic weapons, a view reinforced by Tehran&apos;s continuing refusal to freeze uranium enrichment. Diplomatic efforts are under way to agree new UN sanctions to force it to comply. The sensitivity of the issue is highlighted in a report today by a leading British foreign affairs think-tank warning that Israel - with its own large but undeclared nuclear arsenal - faces &quot;dire and far-reaching consequences&quot; if it takes military action against the Iranian programme. Israeli airstrikes were possible, though &quot;extremely risky&quot;, and Iran could retaliate with massive ballistic missile attacks on cities such as Tel Aviv or Haifa with &quot;substantial&quot; loss of life, says Yossi Mekelberg of Chatham House&apos;s Middle East programme. &quot;An Israeli military operation against Iran would hurt Israel&apos;s long-term interests. It would be detrimental to Israel&apos;s overall security and the political and economic consequences would be dire and far-reaching,&quot; the report said. But it warned too that the Israelis may feel compelled to act if they believed Tehran was close to developing a nuclear bomb. &quot;Any military operation against Iran, as well as involving many casualties, would enhance the appeal of extremism in the Muslim world, inside and outside Iran, at the expense of the moderates.&quot; If diplomacy failed, the report proposes that Israel could move to a policy of deterrence by openly declaring its own nuclear capability, mirroring the &quot;balance of terror&quot; that kept the peace between the west and the Soviet bloc in the cold war. In Dubai, the French foreign minister Phillippe Douste-Blazy agreed that military action would destabilise the region and insisted that sanctions would have to be imposed on Iran. Last December the security council imposed sanctions including a ban on the transfer of sensitive nuclear technology and threatened further measures if Iran failed to suspend enrichment. The five permanent council members plus Germany are now consulting on new proposals including a travel ban, an expanded list of people, organisations and companies subject to an asset freeze - including the Revolutionary Guards and the state-owned Bank Sepah - as well as an arms embargo and trade restrictions. Russia and China, however, have strong reservations, and any decision needs a consensus . In a related development, the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, yesterday met the Iranian defence minister, Mostafa Najjar, to discuss military links between the two countries. Syria is Iran&apos;s only Arab ally at a time of deepening confrontation between Arab states and Tehran. The two countries both support the Lebanese movement Hizbullah and the Palestinian Hamas while Iran has close links to Shia parties in Iraq. Syria has been improving its arsenal since last summer&apos;s war between Hizbullah and Israel while Iran has been upgrading its military capabilities.", "tags": ["World news", "Iran", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Iran to take nuclear case directly to UN", "sentences": ["In Dubai, the French foreign minister Phillippe Douste-Blazy agreed that military action would destabilise the region and insisted that sanctions would have to be imposed on Iran."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/12/iran.ianblack", "publicationDate": "2007-03-12T00:09:54Z"}, {"article": "Details of the Middle Eastern money backing the buyout of Aston Martin emerged yesterday. Ford is close to agreeing the \u00a3450m sale of the classic British car business to a consortium led by the motor enthusiast David Richards and an announcement could be made as early as today. The US auto manufacturer is being forced to sell off the luxury sports car brand in an effort to repair its balance sheet - but will hold on to a share of around 15%. Ford has been in exclusive negotiations with Mr Richards for the past few weeks. The British businessman has secured backing from, among others, the Kuwaiti firms Investment Dar and Adeem Investment. Another name that has been mentioned as a backer is Naeem Capital, part of an Egyptian investment bank. Mr Richards is also said to have won support from US investors. Investment funds from the Gulf region are eager to diversify and have been buying up assets in Britain including Madame Tussauds, P&amp;O and Veridian, the main electricity supplier in Northern Ireland. Dubai International Capital owns a $1bn stake in DaimlerChrysler and Abu Dhabi&apos;s Mubadala Development Co owns 5% of Ferrari. The agreement between Ford and the consortium has been hailed by fans of the quintessentially British car as a great day for British motoring. Mr Richards, 54, a former accountant, is the founder of Prodrive, the group that runs Aston Martin&apos;s racing team, and has long harboured ambitions to run his own manufacturing operation. He is the former head of the BAR Honda and Benetton formula one teams and he has a private collection of classic Aston Martins. Barring any last minute hitches, he will become Aston Martin chairman. The Aston Martin chief executive, German born Ulrich Bez, has overseen a remarkable turnaround in the marque&apos;s fortunes and is expected to remain at the company. In 1992, production skidded to only 46 cars. Under Mr Bez, it has risen to 7,000 cars last year and the company is in profit. Mr Richard&apos;s medium term ambition is to increase that number to 10,000, reports suggest. He also plans to keep building the Aston Martin range, including the Rapide, a new four-door coupe. Aston Martin has had a long and fruitful association with the James Bond films - Daniel Craig was behind the wheel of an Aston Martin DBS in Casino Royale. Ford took a controlling stake in Aston Martin in 1987 and acquired full ownership in 1994. It announced plans to sell the company almost six months ago. Ford last year lost $12.7bn (\u00a36.6bn) and announced plans to lay off 44,000 workers and close 16 plants. Ford could now turn its attention again to the sale of its other two luxury British car-makers, Jaguar and Land Rover. Mr Richards saw off competition from the private equity group Doughty Hanson and Simon Halabi, the Syrian billionaire. Aston Martin produced its first car in 1914. The firm was bought by the Yorkshire tractor maker David Brown in 1947. When he sold the business 25 years later it was in poor shape. Several owners followed before Ford bought the business.

Four members of the jury at Manchester crown court wept as Judge David Clarke told Rahan Arshad, 36, that life meant life and that he would never be freed on licence. Arshad closed his eyes as the jury of eight women and four men delivered their unanimous verdicts after deliberating for just over two hours. Rahat Ali, brother of Arshad&apos;s wife, Uzma, shouted &quot;Yes!&quot; as the first guilty verdict was returned. Arshad had denied four charges of murder but admitted the manslaughter of his wife, claiming he killed her after she had murdered their daughter and two sons at the family home in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, last July. Arshad returned voluntarily to the UK from the far east and, when arrested at Heathrow, told police: &quot;My beautiful kids. I don&apos;t regret killing that fucking bitch, but my kids, killing my kids ...&quot; In an impact statement read to the court, Mr Ali, who was in court with his mother, Safia Hassnain, and brother, Mustajab Ali Haider, said he had not slept between the discovery of the bodies and Arshad&apos;s return to Britain and told of his grief at seeing the four bodies on the mortuary slab. He said his sister had been his &quot;best mate&quot; and the pain of losing her and her children was at times unbearable. &quot;None of us could understand how a father could do such a thing to his children and his wife also ... What must they have been thinking when it was happening to them, especially the children?&quot; The judge told Arshad: &quot;The jury have convicted you on overwhelming evidence ... You killed your entire family in circumstances of great brutality. You beat your wife to death in her bedroom and then coldly and deliberately you brought your sleepy children downstairs to meet their deaths. You left the scene and fled the country. It was over three weeks before the bodies were discovered. There is no suggestion of mental illness on your part.&quot; Arshad insisted throughout the trial that he had not killed his children. He said that when he found the bodies lying in a downstairs room, he went upstairs to confront his wife, who he claimed had said: &quot;Are you satisfied?&quot; He had then &quot;blanked out&quot;. &quot;I found myself in the shower, in the bath,&quot; he told the court. &quot;I mean in the bath. I found myself in the bath with the bat.&quot; He said he did not know exactly what had happened to Uzma, who suffered 23 blows to her head and body from the bat he had bought the previous day and later hid in his garden shed. The court heard that Uzma, whom Arshad married in 1992 and described as &quot;an absolute beauty&quot;, had been again living with her husband after an affair. Arshad attacked her in a bedroom and covered her body with a towel. He then carried each of his sleeping children downstairs, battering first Abbas, eight, then Henna, six, and finally Adam, 11. He covered their bodies after each attack. After the murders, late on July 28 or July 29 2006, he drove to Heathrow in his BMW, caught a plane to Bangkok and travelled on to the resort of Phuket. The decomposing bodies were found more than three weeks later after a neighbour smelled rotting flesh. The court heard he had told his wife and children that they were about to go on holiday to Dubai, where Uzma wanted to buy gold. He told the children they were not going to Dubai when he took them to Blackpool shortly before he killed them. Mr Ali said outside the court: &quot;My family and I finally feel we can relax. For months we have been in terrible shock. No one can heal the grief we have suffered. My mother can&apos;t understand how [Arshad] could destroy [my sister]. The judge made a brilliant decision. A person like this shouldn&apos;t ever be freed.&quot; &quot;Rahan Arshad&apos;s defence has been nothing short of ridiculous,&quot; said Detective Superintendent Martin Bottomley, who led the investigation. &quot;The only time he has ever shown any remorse was when he first got off the plane from Thailand.&quot;", "tags": ["UK news", "Crime"], "title": "Life for taxi driver who murdered wife and children", "sentences": ["The court heard he had told his wife and children that they were about to go on holiday to Dubai, where Uzma wanted to buy gold.", "He told the children they were not going to Dubai when he took them to Blackpool shortly before he killed them."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/mar/14/ukcrime.davidward", "publicationDate": "2007-03-14T00:02:48Z"}, {"article": "A free weekly newspaper is launched today in Dubai.

That is the question being asked in Sydney after David Gyngell, son of the late TVam executive Bruce Gyngell, was spotted brunching with Rupert Murdoch&apos;s son at a beachside cafe in Sydney this week. &quot;The pair greeted each other with a forceful bear hug before getting down to business over espressos. An intense conversation ensued,&quot; reported the Sydney Morning Herald&apos;s well-connected diarist Andrew Hornery. Gyngell runs Granada America, ITV&apos;s US production arm, but was once in charge of James Packer&apos;s Channel Nine before quitting in an executive turf war and heading to Los Angeles. Prior to their flip-flop and T-shirt summit at the Swell cafe, just a couple of paces from Sydney&apos;s Bronte Beach, the smart money had been on Gyngell returning to his old job to rescue a fading Channel Nine, currently run by Eddie McGuire, the former host of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? in Australia (Monkey is trying to imagine Chris Tarrant running ITV instead of Michael Grade). Anyway, now the speculation is about young Mr Murdoch - who quit his job at father Rupert&apos;s News Corporation in July 2006 for a beach side life - wanting to buy Channel Ten and getting Gyngell to run it. More to be told on that one, Monkey feels. Sticky wicketTo Times Online - no, really - where its sports team came over all snooty on the eve of the cricket World Cup. &quot;Features of this World Cup that will infuriate fans by the close of the tournament,&quot; it said. &quot;Footage such as that currently filling a drinks break in which the Caribbean is promoted as the land of sun, sea, reggae and laughter; David Gower&apos;s deepening tan; over-by-over reports lazily buffeted by inane reader emails.

Circulatory crisis in the AlpsThere has been a major dust-up at the Austrian equivalent of the chaps who count our newspaper circulations, ABC. No, stick with us. Two big daily newspapers have quit in protest at another paper, Osterreich, being allowed to join the OAK. Osterreich, you see, gives out free shorter versions of itself and Krone and Kurier want it to be considered a freesheet and not a &quot;proper paper&quot;. Krone and Kurier, which are both owned by the Mediaprint corporation, are now threatening to found their own newspaper association. Monkey feels something&apos;s got to give. But who will it be? Trinny&apos;s jolly japesTo Hello! magazine now and the second half of its coverage of Elizabeth Hurley&apos;s understated wedding to Arun Nayar. Monkey knows the magazine has always had a writing style all of its own, but William Cash&apos;s report about the nuptials - at least, Monkey thinks it&apos;s William Cash - really takes the biscuit. &quot;The evening ended on an amusing note when Trinny Woodall of What Not To Wear fame decided to play a practical joke on four of Elizabeth&apos;s closest male friends, including Sudeley Castle host Henry Dent-Brocklehurst and Old Etonian racing driver Charles Dean, who were sharing a &apos;boys&apos; dormitory&apos; in a giant royal chamber. She made &apos;apple pie&apos; beds so that they couldn&apos;t get under the covers when they tried to get into bed late at night in the dark. Charles Dean, one of Elizabeth&apos;s Gloucestershire neighbours, found it so hilarious that he laughed for 20 minutes, preventing anybody else in the &apos;dorm&apos; getting to sleep!&quot; No word on whether there were also lashings of ginger beer. Enid Blyton, eat yer heart out. Think once, think twice, think ReichMonkey normally enjoys the Daily Mail&apos;s waspish political sketch writer, Quentin Letts. But not on Wednesday, when Letts made a Nazi slur against environment minister David Miliband&apos;s special adviser. His column was about Miliband&apos;s PR opportunity involving school children and climate change. Letts was denied access to the event and by the end of the column his kettle had boiled dry. &quot;Mr Miliband then stomped off, accompanied by a macintoshed gauleiter of a special adviser, name of Schaefer, who was shouting into a mobile telephone. This, England, is the politics of 2007.&quot; Gauleiter was the Nazi term for a local government official in the Third Reich. Sarah Schaefer is the German-born special adviser to Miliband. She is of Jewish descent and her grandfather was a celebrated doctor who gave help to many Jews during the Nazi era. First London mayor Ken Livingstone makes a widely-despised attack on Jewish Evening Standard journalist Oliver Finegold, likening him to a &quot;concentration camp guard&quot;, now this. Monkey wonders if Letts regrets the &quot;joke&quot;. History lessonSir Martin Sorrell makes much of his ambitions in Asia, where WPP is building a significant presence in a number of advertising markets. So perhaps he should brush up on his history of the region&apos;s culture. In his witness statement to the ongoing libel trial between him and former colleague Marco Benatti, Sir Martin tells how he received a gift from the Italian of The Art of War, by Sun Tzu, &quot;a famous Japanese general&quot;. Sun Tzu, as any amateur student of boardroom strategy or sports psychology should know, was in fact a Chinese military authority, believed to have lived in the state of Wu in the 6th century BC. Let&apos;s hope for WPP&apos;s sake not too many potential Chinese business partners are paying close attention to this week&apos;s trial. Nice idea, DudeHere&apos;s one for Big Lebowski fans. Disney-owned producer Buena Vista is developing a syndicated gameshow - about bowling. With a working title Up Your Alley - how skill is that? - the show revolves around bowling and celebrities, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Mine&apos;s a size 14. A pink one.

The Sun reports that the music manager is rushing out a &apos;warts-and-all&apos; book with a &apos;bombshell&apos; final chapter about his exit from the ITV show. But a chapter about Ronan Keating has been removed after Boyzone agreed to reform for a tour. Thursday March 15 RTS award mithering: part twoOh dear. Have we learnt nothing from the whiny emails that went pinging round BBC News after their poor showing at the RTS news awards the other week? ITV Productions boss John Whiston hasn&apos;t, apparently. In an email to staff about this week&apos;s RTS programme awards, Whisto just couldn&apos;t resist a bit of a grumble. He starts off well enough, basking in the glory of ITV Productions/Granada&apos;s five (count &apos;em) drama awards. But then it turns sour: &quot;This Morning lost out in the daytime programme [category] to something that so wasn&apos;t a daytime programme - two blokes rowing across the Atlantic. Phillip and Fearne are already in training on their rowing machines for next year.&quot; Actually, on reflection, he&apos;s got a point there. But isn&apos;t it Fern, as in Britton - not Fearne, as in Cotton? Wait, there&apos;s more: &quot;At the risk of sounding churlish we should have [won more] with Prime Suspect beaten by a perfectly respectable but not nearly as resonant drama on Channel 4.&quot; Okaaaay. &quot;There were a couple of other &apos;We Woz Robbed&apos; categories including Liza Gilchrist the producer of See No Evil who should have won the Breakthrough award.&quot; Blimey, give it a rest. &quot;And I&apos;m a Celebrity lost out to How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?, which at least was recognisably an entertainment programme.&quot; Sarky. On a missionIs broadcasting minister Shaun Woodward a fan of Black Hawk Down, Ridley Scott&apos;s gung-ho war flick about the ill-fated US military mission to Somalia in 1993? Monkey only asks because Woodward seems to have appropriated the film&apos;s tagline &quot;Leave no man behind&quot; - also the motto of the Rangers and other US special forces - for the government&apos;s digital switchover campaign. During today&apos;s switchover briefing, &quot;no-one gets left behind&quot; became something of a mantra for the minister. Hooah, Shaun. Monkey has visions of the SAS choppering Freeview boxes in for digital TV have nots. Strong winds forecastThe list of taboos not broken by TV is growing ever shorter, goodness knows. We&apos;ve had live autopsies, live births, live plastic surgery, live executions. OK, not the last one - but it&apos;s only a matter of time, surely. So Monkey is indebted to the eagle-eyed reader who drew our attention to a classified ad in today&apos;s Metro: &quot;Bad flatulence? TV documentary can help. Do you or someone you know fart constantly? Does a digestive disorder give you wind? Is flatulence causing problems in your career or relationship?&quot; The resulting show may sound a bit like this. Or this. Or even this. Parp! Opie&apos;s profile raisedFive&apos;s new initiative of setting up MySpace pages for the broadcaster&apos;s commissioning team has had an unexpected upside for Lisa Opie, managing director of content. Speaking at a MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival London event, Opie revealed that since setting up her own MySpace profile she&apos;s had two offers of &quot;dates&quot;. Monkey hears there&apos;s no truth in rumours that the would be wooers are a &quot;Simon from Gray&apos;s Inn&quot; or an &quot;Andy from Horseferry Road.&quot; No longer in the pinkSurprising news out of the Times, where its editor of the past five years, former Financial Times man Robert Thomson, has just made another hiring - not, repeat not, from his old paper. As MediaGuardian.co.uk reports this morning, the Times&apos; new chief political correspondent will be Francis Elliott from the Independent on Sunday. The news got Monkey pondering, just how many staff has Thomson poached from the Pink &apos;Un? So far it&apos;s Times Online chief designer Tomaso Capuano, Times Online editor-in-chief Anne Spackman, editorial communications director Anoushka Healy, Bombay correspondent Ashling O&apos;Connor, Times Online executive editor Parminder Bahra, US editor Gerard Baker, Madrid correspondent Tom Catan, business and city editor James Harding, associate features editor Emma Tucker and business feature writer Sathnam Sangera. Honorable mention to Tokyo correspondent Leo Lewis, who quit for the FT only to be poached back after just three months. Says one Times wag who claims closeness to its inscrutable editor, &quot;We&apos;ve run out of FT talent...&quot; Dashing tribute to MorseITV is marking the 20th anniversary of the first Inspector Morse with a spectacular musical event at the Royal Albert Hall, hosted by Michael Parkinson and featuring the likes of Lesley Garrett, Sir Willard White, Alfie Boe, the Crouch End Festival Chorus and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The concert, featuring pieces of music from the long-running series, will be broadcast as part of a weekend of programmes devoted to Morse on ITV3. The concert is on April 19, and the Morse weekend takes place on April 28 and 29. Monkey will endeavour to watch. It&apos;s gonna live foreverIt&apos;s the TV revival we&apos;ve all been waiting for. Yes, it&apos;s Fame: the stage-school film and TV hit could be back in the form of a London-set drama. The Sun reports that Sky One is about to give the \u00a37m pound project the go-ahead. Wednesday March 14 The sorry state of phone-insMonkey had to wait until the very end of today&apos;s programme, but Blue Peter finally got round to apologising for faking the winner of a viewers&apos; phone-in competition. &quot;Unfortunately there was a technical problem and a visitor was asked to stand in as a contestant. This was a mistake and this is what we have done about it,&quot; announced the three presenters, who democratically shared the apology between them. &quot;We have decided to run the competition again and we have chosen our winner from the entries.&quot; The winner was Mark Thompson Jr! No, no it wasn&apos;t. We&apos;re kidding. Back to the apology. &quot;We would like to say sorry to you because when this mistake happened we let you down.&quot; LWT reunitedITV boss Simon Shaps began his Broadcasting Press Guild lunch speech today by saying how glad he was to see former LWT head of current affairs David Cox, now a freelance journalist, in the room. &quot;David hired me at LWT,&quot; he explained. &quot;... and you sacked me,&quot; was Cox&apos;s response. &quot;Thanks for nicking my punchline,&quot; Shaps replied. Presenters in the front lineTonight&apos;s Blue Peter apology for faking the winner of a phone-in competition - as one Monkey reader suggested, &quot;Here&apos;s one we made up earlier&quot; - won&apos;t be made by head of Children&apos;s BBC Richard Deverell. Oh no. Deverell has declined the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of one of his predecessors, Lorraine Heggessey, and will be leaving the apology to the programme&apos;s presenting team. &quot;They are the ones who have the relationship with viewers,&quot; Deverell told BBC News 24. We bet they&apos;re delighted! Hard-line approachWhat form will the Blue Peter apology take tonight? The programme&apos;s last high profile on-screen apology followed presenter Richard Bacon&apos;s unfortunate exit after taking cocaine. So Monkey used the then kids&apos; controller Lorraine Heggessey&apos;s apology in 1998 as a template for tonight&apos;s fess-up. &quot;Many of you will have watched Blue Peter last November and entered our phone-in competition. It was right that we should have been raising money for Unicef as part of our Blue Peter Appeal, and we were delighted that you took part. Many of you will know there has been a sad event too. We couldn&apos;t actually access all your phone calls and we had to ask a child visiting the studio to phone in instead. We admit we have done wrong and we very much regret it. I believe that Blue Peter has not only let itself and the BBC down, but it has also let all of you down badly.&quot; There, that should do it. Flying highTimes columnist Tim Hames took the Conservative party to task for its plans to hike up the tax on people who make more than one short-haul return flight a year. &quot;Soaring to the heights of absurdity,&quot; was the headline on yesterday&apos;s piece. &quot;A patronising threat to the &apos;ordinary&apos; family.&quot; Such sentiments presumably went down very well with the Institute of Travel and Tourism, whose 2007 conference will be moderated by... Tim Hames. The ITT website says Hames is a &quot;veteran of an ITT conference&quot; who will bring his &quot;own unique style to ITT&apos;s conference sessions in Gran Canaria&quot;. Hames was also a speaker at last year&apos;s ITT conference in Oman. Never mind the environment, think of the air miles!

Read more... BBC at the barricadesAndrew Marr reveals an interesting piece of BBC history in his Daily Telegraph column today. Back at the height of the Suez crisis 50 years ago, PM Anthony Eden was infuriated by the BBC&apos;s coverage. According to former BBC reporter Kate Adie, the government had put troops on standby in a building across the Strand from Bush House - and BBC engineers were given sledgehammers so they could smash equipment rather than let it fall into government hands. Tuesday March 13 Sharp-dressed manChannel 4 boss Andy Duncan admitted today that the channel didn&apos;t get things &quot;100% right&quot; during the Celebrity Big Brother outcry earlier in the year. &quot;In hindsight we could have handled that more sensitively,&quot; he told MPs of the culture, media and sport select committee. &quot;At the time we were very concerned within Channel 4 but probably failed to get that across externally.&quot; Fortunately, Duncan seems to have learnt from his mistakes. One of the chief criticisms about his reaction to the CBB furore was that he appeared at a press conference wearing just a polo shirt. Naturally no one in medialand was bothered, knowing Duncan&apos;s taste for dressing down, but it didn&apos;t play well with the wider public who expect their suits properly suited. Today Duncan decided against risking the sartorial disapproval of MPs and was looking very sharp in a blue open-necked shirt and tailored jacket. Crooner connectionsSo how exactly do you get an interview with elusive singer songwriter Joni Mitchell? If you are Gregor Cameron, who has made a two-part programme with the singer for Radio 2, then you ask your wife. Cameron, whose World&apos;s End productions also makes Fighting Talk for Radio Five Live, is married to Amanda Ghost, co-writer of James Blunt&apos;s You&apos;re Beautiful. Ghost, who also co-wrote Beyonce and Shakira&apos;s up-coming duet, Beautiful Liar, was the last person signed by legendary A&amp;R man Andrew Wickham at Warners. And his first? Joni Mitchell. Ghost interviewed Mitchell for the two-part series, on Radio 2 later this month. Serving up the wrong SimonThe Daily Telegraph went to great lengths to fanfare its new restaurant critic, Mark Palmer, giving him the entire front page of its Weekend section, plus most of page two. It even puts him in black tie, holding up various numbers on cards, the reason for which becomes apparent inside. &quot;I&apos;d like to think that this job is the closest I&apos;ll get to aping Simon Callow as he sits in judgement on those wretched wannabe singers on Saturday night.&quot; Rule number one, Mark: always triple check your pop culture references, and if in doubt don&apos;t bother. Simon Callow is an acclaimed stage and screen actor who appeared in Monkey&apos;s favourite romcom, Four Weddings and A Funeral. Palmer, presumably, was thinking of Simon Cowell. The Bank&apos;s C4 flutterChannel 4 News hacks were surprised - and rather delighted - to find the Bank of England bunging them \u00a340 worth of the new \u00a320 notes with a parcel featuring a tape of footage of the currency being printed. But surely, they must be specimen samples? Apparently not - closer inspection of the covering note that came with parcel confirmed they were the real thing, with the Bank of England suggesting &quot;please feel free to donate the money to charity&quot;. Or take a flutter on today&apos;s Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham... Wrong numbersNew recruits heading to The Daily Telegraph should be wary about accepting a work mobile phone from their new bosses. The company is charging anyone leaving the company \u00a3250 if they want to take their mobile phone number with them. The revelation has come as a surprise to reporters, particularly those who were encouraged to migrate their old personal numbers to official Telegraph phones a few years ago. According to Peter Lohmeyer, the head of paperclips, filing cabinets and water dispensers at Victoria, it&apos;s all the fault of a particularly inflexible contract signed when Orange took over the Telegraph group&apos;s phones two years ago. A contract signed soon after John Allwood, the former CEO of Orange joined the Telegraph Group as managing director. Sadly, Mr Allwood is unable to sort out the mess, having resigned earlier this year. Snubbed nosesHealthy and safety &apos;jobsworths&apos; have banned red noses - from, of all places, the hall where Comic Relief does Fame Academy is being filmed, reports the Mirror. Producers had planned to hand out foam noses to the audience - but they were deemed a health risk. Monday March 12 Ropey logoIs it just Monkey, or does the logo for Capital Radio&apos;s expensive  new rebrand look disconcertingly like a length of old rope?

Now that really would have been inappropriate. Image problemsApology of the week (and it&apos;s only Monday): Page 19 of today&apos;s Metro: &quot;Metro wishes to unreservedly apologise for the mistake in Friday&apos;s paper where a photograph of his Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum was published in an article on page 21 about Guant\u00e1namo prisoners. His Highness is in no way connected to Guant\u00e1namo or its prisoners. We apologise for this mistake and for any offence it may have caused. Our thanks to the United Arab Emirates embassy in London for bringing this mistake to our attention. Sheikh Mohammed is prime minister and vice-president of the United Arab Emirates, the ruler of Dubai, and a leading figure in the world of thoroughbred horse racing and breeding.&quot; Number crunchIt has baffled boffins at Mensa as well as lateral-thinking pioneer Edward de Bono, but ITV today claimed there was a legitimate way of getting the answer to a mind-boggling quiz it set on the premium-rate phone-in show Make Your Play. The Times reported this morning that it was finding it tough to get anyone to reach the answer of 506 in the quiz headed Add the Pence, which listed &quot;Two pounds, 25p, \u00a31.47, 16p, Fifty pence&quot; as its options. A Bletchley Park cryptanalyst finally came up with a way of reaching 506 but ITV said it was wrong. Monkey was today taken through the puzzle, but not being a maths enthusiast is not really any the wiser. But for all you puzzle fiends out there, here is the answer, apparently. Two pounds = 200p, count the letter p on its own as well plus the portion of the phrase that alludes to 2p, and that makes 203p. Then you add 25p plus the 5p separately and the singular p which makes 31p. Then add \u00a31.47 and the singular p, making \u00a31.48; 16p plus the separate 6p and the singular p makes 23p. Then Fifty pence is taken as 50p plus 50p plus the single p. And all of this makes 506. Allegedly. Monkey only asks that you hassle ITV and not MediaGuardian if you don&apos;t get it either. Interest rate reverseBBC News 24 had a scoop of sorts on Thursday&apos;s interest rate decision by the Bank of England, beating its rivals by a full six minutes. &quot;Interest rates up,&quot; revealed the news channel, only for the official announcement at midday that - oh dear - there would be no change. This is presumably what BBC head of TV News Peter Horrocks meant when he called for more exclusives in the wake of the corporation&apos;s disastrous night at the Royal Television Society journalism awards. Next year&apos;s channel of the year gong is surely already in the bag. Oh, mother-in-lawIcstis chairman Sir Alistair Graham, the man charged with getting TV&apos;s house back in order after the premium-rate phone scandal, has a personal interest in premium-rate phone competitions run by broadcasters: his mother-in-law once racked up a \u00a3190 phone bill ringing up a TV quiz channel. And no, she didn&apos;t win a prize. Sun seekersCongratulations to the Sun&apos;s deputy fashion editor Toni Jones, who is marrying snapper Dan Kennedy in Tuscany in June. We know this because an email arrives telling us they have just taken delivery of their &quot;ribbons-and-bows&quot; invitations from wedding stationery website specialdaydirect.co.uk. &quot;You may not be able to afford a lavish celebrity style wedding, but specialdaydirect.co.uk is fast becoming the website where those in the know choose their wedding stationery.

For further info on Special Day, please contact . . .&quot; Well, it&apos;s not Hello!, but it&apos;s a start. Head of S&amp;MReaders of last week&apos;s column may remember we asked why the BBC&apos;s &quot;director of audio and music&quot; Jenny Abramsky is not called something a bit less clunky, say, head of sound and music. A correspondent suggests: &quot;I can&apos;t imagine Abramsky being delighted with the title &apos;head of S&amp;M&apos;&quot;. No, probably not. Reporters anonymousThe Daily Telegraph has come up with an ingenious way of stopping the Daily Mail nicking its staff . In the space of just four pages last Thursday, Will Lewis&apos;s paper devoted four stories to &quot;Telegraph correspondents&quot; and two to &quot;Telegraph reporters&quot;. Mail editor Paul Dacre can&apos;t poach its journalists if he doesn&apos;t know who they are! The alternative - that the Telegraph was gobbling up agency copy in the absence of its own reporting staff - is too awful to contemplate. Sun slapThe Sun&apos;s royal snapper Arthur Edwards made front-page news with his revelation to a House of Commons committee that Prince William had spoken openly about his plans to marry Kate Middleton. But why did the story - splashed by the London Evening Standard on Tuesday - merit just two paragraphs on page seven of the next day&apos;s Sun? Monkey hears some of the paper&apos;s staff were left wondering why Edwards decided to tell MPs and not the Sun newsdesk. They didn&apos;t know whether to slap him on the back - or round the face. Barber shop duetNever let it be said that the Financial Times editor Lionel Barber does not treat all his staff equally. In his latest email update he singles out his brother Tony Barber for praise on no fewer than three separate occasions. &quot;Eye catching . . . well judged . . . outstanding.&quot; Good for Tony! It would be a shame if Lionel let their relationship inhibit praise where it was due.

The incident has outraged activists in Iran and elsewhere, but there is much more to it. On June 23, 2003, after months of heated debate, the then-reformist parliament in Iran passed a bill, in favor of signing a UN document that would abolish legal discrimination against women. It was a big day for the 14 female MPs, who had tirelessly pushed for the bill in the hope that it would be a serious start to a series of changes in Iranian legal system - and an attempt to repair the Islamic republic&apos;s terrible international image on human rights. But the law, to little surprise, was rejected by an ultra-conservative body (The Guardian Council) which has six top clerics and six lawyers and oversees parliament to make sure its decisions are not against the Iranian constitution or the core values of Islam. (Or their reading of those values.) They said the bill violated both Iran&apos;s sovereignty and Islamic law. The then-77 year-old secretary of the council, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, an infamous opponent of the reform movement at the time and a strong supporter of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad now, said it was his saddest day of his work on the council, according to an Iranian official. The rejection came after months of lobbying and protests (including street protests) by ultra-conservative clerics and their supporters who opposed the bill - despite a small minority of high-ranking clerics, such as Ayatollah Sane&apos;I, who supported the law and didn&apos;t find it un-Islamic. The unlucky bill has so far been passed between various legislative councils and bodies and its future is entirely unclear. Four years later, women&apos;s activists in Iran have tried alternative routes to abolish the discriminative laws against women, in areas such as employment, divorce, inheritance and custody rights, among others. Two different approaches have emerged: One approach believes that the best way to silence the conservative critics, who accuse the reform movement of being a Western import with an aim to undermine religious values, is to construct a broad and inclusive manifesto, from bottom up, by mostly Muslim Iranian women, based on the experiences of post-colonial feminists in Asia and Africa. The other approach is focuses around a campaign that wants to create local and international pressure on the Islamic republic by collecting one million signatures from ordinary Iranian women, and use that leverage to raise awareness of and abolish the discriminatory laws. While the former approach tries to work within the current social, political and juridical structure, the latter rejects the structure in the first place and, by using methods of organised, massive civil disobedience, tries to force the establishment to accept the changes. Both approaches have been more or less tolerated by the Islamic Republic in the past couple of years and, as a result of various conflicting opinions within the establishment, a neutral position has emerged in regards to the women&apos;s movement. But in the past few months, there have been some signs that the American &apos;pro-democracy&apos; project has developed an appetite for Iran&apos;s women&apos;s movement. And why not? What else can potentially mobilise half the population of a country against its government and possibly foment Ukranian or Georgian-style coloured revolution? A Dutch newspaper discovered last year that a controversial Dutch grant to promote &apos;pro-democracy&apos; media projects was awarded to an American organisation, Freedom House, to launch an online Persian-language magazine (Gozaar) to promote human rights and democracy. Immediately, Iranian authorities who were already suspicious of the Dutch government&apos;s intentions (they are the perhaps the only country other than the US that has publicly created a fund to promote democracy in Iran) started to closely watch the other projects aided by the 15 million Euro fund, which was mostly awarded to European-based Iranian exiles. They began to see the whole budget as a Dutch cover up for the American regime-change project. One other grant was awarded to an Iranian dissident to start a web magazine on Women&apos;s issues. But it emerged that the woman in charge of the web magazine, Shahrzad News, was an active member of what was once an armed opposition group that was outlawed and dismantled in the early years after the Iranian revolution. Shahrzad News developed close ties with some of the women&apos;s activists, mainly with those who favored the civil disobedience approach, and, in addition to having them write articles, it organised a workshop in Dubai to improve the journalistic skills of some women&apos;s activists. At the same time, the US State Department announced that it had created a special office in Dubai to gather intelligence on Iran and establish easier contact with Iranian dissidents. New York Times reported last December that US State Department has indirectly funded workshops on organising civil disobedience, hoping to foment massive revolts in Iran and overthrow the regime. A mix of paranoia and intelligence has, ever since, led the Iranian government to become extremely wary of the activities of the non-governmental organisations, especially those working on women&apos;s issues. Last month they prevented a group of women from attending a new workshop in India, organised by Shahrzad News, and detained three of them for a day. Based on the accounts later published by those activists, the well-behaved intelligence officers questioned them in detail about their financial ties with Shahrzad News and other possible foreign-funded organisations. And last week they detained over thirty female activists who had gathered in front of a court to protest the prosecution of a few other activists, who were charged with disrupting national security by participating in an street protest on Women&apos;s Day in Tehran. They have now all been released, except for two - Shadi Sadr and Mahboobeh Abbasgholizadeh. The Islamic republic has lost much of its tolerance. It&apos;s a sad story. On the one hand, foreign &apos;pro-democracy&apos; groups try to use women for their regime-change plans. On the other hand, the ultra-conservative factions in the Iranian establishment have found new justifications for painting the entire women&apos;s movement as a threat to the national security - which alienates the moderates within the establishment - and are pushing for a total crackdown on any sort of women&apos;s activism. The only thing that could save the women&apos;s movement from a further duress is to distance itself from foreign &apos;pro-democracy&apos; funding and abandon even peaceful street protests. Going back to lower-profile types of activism, engagement with moderate conservative officials (especially in the judiciary) and attempts to enter the local and national legislature are the most effective and least-costly options at the moment.", "tags": ["Iran", "Equality", "US news", "Gender", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Iran awakening?", "sentences": ["Shahrzad News developed close ties with some of the women&apos;s activists, mainly with those who favored the civil disobedience approach, and, in addition to having them write articles, it organised a workshop in Dubai to improve the journalistic skills of some women&apos;s activists.", "At the same time, the US State Department announced that it had created a special office in Dubai to gather intelligence on Iran and establish easier contact with Iranian dissidents."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/16/iranawakening", "publicationDate": "2007-03-16T23:00:00Z"}, {"article": "It was a Friday afternoon in June. The sky over Gaza was a broad wash of purple blue, and along the seafront the surf was breaking into small whitecaps. Ali Ghalia was on a day off from his work as a farmer and decided to take his family for lunch on the beach at Beit Lahiya, a few minutes&apos; drive from their home. The beach on the Mediterranean, with its rolling dunes and dry grasses, is a rare delight in a stretch of land ground down by poverty, overcrowding, militancy and decades of military occupation. It is free to the public and barely touched by development - just a few half-built hotels are dotted along the 25-mile coastline, the shadow of a tourist industry that never was. Ghalia had two wives, as is still sometimes the custom in the Palestinian territories, and both were with him on the beach that day, along with their dozen children and their beach kit: several plastic armchairs, plates of food and cooking pots, flasks of tea, plastic toys, blankets to sit on and a small cot for the baby. They ate lunch and lazed in the sunshine, and were still on the beach shortly after 4.30pm. Although it was a Friday afternoon, others in Gaza were still at work, among them Zakariah Abu Harbeed, 37, a cameraman with Ramattan, the leading Palestinian news agency. He is based at the agency&apos;s 10th-floor offices in Gaza City, ready to report breaking stories. Often in Gaza that means covering the conflict - dozens of times he has filmed the dead and the dying, and he has been shot at and wounded in the process. That Friday, Abu Harbeed had been to Beit Hanoun, a town close to the northern border of the strip, to film the scene of an Israeli attack on a group of suspected militants. On his way back, he ran into another story. The Israeli military had just destroyed a car that they also suspected was carrying militants. He filmed that scene, too, and went to the hospital to get footage of the injured. It was, for him, an ordinary day&apos;s work. It was shortly after 4.30pm. Then he took a call from a contact in the ambulance service: the Israeli military were shelling the beach at Beit Lahiya and there were casualties. He called his driver and they jumped into the car. That afternoon at the beach, Abu Harbeed shot about 10 minutes of film for which he later won two awards. He arrived just in time to record the aftermath of a terrible explosion that had killed most of the Ghalia family. Seven were dead: Ali Ghalia, 49, and one of his wives, Ra&apos;eesa, 35, together with five children: Haitham, five months old; Hanadi, 18 months; Sabreen, four; Ilham, 15; and Aliya, 17. Several others were injured, some severely, including more children from the family. Much of the film Abu Harbeed made that day is so graphic it would never be broadcast on television in the west. One clip, however, was broadcast repeatedly that day and in the days that followed. It showed Huda Ghalia, aged 12, distraught and sobbing by the body of her dead father. It was an image distilling Palestinian despair, one that recalled the film of Mohammad al-Dura, the 12-year-old boy who died in his father&apos;s arms in Gaza in a hail of gunfire six years ago, at the start of the intifada. Abu Harbeed talked me through the footage in a cramped video editing suite at the Ramattan offices. It begins as they drive up to the beach, the film shot from the passenger seat through a cracked windscreen with the blare of a siren in the background. There is one ambulance, its back door open, and half a dozen men shouting and panicked. Between them they uncover one limp body after another, dragging them out quickly and either placing them on a stretcher or running with them to the ambulance. They don&apos;t have time to notice that several of the bodies they are carrying are dead, the wounds horrific, impossible to survive. One of the men reaches for a girl, grabs her black clothes at the shoulder and places her on a green canvas stretcher. Her left arm has been blown off just above the elbow. She is pale, unconscious and looks dead, but in fact she survives. I learned later that her name is Amani. Somewhere among the bodies is her sister, Ayhaam. She, too, is badly injured but survives. As this was going on, Abu Harbeed just stood still and filmed. He is a professional just doing his job, and methodical. &quot;You can see I&apos;m not getting close to the bodies,&quot; he said, &quot;that&apos;s too much for the audience. I&apos;m getting the wide picture. But then I felt there was someone alive nearby, as if there was some life coming out of this death. Suddenly Huda imposed herself on this massacre.&quot; Huda is at the corner of the screen, watching the men remove the bodies. She stands still, her arms by her side. She is in a blue T-shirt, her black hair curled down to her shoulders. As the last body is removed, Huda turns around and starts to run, her hands reach forward, the fingers splayed. Abu Harbeed follows her with his camera. &quot;I couldn&apos;t tell where she was going. I just followed her.&quot; Huda reaches a dune, stops running and clasps her arms across her chest. She begins to scream: &quot;Oh father, oh father&quot;, and the screaming continues even as she throws herself into the sand. The camera pans back to show her lying next to the body of her father, Ali Ghalia, broad-shouldered with a grey moustache and lying on his back. His mouth and eyes are open, but he is dead, his pupils rolled up under his eyelids. Huda is still screaming. By now Abu Harbeed was quietly crying in the editing suite. After a minute he looked up. &quot;I don&apos;t like to see these pictures. They make me suffer,&quot; he said simply. &quot;I wanted people to see that this is a family that did nothing to anyone. There are no weapons, no military uniforms, just a picnic.&quot; Beit Lahiya is a poor neighbourhood in the far north of the Gaza Strip. Many of the householders used to work as labourers in Israel, but since a clampdown on permits for work that income has dried up. Most now make a living farming the fields that lie just to the north, between the town and the concrete wall and steel fence that marks the border with Israel. But Gaza&apos;s farming industry is also struggling, thanks to Israel&apos;s repeated closure of the major crossing points out of the strip. Those closures have so damaged farm exports that many no longer bother investing in the seeds to plant cash crops such as strawberries and cherry tomatoes in the first place. Israel says the closures are justified on grounds of security. In effect it means that poverty levels have risen (unemployment in Gaza is running at 40%, according to the UN) and many families, like the Ghalias, have run up credit at local grocery stores which they hope to pay off in the future. The Ghalia family house is unexceptional: a two-storey breeze block structure that looks at least partly homemade. It has a red-tin door, and next to it a spindly cactus that rises up to the height of the first floor and bows under the weight of the family washing line. Outside, there is a constant noise of children playing and the occasional donkey-drawn cart that passes by: the first has a boy with a loud-hailer advertising his tray of freshly caught fish; a few minutes later another cart goes by with baskets of live chickens. The family live on the ground floor, in a couple of empty rooms furnished only with mattresses and blankets that are rolled up and stacked against the wall each morning. Huda shares a bare bedroom with her two younger sisters, Hadeel, eight, and Latifa, seven. In the months after the explosion on the beach, I went to visit Huda and her family many times, to listen to the story of a household struck by a tragedy, a family that captured the headlines and then dropped from sight. I ate with them, went to school with them, drove with them to see relatives and visited their injured in hospital. The first time I met the Ghalias, they were sitting on plastic chairs in the sunshine outside the front door of the house. Ayham, 20, the oldest son, receives visitors. He is quiet and surly, and like most of the men in the family he smokes, though not in front of his mother or uncles. Since his father&apos;s death, he has become responsible for taking a lead in family decisions. He also works as a part-time guard at a local UN office and has begun a two-year secretarial diploma at the Islamic University in Gaza City. The university is affiliated to Hamas, the Islamic militant movement elected into power a year ago, and the course is to be paid for by Hamas: one of a small number of official contributions made to the family since what they call simply &quot;the incident&quot;. After a while, Huda appeared. She was barefoot and dressed in a black cloak with a white veil on her head. A gold bracelet hung from her wrist. She was quiet and monosyllabic: still visibly affected by what had happened. Huda and her two younger sisters have started at a new school, a Hamas-run girls&apos; school in Gaza City, their tuition another gift from Hamas. She said she preferred the new school. &quot;I have new friends now,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&apos;t see the old friends any more.&quot; She had just returned from a visit that she, her two sisters, her mother and her aunt made to the United Arab Emirates. &quot;It was fine,&quot; she said. It was her first time out of Gaza. Some weeks later, Huda produced a photo album of that trip. The visit the family described to me was part political and part medical. Huda&apos;s mother, Hamdiya, 41, who had been badly injured in the right hand, was treated in hospital, as were Latifa and Hadeel. The film of Huda on the beach turned her into such a symbolic figure that many Arab officials queued up to see her. One photograph shows Huda standing with her fingers in a V for victory salute, in front of a poster of Abbas and the late Yasser Arafat. Another shows her sitting on a sofa in a pink dress and wide-brimmed hat, talking to the deputy prime minister of the Emirates. But the pictures the children most enjoy show them incongruously dressed in red ski outfits and helmets, holding plastic sleds at a vast indoor ski centre in Dubai. In Gaza, Huda had already met Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas prime minister, and Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president. Both spoke of adopting her, as did other dignitaries she met. They meant that loosely - not taking her into their families to bring up as their own, but offering her moral and financial support. They were public gestures, singling out a girl suffering a private grief. On their return from the Emirates, Huda crossed back into Gaza through Israel with a special VIP pass. Her mother and the rest of the family had to cross from Egypt, through the Rafah crossing, which is frequently closed and always overcrowded. They had no special passes. With so much attention paid to the young girl, it is perhaps not surprising that the family began to feel a degree of frustration. For one thing, their neighbours presumed that this political attention, international travel and talk of adoption would translate into great financial wealth for the Ghalias. Hamas stepped forward to pay for the children&apos;s education, and a Qatari charity paid for the rebuilding of a house for Amani, the eldest daughter, married with two children, who lost most of her left arm in the incident. President Abbas provided around \u00a31,000 and there appears to be the promise of money from the Emirates to pay to rebuild the family house - although eight months on from the incident, no work has begun. But there has been no more than that. Only after some time did it become clear to the neighbourhood that the Ghalias were still living as precariously as everyone around them. Secondly, there was the extraordinary attention Huda received. Although she featured prominently in the footage shot on the beach, she was only lightly injured. The family was upset by the iconic status she had been given and angry that the others, who suffered much more serious physical wounds, had been overlooked. Huda&apos;s younger brother, Adham, 10, suffered serious shrapnel wounds to his stomach and mouth, and was eventually transferred to the US for treatment. He is still living there, looked after by a series of expatriate Palestinian families who ensure he receives the medical care he needs and that he is attending school. He calls home several times a week. Huda&apos;s two elder sisters, Amani and Ayhaam, who were the most seriously injured, have been in and out of hospital, and still have months of serious operations ahead of them. &quot;Huda was seen on television, that&apos;s all,&quot; said Hassan Ghalia. &quot;But it is not only Huda, believe me. She is the one who saw everything and was seen by the world, but other people lost so much and nobody saw them.&quot; Hassan, 33, is one of Huda&apos;s uncles, the thinner and younger brother of her dead father, Ali. Of the several uncles who live nearby and take care of the family, Hassan is perhaps the most mature. He, too, is a farmer, but can&apos;t afford to plant this year and has no other work. He is carefully spoken and always points out that though he blames the Israeli military for the explosion, he does not blame the Israeli people, with whom he hopes the Palestinians will one day find peace. He told me, &quot;The Palestinians firing rockets at Israel are doing it out of ideology. The Israeli military who fire at us are doing it out of ideology. And we are just crushed in the middle.&quot; In the months ahead, it was Hassan who volunteered to look after his niece, Ayhaam, accompanying her on the trips to hospital in Israel and taking care of her physiotherapy on her return. And after all, he said, this was not the first crisis to hit the family. A year and a half earlier, in January 2005, several of his nephews were involved in another, equally traumatic incident: seven children, all under the age of 18, were killed, and seven other people, including five more children, were severely injured when they were hit by Israeli tank shells. The children, most from the Ghaben family, were in farmland just north of Beit Lahiya, picking strawberries. Witnesses said militants had been firing mortars from the fields over the border into Israel that morning, but disappeared as the Israeli shelling began. The Israeli military said it targeted a group of masked men preparing to fire more mortars. Three of the children lost both their legs - including Issa Ghalia, now 15, who is a regular visitor to Huda&apos;s family. He was treated in Israel and later in Iran. He was fitted with a pair of prosthetic legs, but prefers not to use them and instead would swing through the gate, up the steps and on to a chair using his arms alone. &quot;The legs are good, but sometimes I just get tired of them,&quot; he said one day as he sat listening to the family&apos;s news. It is attacks such as these that have discouraged farmers in northern Gaza from going anywhere near their fields by the border. On a Saturday morning I went to Huda&apos;s new school, the Dar al-Arqam, which is large, clean and imposing. Three newly-painted buildings stand on three sides of a large concrete playground. It has been open since August 2003 and around 1,500 children, aged between five and 15, study here. Nearly all are girls, although there are temporarily a small number of boys, too, because their school was damaged in recent fighting. All the teachers are women. &quot;It is our kingdom,&quot; the deputy head, Eman Nassar, 34, told me. She took a degree in biochemistry at an Egyptian university and spent six years as a kindergarten teacher in Gaza before coming to the school. Around a third of the children are loosely termed &quot;orphans&quot;, meaning one or both of their parents have either died during the conflict or are among the 10,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Like Huda and her sisters, they do not pay school fees. In addition, any child in the fourth grade or above who scores more than 95% in their end of year exams is exempt from school fees, which range up to 320 Jordanian dinars (\u00a3240) a year. The school is openly affiliated to Hamas - although the teachers are at pains to insist that does not make them signed-up members of the movement - and there is a strong religious element to the teaching. Qur&apos;anic learning is a key part of the children&apos;s curriculum, as are Arabic, English, science, maths, geography and history, all taught from government textbooks. Almost all the girls wear a uniform of a black cloak and a white veil over their hair. At home I noticed Huda now almost always veiled her hair, though her hair was not veiled that day at the beach. &quot;We work for God, not for Hamas or Islamic Jihad or anyone else,&quot; said Nassar. &quot;We work for God and we want our children to be the best.&quot; The children themselves are not all from Hamas-supporting families - the Ghalias, for example, are almost wholly divorced from politics and show no particular loyalty to any of Gaza&apos;s political factions. Nassar said the goal of the school is to teach the children to think, not to prepare them for any set role as women or in politics. &quot;Everyone has to learn. But how you use that knowledge, that&apos;s what&apos;s important,&quot; she said. The teachers are all well-educated and the school is in far better condition than government schools in the area. The school day is longer, and the class sizes smaller. Huda, with her government school background, found herself well behind other girls of her age. Her English was particularly poor and she was extremely reluctant to speak up in class. It didn&apos;t help that she was teased a lot by the other children, and even now in between classes she plays with her sisters more than her classmates. &quot;The other children would run after her saying, &apos;Huda Ghalia, Huda Ghalia&apos;, and, &apos;Oh father, oh father&apos;, just like they&apos;d seen on television,&quot; said her teacher, Nadia Shurafa, 25. &quot;Her response was to be shy and not talk to anyone. She tried to forget about what happened, but no one lets her forget. She just wants to be normal.&quot; The conflict in Gaza has such a huge impact on all the children&apos;s lives that the school does its own psychological work. There are several others like Huda who have seen members of their families killed in front of them. Sometimes it is a matter of stepping in to prevent fighting in the playground. &quot;They fight very easily,&quot; said Nassar. &quot;They form themselves into different militia groups and act out what they&apos;ve seen. Or they play &apos;I&apos;m a Jew, you&apos;re a Palestinian&apos;. You have to keep your eyes on them and try to get them to talk about what they feel. And sometimes you just have to accept what they do.&quot; One teacher, Asma&apos;a Obaid, 24, runs one-on-one sessions for the most traumatised children, including Huda. She encourages them to talk through their experiences and to draw scenes from the incidents they have been through. Obaid flicked through some of the most recent paintings on her desk. They show pictures of dead children, helicopters firing missiles into buildings and key events in recent Gazan history, including the killing of the Hamas spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. &quot;Sometimes the children say they want to kill the person who killed their father, or brother, or whoever it was,&quot; Obaid said. &quot;We tell them it&apos;s better to educate themselves.&quot; She often asks the children to draw a happier picture than the violence all around them ,and she produced one painting drawn by Huda that showed a large, multicoloured house next to a row of trees, with flowers and seven people in the garden and a smiling sun in the sky. &quot;A specialist psychologist visited the school and saw this and said this represents where Huda wants to be, this place of stability and sunshine,&quot; Obaid said. Huda&apos;s days are spent at school, or playing with brothers, sisters and cousins at home or the house of one of two uncles, Hassan and Yahya, who both live across the street. Every few weeks she is driven down to the south, to a house in the sand dunes near Khan Yunis, to see the woman she knows as her grandmother, who for 20 years has acted as a spiritual healer. I went with her once and watched as the old woman talked to Huda, reading to her from the Qur&apos;an and feeding her a sweet-smelling juice made of amber and musk, a potion rumoured to have special remedial properties. &quot;This helps to push out the fear,&quot; said the 70-year-old woman, Um Khalid, the mother of Ali Ghalia&apos;s second wife, Ra&apos;eesa, who was Huda&apos;s stepmother and who was also killed in the beach explosion. &quot;Thanks to God and this liquid, everyone gets better. I have a connection with God, you see. I just make the treatment and it all comes out of her. She calms down and she has really improved over time. They will forget eventually.&quot; One afternoon, Huda was standing on the roof terrace of her family house in Beit Lahiya, picking passion fruit off a vine with her mother and younger sisters. The terrace looks over the back garden, which is small but full of trees: figs, oranges, lemon, a date palm and a banana tree that needs cutting back. It was several months after the incident on the beach and Huda was slowly beginning to open up. She was still shy, but less withdrawn than when I first met her. We talked about the new school, which she seemed to prefer. She talked about perhaps being a lawyer in future - this is what Sheikh Hamdan, the deputy prime minister in the Emirates, had suggested: &quot;Become a lawyer, defend your rights.&quot; She talked about the television - the footage of her still reappears occasionally on the Arabic news channels. &quot;We don&apos;t have a television and I won&apos;t go to any house that does have a television,&quot; she said. Her teachers say she is too frightened to look at any photographs of herself. &quot;I remember that day and what happened,&quot; Huda said. &quot;I can&apos;t forget it and sometimes I dream of it. I am trying to forget, but I can&apos;t.&quot; As is often the case in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the cause of the explosion that afternoon on the beach is much disputed. The Ghalia family and others hold the Israeli military responsible for the blast, saying an artillery shell hit the family. The Israeli military had fired thousands of shells into Gaza in the preceding weeks, aimed at preventing Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli towns, and admitted firing a number of shells from the sea and the land on that Friday. But the Israel Defence Force denied responsibility at the time and, in a written response for this article, said the explosion that killed the Ghalias was &quot;without a doubt, not caused by the IDF&quot;. This conclusion was based on &quot;intelligence analysis, Palestinian claims, media coverage of the incident and IDF filmed footage that documented all IDF activity during that day&quot;. It admitted the Israeli military had fired six artillery shells: the IDF could account for where five of those shells landed, but not the first shell, which it said was fired at 4.30pm. &quot;The possibility that this shell landed in the area of the incident is close to zero,&quot; it said. The IDF concluded, based on clips of video footage, that the blast happened some minutes later and not before 4.57pm. The IDF also said that two pieces of shrapnel taken from two of the people injured at the scene did not come from 155mm IDF artillery shells. In its written response, the IDF offered no other possible cause for the blast, though in the days after the incident it suggested there had been a coincidental separate explosion on the beach at that time in the afternoon, caused either by a buried old shell or a mine planted by Hamas. Several human rights groups and press reports at the time raised points of difference with the IDF account. In particular, a detailed article by the Guardian&apos;s Chris McGreal on June 17 showed that the timings noted in hospital records, and by a doctor and an ambulance driver, indicated that the blast happened some minutes earlier than the IDF maintains - so challenging the IDF&apos;s central claim that its shelling had stopped by the time the Ghalias were killed. The article also cited a former Pentagon battlefield analyst working for Human Rights Watch who believed that the crater size, shrapnel, types of injuries and their location on the victims&apos; bodies (particularly to the head and torso) pointed to a shell dropping from the sky, not explosives under the sand. Witnesses spoke of hearing other blasts at the time, consistent with a pattern of shells falling at the beach. It happens quite frequently that severely ill or injured patients in Gaza who cannot get adequate treatment in the strip&apos;s hospitals are allowed to cross into Israel. And so it was with Huda&apos;s two elder sisters, Amani and Ayhaam: shortly after the incident, both were taken to hospitals in Israel. Amani, 23, whose left arm had to be amputated above the elbow, was taken to hospital in Be&apos;er Sheva and travels back and forth from Gaza on a regular basis. Ayhaam, 17, suffered severe injuries to her shoulders, chest, throat and legs, and for many months was confined to a wheelchair. Of all those on the beach that day, she was perhaps the worst injured. Six months after the incident, Ayhaam was back in hospital in Israel, sitting on a metal-framed chair in a third-floor room at the Assaf Harofeh Medical Centre, near Ramla. With her was her uncle Hassan, who spent every day and every night in the ward at his niece&apos;s bedside. It was his first time in Israel since 1993. He spoke little Hebrew, the doctors spoke little Arabic, but he could talk to the cleaners, most of whom were Arab Israelis. He found many of the Jewish families in the hospital welcoming. &quot;It&apos;s more human than political,&quot; he said as we sat together in the ward. &quot;Most people we&apos;ve met are compassionate. Their reaction is: &apos;We suffer in the same way you suffer.&apos;&quot; It was Ayhaam&apos;s third time at this hospital, and when she had arrived about two weeks earlier, the doctors had been deeply concerned and advised an urgent operation. The problem was with her windpipe, which had narrowed so much that she was having difficulty breathing. It wasn&apos;t clear to the doctors whether the narrowing was caused by a shrapnel injury, or was the result of a long intubation in another hospital, or whether a small opening in the windpipe had become infected. Whichever, Dr Ilan Bar, one of Israel&apos;s leading cardio-thoracic surgeons, concluded that he needed to cut away the narrowed section of the trachea and then reconnect the remaining ends. In a small office off the wards, Bar opened his textbook to show me the procedure. &quot;You pray to God that it doesn&apos;t disrupt,&quot; he said. &quot;It is very rare and very risky.&quot; For the first few hours after the operation, it appeared to have been successful. Then, when Bar was out at a Saturday night football match at his Tel Aviv local club, he was called back to the hospital: Ayhaam&apos;s condition had seriously deteriorated. &quot;That Saturday night the doctor told me there wasn&apos;t anything more they could do,&quot; Hassan said. &quot;We were just waiting for her to die.&quot; But by the Sunday morning Ayhaam had recovered. &quot;For now I can say the procedural technique was successful,&quot; said Bar. &quot;Now I want to take care of all the other problems she has, like walking and movement, clearing her lungs, healing her bladder. Our procedure was life-saving; now let&apos;s deal with the other problems that can make her life whole.&quot; On the Tuesday after her operation, Ayhaam was sitting up, alert, in her room. Her feet, sunk in a pair of pink slippers, had been gently taped to a simple pedal machine to begin the first stages of physiotherapy. Bar, on his morning rounds, seemed pleased with her condition. &quot;Today for the first time I saw her smiling,&quot; he said. &quot;Before, she used to just lie on the bed like a sack of potatoes.&quot; I asked him about the politics of the case, but he was dismissive. It was not the first time he has treated Palestinian patients: seriously injured children are quite often sent to his hospital and he has once visited Gaza to meet doctors there. Two weeks later, Hassan and Ayhaam travelled back to Gaza by ambulance. The driver stopped at a hospital in Be&apos;er Sheva to pick up another Palestinian patient, an elderly women in the final stages of cancer who was heading back to Gaza to die at her family&apos;s side. But the woman was sicker than the doctors had thought and she died in the ambulance. The driver had no choice but to carry on his journey. They passed quickly through the Erez crossing into northern Gaza. At that point, Hassan noticed, the driver suddenly speeded up and took a corner too quickly. The ambulance lurched over and toppled on to its side, throwing Hassan, Ayhaam and the dead woman on top of each other across the vehicle. The pair were bruised but not badly hurt, and as he told the story later, Hassan shrugged as if this sort of bad fortune was something they had come to expect. The last time I saw them, Ayhaam was sitting on the porch of Hassan&apos;s house, warming herself in the afternoon sun. Most of the rest of the family were around her, apart from Adham, who was still in the US. Huda, who had just finished her end-of-term exams, was there, along with her younger sisters and her mother, as well as Amani, back briefly from hospital in Israel and soon to be fitted with a prosthetic arm. Her husband and their two children were with her. The family were laughing among themselves, and it was the first time I had seen them like this. They were happy to have the two elder girls home, and celebrating the news that another of Huda&apos;s uncles, Yahya, 38, had finally got himself a job working as a gardener for the municipal authority. It was to pay him just 1,000 shekels a month, but this was the first time he&apos;d had work for many months. Yahya, who is always quick to make light of their lives, joked that he was so important at work, he&apos;d soon be able to supply bags of flour and food for the family. &quot;Ask God not to fire him,&quot; said Hassan, feigning a look of despair. He talked about Ayhaam and her slow recovery, and finding suitable medical care for her in Gaza, which has now become his main responsibility. As the family chatted, there was no mention of the day on the beach last summer. I asked Hassan what he felt now about that day. &quot;Eight months have gone by and nothing has changed,&quot; he said. &quot;I know life goes on, but the scars are still deep.&quot; Ayhaam was soon to start physiotherapy, and to demonstrate her recovery she took a dozen uncertain and uncomfortable steps across the courtyard, supported by Hassan. Huda walked alongside, holding Ayhaam by her fingertips.", "tags": ["World news", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "Life and style"], "title": "'I try to forget - but i can't'", "sentences": ["But the pictures the children most enjoy show them incongruously dressed in red ski outfits and helmets, holding plastic sleds at a vast indoor ski centre in Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/17/israelandthepalestinians.rorymccarthy", "publicationDate": "2007-03-17T00:07:00Z"}, {"article": "Preamble I&apos;ll begin with the big news. England have dropped Andrew Flintoff after he was, allegedly, rescued from a capsized pedalo at 4am on Saturday, not long after the defeat to New Zealand. It&apos;s a disciplinary matter, and Flintoff is currently back at the team hotel, where he will be hoping this weekend of World cup shocks does not continue today with a win for Canada. The less big news is that Canada have won the toss and asked England to bat. Michael Vaughan, it is fair to say, did not look a happy chappie at the toss. Post-preamble Well, I was going to start with a cheap gag about whether Canada could buck the trend of the big sides losing to the minnows by seeing off the plucky English, but the Flintoff news rather changed my plans. Four other players - Ian Bell, Jimmy Anderson, Liam Plunkett and Jon Lewis - were in trouble after staying out too late as well, but we&apos;ll know more about their fates later. But for England to drop their star all-rounder just one game into a tournament they have - in theory at least - been building for since 2003, well, it&apos;s simply incredible. We all thought we were going to doze off during the opening fortnight of this competition. Instead it&apos;s been so amazing that non-cricket-lover Barry Glendenning woke me up last night to check whether Ireland really had beaten Pakistan (he was on the phone, rather than next to me in bed). 1st over: England 4-0 (Joyce 1, Vaughan 0) Apologies for the lack of preamble. The Flintoff story has caught the one-man OBO team off guard and we&apos;ve been busy doing all kind of tedious website housekeeping that I won&apos;t bore you with. Anyway, it all gets under way with a hideous leg-side wide by Anderson Cummins, who then generously give Ed Joyce his first World Cup run with a leg-stump half-volley. Cummins, the former Windies international, follows up with two looping off-side wides to Vaughan, who still looks furious beneath his helmet. And then Cummins beats him with a beauty to improve his mood. A curate&apos;s egg of an opening over, but at least none of it ended up on English faces. Gary Naylor, predictably, is first to offer his views on the Flintoff affair. &quot;Doesn&apos;t the sanctimonious tone taken by Willis and Co make you want to vomit?&quot; he asks rhetorically. &quot;Sure he did the wrong thing - but cricket offers too much time and hence too many opportunities for high jinx for this never to happen. So it has happened and he is out of a &quot;must win&quot; game. Failure of management. Again.&quot; 2nd over: England 7-0 (Joyce 2, Vaughan 2) Joyce runs the left-arm seamer Umar Bhatti to third man for a single, before Vaughan is beaten twice outside off-stump. Vaughan responds by using his feet to get down the track and picks up to backward square-leg. Australia are also playing today, incidentally. They continue their tricky start to the competition with a game against the Netherlands in St Kitts. &quot;In a moment of inspiration I ended up buying tickets for what I thought would be the India v Pakistan Super Eight game,&quot; says Sriharsha Pappu. &quot;I am wondering now if there are any takers for Ireland v Bangladesh!&quot; But it could be a cracker, Sriharsha ... 3rd over: England 17-0 (Joyce 6, Vaughan 2) Cummins drifts onto Joyce&apos;s pads and that&apos;s four through midwicket. What will England need here to be confident of avoiding a Bangladesh/Ireland-style upset? I reckon 250 would put them out of sight, although there&apos;s always the John Davison factor: he hit a hundred against West Indies four years ago off something like 67 balls. Cummins helps matters with successive no-balls, before the keeper Ashish Bagai lets through four byes off the last ball of the over. Bonus! And here&apos;s Archi Campbell: &quot;Surely Freddie&apos;s antics were just an avant-garde metaphor for the sinking ship that is the English cricket team, and he was just trying to express his frustrations at being restricted within such an uncultured and incompetent group of dullards?&quot; It&apos;s the other obvious reading, Archi. 4th over: England 21-0 (Joyce 9, Vaughan 3) Vaughan pushes a single to mid-off off Bhatti, who then beats Joyce outside off. This is a big innings for Joyce. He&apos;s yet to reach double-figures in three innings out here and there is a plausible movement to bring back Andrew Strauss in his place. But there&apos;s a rare three, thanks to an easy push through the covers. &quot;According to Ian Botham, Flintoff&apos;s only mistake was to get caught,&quot; says Rachel Clifton, who, like me, must be watching Sky. &quot;Heartening to know that he doesn&apos;t think being completely pissed the day before a game is any problem at all. But exactly how much must Flintoff have cheesed off Fletcher for them to drop him? Or is it only because it is Canada they have taken that step?&quot; A bit of both, I guess. 5th over: England 31-0 (Joyce 17, Vaughan 3) Anderson is struggling with his run-up and produces another wide to take extras into double-figures. Is it too obvious to say that Canada can ill-afford such generosity? OK, it is. So I won&apos;t say it. There&apos;s another wide, this time down the off-side to Joyce. It&apos;s very windy out there, but this is poor from Canada&apos;s most experienced bowler, even if Cummins is 73. That would have been wide too if Joyce hadn&apos;t got a toe-end on it and sent it through the covers for four. The next ball is a carbon copy. A decent, if not frightening, start by England. &quot;John Morris and David Gower fly over Queensland in a Tiger Moth, Fat Freddie falls off a pedalo ... oh for the days when breaking team discipline had some style,&quot; weeps Neil McLean in Dubai. &quot;Still on a plus side the old English ethos of playing the game being more important than the winning would appear to be alive and well among the bowling department ...&quot; 6th over: England 39-0 (Joyce 17, Vaughan 11) Vaughan edges Bhatti just in front of slip, then times him off his pads through midwicket for four, elegant runs. He follows that with a sumptuous straight-drive for four more and England are beginning to motor. &quot;A failure of management?&quot; scoffs James Matthews. &quot;A failure by the players surely? As professional sportsmen representing their country (or one close by, in Joce&apos;s case) have a responsibility to look after their bodies and try to maintain their peak physical condition. Freddie has been in good form with the ball in hand, but hasn&apos;t produced much with the bat in almost a year. Perhaps this will be the wake-up call he needs. As a footnote, could the Sky interview with Atherton, Hussain and Botham been any more predictable? &apos;Botham approves of cutting loose shock&apos;.&quot; 7th over: England 46-0 (Joyce 23, Vaughan 11) Cummins is fuming. Not only does he bowl another leg-side wide, but he then watches in disgust as a Joyce cover-drive is turned into a boundary by a miserable effort on the fence by the 40-year-old George Codrington. &quot;I have to totally disagree with the &apos;esteemed&apos; Mr Naylor,&quot; says the &quot;sarcastic&quot; Ben Hendy. &quot;I think it shows exactly the right message to all the players - complacency about their places shouldn&apos;t be expected, no matter who they are. This is, after all, a game we will win - Canada are no Ireland in the cricketing stakes - so the loss of Flintoff won&apos;t be a big one. It&apos;ll give Bopara an opportunity, thus putting a little pressure on Dalrymple - the man he&apos;s competing with for a place. All in all, I think it&apos;s an excellent move, and for which we should be congratulating Flintoff for engineering!&quot; 8th over: England 47-0 (Joyce 23, Vaughan 12) Another thought on the Flintoff incident. Not long ago he was holding aloft the Commonwealth Bank Trophy. He was the England captain. Now he has been disciplined by, among others, the man who replaced him. Humiliation upon humiliation. A good over from Bhatti: one off it. &quot;Just wondering how Rob Smyth is feeling about Naved ul Rana&apos;s chances of taking any more wickets this World Cup,&quot; asks Sriharsha Pappu, a little cruelly. 9th over: England 54-0 (Joyce 23, Vaughan 17) Cracking shot from Vaughan, who rocks back to hammer a Cummins long-hop through point for four. Candy and babies spring to mind, but Vaughan&apos;s one-day record makes him a beggar rather than a chooser. I&apos;ll stop mixing my metaphors now. Cummins charges in for the last ball of the over, then delivers a no-ball. And then a wide. Dear, oh dear. &quot;He ought to have been given a bonus for reurning to the Freddie antics of old rather then the laboured dinosaur that has been taking to the field of late,&quot; says Tom van der Gucht. &quot;I predict him to bounce back, be top wicket taker/run scorer and lead England to their first World Cup. Either that or be made to check into AA.&quot; 10th over: England 55-0 (Joyce 23, Vaughan 18) Bhatti has been comfortably the more impressive opening bowler. Anderson has given away three no-balls and seven wides to Bhatti&apos;s none and none. Meanwhile, Beefy tries to take an interest in the demographics of Canadian cricket, but it isn&apos;t convincing. Vaughan prevents a maiden with a push to midwicket. Over in St Kitts, Australia are 69 for 0 after 11 against the Netherlands. &quot;I can hardly bring myself to type these words,&quot; sobs Clare Davies, &quot;but I think Naylor is wrong! There may be too much time for the boys in between matches, but they are PROFESSIONALS and knew before hand what this WC schedule was. If they had to get a**eholed, could they not have had some horrible male-bonding piss-up in their hotel rooms - with karoake?&quot; I love the withering &quot;with karaoke&quot;. As if that puts the seal on the hellish scenario. 11th over: England 59-0 (Joyce 23, Vaughan 22) John Davison&apos;s off-spin replaces the errant seam-up of Cummins, but Vaughan simply eases his second ball off the back foot through midwicket for four: a lovely shot. Now can Vaughan finally put together a decent one-day innings, rather than play sweetly for 27 before slapping a full-toss to short extra? Experience tells me to harbour doubts. 12th over: England 62-0 (Joyce 26, Vaughan 22) Matthew Hayden is out for 29 in St Kitts, caught Borren, bowled de Leede. In other good news, Joyce drives Bhatti through the covers for three. But that was another good over from the steady Bhatti, left arm and 70mph. 13th over: England 62-0 (Joyce 26, Vaughan 22) Davison goes round the wicket to deliver his offies to Joyce. It&apos;s a slowish pitch, which is no great surprise, so taking the pace off the ball so early in the England innings is not a bad shout, even if the decision had as much to do with Anderson&apos;s ineptitude as anything else. A maiden. &quot;Tumbling into the open sea in the middle of the night must have sobered Freddie up,&quot; points out Gary Naylor. &quot;Bad fright stops play?&quot; Enough already. 14th over: England 72-0 (Joyce 27, Vaughan 31) Vaughan ends the sequence of dot balls by pushing Bhatti to mid-off&apos;s right for a single, before Joyce drives for one to deep cover. These two are just in danger of hibernating here. If England are to fight off criticism of the slowness of their top three, they&apos;ll need to score at more than four-and-a-bit an over against this lot. As if to shut me up, Vaughan goes up and over deep midwicket for a one-bounce four. And then caresses the next ball down the ground. I take it all back. Every word of it. 15th over: England 75-0 (Joyce 29, Vaughan 32) Joyce sweeps for a single, Vaughan repeats the dose and it&apos;s all very tranquil out there. Until Joyce dances down the track and tries to launch Davison into the Caribbean. He doesn&apos;t get hold of it and the ball dribbles lamely to midwicket. &quot;The Art of Management is getting the most out of the resources at your disposal,&quot; retorts Gary Naylor. &quot;While Flintoff deserves some punishment, my point is that Fletcher and co knew this was coming and were not able to avoid Flintoff missing a must win game (give Canada some respect!) If you want to see how to really shaft your chances of winning cricket matches, I refer you to the Fletcher-led preparation for the Ashes Series.&quot; 16th over: England 77-0 (Joyce 30, Vaughan 33) Canada take the third powerplay immediately and replace Bhatti (7-0-30-0) with Abdool Samad, who bowls brisk off-breaks, or is it slow medium-pacers? I can&apos;t quite tell. Either way, he shouldn&apos;t trouble Vaughan and co. Oh, and he almost bowls off the wrong foot as well. It&apos;s the kind of action you&apos;d snigger at if you saw it on the village green. Having said ALL that, Samad concedes only two runs off his first over. &quot;The words &apos;England&apos;, &apos;fine&apos; and &apos;players&apos; seem to be used far more often for off-the-field antics rather than on-the-pitch performance,&quot; says Ed &quot;Hewlett&quot; Packard. 17th over: England 82-0 (Joyce 30, Vaughan 37) A quiet over from Davison: five off it, including a wide. &quot;Botham saying &quot;we can&apos;t criticise Flintoff when we condoned his binging after the 2005 Ashes&quot; is utter rubbish,&quot; says Stephen Smith. &quot;He wasn&apos;t captain then, and when he was captain during the winter there were rumours flying all over Melbourne and Sydney that the drinking culture Hussein and Vaughan had calmed down was returning under Flintoff&apos;s watch. Now he&apos;s been captain, Flintoff should know better. Well done to the management.&quot; 18th over: England 85-0 (Joyce 31, Vaughan 38) Joyce survives a half-chance to Desmond Chumney (aged 39) as he drives uppishly at Samad. Chumney dived forward and to his right in the covers but couldn&apos;t hang on. Canada&apos;s heads drop even further and Joyce&apos;s career stops flashing before his eyes. He is not looking convincing, somthing he&apos;ll be able to discuss with Vaughan over the drinks. 19th over: England 95-0 (Joyce 40, Vaughan 39) George Codrington enters the attack, still flushed with confidence after his creaking efforts on the boundary earlier in the day. He bowls very gentle off-breaks - so gentle that Joyce assesses him for two balls, then launches his third straight down the ground for a breeze-assisted six. The next ball is driven through the covers for three. Ten off the over and this game is finished as a contest already. WICKET! Vaughan c Davison b Samad 45 (101-1) Classic Vaughan. He plays nicely for a few runs, then squirts a square-drive to backward point. That, in a nutshell, is why he averages 27 in nearly 80 ODIs. 21st over: England 106-1 (Joyce 43, Bell 2) Over in St Kitts Bas Zuiderent has just done a Herschelle Gibbs. He leapt high at midwicket to parry a pull from Ricky Ponting, then caught the rebound. But in his eagerness to celebrate what would have been a fantastic moment for the Dutch, Zuiderent grassed it. Ponting&apos;s sledge can only be guessed at, but it won&apos;t have involved dropping the World Cup. That partnership between Vaughan and Joyce, by the way, was England&apos;s first century stand in ODIs since Jamshedpur in April. It&apos;s been too long. Now, can Ian Bell take the chance to bat for 30 overs and score his maiden one-day hundred? Or am I jumping the gun? Five off Codrington&apos;s over. 22nd over: England 107-1 (Joyce 44, Bell 2) Gilchrist and Ponting have fallen in the space of three balls in St Kitts, where Bas Zuiderent can breathe again. Back in the thick of the action and Canada have turned to the left-arm spin of Sunil Dhaniram. It&apos;s a tidy first over - a single to Joyce to backward square, followed by circumspection from Bell. &quot;What a load of tosh (imho)!&quot; says Tom Lonnen in response to Gary Naylor. &quot;Blame for these kind of antics should rest squarely on the shoulders of the players. They&apos;re grown men, not babies and should know better - especially at a World Cup! Fletch and Co can&apos;t mollycoddle them all the time. It would take a seriously good manager with help from a crystal ball to foresee your star player falling off a pedalo into the sea at 4am!&quot; 23rd over: England 109-1 (Joyce 45, Bell 3) Davison replaces Codrington as England continue to consolidate after the senseless demise of Vaughan. It&apos;s an all-slow attack at the moment, which tends to be when England struggle most. If they can&apos;t milk this lot, they might as well kiss goodbye to a semi-final place. &quot;Botham mentioning Ashes 05 was bizarre,&quot; agrees Craig Easterbrook. &quot;Freddie can go on a week-long bender if we win the World Cup, but not 24 hours before a World Cup match after a woeful defeat. Shredded Wheat may be good for the heart, but clearly the brain doesn&apos;t see any benefits.&quot; 24th over: England 114-1 (Joyce 46, Bell 7) England are playing the spinners with their customary pokes and prods until Bell sweeps fine for three. Even so, only five off Dhaniram&apos;s over. &quot;Is Flintoff&apos;s 4am rescue from a capsized pedalo the most bizzare instance of a player getting caught in the nets?&quot; wonders Tom Williams. 25th over: England 119-1 (Joyce 49, Bell 9) Joyce inside-edges a big drive off Davison but the ball stays low and cannons off the keeper&apos;s right thigh. It wasn&apos;t much of a shot, and the less said about the keeping the better. In fact, high-class cricket all round, as Bell drives for one to wide long-on. A lofted Joyce cover-drive for two completes the over. 26th over: England 122-1 (Joyce 50, Bell 11) Bell plays out three dot balls against Dhaniram, then turns the fourth to midwicket for a single. I just wish they showed more urgency. If - and it&apos;s a massive if - they lose to Kenya, run-rate should come into play. But that&apos;s a long way away: in the meantime, Joyce has a half-century, from 74 balls. It&apos;s not been eye-catching, but he needed that. &quot;We need puns,&quot; says Michael Anderson, paving the way for one of his own. &quot;Often the best way to get from the 20th to the 30th over in an England ODI innings without biting your fingers off in boredom. My fantasy team name: superkallisgoesballisticKPbatsferocious. Anything better?&quot; 27th over: England 126-1 (Joyce 51, Bell 14) Back comes Codrington, who, as they say, isn&apos;t getting any younger. Bell pushes him for two through midwicket, then cuts for a single. I&apos;m still not convinced by Joyce. His CB Series hundred needed three drops and he tends to get out tamely. Strauss must be - very politely, of course - fuming. &quot;If, God forbid, Vaughan&apos;s knee, hamstring etc gives away again who will be captain?&quot; wonders, like many of you, Phil Rhodes. &quot;Would Freddie now be captain if Vaughan got injured? With Strauss out of favour who would be captain? Collingwood?&quot; It&apos;s a fair question. My guess would be Collingwood, yes. 28th over: England 130-1 (Joyce 53, Bell 16) Well, it&apos;s not exactly gripping, but England are doing more or less what they have to: build a total and then - to use Vaughan&apos;s favourite phrase - apply the pressure. Joyce sweeps Dhaniram for a single, Bell cuts for another, and Joyce chips over midwicket for one more. That sums up the progress of this innings. Still, it&apos;s better than an Ireland-style cliffhanger. &quot;Today is the day for my Bell Boy,&quot; says Clare Davies, lowering the tone as ever. &quot;If he fails, then I will never make another prediction about a player in my life, ever. And my record in this tournament is not great. I had Afridi as a star performer, and fell for the old Rana Naved success line. Bell&apos;s now my hope of respectability.&quot; I think that ship sailed a long time ago, Clare. 29th over: England 136-1 (Joyce 54, Bell 21) Bell shows some intent at least by launching Codrington flat over mid-off for four, skimming runs. Vaughan must be kicking himself. These were his runs. But after 76 one-day innings, he has yet to make a hundred for England. One of these two surely must instead. &quot;It strikes me that one point overlooked in the current debate about Flintoff is where he managed to get a pedalo at that time in the morning,&quot; says Gordon Lynch. &quot;Most boating lakes in the UK have a strict closing time of around 5.30pm. Does this give us an insight into more casual regulations about access to pedalos in the Caribbean, or do Flintoff procure his pedalo illegally therefore ensuring disciplinary action was inevitable?&quot; 30th over: England 139-1 (Joyce 56, Bell 22) Joyce reverse-sweeps Dhaniram, but it&apos;s straight to short third man. A more conventional sweep the ball after brings a single. This is all rather underwhelming. &quot;Was Freddie&apos;s Friday the first instance of following a duck with a ducking?&quot; wonders the ever-inventive Gary Naylor. 31st over: England 143-1 (Joyce 58, Bell 24) Canada are determined not to give England&apos;s batsmen any pace to work with, so Davison continues the all-spin attack and is milked unthrillingly for four singles. &quot;Please come to your senses everybody!&quot; says David Keech, sounding like a posh version of one Harry Enfield&apos;s Scousers. &quot;Vaughan should be allowed to play out this world cup and then quietly retire. At that point Strauss should be appointed permanent captain. He is out of form partly due to a run of bad luck in the Ashes series but - as the age old saying goings - form is transient, class is permanent. And Strauss has class.&quot; 32nd over: England 149-1 (Joyce 61, Bell 27) In St Kitts, Australia are 163 for 3 after 30 overs as Joyce pushes Dhaniram down the ground for one and Bell follows suit. And - what&apos;s this! - a slow hand-clap from the crowd! England are being goaded by what looks like their own supporters. But that&apos;s six singles off the over and six an over from here makes nearly 260, which should be more than enough. &quot;Stupid-fletcher-fragile-wickets-Freddie-bats-atrocious,&quot; says Robert James. 33rd over: England 152-1 (Joyce 63, Bell 28) &quot;I don&apos;t know what all the fuss is about,&quot; says Botham, who resumes his place in the commentary box with a grumble. I should point out, by the way, that England ought to be looking at more than 260. I&apos;d say 280 minimum, even without Flintoff to come. But that was a better over from Davison: three off it. WICKET! Bell c Codrington b Dhaniram 28 (153-2) Bell gives it away \u00e0 la Vaughan. He attempts to slog-sweep Dhaniram for six, but gets a huge top edge and Codrington staggers into view to take the catch where slip would have been. Bell looks furious and well he might. All that hard work for very little. Still, at least it brings Pietersen to the crease. 34th over: England 159-2 (Joyce 65, Pietersen 5) KP gets off the mark with a very iffy four, going down the crease to Dhaniram and lifting him not too far over mid-off. &quot;Hearts-in-mouths stuff,&quot; enthuses Ian Smith in the commentary box. &quot;England&apos;s performance is so yawntastically lacklustre that I&apos;m practically dropping off over my laptop,&quot; complains Ruth Connelly, writing before the advent of Pietersen. &quot;I&apos;m half hoping that Canada cause another Ireland-style upset and knock us out in Round 1 cause frankly I can&apos;t cope with any more games like this ...&quot; 35th over: England 160-2 (Joyce 66, Pietersen 5) Davison keeps Joyce quiet, which in his present mood might not be the most difficult thing in the world. Then he sweeps the last ball of the over for a single to keep KP off strike. Great. &quot;A pedalo?!?!&quot; says Tom Lonnen, catching up with the day&apos;s events. &quot;I mean, how ridiculous is that ...? They were cool when your folks let you have one all to yourself during your family hols to Lanzarote ... But this man&apos;s a superstar, surely he should be falling off the back of a speedboat or at the very least a jet-ski?&quot; WICKET! Joyce b Dhaniram 66 (160-3) For goodness sake. Joyce tries to reverse-sweep the first ball of Dhaniram&apos;s new over and is bowled. Still not convinced by Joyce, I&apos;m afraid. And that was a pretty bone-headed shot. WICKET! Pietersen c and b Dhaniram 5 (161-4) They&apos;re doing it again! Another middle-order collapse as Pietersen pokes at one that Dhaniram holds back and provides the simplest of return catches. Dhaniram celebrates by performing the dead ant: on his back, waggling his limbs in the air. Are England bottling this? 37th over: England 166-4 (Collingwood 5, Bopara 1) So, England have 14 overs to avoid making a real hash of this. They&apos;ve got a new batsman at one end and practically a new player at the other. Ravi Bopara scores his first World Cup run with a single into the leg-side, before Paul Collingwood takes two into the covers. But Canada are buzzing - from nowhere. England for the World Cup? Don&apos;t make me snigger. &quot;Any word on why Freddie is watching at the hotel rather than from the ground?&quot; asks Wayne Atkinson. &quot;Is it just to avoid unnecessary distraction or is there any suggestion he&apos;s spat the dummy or sustained a pedalo-related injury? Or is Fletch making work off the cost of the damaged pedalo in the hotel kitchen?&quot; 38th over: England 169-4 (Collingwood 7, Bopara 2) England&apos;s problem now is that they can&apos;t accelerate as they were planning to. It&apos;s been another mystifying collapse. They should still win this game easily, but, but, but. Dhaniram bowls and Peter Parker&apos;s hat blows off behind the stumps at the non-striker&apos;s end. Collingwood remains undisturbed and England take three off the over. &quot;Sorry, Clare, about Bell, but at least this increases the chance that MY darling, Paul Collingwood, will get a look in,&quot; says Marie Meyer. 39th over: England 173-4 (Collingwood 9, Bopara 4) There are few better rescuers in world cricket than Collingwood, but Bopara is an unknown quantity and almost gets run out pinching a quick single to mid-on off Codrington. Ian Smith reckons England will be playing Kenya on this very pitch, which means the Kenyan spinners might enjoy it. Just a thought to help the Sunday lunch go down more smoothly. Four off the over, which is less smooth. 40th over: England 181-4 (Collingwood 12, Bopara 9) At last, a boundary as Bopara wrists Dhaniram through midwicket. It was a low full-toss, but Bopara waited on it and timed it perfectly. Collingwood then gets hold of a reverse-sweep to collect three. That&apos;s better. I said at the start that 250 would make them feel absolutely safe. Well, there are only 10 overs to go and they still need 69. &quot;I&apos;d be less concerned about us giving away our wickets in ridiculous fashion if the runs that preceeded tham came at a decent rate,&quot; says Ben Hendy. &quot;The fact is that 4.5 an over is not an acceptable rate against a non-Test playing nation.&quot; 41st over: England 191-4 (Collingwood 17, Bopara 14) Codrington gives the ball some air and Collingwood slaps it through the covers for four. He follows that with a bread-and-butter push to mid-on for a single, as news comes through that Flintoff has been officially sacked as England&apos;s vice-captain. Oblivious to this bombshell, Bopara glances Codrington for four and this is a better over for England. &quot;Flintoff had to be rescued because he was at risk of being attacked by sharks,&quot; speculates Gary Naylor. &quot;The other England players need to be rescued because they are being attacked by minnows. Laugh or cry?&quot; Or just ignore. 42nd over: England 197-4 (Collingwood 20, Bopara 16) &quot;I wonder if Flintoff&apos;s allowed to watch the television,&quot; says TV&apos;s Mark Richardson. &quot;Or does he have to stand in the corner and face the wall?&quot; Nice. Meanwhile, Samad returns with his wrong-footed slow-mediums as Canada continue to ignore pace (if that isn&apos;t paying Anderson Cummins too big a compliment). This is a decent repair job by these two. Now they need to turn it into more than that. 43rd over: England 202-4 (Collingwood 23, Bopara 18) Up comes the England 200, but in a competition where everyone was predicting scores of 300-plus, it hasn&apos;t exactly set the pulse racing. In their defence, it&apos;s a tired pitch, but Canada have read it well by taking all the pace off the ball and inviting England to take the initiative. 44th over: England 206-4 (Collingwood 25, Bopara 20) Samad is still hopping and skipping his way to the crease and England can&apos;t make much of him, which is a worry. The big push, as ever with England, is more of a medium-sized shove. &quot;Collingwood for Vice-Captain!&quot; shrieks Marie Meyer. 45th over: England 215-4 (Collingwood 29, Bopara 24) I still think 250 is the bare minimum against this attack if England are to look themselves in the mirror tomorrow morning without wincing. Collingwood pushes Codrington to deep extra for two and there&apos;s the 50 stand off 53 balls. Much more like it. And there&apos;s four to Bopara, who goes down the track to heave Codrington over midwicket. A shot worthy of Strictly Come Dancing. &quot;Flintoff won&apos;t be able to watch the game on the telly unless he gets a flight to one of the neighbouring islands,&quot; points out Xander Bird. 46th over: England 237-4 (Collingwood 46, Bopara 28) Now Collingwood goes on the attack, mowing Samad from outside off-stump to midwicket for four. The next ball costs seven: a near-beamer on leg-stump which is signalled as a no-ball and helped for six by Collingwood. And that means Samad has been withdrawn from the attack, because that&apos;s his second waist-high full-toss. Drama here/there in St Lucia. So back comes Bhattia to finish the over. With Samad in that kind of form, England might have preferred him to stay on. But Bhattia&apos;s first ball is slog-swept for four more by Collingwood, who&apos;s really in the groove now: there&apos;s three more with a thumping cover-drive, thanks to a beached whale of a dive from Codrington. And there&apos;s four cracking runs by Bopara to make it 22 off the over: a steer to pierce the packed leg-side field at deep midwicket. &quot;I wasn&apos;t shrieking,&quot; shrieks Marie Meyer. &quot;I was cooing. He&apos;s lovely, he is.&quot; I hear you. WICKET! Bopara b Codrington 29 (242-5) The ball after Collingwood brings up a 41-ball fifty, Bopara becomes the second England player to be bowled on the reverse-sweep. Still, that 29 took only 30 balls and helped dig England out of a medium-sized hole. &quot;Hands off Colly,&quot; says Stephen Smith to Marie Meyer. &quot;I&apos;ve been making cow eyes at him for a lot longer. Nuts to Colly being vice-captain - he should have been captain last summer, in the winter, and the next time Vaughan falls over. Fact.&quot; 47th over: England 242-5 (Collingwood 50, Dalrymple 0) England must aim for 270 now. WICKET! Dalrymple c Bagai b Anderson 2 (245-6) A weird dismissal. Dalrymple thinks about the sweep, changes his mind and ends up providing a good low catch for Bagai off the face of the bat. Time for Nixon. &quot;I hope this will be a good kick up the arse for Flintoff,&quot; says Andy Turner. &quot;In the medium term it may be a good thing that his captaincy hopes have been ended for the moment. He is a great player but he also needs to work hard to produced his best form, and the distractions since the Ashes don&apos;t seem to have helped ...&quot; 48th over: England 247-6 (Collingwood 52, Nixon 1) Paul Nixon works his first ball off his toes for a single, but this has been a laboured effort by England. 49th over: England 260-6 (Collingwood 53, Nixon 13) Nixon reverse-sweeps his first ball off Codrington, who does not look impressed. he made good contact with it too, turning a full-toss into a not-very-many bounces four. Nixon then advances on the next ball and launches it down the ground for four more. Shot! He misses the next two balls before reverse-sweeping the sixth for four more. The man is a legend. &quot;Thanks to Xander Bird for setting this up,&quot; says Bob O&apos;Hara. &quot;Flintoff could always take a boat.&quot; 50th over: England 279-6 (Collingwood 62, Nixon 23) I&apos;ll be carrying on with OBO duty for Canada&apos;s reply, by the way, so keep the emails coming and I&apos;ll see what I can do to use them/take them out of context/ignore them completely. It&apos;s Cummins to bowl the last over of this strange England innings and his first ball, a full-toss, is spanked over backward square for four by the redoubtable Collingwood, who pushes the second to long-on for two. A heave for two comes off the third ball, and Nixon is running Collingwood ragged. He looks shattered! Well, they do say Nixon is the fittest man in the squad. He wants two off the fourth ball as well, but Collingwood rightly limits the damage to one. Nixon flicks the fifth ball over fine leg for four before launching the final ball of the innings over long-on for six. Nineteen off the last over with Nixon once more achieving official legend status. England managed 98 off the last 10 overs. It SHOULD be too much for Canada.

In their world, the sport stops in early November and starts once again at the Lincoln meeting in late March. It is a prejudice that becomes harder to defend with every passing season, however, and the Winter Derby at Lingfield this weekend could not offer a better advertisement for racing on the sand. The 15 five-day entries include 11 horses with an official rating of 100 or higher, including Alfie Flits, who has yet to run on any all-weather surface. &quot;The race is on the week after Cheltenham this year, which gives it more of a chance to shine,&quot; Ian Renton, the executive director of Arena Leisure and the driving force behind the Winter Derby in its early years, said yesterday. &quot;I think more and more people are coming to realise that almost all turf horses act equally well on Polytrack. I think it&apos;s also recognised now that there&apos;s more difference beween Fibresand compared to Polytrack than there is with turf compared to Polytrack. As a result, this has become an early-season target for some top-class horses.&quot; The adaptability of turf horses will be put to the test on Saturday by Illustrious Blue, the winner of a strong turf handicap at Nad Al Sheba earlier this year and a horse who could just as easily have run in the Lincoln. &quot;He&apos;s rated 106 now,&quot; William Knight, his trainer, said yesterday, &quot;so we have to be stepping up into races like this, and the ground would have been a worry in the Lincoln too, with him due to carry a big weight. &quot;The surface at Lingfield is great, it&apos;s what we train him on at home. It&apos;s got plenty of give but it rides like good ground and the great majority of horses can act on it.&quot; Illustrious Blue is 11-2 joint-favourite for the race with BetDirect, the sponsor, alongside Sri Diamond, who won the race last year, despite starting from an apparently hopeless stall position in 14. &quot;We thought about going to Dubai with him,&quot; said Sylvester Kirk, trainer of Sri Diamond, &quot;but this is a great prize and we decided to keep him going down this route. We gave him one run in January and kept him off since then, because he&apos;s a horse that&apos;s always better fresh. &quot;It&apos;s the sort of race that suits him perfectly, as he can be a bit fragile and we have to be a little selective with him. Lingfield and the Polytrack could have been designed specially for him, he loves it around there and it&apos;s a surface that&apos;s very forgiving for him.&quot; The top-rated horse in the race is Alfie Flits, who started out in bumpers last year and holds an entry in a Listed event to be run over 12 furlongs at Kempton the same afternoon. That there are such choices available to good horses on the all-weather is another sign of its growing stature but Alfie Flits would be a fair bet at the sponsor&apos;s 12-1 if Alan Swinbank were to steer him towards Lingfield. &quot;That&apos;s the race that I&apos;m leaning towards at the moment,&quot; Swinbank said yesterday, &quot;but it&apos;s still only Tuesday and I wouldn&apos;t want to put anyone away. &quot;What I would say is that Jamie [Spencer, who could have ridden Sri Diamond] is very keen on his chance at Lingfield.

British Airways shares climbed 16.5p to 519.5p, partly on takeover speculation and partly on chancellor Gordon Brown&apos;s dismissal of the Conservative idea of adding VAT to air fares.  Initially there was some talk of a potential takeover offer for BA from Dubai&apos;s Emirates airline, although Emirates immediately scuppered that one by saying it had no intention of making a bid.   BA was also mentioned as a possible merger partner for Spain&apos;s Iberia, as was Air France and Lufthansa. But Iberia dashed hopes that something was imminent by saying it had received no merger offer at the moment. However it did not rule out a deal in the future, and predicted more consolidation in the airline sector after an open skies pact between Europe and the US is finally signed.   Tomorrow the EU is set to vote on the deal, and analysts believe the UK may accept it while trying to delay its implementation at Heathrow.   Back at the budget, investors gave an initial welcome to Brown&apos;s 11th and final statement. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares was 31 points higher when he stood up, received a lift from his plans to cut corporation tax by 2% to 28% and moved even higher when he pulled the income tax cut out of the bag. When he sat down the gain was nearly 60 points, although by the close of trading the index had slipped back to 6256.8, a 36.5 point gain, after an uncertain start on Wall Street.   Insulation and roofing specialist SIG rose 22p to \u00a312.45 after a number of green measures in the budget, including plans to cut VAT on energy saving products, grants for pensioners installing insulation in their homes and stamp duty exemption for new zero carbon homes.   In a note, Cazenove said: &quot;This follows Brown&apos;s commitment last Monday to insulate every home in the UK starting with the worst eight million homes (out of 24) over 10 years. Insulation accounts for 42% of SIG&apos;s sales. We believe the trend of regulation and action to encourage insulation by EU governments represents a potentially transformational event for SIG.&quot;   The emphasis on green measures also helped troubled biodiesel producer Biofuels, up 1.75p to 13.5p, and rival D1 Oil, 8p better at 1525p.   British Energy added 19.5p to 481.5p as dealers read into Gordon Brown&apos;s speech that he planned to sell the government&apos;s stake in the company before too long.   But the budget changes to the tax rates for casinos hit Rank Group, down 9.75p to 225p. The company said the proposed increase in gaming duty for casinos would cost it around \u00a38m a year.   Ahead of the budget came the minutes of this month&apos;s Bank of England meeting, when interest rates were left unchanged. Eight out of the nine members of the Bank&apos;s monetary policy committee voted to leave rates on hold at 5.25p, with David Blanchflower surprising the market with a 0.25% cut.   Jaspreet Sehmi, economist at the Centre for Economic and Business Research, said, &quot;Analysts had predicted much less of a consensus, anticipating that the votes would be split 6-3 in favour of holding rates against implementing another hike.   &quot;Despite Blanchflower&apos;s vote, the tone of today&apos;s minutes reinforces our view that rates will move up again in the coming months, although the MPC seems likely to wait until May to assess how the volatility in the financial markets develops.&quot;   Dealers said investors were more concerned about yesterday&apos;s inflation figures, which suggested a rise to 5.5% was needed. Still on rates, economists expect the US authorities to leave rates unchanged this evening. The decision is due at 6.15pm UK time.   There was the usual burst of takeover activity and speculation, even apart from the airlines.   Barclays rose 10.5p to 712.5p awaiting developments in its proposed deal with Dutch group ABN Amro, while insurance group Aviva added 12.5p to 771.5p as it signed a deal with Turkish group Aksigorta to form a life and pensions business. The joint venture would be the second biggest pension company in the country.   Elsewhere Hammerson rose 79p to \u00a317.34 on reports of interest in the property group from France&apos;s Unibail or US giant GE Real Estate. Still in the real estate sector, British Land added 21p to \u00a315.58 after it formed a \u00a3650m property joint venture with supermarket giant Tesco, up 7p to 442.75p.   Satellite broadcaster BSkyB recovered 14p to 568p after yesterday&apos;s news that regulator Ofcom has launched an investigation into the UK&apos;s pay television market. Today analysts at Bear Stearns upgraded its rating to outperform and set a price target of 680p. At the same time US group Harris Associates declared a 3.2% stake.   Elsewhere Cadbury Schweppes climbed 10p to 645p after upbeat notes from Lehman Brothers and Citigroup. The latter said the company&apos;s plan to split into separate confectionery and beverages businesses left both vulnerable to bids. &quot;In our view there is a 50% chance that Cadbury confectionery will be bid for within 12 months,&quot; said Citigroup. &quot;Although there is logic in combining confectionery with Hershey or Kraft, we think the most compelling logic is a combination of Nestl\u00e9 and Wrigley.&quot; It tipped a private equity group as the most likely bidder for the beverages business. &quot;We would not under-estimate the chance of a private equity bidding war,&quot; it added. &quot;It is worth noting that Cadbury have a close association with Carlyle, which was its bottling partner for seven years,&quot; and it said KKR might also run the rule over the business.   Directories group Yell jumped 17.5p to 588p on talk it was been stalked by a predator.   But Whitbread fell back after yesterday&apos;s talk of a possible \u00a323 bid. The shares, down 70p to \u00a318.64, were the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 as Barclays Wealth analysts said the company looked &quot;fundamentally overvalued&quot;. However, UBS raised its price target from \u00a311.70 to \u00a320.75.   Argos and Homebase owner Home Retail Group lost 2.75p to 441.5p. Evolution Securities put out a sell recommendation with a 390p target, saying the company faced increasing competition, not least from Tesco, and was an unlikely bid target.   Among the mid-caps oil services group Abbot lost 15.75p to 280p as 28m shares were sold by Arne Blystad, chairman of Songa Drilling, the Norwegian oil rig business it bought last year. The shares were placed by Goldman Sachs.   But Premier Oil added 58p to \u00a312.52 ahead of results tomorrow. There were also suggestions of a possible \u00a317 offer from a Middle Eastern group.   Takeover talk also swirled around Durex condom maker SSL International, up 16.75p to 404.75p. UK Coal climbed 24p to 500p as property group Peel raised its stake from 20.04% to 24.49%.   Traders noted some interest in Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels. The shares added 27p to 677p, but today the shares have gone ex, the final and special dividend worth a total of 10.5p, so the effective increase is much higher. The company has been the subject of takeover talk, and is also converting some of its properties into tax efficient real estate investment (Reit) trust status.   There was also a positive Cazenove note which also helped.   Online gaming groups were lifted by a statement from Sportingbet, up 1.25p to 64p, that the state of Louisiana had withdraw charges against its former chairman Peter Dicks, whose arrest in the US started a crackdown on internet gambling. PartyGaming benefited, up 2p to 45p.   Aim disaster of the day was cake maker Inter Link Foods, down 103.75p to 75.25p - a near 60% drop - after its second profit warning in just over a month. &quot;This is particularly disappointing given that the group appeared to be &apos;kitchen-sinking&apos; the 2007 forecasts at the last update,&quot; said analysts at Shore Capital, which repeated its sell advice.   Still on Aim, the marketing and media buying group Adventis gained 1p to 60p in early trading after it reported a 75% jump in 2006 pre-tax profits to \u00a31.8m and flagged up client wins in healthcare, residential and commercial property and financial services.   Chief executive Charles Phillpot said he wanted to complete two big acquisitions and &quot;a couple of smaller deals&quot; in the coming year. &quot;We&apos;ve got several deals bubbling away on the M&amp;A side,&quot; he said, but stressed Adventis would not take the &quot;scattergun approach&quot; to acquisitions he saw at some rivals. The shares were flat at 59p by the close.   Immunodiagnostic Systems, a producer of diagnostic testing kits, rose 18p to 268.5p after it reported that operating profits for the year to March 31 2007 were now expected to be more than 10% above current market expectations. &quot;Prospects for the new financial year look buoyant,&quot; it added.   Broker Teather &amp; Greenwood raised its forecasts and said the shares were &quot;currently significantly undervalued&quot;.

This week in Miami is no different, with 45 of the 73 players competing in the CA Championship at Doral coming from overseas. &quot;I bet I don&apos;t know 20% of these guys,&quot; the American journeyman Paul Goydos admitted yesterday before adding that 20% of the foreign players probably do not know him. Not many Americans are as good-humoured as Goydos when it comes to contemplating the shift in the game&apos;s centre of gravity and the sight of multiple flags flying over the Doral clubhouse - 17 countries are represented this week - has served only to intensify the angst. Stenson is emblematic of this sea change in the game thanks to his recent victory in the world matchplay championship at Tucson and he is the first port of call these days when people are looking to explain why, outside of Tiger Woods, America no longer dominates the sport. &quot;Golf has been growing and growing worldwide,&quot; the 30-year-old said. &quot;You can tell from the tournaments I used to play when I was an amateur. Countries that weren&apos;t on the map when we were playing 10, 15 years ago, all of a sudden they are producing good players. It&apos;s growing worldwide and more and more players are coming up from countries that we didn&apos;t even know had golf courses 10 years ago. I think that&apos;s a factor. I think it just keeps on going.&quot; This reasoning was plausible, not to say diplomatic, but it also avoided a more unpalatable truth that Stenson, as a member of the game&apos;s unofficial trade union for top-class players, would never utter in public - that American professionals have things too easy. As they make their journey from the pampered elite of college golf to the well-remunerated PGA Tour - where 93 players made over $1m (\u00a3520,000) in prize money last year - the average American player enjoys a career noticeably lacking in the kind of adversity which marked Stenson&apos;s rise to the upper echelons. &quot;He is a great talent. He has the strength of a gorilla, is a fast learner and he is now winning regularly,&quot; said Faldo before tipping the Swede to win the Masters. &quot;He is also a solid putter. He is the man.&quot; Six years ago such a glowing reference from one of the greatest European players of the modern era would have been out of the question, not least because Faldo, like most people, would never have given the Swede a second glance. With good reason: he was not very good. In fact, Stenson&apos;s game was so bad back then that he contemplated giving up. The nadir came at the 2001 European Open at the K-Club, when he walked off the course after nine holes, telling his playing partners they would &quot;get on better&quot; without him. At one hole he hit two drives off the tee, one right and one left, that were measured 140 yards apart - an inconceivable margin of error for a 24-handicapper, never mind a professional. &quot;You know, the first couple of provisional balls don&apos;t bother you too much. But when the caddie is rattling around in the pocket [of your golf bag] to see if you&apos;ve got any more balls left, you know you have got a problem,&quot; he said when asked to describe his feelings back then. Lesser players might have walked away from the game but Stenson stuck at it. He changed coach, to the incomparable Pete Cowen, who has worked with the likes of Thomas Bjorn and Lee Westwood. &quot;He has trouble hitting the world,&quot; was Cowen&apos;s famous assessment of his new pupil, but that is no longer the case. The pair spent three years rebuilding the Swede&apos;s swing and by 2004 he was good enough to win the Heritage tournament at Woburn.

British Airways shares rose 16.5p to 519.5p, partly on takeover speculation and partly on the dismissal by Gordon Brown, the chancellor, of the Tory idea of adding VAT to air fares. BA was said to be in the sights of Dubai&apos;s Emirates airline, although Emirates scuppered that by saying it did not intend to bid. BA was also mentioned as a possible merger partner for Spain&apos;s Iberia, as was Air France and Lufthansa. Iberia dashed such hopes by saying it had received no merger offer. But it did not rule out a deal and predicted more consolidation in the sector if Europe and the US finally agree an open skies pact. The EU is set to vote on the deal today, although the UK is said to be pushing for a delay in implementing the proposals. Back at the budget, investors gave an initial welcome to Brown&apos;s 11th and final statement. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares was 31 points higher when he stood up, received a lift from his plans to cut corporation tax by 2% to 28% and moved even higher when he pulled the income tax cut out of the bag. When he sat down the gain was nearly 60 points, although by the close of trading the index had slipped back to 6256.8 - a 36.5 point increase - after an uncertain start on Wall Street. The insulation specialist SIG rose 22p to \u00a312.45 after a number of energy-saving proposals in the budget. Cazenove said: &quot;Insulation accounts for 42% of SIG&apos;s sales. We believe the trend of regulation and action to encourage insulation by EU governments represents a potentially transformational event for SIG.&quot; Green measures also helped the troubled biodiesel producer Biofuels, up 1.75p to 13.5p, and its rival D1 Oils, 8p better at 152p. British Energy added 19.5p to 481.5p as dealers read into Mr Brown&apos;s speech that he planned to sell the government&apos;s stake in the company before too long. But budget changes to the tax rates for casinos hit Rank Group, down 9.75p to 225p. The company said the proposed increase in gaming duty for casinos would cost it about \u00a38m a year. The minutes of this month&apos;s Bank of England meeting, when interest rates were left unchanged, came out ahead of the budget. Eight out of nine members of the monetary policy committee voted to leave rates on hold at 5.25p, with Danny Blanchflower surprising the market by voting for a 0.25% cut. There was the usual takeover speculation. Barclays rose 10.5p to 712.5p, awaiting developments in its proposed deal with the Dutch bank ABN Amro, while the insurer Aviva added 12.5p to 771.5p as it signed a deal with the Turkish group Aksigorta to form a life and pensions business. The joint venture would be the second-biggest pension company in Turkey. Elsewhere, Hammerson rose 79p to \u00a317.34 on reports of interest in the property group from France&apos;s Unibail or the US giant GE Real Estate. Still in real estate, British Land added 21p to \u00a315.58 after it formed a \u00a3650m property joint venture with the supermarket chain Tesco, up 7p to 442.75p. Cadbury Schweppes climbed 10p to 645p after upbeat notes from Lehman Brothers and Citigroup. The latter said the plan to split into confectionery and beverages businesses left both open to bids. &quot;There is a 50% chance that Cadbury confectionery will be bid for within 12 months,&quot; said Citigroup. &quot;Although there is logic in combining confectionery with Hershey or Kraft, we think the most compelling logic is a combination of Nestl\u00e9 and Wrigley.&quot; It tipped a private equity group as the most likely bidder for the beverages business. &quot;We would not underestimate the chance of a private equity bidding war. It is worth noting that Cadbury have a close association with Carlyle, which was its bottling partner for seven years.&quot; It said KKR might also be interested. The directories group Yell jumped 17.5p to 588p on talk that it was being stalked by a predator. But Whitbread fell after this week&apos;s talk of a possible \u00a323 bid. The shares, down 70p to \u00a318.64, were the FTSE 100&apos;s biggest faller as Barclays Wealth analysts said it looked &quot;fundamentally overvalued&quot;. However, UBS raised its price target from \u00a311.70 to \u00a320.75. Among the mid-caps, the oil services group Abbot lost 15.75p to 280p as 28m shares were sold by Arne Blystad, chairman of Songa Drilling, the Norwegian oil rig business it bought last year. But Premier Oil added 58p to \u00a312.52 ahead of results today. There were also suggestions of a possible \u00a317 offer from a Middle Eastern group. Immunodiagnostic Systems, which makes diagnostic testing kits, rose 18p to 268.5p after it said operating profits for the year were now expected to be more than 10% above current market expectations. &quot;Prospects for the new financial year look buoyant,&quot; it added. The telecoms group Future Internet Technologies slipped 9p to 261.5p as the entrepreneur Robert Bonnier sold Cold Investments, which held his stake in FTI, to the Dutch business Johan Frencken. Frencken, who now owns 24.89%, has no plans to bid for the firm. Millennium rumours Traders noted some interest in Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels yesterday. The shares added 27p to 677p, despite the fact that they were quoted ex-dividend. The company has given investors a final dividend of 6.5p along with a special 4p a share payment, so the increase in the company&apos;s share price yesterday was effectively even higher than it seemed. There was a positive note from Cazenove to help things on the way, not to mention some takeover speculation. The company, which is 52% owned by chairman Kwek Leng Beng through his City Developments business, has played down suggestions it would be taken private. Dealers said the rise may have been due to hopes that the company would take more advantage of the government&apos;s tax efficient real estate investment trusts (Reits). \u00b7 nick.fletcher@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Business"], "title": "Market forces: BA takes off on lack of tax and talk of co-pilots", "sentences": ["BA was said to be in the sights of Dubai&apos;s Emirates airline, although Emirates scuppered that by saying it did not intend to bid."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/22/marketforces", "publicationDate": "2007-03-22T23:53:51Z"}, {"article": "The speculation began as soon as Invasor crossed the line to win the Breeders&apos; Cup Classic at Churchill Downs last October. The four-year-old had just won his fourth Grade One race in succession but it was the single defeat on his record for 2006 that attracted the most attention. Discreet Cat had pumelled Invasor by seven lengths in the UAE Derby back in March and there had to be a chance, at least, that the pair would meet again in the Dubai World Cup, the richest race on the planet. Five months later, that chance has wintered well. Invasor arrived in Dubai earlier this week, having been prepared for the $6m World Cup in the warmth of Florida, while Discreet Cat, the Godolphin operation&apos;s great hope for 2007, is also on course for the race in eight days&apos; time, despite missing his intended prep race. It is the sort of boost that the World Cup meeting needs and probably deserves, in terms of its profile in Britain at least. Its place in the calendar, between National Hunt&apos;s two great festivals, means that it has an annual battle for the punters&apos; attention. The six-race card, however, is the most valuable in the sport and includes not only the World Cup but the two biggest prizes in turf racing too, the Dubai Duty Free over nine furlongs and the Sheema Classic over 12, both of which are worth $5m. Invasor is currently in quarantine and is not expected to work on the track at Nad Al Sheba until tomorrow at the earliest. Discreet Cat, meanwhile, has done much of his preparation away from public inspection, the exception being a gallop last week when he beat his companion by three lengths without coming out of a canter. &quot;He&apos;s really well and we&apos;re looking forward to next week,&quot; Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, said yesterday. &quot;It was unfortunate that he had to miss his prep race but it&apos;s just one of those things and we couldn&apos;t be more pleased with him. &quot;We also have Best Alibi [who was third in last year&apos;s Irish Derby] and Laverock to run in the mile and a half race, and Best Name [fourth to Rail Link in last year&apos;s Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe] and Formal Decree [the four-length winner of last year&apos;s Cambridgeshire Handicap] entered for the Duty Free. &quot;Those ones all have good place chances, but this is a showpiece meeting and it&apos;s proper racing. We&apos;re all fired up and ready, but you always need to step up to a higher level to win on World Cup night.&quot; Coral, the only major bookmaker currently betting on the World Cup, make Discreet Cat their 6-5 favourite, with Invasor a 13-8 chance. Premium Tap, third home in last year&apos;s Breeders&apos; Cup Classic, is 6-1 and it is 12-1 bar. The highlight of the World Cup undercard for British backers is likely to be the eagerly awaited seasonal reappearance of Sir Percy, last year&apos;s Derby winner, in the Sheema Classic. Sir Percy raced only once after his narrow success at Epsom, when seventh of eight in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October. &quot;He&apos;s done very well through the winter and I&apos;ve had a pretty clear run with him,&quot; Marcus Tregoning, Sir Percy&apos;s trainer, said yesterday. &quot;As long as he comes back to his very best form, then he&apos;s sure to run a very big race. &quot;Good horses get beat occasionally. If you look at Ouija Board&apos;s fantastic career, she did get beaten from time to time but kept coming back to win good races. I think the blip was because we&apos;d had such an interrupted preparation with him last year and it caught up with him towards the end.&quot;", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Dubai", "United Arab Emirates"], "title": "Horse Racing: Invasor to cross Cat's path in world's richest race", "sentences": ["Discreet Cat had pumelled Invasor by seven lengths in the UAE Derby back in March and there had to be a chance, at least, that the pair would meet again in the Dubai World Cup, the richest race on the planet.", "Invasor arrived in Dubai earlier this week, having been prepared for the $6m World Cup in the warmth of Florida, while Discreet Cat, the Godolphin operation&apos;s great hope for 2007, is also on course for the race in eight days&apos; time, despite missing his intended prep race.", "The six-race card, however, is the most valuable in the sport and includes not only the World Cup but the two biggest prizes in turf racing too, the Dubai Duty Free over nine furlongs and the Sheema Classic over 12, both of which are worth $5m."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/23/horseracing.sport", "publicationDate": "2007-03-23T03:41:01Z"}, {"article": "There is sensational golf and then there is the kind currently being played by Henrik Stenson. The Swede, winner of the World Match Play championship and Dubai Desert Classic already this year, continued to mine a seam of 24-carat form yesterday, shooting a five-under 67 at the Doral country club to take the lead after the first round of the CA Championship. &quot;I&apos;ve got plenty of time to prove you wrong before the week is over,&quot; he said to the suggestion that he could do no wrong with a club in his hand. &quot;It feels good that I can go out and play pretty solid, that I can manage to get off the course with not too many shots left behind.&quot; Full marks for the modesty of his remarks, perhaps, but there will be questions asked about their accuracy, not least because solid comes nowhere near to capturing the quality of his play on an unseasonable Florida day that saw the likes of Phil Mickelson scuffle round the course they call the Blue Monster with about as much aplomb as a club pro with the yips. Miami in March? More like St Andrews in October. &quot;You&apos;ve got to think your way around the course a little bit more on a day like this . . . when you are standing there and your trousers are flapping and the putter feels like it could go anywhere,&quot; Stenson said after running in seven birdies amid the wind and rain. His only blemish came at the par-three 13th hole where he missed an 18-inch putt for par. Less accomplished, and less confident, players might let such an aberration knock them off their stride but, true to a national stereotype honed by Bjorn Borg, the Swede continued his unflappable progress. Only Robert Allenby was able to match his 67, with Thomas Bjorn one shot further back after a four-under-par 68. The Australian and the Dane are both terrific players but their form in recent times has been inconsistent and it remains to be seen if they will be able to sustain their challenge over three days. The same might be said of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal these days, although yesterday&apos;s conditions gave full scope to the Spaniard&apos;s imagination and shot-making ability. He finished the day tied for fourth alongside Aaron Baddeley on three under par, one shot ahead of a group of players including Ernie Els. Top-class play has a habit of defying predictions, especially on the basis of one day&apos;s play, but the most likely - and most enticing - scenario is a Sunday afternoon denouement featuring Stenson and Tiger Woods, the two best players on the planet given current form. The Swede bested the world No1 on the final day in Dubai last month, so it is safe to assume Woods will be looking for revenge before the week is over. If so, he will have to drive better than he did yesterday. Over the past year he has tamed a once-errant driver but yesterday he only managed to hit six of 14 fairways. Other players might have been discourage by regular visits to the rough but Woods, of course, is not any other player. He is the personification of determination, which is why he battled his way to a one-under par 71 - not exceptional by his own standards but good enough to finish the day tied for 10th place alongside Sergio Garc\u00eda. It was not so long ago the Spaniard filled the Stenson&apos;s role as the man most likely to challenge Woods. How times change. Forlorn is not exactly the right description for a player who won over a \u00a31m in prize money last season, but Garc\u00eda seems a curiously downbeat figure these days. He has not won a tournament since the 2005 European Masters in Switzerland and he has slipped to 13th in the world rankings. Nevertheless he remains capable of great deeds and for short spells yesterday he produced some wonderful golf, not least at the par-five 1st hole (his 10th hole of the day) when he chipped in from off the green for an eagle. A few more shots like that over the next two days and he would be a more than welcome interloper to any final-round showdown featuring Stenson and Woods.", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport"], "title": "Golf: Hurricane Stenson arrives with a blast", "sentences": ["The Swede, winner of the World Match Play championship and Dubai Desert Classic already this year, continued to mine a seam of 24-carat form yesterday, shooting a five-under 67 at the Doral country club to take the lead after the first round of the CA Championship.", "The Swede bested the world No1 on the final day in Dubai last month, so it is safe to assume Woods will be looking for revenge before the week is over."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/23/golf.sport", "publicationDate": "2007-03-23T03:41:01Z"}, {"article": "Bob Woolmer&apos;s death has cast a spotlight on the murky but lucrative world of sports betting on the sub-continent, with suspicions that a betting syndicate could have been involved in his murder. Gambling is banned in Pakistan, but it is a major underground industry run by a network of bookmakers with links to syndicates in India and Dubai. Prospective gamblers call their bookmaker on his mobile, using the reference of a friend or relative. The odds quoted are less favourable than those in the UK or in Mumbai. Punters have little choice - Pakistani credit cards are banned from major internet gambling sites. Winnings are collected and losses paid through money changers. &quot;It all works through intermediaries,&quot; said a Karachi businessman. &quot;I&apos;ve never actually met my bookie. I have no idea what he looks like.&quot; One well known bookmaker is the brother of a famous former player who has faced match-fixing allegations. The trade is extremely lucrative. Some bookmakers are connected to organised crime figures such as Dawood Ibrahim, a notorious mobster on Interpol&apos;s most wanted list. Powerful criminal syndicates are said to dangle huge sums before players to swing results of games. Former Pakistani bowler Sarfraz Nawaz claimed Woolmer was murdered because he was about to expose a match-fixing scandal. Indian gangster Babloo Srivastasa appeared on TV, en route to a court appearance on an unrelated murder charge, claiming Ibrahim was behind the killing. &quot;The Pakistan-Ireland match must have been fixed. The D-company [Ibrahim&apos;s gang] may have lots of money at stake,&quot; he said. &quot;Woolmer may have got an inkling of the fixing and so he was killed.&quot; Srivastasa&apos;s claims are unsubstantiated. But the Indian authorities have long suspected that Ibrahim, wanted in connection with the bombings in Mumbai that killed 200 people in 1993, has been involved in match-fixing. The cricketing authorities were forced to react to the scandal in 2000 involving former South African captain Hanse Cronje, who admitted accepting $130,000 (\u00a366,550) to fix matches. The International Cricket Council established its anti-corruption and security unit (ACSU), and retired Metropolitan police commissioner Lord Condon produced a devastating report which concluded match-fixing was rife. Since then cricket has tried hard to clean-up its act: Cronje, before he died in a plane crash, was banned for life; his team mates, Herschelle Gibbs and Henry Williams, received six-month bans. Others punished included India&apos;s Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Sharma, who received life bans, although Azharuddin&apos;s was lifted, as did Pakistan&apos;s Salim Malik and Ata-ur-Rehman, although the latter&apos;s was also lifted. Security measures were put in place, with CCTV cameras trained on dressing rooms, and a ban on players using mobiles during matches. Yesterday Lord Condon said cricket had responded robustly to his report. &quot;I do not think match-fixing is the problem that it was,&quot; he told Radio 5 Live. &quot;Nevertheless, there are some very unsavoury people involved in seeking to fix matches, or parts of matches.&quot; Suspicion has continued to swirl around the game. The ACSU is investigating Marlon Samuels, a West Indies batsman, over an alleged attempt to pass information to an illegal bookmaker during a one-day international. The authorities have a taped conversation between Samuels and alleged bookmaker Mukesh Kochar, who Indian police say is a known associate of Ibrahim. Police said there was no evidence money had changed hands. Samuels denied wrongdoing. As Pakistan prepared to play Ireland, one gambler was offered odds of 50-1 for a shock upset, while another had heard figures of 95-1. Fancy fixings Betting on international cricket on the sub-continent involves millions of rupees, with money placed on the outcome of a game and on a multitude of possibilities during it. These are much easier for bookmakers to manipulate because they only require the involvement of one or two players. Known as &quot;fancy fixings&quot;, they are difficult for the authorities to police because of the huge number of one-day internationals played. The anti-corruption unit watches for unusual betting patterns and analyses the tapes of suspicious matches, but with many of the bets placed anonymously on the internet or via mobile phone, they are difficult to monitor.", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "Gambling", "Cricket", "UK news", "Sport"], "title": "Gangsters behind illegal betting on world cricket", "sentences": ["Gambling is banned in Pakistan, but it is a major underground industry run by a network of bookmakers with links to syndicates in India and Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/24/pakistan.gambling", "publicationDate": "2007-03-24T01:23:32Z"}, {"article": "Quiz time. What, exactly, is a Qashqai? Is it a) an exotic superfruit found only in the larger branches of Sainsbury&apos;s and used to form the major ingredient in a Bodyshop foot balm; b) an exclusive waterside apartment development in Dubai; or c) an Arsenal player? Answer: none of the above. You&apos;ll be kicking yourself because, of course, the clue was in the picture. A Qashqai is a new, miniaturised sports utility vehicle from Nissan. When I say miniaturised, I mean that it is smaller than the Nissan Murano, which is large enough to go to war in. The Qashqai could also go to war, but probably only as a back-up vehicle. But before it goes anywhere, you will want to work out how to say &quot;Qashqai&quot;. Qwoshkey? Kwasskwy? Quishquosh? The received pronunciation, courtesy of the Nissan press office, is Cash-kye, but it might be best to check with your local dealer for any regional variations. And try saying it with a mouthful of wine gums, if you want to help break the ice on long journeys. In the present way of things, turning loose a smaller SUV or two could prove a canny political move. These days, the more a Chelsea tractor can pretend that it comes in peace as an inflated hatchback, the less chance it has of attracting popular contempt, ultra-swingeing taxes and congestion charges, and point-blank refusals to allow it to pull out into slow-moving traffic. That&apos;s not to claim that the Qashqai is entirely shy and apologetic about itself. Indeed, it is clearly, in its own self-consciously humble way, bulked up to provide a bit of nose-thumbing attitude. Nissan seems keen to play up the car&apos;s slightly gritty, street-wise nature. Its shape has something of the pleasing aspect of a brand new trainer about it. It&apos;s a middle-class schoolrun-mobile but, the suggestion is, with slightly more emphasis on the &quot;yo&quot; than on the &quot;yah&quot;. But Nissan probably goes a bit too far when it describes the Qashqai as &quot;100% urbanproof&quot;. The vehicle has not been invented, even by the army, that can see off every urban menace. This one is as susceptible as any other car to being keyed, having its wing mirrors idly twisted and getting the paintwork stripped off its bumpers by someone pulling out of a tight parking space. And I can confirm from firsthand experience that, even in a Qashqai, people will still try to sell you copies of the London Evening Standard at junctions. Still, mine came, a bit like Christmas, with &quot;chocolate and orange&quot; trim (more appetising than it sounds), and it also had the optional panoramic glass roof - worth the extra \u00a3700, I would suggest, for the light it admits to the cabin and the unrivalled sweeping views it affords of the upper decks of passing buses. It was also quick, neat, tidy and, on account of its relatively modest scale, it could be pressed along at speed without the eerie feeling, prevalent in larger SUVs, that it wouldn&apos;t take much more than a high wind and the wrong corner to find it sliding along on its roof.

Although the news caused a temporary blip in operations in India, with illicit bookies changing their telephone numbers - something they do as often as match to match - the defeats of Pakistan and India have forced the bookies back into business in an attempt to cover losses. The fear that India will not do as well as expected has also led to the bookies trying to up their operations for the games that are currently under way. Although the major bookies in the big cities were largely inaccessible once the India-Sri Lanka match got under way yesterday, the smaller operators were very much in business. One Mumbai bookie, who insisted on being contacted through a public phone booth, said he had no option but to stay open, even though the risks of getting caught were heightened in light of all that has happened in the West Indies. Contrary to popular belief - although the big bookies operating out of Mumbai and Kolkata set the trends in terms of odds - the high-volume betting is taking place in the smaller cities. With these bookies, the betting starts as low as 2,000 rupees (\u00a325) with no upper ceiling. Before India&apos;s defeat by Bangladesh most bookies were offering odds of between 6-1 and 8-1 on India winning the World Cup. For the match against Sri Lanka one bookie was more interested in individual bets than on the outcome. &quot;Sourav Ganguly is favourite to top score and Zaheer Khan is favourite for top wicket-taker,&quot; he said. A bookie in Bangalore, speaking through a confidant, said the volumes were becoming so high they had to stop accepting bets around the halfway mark of yesterday&apos;s India-Sri Lanka match. &quot;We need to close all accounts before the next game. There&apos;s no way we can balance things if we keep taking fresh bets,&quot; he said. The bookie suggested that the total volume of betting for the India-Sri Lanka match was expected to be in the order of \u00a332m, with close to half of those amounts coming from overseas, mostly in the Middle East. Dubai was expected to be a big market. The bookies believed a majority of punters would bet patriotically rather than intelligently. &quot;Everyone wants India to win and numbers are showing that,&quot; he said. &quot;But, when it comes to bets on players, it is the well-informed who play.&quot; Off the hook in India An unnamed South African cricketer reported an approach in India from an individual he feared might be an illegal bookmaker, it was revealed yesterday. The South Africa team manager, Goolam Rajah, reported the incident to the International Cricket Council&apos;s anti-corruption unit, which subsequently satisfied itself that the telephone call was &quot;innocent&quot;. Rajah refused to name the player, but added he is not a current member of the South Africa squad in the Caribbean. &quot;Nothing happened, other than that one phone call,&quot; Rajah said.", "tags": ["Sport", "Cricket", "Cricket world cup 2007"], "title": "Cricket World Cup: Illegal gambling goes on in India despite tragedy in Caribbean", "sentences": ["Dubai was expected to be a big market."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/24/cricket.cricketworldcup20075", "publicationDate": "2007-03-24T23:56:07Z"}, {"article": "HMV foiled As a former proud employee of Waterstone&apos;s, it pains me to see the company sink into a mire of mediocrity.

Photograph: Linda Nylind One of the surest indicators that a subject is a real topic of discussion is when it&apos;s also a conversation killer. I have been to a number of dinners recently where all sorts of perversity and controversy have been happily recounted in gory detail, but one subject consistently caused skittish evasion and awkward silences: how the world&apos;s leading auction house, Christie&apos;s International, acquired London&apos;s cutting edge Haunch of Venison gallery and what the acquisition can mean. As Walter Robinson eloquently explains on Artnet, something similar was already a glimmer in the auction houses&apos; eyes as early as the 1980s. In the currently booming art market it might be considered quaint to hold onto the idea that galleries, rather than auction houses, are the ideal environment for artists to develop their reputations and the value of their work. But the Haunch acquisition still raises some real concerns. The topic can be unsettling because, although it is too early to tell whether a precedent has been set, it demonstrates how historic divisions between critical and commercial stakeholders are becoming increasingly and troublingly blurred. In many respects the art world functions through a complex, often opaque system of checks and balances. Museums, auction houses, galleries and critical forums - including the mutually wary academics and art journalists - all play their part. When collectors are blocked by dealers from purchasing a work straight through a gallery, then they have the opportunity to go to auction and shout out sums in a public forum instead. This money manoeuvring strikes some as vulgar, but no one can argue that selling to a competitive crowd at auction is not a powerful inflator of prices, as opposed to selling art to buyers one-on-one through a gallery. But the relationship makes sense to Haunch. The association enhances their pulling power with artists hoping to establish themselves on the block. Already one very hot young artist is rumored to have moved to Haunch from his previous London gallery. And while most English galleries are sticking to an island mentality and opening sister spaces in different areas of London, many high end American galleries are becoming global brands. Christie&apos;s cross-continental expansion potentially provides Haunch the opportunity to piggy back with them to Asia, Dubai and wherever else the auction house positions itself to establish or benefit from a new market. Already Haunch has plans to open a branch showing primary market contemporary work and secondary market historical pieces in New York City this autumn. Perhaps historic divisions between the primary and secondary markets are anachronistic and laughable anyway. At this point it is no longer an issue of where work is sold but who buys it. Lets face it - the hedge-fund hounds sniffing around fashionable galleries for anything fresh are the same guys willing to go wild at the auctions and really, they buy with their eye to the block anyway.", "tags": ["The art market", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture"], "title": "Christie's acquisition of a gallery should concern us all", "sentences": ["Christie&apos;s cross-continental expansion potentially provides Haunch the opportunity to piggy back with them to Asia, Dubai and wherever else the auction house positions itself to establish or benefit from a new market."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/mar/26/christiesacquisitionofalon", "publicationDate": "2007-03-26T07:00:00Z"}, {"article": "Arabian oryxes released after extinction in wild Ninety-eight Arabian oryxes have been released into the desert of the United Arab Emirates in an attempt to reintroduce the creature to its natural habitat after 40 years of extinction in the country.

But Pakistan Cricket Board officials tried to keep players away from the media and some have taken different routes home from the World Cup in the Caribbean. The batsman Mohammad Yousuf returned home via Dubai yesterday and the team&apos;s vice-captain, Younis Khan, remained in Dubai. &quot;Younis Khan is already in Dubai on a private visit and some players including Azhar Mahmood, Rao Iftikhar, Shahid Afridi and Danish Kaneria might stay back for a while in London,&quot; a PCB official said. Kaneria had been staying in the room next to Woolmer&apos;s at the Pegasus Hotel in Kingston, Jamaica, where the 58-year-old was found dead nine days ago. &quot;I was the only player staying on the same floor as Bob,&quot; he said. &quot;I woke up at 9.30, had breakfast at 10; nothing was wrong at that stage. I spoke to my family and wife, then as I was going to my friend&apos;s room I saw outside my room medical staff, my manager and police.&quot; Kaneria said Woolmer had been visibly depressed the previous day during the shock defeat to Ireland that put Pakistan out of the World Cup. &quot;My last conversation with him was during the Ireland game as I was the 12th man. He was feeling very depressed and down.&quot; Younis said: &quot;I was the closest to him in the team and we discussed everything. Being knocked out of the World Cup was a big disappointment but Bob&apos;s death is like a nightmare. We had talked about the future and he wanted me to come to work with him in his cricket academy project he had planned in Cape Town.&quot; Younis is expected to take over as captain from Inzamam-ul-Haq, who has announced his retirement from one-day internationals. Rumours abound about the circumstances surrounding Woolmer&apos;s death and police are studying CCTV footage from the hotel. However, the team&apos;s spokesman, Pervez Mir, criticised the lack of communication between the police and the team management. &quot;We assisted in whatever way [the Jamaican police] wanted but we need an official statement from their office, to notify us officially as to what were the causes of Mr Woolmer&apos;s death, because we heard on TV that he was murdered but we&apos;ve not been officially told.&quot; Mir rejected rumours of links between Woolmer&apos;s death and match-fixing. &quot;To divert a murder inquiry into a match-fixing inquiry, that&apos;s not fair, because we have to find the killers, then we will know what&apos;s happened.

A board official said the PCB would not send any lawyer or investigator to Jamaica because Pakistani diplomats were handling the issue. &quot;As yet the Jamaican police have not approached us for any assistance,&quot; he added. The PCB chairman, Naseem Ashraf, said he had received an email from Woolmer in the hours before his murder confirming his retirement from international cricket. &quot;He told me he was hanging up his boots and retiring from international coaching ...

Rashid Rauf, a terrorist suspect in London and Islamabad, is being held in a high-security jail in Rawalpindi, outside Pakistan&apos;s capital, and the authorities are preventing his lawyer and relatives from visiting. All attempts by British consular staff to see Mr Rauf have been rebuffed because Pakistan does not recognise dual nationality. His case is being heard concurrently at district and high court level as well as in an anti- terrorism court. According to his charge sheet he is involved in &quot;cases of murder and terrorism&quot; involving the possession of 29 bottles of hydrogen peroxide and fake South African identity papers which were found at a house he used in Rawalpindi. Thousands of miles away in London, Mehran Baluch, one of the men the Pakistan security services (ISI) wants to swap for Mr Rauf, remains at liberty, oblivious of his key role in the diplomatic wrangling going on behind closed doors until contacted by the Guardian. Mr Baluch knows nothing of Mr Rauf. His cause is his native Baluchistan, a remote, oil rich, western province straddling Pakistan and Afghanistan, where Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan have recorded disappearances, arbitrary arrests, detention and torture by the Pakistani security forces. Born in Nimroz, in the Afghan part of Baluchistan, Mr Baluch came to Britain aged 13 for his education. He has lived here more than 20 years and holds a British passport. Mr Baluch said that he had dedicated his life to highlighting human rights abuses in Baluchistan, where leading political figures had &quot;disappeared&quot; with increasing regularity over the past year. &quot;President Musharraf claims they have left the country or gone on holiday,&quot; said Mr Baluch, speaking of Pakistan&apos;s leader. &quot;Gone on holiday? These are people who don&apos;t have enough to eat, how can they afford to go on holiday? I am baffled by this. The ISI must be desperate if they want me extradited. The British should see that they have created a Frankenstein in President Musharraf.&quot; The journey that entwined the fate of the two men began in 2002 following the murder in Birmingham of Mr Rauf&apos;s uncle, Mohammed Saeed. Following the fatal stabbing, Mr Rauf went to Pakistan, settling in Bahawalpur, southern Punjab, where his relatives had a close friend, Ghulam Mustafa, who owned a madrasa. With police in Birmingham seeking to speak to him in connection with his uncle&apos;s murder, Mr Rauf made a life in Bahawalpur, marrying Mr Mustafa&apos;s daughter Saira, 21. Another of Mr Mustafa&apos;s daughters is married to Maulana Masood Azhar, a leading militant who was released by India in 1999 after a hijacked Indian plane was forced to land in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan. Mr Rauf, who arrived in Pakistan in western clothes, soon grew his beard, donned a shalwar kameez and started to pray five times a day. For four years he worked as an honest and pious businessman, according to friends and relatives in Bahawalpur. Umer Ahmed, 22, his brother-in-law, said he moved about in rickshaws, mixed little with local people and planned to set up a cosmetics business. &quot;He would sell make-up and talcum powder, that sort of thing,&quot; he said. Mr Rauf also travelled the country with the Tablighi, a high-profile Islamic organisation that dispatches preachers across Pakistan and the world. Then last August Mr Rauf was arrested by the ISI, in a move that sparked arrests and raids in the UK linked to an alleged plot to blow up transatlantic airliners. According to officials in Pakistan, Mr Rauf was picked up near Islamabad airport on August 10, 2006, when he gave a false name and produced a false ID card. But his lawyer and family claim that he was pulled off a bus travelling from Bahawalpur to Multan several days earlier. Shortly after the arrest Pakistani police raided Mr Rauf&apos;s house in Bahawalpur, seizing his laptop, passport, mobile phone, video camera, and \u00a34,000 in cash. Mr Rauf&apos;s relatives suspect that foreign, possibly British officials, were watching from a distance in a car with blacked out windows which was parked down the street. Relatives say that the 29 bottles of hydrogen peroxide also found in his possession, according to the charge sheet, were used to bleach his beard. The British communicated with Pakistan their interest in Mr Rauf. But terrorist charges against him, which accused him of being a key figure behind the alleged suicide plot to blow up airliners, were dropped last December by a court inPakistan in a move that surprised British security and intelligence officials. Since then the Pakistani authorities have charged Mr Rauf with terrorist related offences in Pakistan, making clear their investigations take precedence over that of the British. When Margaret Beckett, the foreign secretary, visited Pakistan last month she made clear Britain&apos;s interest in the extradition of Mr Rauf. She was told, however, that Pakistan wanted reciprocity. According to British sources in Islamabad it was at this meeting that the name of Mehran Baluch was first mentioned as an individual that the Pakistanis wanted in return for Mr Rauf. Since then sources in Islamabad have told the Guardian that the Pakistanis want up to eight individuals, including Mr Baluch and Gazian Marri, though he is thought to be living in Dubai. The revelation means the Rauf case is now caught up in the increasingly delicate relationship between the British and Pakistani security and intelligence agencies. With as many as 40,000 young British citizens of Pakistani descent going to Pakistan each year, security sources say the frightening evidence of a growing number of Britons with links to Pakistan apparently prepared to commit terrorist acts in the UK, is a top of priority for both MI5 and MI6. In that climate Britain is struggling to develop closer ties with the ISI, whose help is needed to monitor the activities of suspect Britons of Pakistani descent.

In increasingly tense discussions, the British government is demanding the return of Rashid Rauf, a 26-year-old who is held in a high security prison in Pakistan. But ministers in Pakistan have responded by asking for something in return. In a proposed swap, they are calling for the extradition of up to eight people living in the UK who they claim are involved in an uprising in the western oil-rich province of Baluchistan. Lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service flew to Islamabad last month to try to speed up the process and help the authorities prepare extradition papers for the eight, according to sources in the Pakistani capital. But human rights groups have condemned any attempt to &quot;barter&quot; individuals, and warned both governments that the due process of the law must be followed. Mr Rauf, originally from Birmingham, was arrested by Pakistani police last August. He has been charged in Pakistan with possession of 29 bottles of hydrogen peroxide - a key ingredient used in the past by al-Qaida in the manufacture of bombs - and the possession of fake South African identity papers. Anti-terrorist sources in the UK claim Mr Rauf is a &quot;very important&quot; suspect in the network of British-based Islamist terrorists. His arrest by Pakistan&apos;s security services, the ISI, last August sparked a series of raids in Britain in connection with what counter-terrorism officials said was an attempt to blow up transatlantic airliners. Fifteen people have been charged with terrorism offences in connection with the alleged plot. Mr Rauf&apos;s family in Pakistan say the charges against him have been &quot;cooked up&quot;. One told the Guardian he bought the hydrogen peroxide to bleach his beard. Among those whom the Pakistanis want extradited are Mehran Baluch and Ghazian Marri, leading figures in the nationalist movement in Baluchistan, where President General Pervez Musharraf is quelling an insurgency. Pakistani sources claim Mr Marri is the kingpin of the rebel Baluchistan Liberation Army, which was added to the Home Office list of proscribed organisations in a surprise move last summer, just as negotiations over the extradition of Mr Rauf were about to begin. Mr Marri&apos;s friends say he was arrested in Dubai last March at the request of the Pakistan authorities, but released four months later because they were unable to present any evidence. He remains at liberty. Mr Baluch, 33, who lives in London, is the chairman of the Baluchistan Rights Movement. He has lived in the UK for more than 20 years, has a British passport and speaks regularly at United Nations conferences on the human rights of the Baluchi population in the region where 73 of the 99 abductions registered by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan took place last year. Speaking to the Guardian, Mr Baluch said: &quot;I knew that they were after me but I never knew they were to that extent. When I speak at the UN in Geneva they try to threaten me through various groups to tell me to take my issues back home, that they are not international issues. I have grown up with this threat, but I didn&apos;t think they would go to these lengths. &quot;What offences have I committed? I am standing up for human rights, I am speaking out against the disappearances going on Baluchistan. &quot;I would like to tell the British they need to understand the Baluchi perspective and the whole story. They should not just see this from a Pakistani point of view. They are lying. Pakistan is committing human rights abuses in Baluchistan. My job primarily is to speak out against this. I address issues of human rights, especially the disappearances.&quot; The CPS refused to discuss whether lawyers had been sent to Pakistan to help with Islamabad&apos;s extradition requests for Mr Baluch, Mr Marri and up to six others. But a British source in Islamabad said officials from the CPS had travelled to Pakistan earlier this month. One British official said the Pakistanis were having difficulty producing evidence which could stand up in a British court. Ali Hasan, south Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch, said: &quot;There isn&apos;t a problem with the British exploring the legal options.

But the remote Scottish island of Canna does have two new inhabitants after a worldwide appeal by its owners, the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), to help repopulate the island. Sheila Gunn, 50 and her 58-year-old husband, John Clare, a former Royal Navy sailor, were among 350 people who applied to live on the island, which lies south-west of Skye. Ms Gunn previously ran a guesthouse in Oban and spent time working on Canna as a relief teacher while her husband served with the navy for 28 years and spent 12 working in police support. She said: &quot;We are delighted to have been given this wonderful opportunity and are very grateful to the island community and the National Trust for Scotland for inviting us to join them on the island. &quot;I am looking forward to being involved with the challenges ahead and assisting with the development of the school.&quot; The NTS advertised for new residents after the population of Canna dwindled to just 15 inhabitants, the lowest ever recorded on the island. The competition attracted applicants from the UK, Dubai, Nova Scotia in Canada, Australia, the US, Germany, South Africa and Japan, before the NTS came up with a shortlist of six families before settling on Ms Gunn and Mr Clare. The four-mile-long island, which was gifted to the trust by the Gaelic scholar, John Lorne Campbell, 25 years ago, has a rich archaeological heritage. Evidence suggests people have lived on it since the fifth millennium BC. It has the remnants of neolithic farms, a nunnery or hermitage reputed to be one of Scotland&apos;s three earliest Christian settlements, Celtic crosses, Bronze Age burial mounds and forts, and the ruins of derelict 19th century townships. Most of Canna&apos;s adult population are all linked by one name - MacKinnon, a family name whose history stretches back on Canna to the Jacobite rebellion of 1745. The island has views thought to be among the most spectacular in the British Isles. But the NTS warned applicants that life can be very harsh. It bluntly told applicants that the island can be &quot;very challenging ... winters are long, dark and can be hard for those not used to it&quot;. The footbridge linking Canna and the nearby island, Sanday, was torn down by a storm in January 2005. After the NTS launched its appeal, Winnie Mackinnon told the Guardian&apos;s Severin Carrell that Canna can quickly get under a visitor&apos;s skin. &quot;You see people coming off the ferry and they&apos;re like a coiled spring, but by the end of the week that spring has started to uncoil,&quot; she said. &quot;In places like London you&apos;re going fast, fast, moving, moving, time-check, time-check.

To date in his unbeaten six-race career, he has been discreet by name and nature, appearing only rarely to win with complete authority, and only once at Grade One level. Looking at him yesterday, though, it was clear that this could be the year when patience has its reward. The consensus among those who had seen Discreet Cat race in the flesh last season, when his five wins included the Grade One Cigar Mile at Aqueduct, was that he looks like a different horse. He is taller, stronger, a colt whose body has developed into an ideal match for his exceptional engine, and under the lights at Nad Al Sheba racecourse on Saturday night, Frankie Dettori will get a chance to work through his gears. No fewer than 47 of Godolphin&apos;s team to race in Europe, America and the Far East this season either worked or cantered here yesterday, but there is no doubt that Discreet Cat is the one that really matters. This time last year, he beat Invasor, who went on to win the Breeders&apos; Cup Classic, by seven lengths in the UAE Derby on World Cup night, in receipt of 9lb. If he could beat the same horse again at level weights in the World Cup itself, he would be Godolphin&apos;s most exciting stallion prospect since the ill-fated Dubai Millennium won the same race seven years ago. &quot;As you can see, he looks ready to go,&quot; Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, said yesterday as Discreet Cat trotted onto the track. &quot;He&apos;s a very relaxed horse, but he&apos;s got a very tough constitution as well. He&apos;s a horse who keeps himself fit, he&apos;s an active type and has never carried much conditions, so fitness is not going to be an issue on Saturday night. &quot;We&apos;ve always handled him carefully, and given him time to grow into his frame, and we never rushed him too early in his career. He&apos;s never raced over further than a mile and a furlong, he gives every impression that if he relaxes in the early stages of the race he should stay the extra furlong on Saturday really well. &quot;We have not been around many horses like this one, and we&apos;d have to be hopeful that he will still be unbeaten after Saturday&apos;s race.&quot; Invasor too looked much stronger as a four-year-old when he cantered at Nad Al Sheba on Sunday, and while Discreet Cat is still the marginal favourite with many bookmakers, others now bracket the pair of them together. William Hill offer 11-8 the pair, then 6-1 about Premium Tap, who finished third in the Breeders&apos; Cup Classic last autumn, and 20-1 bar. Godolphin&apos;s other main contenders for Saturday&apos;s card, which includes the Dubai Duty Free and the Sheema Classic, the most valuable turf races of the year, were also working yesterday, but their most interesting runner could be Folk, who has already won the UAE 1,000 Guineas and Oaks and now runs in the UAE Derby. &quot;She&apos;s a fantastic filly, and she&apos;ll be getting a 13lb pull with the southern hemisphere runners,&quot; Crisford said. &quot;She looks the ideal sort to be a real flag-bearer for Godolphin in North America this year.&quot; The operation&apos;s interest in the British Classics, though, may already be pointing towards Epsom in June rather than Newmarket&apos;s Guineas meeting in May. Truly Royal and Dijeerr earned a mention from Frankie Dettori yesterday as possible rides in the 2,000 Guineas, but it is Eastern Anthem who is thought to be his most likely mount in the Derby at this stage. &quot;He&apos;s really filled up to his potential and he&apos;s going really well, so he&apos;d have to be on the shortlist,&quot; Dettori said. Measured Tempo, a Newmarket maiden winner on her only start, is expected to miss the 1,000 Guineas, to be prepared for an Oaks trial, probably the Musidora Stakes at York. &quot;She&apos;s full of quality and class,&quot; Crisford said, &quot;but she&apos;s going to need middle distances, so I don&apos;t think she&apos;s going to be a Guineas filly.&quot;", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Frankie Dettori"], "title": "Horse racing: Dettori has Cat purring ahead of ultimate test", "sentences": ["Three days before the race that could make him the biggest draw in international Flat racing, Discreet Cat cantered around the Al Quoz training track here in Dubai yesterday with the smooth composure of a horse who is ready to go about his business.", "If he could beat the same horse again at level weights in the World Cup itself, he would be Godolphin&apos;s most exciting stallion prospect since the ill-fated Dubai Millennium won the same race seven years ago.", "Godolphin&apos;s other main contenders for Saturday&apos;s card, which includes the Dubai Duty Free and the Sheema Classic, the most valuable turf races of the year, were also working yesterday, but their most interesting runner could be Folk, who has already won the UAE 1,000 Guineas and Oaks and now runs in the UAE Derby."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/29/horseracing.sport1", "publicationDate": "2007-03-29T21:49:06Z"}, {"article": "Invasor and Discreet Cat, the favourites for the Dubai World Cup on Saturday, will set off from opposite ends of the starting gate after they were allotted stalls seven and one respectively at the draw ceremony yesterday evening.

Yet sometimes it is easier to remember one bad run than several good ones, and Sir Percy&apos;s mission is a treacherous one after his dismal effort in the Champion Stakes last October. And it is not just his own reputation that will be up for review when the field sets off for the Dubai Sheema Classic, but to some extent the good name of the Derby too. The Epsom Classic is still a special contest, and one that comes with baggage as well as glory. The Derby winner represents the race whenever he enters a set of starting stalls, and in recent seasons they have not been doing so with much distinction. One bookmaker is offering just 5-4 that he will fail to win any sort of race this year, so it is a gamble to keep Sir Percy racing at four. When the possible payoffs include the joint-richest prize in turf racing, though, it is a difficult one to refuse. The first prize in the Sheema Classic is $3m, roughly three times the sum that Sir Percy earned for his connections at Epsom last year. His value as a stallion might well increase by significantly more than that, however, if he could complete the rare feat of a Grade One victory at two, three and four. &quot;Physically, he&apos;s not changed an awful lot,&quot; Marcus Tregoning, Sir Percy&apos;s trainer, said yesterday. &quot;He&apos;s the same height and the same weight as he was when he won the Derby, so whether that means that some of the more backward horses from last year will have caught up with him now, I don&apos;t know. &quot;We&apos;re coming back from a disappointing race, but he seems to have done very well out here considering that he&apos;s been training on his own. He&apos;s been feeding very well and he&apos;s looking fine, so we&apos;re just hoping that he&apos;s going to run like that as well, as his last effort was very disappointing. &quot;The whole season was stop-start last year. It was a nightmare in the run-up to Epsom, because he had been jarred up when he finished second to George Washington in the Guineas, and even two weeks before the Derby there was a real chance that we would have to pull him out. It was all so stop-start that we had to give him a really good break afterwards, and I think that maybe the core fitness just wasn&apos;t there in the autumn.&quot; It is a measure of the strength of the field tomorrow that last year&apos;s Derby winner may not start favourite, with both Brian Meehan&apos;s Red Rocks, who took the Breeders&apos; Cup Turf in November, and Pop Rock, who was narrowly beaten in the Melbourne Cup, jostling with Sir Percy at the head of the latest betting. Overlook his last run, though, and Sir Percy&apos;s form remains impressive, not least the fact that he won the Derby at all having been marooned many lengths off the pace coming down to Tattenham Corner. &quot;We thought at the time that he had far too much ground to make up,&quot; Tregoning says, &quot;and we couldn&apos;t believe the stroke of luck he got with that run up the rail. If he&apos;d been beaten a short-head we might have thought that it was a terrible ride [by Martin Dwyer] so that shows you how easily things can turn around. &quot;Maybe he&apos;s still got something to prove and maybe he hasn&apos;t, but the main point about him is that his target was achieved when he won the Derby. It was a great day for all of us, though looking back I think I should possibly have made a bit more of it at the time. The trouble is that it comes too early in the year. You really want to be winning big races in the autumn, when the sales are on.&quot; Red Rocks is likely to be the horse to beat tomorrow night, when Brian Meehan will hope to take one of the card&apos;s two $5m events for the second year running. &quot;He&apos;s well, and he&apos;s giving me the same vibes that he did before the Breeders&apos; Cup,&quot; Meehan said yesterday.

BA decided not to renew the \u00a31.5m annual rent to advertise at the roundabout at the airport&apos;s entrance after a presence lasting 16 years.   The scaled-down model is passed by more than 25 million travellers annually - more than 400 million over the last decade and a half - making it one of the most valuable advertising properties.   More than 80% of passengers are affluent ABC1s, the most valuable consumer group.   It was reported that the Concorde model may be broken up if a good home cannot be found.   Industry observers were shocked at BA&apos;s decision to give up the site.   Emirates Airlines saw off stiff competition for the site to sign a six-year deal, raising its profile during the 2012 Olympic Games.   It will replace the much-loved Concorde with a model of a double-decker Airbus A380 superjumbo.

It will have rights to the site, which is seen by passengers travelling by road to Terminals One, Two and Three, from Sunday.

There is the beautiful and leggy female presenter, Rouda bin Hafez, the over-designed set with a sweeping walkway, giant video screens and a revolving stage bathed in lilac lights. From my seat, directly behind the panel of five judges, I can use an electronic key pad to vote for my favourite performer; though the ultimate winner will be decided by SMS texts from a TV audience reckoned at 17 million across the Arab world. However, despite the format, this is a far cry from the karaoke contests we have grown used to in Britain. Instead of the familiar mix of R&amp;B ballads and selections from the Broadway songbook, contestants from drawn from all the Arab nations recite their own poetry, composed in a traditional Bedouin style called Nabati that dates back to the fourth century. Even the judges are different: respected academics and poets who weigh the contestants use of metre and imagery with unfeigned sincerity, and none of the personalised slurs or gushing pronouncements of star quality one expects from Simon Cowell and his cohorts. Fifty years ago, Abu Dhabi city was a small settlement of some 30 to 40 extended households. Today, the capital of the Emirates has a population of 800,000, the vast majority foreign nationals. The city is about to embark on a building programme that will soon overshadow its neighbour, Dubai. The Millions&apos; Poet contest, as the show is called, is part of a wider cultural debate sponsored by the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan that includes museum projects, book prizes and incentives for publishers to relocate to Abu Dhabi, as well as the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair that will operate as a joint venture with Frankfurt, the world&apos;s largest publishing expo. As the first of tonight&apos;s aspiring Millions&apos; Poet takes to the stage, there is a sudden burst of applause and the Crown Prince sweeps into the auditorium with his entourage, bowing slightly to the audience before taking a seat at the front of the stage. The Prince, the younger brother of the president of the Emirates, is a charismatic man with hooded eyes that recall Martin Amis&apos;s image, aimed at Salman Rushdie, of a falcon staring through a venetian blind. In a break from filming, the Crown Prince shares his thoughts on the city&apos;s future. Unaccustomed to meeting royalty, I somehow combine a curtsey with a Prussian heel-click and the Prince&apos;s eyes momentarily widen in surprise, though he recovers enough to talk about the challenge of balancing the old and the new. He reflects that his grandfather travelled everywhere by foot or camel, while the Emirates are now a hub for global air travel. Despite the million dirham prize - about \u00a3170,000 - and the rest of the hoopla that even includes a glossy pin-up magazine, Nabati speaks to a specifically Bedouin experience. This ancient lineage, the prince suggests, can be continually rekindled to remind Emiratis of their history. Nashwa Al-Ruwaini, the producer of Millions&apos; Poet, admits that the very visible support of the Crown Prince has been one of the reasons for the show&apos;s success. &quot;Advertisers have tended to push the media to develop chat and pop formats, very spicy shows,&quot; she says. &quot;But every time we borrowed from the west, the shows haven&apos;t really worked. We had Arabic Big Brother and it closed before the end of its run.&quot; Poetry shows have been a staple of Arabic television but, Nashwa says, &quot;they normally have low production values, we decided to switch that.&quot; The Millions&apos; Poet show was provided with a government-funded budget of 43m dirham - about \u00a37m. As far as I can see, the money is up on the stage, but Nashwa says the biggest expense came during pre-production. &quot;We met 6,000 poets from across the Arab states and produced a shortlist of 700, which we slimmed to 48 for the contest here in Abu Dhabi,&quot; she says. This pre-production stage was shown as a three-hour documentary before the contest began its run on December 7, 2006, in the 2,000-seat Al Raha Beach Theatre. Nashwa is the CEO of her own production company and, as the host of a popular chat show, is often described as the Arab Oprah Winfrey. Yet she admits she knew little about Nabati when she won the Millions&apos; Poet commission and was taken aback to find so many ordinary people composing verses. The Arabic language is commonly divided into classical and colloquial. The language of newspapers or sermons is often contrasted with the everyday language as it is spoken in the various Arab countries. Yet there is an equally telling distinction between the language of the settled communities - the ancient cities of the Fertile Crescent and the Nile delta - and the language spoken by the nomads and erstwhile nomads of the Gulf cities like Abu Dhabi. The Arabic of the Bedouins has developed more slowly, in a more conservative milieu. Nashwa, a Cairo-born Egyptian, says, &quot;Producing the show has been an eye-opener. I had an office here in Abu Dhabi and I was receiving calls from Egypt, but from the Sinai, and from their accents I assumed they were Emiratis.&quot; Although a few contestants have come from as far away as Somalia and Morocco, the show has its strongest following in the nations that share a Bedouin identity. This is reflected by the five judges who come from the Gulf and Jordan, as well as by tonight&apos;s poets who represent Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar. The first contestant is a thin-faced Kuwaiti named Abdel Karim Al-Jabari who has arranged his keffiyah so artfully, his face seems to be swathed in an elaborately folded napkin. Abdel&apos;s poem begins as a paean to his virtues as a son of Kuwait before announcing, in the second half, that he comes as an ambassador from one great prince to another: Kuwait to Abu Dhabi. Nabati is a poetry of two halves, where a theme is first developed before being turned around and elevated in the second half. Abdel&apos;s switch from boasts to courtly tribute brings an enthusiastic response from the audience. Yet the judges are markedly less impressed. The Jordanian judge is particularly critical, suggesting that the theme is far too familiar. The Saudi contestant, in contrast, has far fresher images. He begins by predicting that the Millions&apos; Poet will emerge from among tonight&apos;s contestants, all so talented that they surely share the same blood, before declaring that, nevertheless, everyone should use their SMS-text messaging to vote for him. The audience breaks into laughter and applause as the Saudi turns irony against his own conceit. The Saudi poet, Faisal Al-Yami, was a minor celebrity as a songwriter before entering Millions&apos; Poet. The Qatari poet, Mohammed Fteis Al-Murri, is also well-known, an established poet who could draw audiences in the hundreds to his recitals. In tonight&apos;s poem, he compares the history of Nabati to a camel race, suggesting that many poets have wandered off in their own direction while others have only succeeded in touching their object by a short toe. Yet, he declares, with the advent of the Millions&apos; Poet contest, the course has been straightened and all the riders now run together. As he extends the imagery, each new conceit is greeted with gasps from the audience. The outsider is the contestant from Abu Dhabi, Salah Al-Mansouri. He was an unknown before the contest and even looks different to the others, rather like the chunky young Charles Bronson, and with a muscular style to match. While the others use formal hand gestures, Salah relies on his face and especially his eyes, bringing a lively arrogance to his performance. The first half of his poem causes some disquiet. He kicks off with a lengthy string of boasts that would be unremarkable in hip-hop but breaks Nabati convention by claiming his talent is his own rather than an attribute of his clan. This will provoke the Saudi judge to suggest that, at first, he felt Salah should be called &quot;The Wailer&quot;, because he appeared to be indulging in pure braggadocio. Yet Salah redeemed himself in the second movement, as he explained that his style emerged in London and was conceived on the Edgware Road. Salah has lived abroad for the past 10 years, studying first in Tulsa and now at Imperial College. Later, Salah will tell me that he regards his poetry as political. &quot;If you live in a multinational space, you learn that is okay to have the freedom to express yourself in your own way, as people do in the US and UK. I think of myself as a messenger, I&apos;m expressing what people already feel and that they now want to hear.&quot; Salah&apos;s creed of personal expression has struck a chord: he is mobbed by fans as he leaves the theatre. Salah is accompanied by his friend Suhail, an old roommate from his time in Tulsa. Suhail tells me that, while freedom of speech is guaranteed under Emirati law, open debate is always in tension with more traditional voices. &quot;This is what makes Salah so political, one has to push the boundaries for the rights to expression, otherwise you cannot even start the debate about the future.&quot; As the Million Poets&apos; final this month coincides with a national Nabati festival, it may turn out to have been a stroke of genius for the government to have kick-started debate via the medium of verse: no matter how far poets like Salah push personal expression or draw upon hip-hop, the nature of Nabati will keep returning the debate to ancient traditions. When the SMS votes came in, the established Qatari poet has won the day with his imagery of the grand camel race of Nabati. \u00b7 The Abu Dhabi International Book Fair will run from March 31 - April 7.

Tiger Woods won his first major and the planet, or at least Planet Golf, was never the same again. The game got richer and got to bask in the glory of having the most recognisable athlete in the world as one of its own. As the sport&apos;s monthly bible, Golf Digest, declared in its just published Masters edition: Ten Years Ago Golf Changed. The tag-line launches a reminiscence about Woods&apos; 12-shot victory a decade ago in which no character in the drama is deemed too peripheral, no meteorological detail thought too insignificant and no sociological analysis too portentous for a simple ball-and-stick sports event. But for the man at the centre of the maelstrom the most vivid memory of 10 years ago is also the most personal one. &quot;Considering how my life is now, the hug from my dad,&quot; Woods said during an informal conversation with reporters in Dubai recently, adding wistfully: &quot;I will never get that again.&quot; The hug was captured by television cameras as Woods made the walk from the back off the 18th green up the hill to the scorers&apos; hut where he was greeted by his father Earl, who died last year. &quot;The year before, in &apos;96, he had a heart attack, and he ended up having heart surgery again; he had complications. He was actually dead for a while, and then somehow - he used to tell this story that &apos;Yeah, I saw this warm light, I was kind of headed towards it. I said, hey, you know what, I grew up in Kansas. So let me go back the other way&apos;,&quot; Tiger recalled. &quot;And when he went back the other way all of a sudden he heard the beeping and everything; he came back. He just always used to say &quot;No, I&apos;m not ready for that place yet.&quot; So he went down to Augusta the week of Masters against doctor&apos;s orders. He wasn&apos;t supposed to travel.&quot; Woods, who won the amateur prize in 1995 with a score of five over but missed the cut by three in 1996 after two 75s, had been playing well in the run-up to the 1997 tournament but when he got to Augusta he putted badly during his practice rounds. &quot;I had the worst speeds, the worst lines, I&apos;m hitting it well, but I just cannot shake it in from anywhere. Wednesday night I go up to Dad and say &apos;Pop, can you take a look at my stroke? It feels terrible.&apos; He tells me just a couple of things and says &apos;Just go out there and do it.&apos;&quot; Woods did indeed do it, despite taking 40 shots for the opening nine holes of his first round. &quot;But I hit a good putt on nine for bogey,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I hit a wonderful iron off the tee on 10. So let me just utilise those two markers and take them forward on the back nine and get back to even par for the day. &quot;All of a sudden it happened. I made a bomb [long putt] on 10, chipped in on 12 and, you know, went through the back nine.&quot; Woods covered the back nine in 30, six under par, for a round of 70.

There is $6m (\u00a33m) in the pot, the largest prize on offer in racing, of which $3.6m goes to the winner. The horses that dominate the betting, however, are owned by men who could come upon $3.6m in the street, and leave it for someone else to pick up. For them this race about status and influence, bloodlines and legacies. And for Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum in particular, it is about Discreet Cat, a horse with the potential to be one of the sport&apos;s great champions. He has six races behind him and six victories, and for as long as he remains unbeaten there are no limits to what he might achieve, be it on the racecourse or in a covering barn at one of the Sheikh&apos;s stud farms. A horse can influence the outcome of a race, but a stallion can influence the entire thoroughbred breed. Discreet Cat races in the royal blue colours of Godolphin, the Dubai-based racing operation founded by Sheikh Mohammed in the 1990s, yet the racing is effectively a means to an end. &quot;What we are doing at Godolphin is trying to make stallions,&quot; said Simon Crisford, the organisation&apos;s racing manager. &quot;That&apos;s what we are in business to do, and one of the reasons that we use Grade One wins as a measure of our success, because those are the races that make the stallions of the future.&quot; Godolphin has produced many champions, and many stallions, during its relatively short existence. But the horse they are still looking for is one who can muscle his way to the top of American racing and breeding. Discreet Cat is their best chance yet, and possibly the best that Sheikh Mohammed will ever have. If he wins impressively tonight, he will be the must-have stallion for American breeders. We have been here before, though, just a few months ago, when Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s Bernardini contested the Breeders&apos; Cup Classic in Kentucky. One more win was all he needed to head into retirement with breeders begging for his services, but he could finish only second to Invasor, a gritty streetfighter of a horse who carries the colours of Sheikh Hamdan al Maktoum, Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s brother. Having frustrated his sibling&apos;s ambitions once, Sheikh Hamdan could now do so again, as Invasor is the obvious danger to Discreet Cat tonight. Betting is banned in Dubai, but British bookmakers have the brothers&apos; horses alongside each other at the head of the market. &quot;Punters love a head-to-head,&quot; said Simon Clare of Coral. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter that neither is trained in Britain, there is still enough of a story with two great horses up against each other to get people&apos;s interest.&quot; And Invasor is just the sort of opponent that Discreet Cat could do without. The Godolphin horse is a polished operator, who imposes his class and superiority on a race and swaggers on to the line. &quot;Class is the word with this horse,&quot; Crisford says, &quot;and he has it in abundance.&quot; Invasor, though, has shown time and again that he simply will not be intimidated. &quot;He&apos;s a very unusual horse in that he never seems to blow at all after a race,&quot; said Kiaran McLaughlin, his trainer. &quot;He can run a mile and a quarter and then he&apos;ll be all cooled out five minutes later. That makes him very special, and we&apos;re all trying to soak up as much of it as we can, because this horse is once in a lifetime.&quot; The form book suggests that Invasor and Discreet Cat will have the finish to themselves tonight, when the course of racing and breeding for years to come could turn on their struggle down the home straight. Invasor is the likelier winner if guts and courage are what count, but Discreet Cat may prove to be a class apart, and gallop to a victory that will grab the attention of racing fans on every continent. At the highest level, international Flat racing is often a game for men who seek to reinforce their influence by proving that even nature and genetics can bend to their will. Sheikh Mohammed, though, has a natural affinity for thoroughbreds, too, and the best ones are much more than just a four-legged extension of his ego. The last horse he owned with as much potential as Discreet Cat was Dubai Millennium, who was given his name at an early age in the hope that he would win the Dubai World Cup in 2000. That he duly did, with immense authority, but after just a single season at stud, he was dead. The Sheikh flew home when he heard that Dubai Millennium was dying of grass sickness, to be with his great favourite in his final hours. He then went to the sales and all but cornered the market in Dubai Millennium yearlings, but that single crop of foals did not yield a worthy heir. Now, you suspect, he thinks he has found one.

It was the mirror on the racing wall that would tell us which was the fleetest of them all in the desert kingdom. Ultimately, there was a brutal beauty about the victorious performance of Invasor, the best horse in the world last year and no semblance of a diminished performer this. But for Discreet Cat the dream is over, the unbeaten record over. For him, the mirror cracked. Invasor was first and the Cat was last and never again must we place the value of potential above proven performance. Invasor is now as low as 3-1 favourite for the Breeders&apos; Cup Classic in November, the race that signposted his arrival at the racing summit last season. It is a horrible price for a race so many months away where so many pitfalls lie ahead, yet such was the authority and bloody-mindedness with which Invasor succeeded that others are hard to consider. About the only further combatant worthy of consideration at this stage is America&apos;s Premium Tap, the horse beaten into second place last night and the equine athlete who ensured that the notion of the Dubai World Cup as a head-to-head was not a total nonsense. In the night, under a starless sky, Discreet Cat had looked ready to rumble, his burnished hide gleaming under the floodlights. It was to prove a false canvas. Premium Tap and Invasor had turned up embarrassingly on the big night in similar outfits, both wearing bandages behind. Premium Tap was most recalcitrant down at the start, raising the terrible prospect that he had come halfway round the world and was about to refuse the last two steps to go into the starting stalls. He eventually went in and eventually came out, a sluggish participant in the early stages. From then, though, Premium Tap&apos;s attitude could not be questioned. Kent Desormeaux forced his mount to the lead as the rest shuffled around in behind to launch a strike. Invasor was never far back under Fernando Jara, while Discreet Cat appeared to be ridden with near hubris by Frankie Dettori, on the rail and far back, giving away plenty of territory to the best horses he had ever faced. By the entrance to the straight, and with 600 metres of harsh action to come, the phoney war was over. Yet it soon became apparent there might be a phoney in the field. Discreet Cat was asked for his effort by Dettori and this was the moment when we would discover what sort of feline he was, either a tiger or a tabby. In a dispiriting instant Dettori would have learned it was the latter. Discreet Cat fizzled out immediately as two older, and now we must say, better, combatants pulled on their helmets. Jara&apos;s extravagant looks round suggested that he knew that Invasor had too much petrol for the others. But that was to discount the combative tendency of Premium Tap. He did not give up the good fight easily. Desormeaux pointed him determinedly up the rail, but there was to be no way back after Invasor had poached his initial advantage. The winning distance was a length and three-quarters. Ultimately, it was not flash, but then Invasor does not do flamboyance. He does hardiness, professionalism and ruthlessness. It is what has made him the best horse in the world. It continues to do so. The Godolphin masters of Discreet Cat were wandering mazily around the trenches in the aftermath. &apos;We are very disappointed,&apos; said Simon Crisford, the team&apos;s racing manager. &apos;We will let the dust settle and take it from there.&apos; Dettori added: &apos;He was beaten before the turn. He didn&apos;t like the kickback.&apos; Invasor was the second Dubai World Cup winner for owner Sheikh Hamdan Al Maktoum after Almutawakel in 1999. &apos;I was confident at the three-eighths pole because he was going so easily and Fernando had a ton of horse,&apos; said Kiaran McLaughlin, the winning trainer. &apos;Premium Tap dug in, but I was never really worried.

Officials in Riyadh say they have seen an 80-90% success rate in a &quot;counter-radicalisation&quot; campaign designed to wean extremists detained by the security forces off the &quot;takfiri&quot; ideology that permits the killing of fellow Muslims and motivates Saudis involved in jihad in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some 140 members of al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula have died in clashes with security forces since attacks began in May 2003. Two thousand men had been through the programme, with 700 released and a negligible rate of re-offending, said General Mansour al-Turki, the government security spokesman. Abu Suleiman, 33, has seen the error of his ways. &quot;I got involved in jihad when I was 20,&quot; he explained in the American-accented English picked up during four years spent in Guant\u00e1namo Bay after his capture at Tora Bora in late 2001. &quot;Bin Laden is a quiet guy but he can work magic with people when he talks,&quot; said the holy warrior-turned financial analyst. &quot;Being in jail gives you a lot of time to think. I had good intentions. I wanted to help Muslims round the world, but I felt I was being used for other purposes. This programme is working for a lot of people.&quot; Prisoners undergo social and psychological profiling, take part in 10-week courses and are helped to find jobs and even wives as part of intensive after-care support that includes cash handouts for their families. Some refuse to participate. &quot;But we don&apos;t force them,&quot; Gen Turki said. The more inveterate detainees will face trials, but no major cases have yet been launched and there seems to be no hurry to start, diplomats say, underlining the sensitivity of the issue in this deeply conservative country, home to 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers. The death penalty will probably be imposed in some cases, with public beheadings in central Riyadh. The softly-softly approach contrasts sharply with reports of the torture of security detainees as documented by Human Rights Watch. The official Saudi account of the programme cannot be independently verified but many details are confirmed by western diplomats, with the US and Britain keen to point to its successes. Another &quot;graduate&quot;, Abu Khaled, 25, works in civil defence after recanting during a two-year jail term served on returning from Afghanistan. &quot;I recognised that I made a mistake,&quot; he says. &quot;I feel guilt and remorse for what I did.&quot; Dr Abdul-Rahman al-Hadlaq, a ministerial adviser, argues that although al-Qaida has been beaten in Saudi Arabia, &quot;military action&quot; cannot be the only means. The &quot;war of ideas&quot; is being fought on websites based in Europe that glorify jihad and violence against &quot;unbelievers&quot;. Saudi religious scholars deploy Qur&apos;anic arguments online to rebut claims about jihad, but dislike suggestions that Wahhabism, the puritanical Saudi brand of Salafi Islam, has any link to terrorism. Programmes are in place in Saudi schools and mosques to combat extremist ideas, but the challenge now is the export of extremists, says Dr Hadlaq. Young people, he says, &quot;lie to their families and say they are going to Mecca or Beirut or Dubai and later they turn up in Iraq&quot;. For all the vaunted success of the programme, &quot;we sometimes get questions we can&apos;t answer&quot;, admitted Sheikh Muhammad al-Nujaimi, who works with prisoners. &quot;Like, &apos;Why did you let us go to Afghanistan to fight the Russians then but won&apos;t let us go there now to fight the Americans?&apos;&quot; But the response is clear, insists Gen Turki, faithful to the official line: &quot;At the time the Saudi government permitted it and the ulama issued fatwas encouraging it.

That&apos;s not just in this country, not just in Europe, but worldwide.&quot; March 2007: Shepherd writes in his programme notes before a dismal defeat by Manchester City which leaves Newcastle concerned about their Premiership status: &quot;Many other clubs would have given a great deal to have reached the last 16 of the Uefa Cup.&quot; Newcastle were never that mighty but now they are fallen. How far they drop remains to be seen but back in the good old days it can be guaranteed Shepherd&apos;s lofty thoughts were not on Bramall Lane. Now, however, Newcastle travel to Sheffield United on Saturday having failed to score in the league since February 10, with one point from a possible 12, players visibly jaded and in some cases, such as Scott Parker, having disputes with fans who openly questioned the team&apos;s attitude. They have a manager in Glenn Roeder who saw the last of Tyneside&apos;s public confidence drain away here to be replaced by sarcasm and mockery. In white shirts Newcastle could have been England. &quot;It has not crossed my mind,&quot; said Roeder of relegation. &quot;There are plenty of teams below us with less points. You should ask them if they are looking over their shoulder. I understand the fans&apos; frustration. I was frustrated myself that we found it difficult to break them down.&quot; Of course, with 37 points already - seven more than Charlton - Newcastle should not go down. In all likelihood they will not but the threat brings one back to Shepherd in 2003. He will find this unacceptable; it means that, whereas Roeder being in charge at St James&apos; Park next season felt plausible a few weeks ago, today it feels the opposite. The mood post-Alkmaar was already turning darker. Roeder, a former captain and the man who turned last season around after Graeme Souness was sacked - following a defeat by City - has had support from the Newcastle board. It ensured he was not isolated when Birmingham City won 5-1 in the FA Cup at St James&apos;. But the supporters&apos; discontent was merely on hold and the Uefa Cup defeat in Alkmaar, according to senior players, meant &quot;the season is over&quot;. Unfortunately no one told Charlton and the rest. Roeder&apos;s vocal challenges have not endeared him to the dressing room. Michael Owen, meanwhile, was photographed in Dubai watching horse racing. His commitment to England unquestionable. He is due to play a practice game against Hartlepool in a fortnight. It is starting to look unpleasant and now Bramall Lane looms. Sheffield United&apos;s 1-0 win in November provoked a &quot;sack the board&quot; demonstration and the same chant was heard again after this 14th league defeat. It was not so loud - Roeder&apos;s substitutions caused a much greater outcry - and, with Shepherd intent on buying full control of the club but unable to persuade Alan Shearer to return, the disillusioned may have to stay that way. City fans know all about that. They cannot be fooled by the two away wins here and at Middlesbrough. But this is a poor division and bad victories take you up the table. At least Stuart Pearce, who thinks &quot;it might require the highest points total yet&quot; to stay up, delivered some realism. &quot;Let&apos;s be honest,&quot; he said, &quot;the season is still on the point of implosion. We are still six points from the drop zone and we were six points from the drop before kick-off, so nothing has changed. All it has done is condensed the teams. All of a sudden we have done ourselves a favour and put Newcastle in the mix.&quot; It was Emile Mpenza who did it, in the 80th minute, running away from on-trial Oguchi Onyewu. Newcastle had a flat back four despite City playing one up front. Stephen Carr was predictably surly. Newcastle then hit the bar, by which time the strangely ignored James Milner had been sent on. Pearce said he was off to listen to the audio version of Lionel Shriver&apos;s We Need To Talk About Kevin. It was a lamentable match, and for both clubs the lament goes on. Man of the match: Michael Johnson It was the 19-year-old&apos;s third start and he impressed with his poise and passing alongside Joey Barton, albeit in a dour midfield tussle.

Sunil Sehgal, director of a Wembley-based IT firm, Transputec Computers, and his wife Seema are the first people to be named in an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission , the Wall Street regulator, into unusual dealing in the run-up to TXU&apos;s takeover in February. The SEC says there were &quot;highly suspicious purchases of speculative call options&quot; in TXU, partly made through the London branch of the investment bank UBS, yielding profits of $5.3m for an unknown number of people involved. Call options are bets that a share price will rise in the short term. When TXU&apos;s imminent takeover was disclosed, its stock leapt by 13%. Mr and Mrs Sehgal are accused of making $270,000 from their part in the well-timed deal. Court documents say that in the course of two months, the couple bought similar options in four other US companies - Caremark, John Harland, Hydril and TiVo, of which all except TiVo were the subject of takeovers within days. Mr Sehgal, who is known as Sonny, is sales director of Transputec, a computer concern he controls with his brother, Rickie. The brothers are leading lights in Britain&apos;s Asian business community. Rickie Sehgal is secretary of the Hindu Forum and was recently profiled by the International Network for Asian Businesses. The SEC&apos;s affidavit notes that Transputec is &quot;an information technology consulting company with offices in the United Kingdom, Dubai and India, that, among other things, serves the technological needs of several financial services companies and law firms&quot;. Nobody answered calls to Transputec yesterday. The company was formed in 1984 and had its first big breakthrough with a software development contract with Chase Manhattan Bank. According to its website, its recent clients include Accor Hotels, Paperchase, the stationer, and a law firm, Salans. The SEC named the couple in court because Mrs Sehgal this week removed $100,000 of her trading profits from an account at the US stockbroker Charles Schwab. A judge in Chicago granted a restraining order on Friday freezing the couple&apos;s remaining assets in America. &quot;This case presents an emergency,&quot; said the SEC. &quot;The commission&apos;s past experience is that persons who violate federal securities laws by engaging in illegal insider trading often attempt to move assets beyond the effective jurisdiction of the US courts.&quot; Last month, the court issued a restraining order requiring the London branch of UBS to freeze any outstanding profit from the options trades, although the bank told the court it did not know the identity of those involved. In a further injunction, the judge ordered Credit Suisse and a German Bank, Fimat Banque Frankfurt Zweigniederlassung, to disclose the identity of people responsible for suspicious options trading. In a coordinated effort, the SEC has been working on the case with the Chicago Board of Trade, which specialises in options trading, and the Financial Services Authority in London. Although it said it had not completed its investigation and had been forced into early action, the SEC&apos;s affidavit said: &quot;The circumstantial evidence that it has developed in the very few days the commission has been aware of the Sehgal defendants&apos; trading strongly indicates that the defendants purchased TXU call options while in possession of material, non-public information.&quot; TXU&apos;s buyout by a consortium including Texas Pacific and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts was the biggest yet in a series of multi-billion-dollar private equity buyouts of public corporations on both sides of the Atlantic.", "tags": ["Business", "US news", "World news"], "title": "British couple named in US insider deal inquiry", "sentences": ["The SEC&apos;s affidavit notes that Transputec is &quot;an information technology consulting company with offices in the United Kingdom, Dubai and India, that, among other things, serves the technological needs of several financial services companies and law firms&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/02/usnews.frontpagenews", "publicationDate": "2007-04-02T00:43:01Z"}, {"article": "On Friday night, in front of the iconic Burj Al Arab hotel, Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai revealed his plans for a new racecourse that promises to be the finest sporting venue of any sort, anywhere in the world. Twenty-four hours later though, at the track that he built just a few years ago, he could only watch as another grand plan dribbled away into the dirt. Discreet Cat, the horse he had hoped would conquer America this year, suffered an ignominious defeat behind Invasor in the Dubai World Cup at Nad Al Sheba. Yesterday, Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, reported that the colt had developed &quot;an aggressive throat abscess&quot; in the 48 hours before the race. &quot;Breathing would have been difficult during the race, which explains his performance,&quot; he added. Whatever the cause, though, the aura of invincibility is gone. People remember results, not reasons. If horses could be made from bricks and mortar, the Sheikh&apos;s string would dominate the sport much as the Burj dominates the beach. Flesh and blood does not respond to his ambition quite so readily, however, and whether it is in the breeding, the buying or the training, something is not right in his operation at present. Saturday&apos;s meeting had been a wretched one for Godolphin even before Discreet Cat&apos;s capitulation, with search parties required for fancied runners like Eu Tambem, Folk and Best Alibi. Discreet Cat&apos;s performance, though, was excruciating, and while Sheikh Mohammed smiled for the cameras as he handed the trophy to his brother Sheikh Hamdan, Invasor&apos;s owner, his disappointment must have been immense. Invasor has improved sharply since he finished seven lengths behind Discreet Cat in last year&apos;s UEA Derby and, while his rival was curling up, he knuckled down, holding off Premium Tap by one and three-quarter lengths, the pair clear. Invasor&apos;s ultimate aim this year is a second win in the Breeders&apos; Cup Classic, while Discreet Cat will also be going back to America and possibly back to a mile. The contrast between Discreet Cat&apos;s performance and his owner&apos;s grand plans for racing both in Dubai and around the world could not have been more complete. Nad Al Sheba looked magnificent on Saturday night, an inspirational oasis of light in the desert, yet within three years it will be surplus to requirements. Sheikh Mohammed expects his new &quot;racing city&quot; at Meydan, close to the current track, to be ready for the 2010 Dubai World Cup, and what the Sheikh expects, he tends to get. Prizemoney for the race that year will, he said, be &quot;at least $10m&quot;, which is another way of saying that if anyone comes up with a bigger prize, Dubai will trump it. At the moment, Meydan exists only as an architect&apos;s model, but even brief inspection suggests that it will be something like twice the size of the new Ascot. Anyone who thought that Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s urge to build, innovate and develop might subside as he heads through his 60s was clearly mistaken, and even this vast project is probably just another step in his long-term plans. He is unlikely to tell anyone what those plans might be, but it does no harm to speculate. One problem which even the Sheikh can do nothing about, for instance, is the summer heat in Dubai, so a spring-to-autumn racing season alongside that in Europe and North America seems unlikely, although dozens of training barns were an interesting feature of the Meydan model. But a single feature meeting at the &quot;wrong&quot; end of the season is hardly sufficient for such a facility. Champions are crowned in the autumn, which is when a showpiece venue like Meydan should be staging its main events. Invasor&apos;s success on Saturday showed America that their horses can produce their best form without medication and after travelling many thousands of miles. If the prizemoney is good enough - and Dubai&apos;s cash reserves are virtually limitless - then why not tempt them at the other end of the year, too? A Breeders&apos; Cup-style meeting in the autumn, in the original home of the thoroughbred, would be one logical step once Meydan is built. Who knows, there might even be on-course betting too. Only one man knows for sure. There seems no doubt, though, that however disappointing the short-term form of his horses might be, Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s plans for the sport of racing as a whole are far from complete.", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Dubai", "United Arab Emirates"], "title": "Horse racing: Sheikh's grand plans did not include Cat flop", "sentences": ["On Friday night, in front of the iconic Burj Al Arab hotel, Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai revealed his plans for a new racecourse that promises to be the finest sporting venue of any sort, anywhere in the world.", "Discreet Cat, the horse he had hoped would conquer America this year, suffered an ignominious defeat behind Invasor in the Dubai World Cup at Nad Al Sheba.", "The contrast between Discreet Cat&apos;s performance and his owner&apos;s grand plans for racing both in Dubai and around the world could not have been more complete.", "Sheikh Mohammed expects his new &quot;racing city&quot; at Meydan, close to the current track, to be ready for the 2010 Dubai World Cup, and what the Sheikh expects, he tends to get.", "Prizemoney for the race that year will, he said, be &quot;at least $10m&quot;, which is another way of saying that if anyone comes up with a bigger prize, Dubai will trump it.", "One problem which even the Sheikh can do nothing about, for instance, is the summer heat in Dubai, so a spring-to-autumn racing season alongside that in Europe and North America seems unlikely, although dozens of training barns were an interesting feature of the Meydan model.", "If the prizemoney is good enough - and Dubai&apos;s cash reserves are virtually limitless - then why not tempt them at the other end of the year, too?"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/apr/02/horseracing.sport1", "publicationDate": "2007-04-02T01:33:40Z"}, {"article": "Sir Percy, a close fourth in the Sheema Classic in Dubai on Saturday, is likely to run in the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes at Ascot in June as he attempts to become the first Derby winner since High Chaparral in 2002 to record another victory after his Epsom success. &quot;He will be dropping back in trip,&quot; Marcus Tregoning, Sir Percy&apos;s trainer, said yesterday, &quot;but I think there will be more pace and that might suit him.

The first ad, most often aired on the US-run TV station al-Hurra, is a call to report terrorist activity: it features a determined looking man striding into a crowded marketplace, watched by a small boy. The boy and the man lock eyes. Moments later, in the middle of the crowd, the man throws open his jacket to reveal explosives and blows himself up. When you need to run adverts warning people about suicide bombers, you know your country is in trouble. The second airs on Dubai TV and is an advert for a company that makes blinds and curtains. &quot;Perfect for palaces and villas,&quot; says the voiceover. When the number of people owning palaces reaches such a figure that you need to take out an international advert to reach them all, you know the economy is doing well. That, in microcosm, is the difficulty of creating policy for the Arab world. It is immensely diverse. The two Arab regions those adverts are targeting, the Gulf and Iraq, literally border one another, but in so many ways are different worlds. Even ignoring the wider Middle East, the Arab world contains huge contradictions: it has some of the richest countries in the world (the Gulf) and some of the poorest (Somalia); it contains two regional powers (Egypt and Saudi Arabia), and two countries under foreign occupation (Palestine and Iraq); it has staunch western allies (Jordan) and opponents (Syria), side by side. At the same time, the Arab countries, by virtue of being neighbours, having trade links, and a common language, culture and history, have much to gain by working together. That&apos;s where - in theory - the Arab League, or the League of Arab States as it is officially known, came in. The league was established in 1945 but has struggled to find a role over the lasat few years. As with the UN under Kofi Annan, its head, Amr Moussa, is widely respected as a diplomat, but the organisation itself lacks power. Last spring&apos;s summit in Sudan was a low point, with eight heads of state staying away, among them President Mubarak of Egypt and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. This year, with the colourful exception of Libya&apos;s Colonel Gaddafi, all the Arab countries were represented. The revitalised Arab peace plan - which seems to be drawing positive noises from Israel - may yet give the league renewed legitimacy. Last week&apos;s summit showed that the member states can present a common front. The league can work, but often only at times of crisis: it was the league that persuaded western governments to re-write a UN resolution at the tail-end of the Lebanon war, and pushed the Sudanese government to compromise on Darfur. Yet if it is to survive and remain relevant, it needs significant reform. The league has been talking about a common economic bloc between the Arab nations since the 1960s; that has yet to happen seriously. The decision-making system also needs to be overhauled. Currently countries must find consensus, a set-up that gives special interests significant veto power over the majority view. A more decisive solution would be a system of majority voting. Moreover, the league needs to have real powers to translate resolutions into action - at the moment it has to work through the individual Arab countries. A change will mean giving the league the power to censure individual countries, weakening the authority of nation states, just as has happened with the European Union. Powerful Arab countries will resist that, but the increase in collective bargaining power is likely to give the league greater standing in the world, and a greater ability to negotiate on behalf of all the Arab states, as happened last year with a Chinese trade deal. Such changes will not be easy. In many ways, the league&apos;s mindset is still stuck in the immediate post-colonial period. A significant collective breakthrough, as could happen with the proposed peace deal, might just be the jolt it needs.", "tags": ["World news"], "title": "A different league", "sentences": ["The second airs on Dubai TV and is an advert for a company that makes blinds and curtains."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/02/adifferentleague", "publicationDate": "2007-04-02T16:00:00Z"}, {"article": "Preamble Afternoon.

Habibul Bashar thinks &quot;it&apos;s a good batting track&quot;, but his team will need a vastly improved performance to their bludgeoning by Australia if Bangladesh are to stand a chance. 1st over: Bangladesh 0-0 (Omar 0, Iqbal 0) Either I&apos;m particularly unpopular or the creaking guardian email server has gone down. I&apos;d wager it&apos;s the former. Anyway, Michael Mason gets this party started with some early seam away from the right-handed Omar, clocking up a rather tidy maiden in the process. &quot;Please make sure this game is exciting,&quot; begs Ranil Dissanayake. &quot;I&apos;ve trundled into the office on about 15 minutes&apos; sleep, after watching the Sri Lanka all day yesterday before doing the work I was meant to do over the weekend. Now dangerously close to kipping on my keyboard. And, as a concession to your formula, let me just say &apos;Gary Naylor&apos;.&quot; 2nd over: Bangladesh 0-0 (Omar 0, Iqbal 0) Another maiden as Bond belts in towards Iqbal and gives him a real working over: first banging one in short and then fizzing an absolute snorter inches past his outside edge. A fine start from the Kiwis. I did His Royal Naylorness a grand disservice in the first over: he was, obviously, first in my now-functioning inbox. &quot;The OBO equation?&quot; he writes. &quot;(Pithiness x Distance from GU Towers x Testosterone level) / Number of people avoiding work = % chance of publication.

I rather prefer the former to the latter. Let&apos;s have more women on the OBO and a lot less of that Gary Naylor!&quot; 3rd over: Bangladesh 8-0 (Omar 7, Iqbal 1) A crisp punch for four to long-off from Omar, who gets off the mark in terrific style. And, following a short delay, it sends Mason back to the stands, where he&apos;ll need to put some strapping on a foot problem he appears to have sustained. Craig McMillan comes on and is immediately chopped through mid-off by Omar for three, before forcing Iqbal to dig out an attempted yorker on his toes. In the meantime, I&apos;d be interested to hear what readers think about these comments from Ian Chappell, lauding the Kiwis as the only serious challengers to Australia. Is he right/wrong/bonkers? 4th over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Omar 7, Iqbal 2) Bowling at a shade under 90mph, Bond is causing all kinds of problems for the opening pair. Which leads us into the one-day record books, where he currently occupies the No1 spot in the career strike-rate stats (minimum 1,000 balls bowled), with an almightily impressive 27. Quiz question: who&apos;s No2? 5th over: Bangladesh 14-0 (Omar 11, Iqbal 3) As the Kiwis are a bowler light with Mason receiving treatment, it falls to James Franklin to take over. A tidy first over is marred by the final delivery, just wide enough for Omar to crack through extra cover to the ropes across a very pacy outfield. 6th over: Bangladesh 18-0 (Omar 11, Iqbal 3) Finally a loose ball from Bond, drifting down leg and glancing Iqbal&apos;s pad before beating Brendon McCullum and registering four leg byes. Meanwhile, it appears that the swimming pool at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium has been closed for the day, following alleged excessive partying from the Australians on Saturday. Not that it&apos;s a particular problem for today&apos;s tiny, silent crowd. 7th over: Bangladesh 18-0 (Omar 11, Iqbal 3) Pedestrian batting from Bangladesh, albeit in the face of some tight bowling from Franklin. 8th over: Bangladesh 19-0 (Omar 11, Iqbal 4) Just the one run to Iqbal as Bond keeps this opening pair tied down. The Tigers are still 8-1 if you fancy splurging your hard-earned on the underdog, while you can buy money at 20-1 on with the Kiwis. 9th over: Bangladesh 24-0 (Omar 11, Iqbal 9) Runs for Iqbal as he edges short of first slip, where the ball kicks up and beats Scott Styris&apos;s attempted grab. Not the ideal start to Jacob Oram&apos;s first over. And apologies for the lack of email action: our server does seem to be enjoying a lengthy liquid lunch, so feel free to try this hastily-created account at jdarty78@hotmail.com. 10th over: Bangladesh 27-0 (Omar 12, Iqbal 11) Ah, I&apos;m actually receiving mails. You love me, you really love me. &quot;Is it Brett Lee, James?&quot; asks Richard Marsden in reply to our teaser in the fourth over? &quot;Actually, I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m asking so coyly. I know it is. I just looked it up.&quot; Not where I looked it up, Richard. 11th over: Bangladesh 28-0 (Omar 12, Iqbal 12) More slow and steady progress from the Bangladesh openers. Well, painfully slow and steady progress would be more apt. &quot;Answer to quiz question re 2nd best strike-rate: Tony Gray? offers Juliet Harris. Correct. &quot;If so, do I win a shiny Guardian-funded prize?&quot; Ah. 12th over: Bangladesh 37-0 (Omar 12, Iqbal 21) More like it from Iqbal as he cracks Franklin to the cover boundary, before forcing a stunning one-handed grab to Hamish Marshall&apos;s left to save another four. Then he flashes at another short-of-a-length delivery and Chinese cuts it behind his stumps for another boundary. There&apos;s no doubt Bangladesh fancy Franklin: in fairness, he&apos;s offered them the only real width and opportunity to hit thus far. &quot;There is the annual inter-house quiz night at my daughter&apos;s school on Wednesday night, which of course clashes with England&apos;s game,&quot; explains Don Wilson. &quot;As I have done quite well in the past at the questions directed at the parents in the audience, I have been left in no doubt that I am expected to attend. Any ideas how I can stay home to watch the cricket without letting my daughter&apos;s housemates think I am a traitor to the cause?&quot; 13th over: Bangladesh 39-0 (Omar 13, Iqbal 22) Iqbal gives Oram the charge and the bowler responds by banging a short ball in and forcing the youngster to take evasive action. Two more singles and the run-rate is up to three. &quot;A shoal of fish, a murder of crows, but what&apos;s the collective noun for a group of people who contribute to the OBO?&quot; ponders Ben Hendy. &quot;I was thinking you could have an &apos;Over of OBOers&apos;.

Gary Naylor (2nd over) I am a woman in Bloomsbury and can quote the great narratologist, Gerard Genette&apos;s four-word (three in French, of course) summary of Proust: &apos;Marcel becomes a writer&apos;,&quot; declares Ladislava Pluk. &quot;Do I get my Blue Peter badge?&quot; If I had an OBO badge I&apos;d send you one, Ladislava. Come to think of it, can anyone out there design or make one for us? We&apos;re not the most practical here at GU Towers ... Two off the over - one single to Iqbal and a leg bye. 15th over: Bangladesh 45-0 (Omar 13, Iqbal 27) Shot! Iqbal rocks back and pulls Oram forcefully through mid-wicket for four. &quot;How about a skive of OBOers?&quot; suggests Duncan Haskell (and many others). 16th over: Bangladesh 51-0 (Omar 18, Iqbal 28) If you&apos;re going to flash, flash hard, advice Omar takes as he edges Franklin through the vacant first slip and away for four. Omar then brings up the 50 - off 94 balls - with a single. &quot;I reckon the collective noun could be a &apos;tedium&apos;, a &apos;desperation&apos; or a &apos;smug&apos; of OBOers, all of which would ring true,&quot; says Thomas Morris. &quot;How about a &apos;P45&apos; of OBOers?&quot; adds David Ennett. 17th over: WICKET! Iqbal st McCullum b Oram 29 (Bangladesh 55-1) Brilliant work behind the stumps by McCullum as Iqbal attempts to create a shot down the leg side; he misses, McCullum makes a super take and then whips the bails off, just before the desperate Iqbal can ground his bat behind the crease. A major blow for the Tigers, just as they were finding their feet. &quot;Don Wilson (12th over) sounds the flashy sort: talking himself up on the basis of one good performance,&quot; declares Jonathan Wood. &quot;His Wednesday can either be spent revealing himself as a paper tiger, or watching England do the same. I&apos;d strongly recommend the latter - it&apos;ll be equally painful, but less personal.&quot; 17th over: Bangladesh 55-1 (Omar 21, Ahmed 0) &quot;Given that Don Wilson sends his daughter to a school which still uses the &apos;houses&apos; system of encouraging petty rivalries and bullying, shouldn&apos;t he be more worried about the massed ranks of Guardian readers who now suspect him to be a &apos;traitor to the cause&apos; for sending her to what sounds very much like a private school?&quot; asks Phil Rowland. &quot;Conversely, will the other parents still want his general knowledge when they find out he&apos;s a pinko?&quot; 18th over: Bangladesh 61-1 (Omar 22, Ahmed 5) Aftab Ahmed gets off the mark with another edge through the slips. It didn&apos;t carry, not that that&apos;s any consolation for Franklin, currently the owner of figures of 0-27 from six overs. 19th over: WICKET! Omar c McCullum b Oram 22 (Bangladesh 62-2) Big trouble for Bangladesh as Omar tries to cut away at a ball that&apos;s far too straight to do so against, nicking behind to McCullum, who takes a regulation catch. That 22 came from 51 painful deliveries. &quot;A confederacy of dunces?&quot; offers Manish Khanduri. Ouch. 20th over: Bangladesh 64-2 (Ahmed 7, Hasan 1) No sooner has Saqibul Hasan arrived at the crease than he&apos;s having to fend off Daniel Vettori&apos;s first over. It goes for two singles, and New Zealand will be more than content with the way the game is slowly taking shape. &quot;The discussion of whether Don Wilson&apos;s daughter has a privileged education links neatly to pedalo racing,&quot; crowbars Dominic O&apos;Reilly, at least in aid of a good cause. &quot;OBOer Phil Staite is organising a pedalo race in aid of Chance to Shine, the campaign to bring cricket back to state schools, and needs a venue. Anyone have their own lake or pond or access to someone else&apos;s one?&quot; 21st over: Bangladesh 70-2 (Ahmed 7, Hasan 2) A play and a miss from Hasan, and a play and a miss from McCullum behind the stumps, who lets the ball through for four extras. &quot;Any Kiwi would be flattered by Chappell&apos;s comments (3rd over), but we all know it won&apos;t matter a damn,&quot; writes the hippo-like Nil Pferd. &quot;Should New Zealand make it to the final they&apos;ll have the Aussies 50-6 and then Symonds or Hogg or any of the usual suspects will flay a double century, after which we&apos;ll be bowled out for 74. To get a real idea of what Australia thinks of us as challengers, enter a bar/taxi in Sydney and introduce yourself with the words &apos;I&apos;m from noo Zeelund&apos;. I&apos;m betting Chappell&apos;s comments don&apos;t represent the majority of his countrymen.&quot; 22nd over: Bangladesh 77-2 (Ahmed 11, Hasan 4) The best shot of the day, as Ahmed flicks Vettori off his toes (the ball, that is) and over mid-wicket for a lovely boundary. 23rd over: Bangladesh 82-2 (Ahmed 17, Hasan 4) Another boundary for Ahmed, who clearly appreciates that Bangladesh really need to up the ante in the next 15 overs if they&apos;re to have a platform to set a fair target with a final slog. &quot;Following your request that someone design an OBO badge for you and in light of the fact that pedalo races and the like have been organised by contributors, I was wondering what was the most time-consuming thing you think you could get someone to do for you,&quot; says Ben Mimmack. &quot;How about you ask that someone knit all members of the GU team matching jerkins with your initials on?&quot; Would you? 24th over: Bangladesh 85-2 (Ahmed 19, Hasan 5) Three off Vettori&apos;s latest over, which he hustles through with very little thought for your OBO writer. 25th over: Bangladesh 89-2 (Ahmed 23, Hasan 5) Good running from Ahmed to scamper through for two twos off new bowler Styris. &quot;Proportionally, I reckon New Zealand are definitely the ugliest team at the World Cup,&quot; claims Tom Janes. &quot;Bond&apos;s manky hair, Marshall&apos;s big hair, Fleming&apos;s long face, Styris&apos;s highlights and poor Craig McMillan, who looks like Chris Rea trapped inside Eric Clapton.&quot; An image we could all do without, Tom. 26th over: Bangladesh 91-2 (Ahmed 24, Hasan 6) So far, so dull. The Kiwis are doing all they need to do, and Bangladesh are, well, taking their good, sweet time. &quot;The nattering women next to me are discussing their favourite puddings - apple crumble is the champion,&quot; bemoans Alex Warwick. &quot;As we work for the Home Office, do your readers feel that by splitting the department they&apos;ve got value for money?&quot; Well? 27th over: Bangladesh 99-2 (Ahmed 25, Hasan 11) An awesomely innovative stroke from Hasan, pre-meditatively reverse-chipping the ball down to fine leg for four. A good over, but many more of the same are needed. &quot;When are you going to honour Ireland&apos;s presence in the Super Eights by giving Barry a go at the OBO?&quot; demands Luke Scofield. &quot;I think Naylor v Glendenning would be a much better contest than most of the actual matches have been so far.&quot; I can&apos;t probably print my jovial colleague&apos;s response, sadly Luke. That&apos;s right, he&apos;s incomprehensibly drunk.* 28th over: Bangladesh 103-2 (Ahmed 27, Hasan 13) &quot;Sorry, I have to disagree with Tom Janes (25th over) about the Kiwis having the highest munter quotient in the World Cup,&quot; says Anna Seddon. Dr Anna Seddon, at that. &quot;The argument can be countered with two words: Jacques Kallis. The South African team aren&apos;t exactly overflowing with lookers at the best of times but Kallis is the final nail. But then again, I fancy Glenn McGrath, so my opinion probably doesn&apos;t count for much ...&quot; Four singles from the over. 29th over: WICKET! Ahmed c sub b Styris 27 (Bangladesh 105-3) A totally needless way for Ahmed to get out. Just as he&apos;s played himself in and begun to flay some tidy strokes around the pitch, he tries to take on a ball that&apos;s too full from Styris and lofts a drive straight to the replacement fielder at long-on. &quot;With respect Alex Warwick&apos;s missive (26th over), I reckon the Home Office know what they&apos;re talking about,&quot; claims Paul Graham. &quot;A good crumble (with custard) would win a World Cup of puddings, probably edging sticky toffee pudding (with custard) out at the last. What do you reckon?&quot; A fairtrade organic carrot and mungbean cake, I&apos;d say Paul, at least if I&apos;m going to sate your stereotypes. 30th over: Bangladesh 108-3 (Hasan 15, Bashar 1) Captain Habibul Bashar comes to the crease in need of sparking his team-mates along: they really need to get to something in the region of 230 at the least, but they&apos;re still chugging along in the 200 region right about now. &quot;Has anyone told John Reid?&quot; fumes an indignant Jonathan Symes. &quot;The reason his department has so many problems is because all of its employees are discussing desserts or following OBO!&quot; 31st over: Bangladesh 110-3 (Hasan 17, Bashar 2) Just the one run off Styris&apos;s latest tight over. Thirteen runs from his four overs so far. 32nd over: Bangladesh 115-3 (Hasan 19, Bashar 5) Four singles and an untidy wide off Vettori. &quot;Alex Warwick should try and drag the female contingent in his office into a more sporting and competitive frame of mind by constructing a puddings World Cup, complete with group stages, Super Eights, semi-final and final,&quot; reckons Jim Adamson. Surely they&apos;d all be stale by the time the blimmin&apos; thing got to an end, Jim? &quot;I reckon when it came to the crunch a boring old staple like apple crumble might prove a bit lumbering and out of touch, England style, against the more sophisticated approach of a Banoffee Pie.&quot; Mmm, Banoffee Pie. 33rd over: Bangladesh 120-3 (Hasan 21, Bashar 8) The run-rate is slowly creeping up towards four-an-over. Well, 3.64 to be accurate. &quot;Does Jonathan Symes (30th over) not realise that the OBO has become the forum for solving problems?&quot; says Ronan Hayes. &quot;As such, it is to be applauded that the Home Office is wise enough to use the myriad talents of OBOers.&quot; OK then folks, what say you about the state of immigration, prisons, etc and so on? 34th over: WICKET! Bashar run out (Oram) 9 (Bangladesh 122-4) Fantastic work in the field from Oram, who accounts for Bashar with a direct hit from the deep mid-wicket boundary. It was a pretty dangerous second run to be taking, but that can&apos;t take anything away from the stunning work of Oram. &quot;I&apos;m sure my knitting group could band together and churn out some lovely cabled jumpers for you all, although you might have to wait for the next World Cup,&quot; writes the in-need-of-pulling-her-finger-out Clare Dyer-Smith. &quot;Or perhaps you could put out a pattern for a knitted cricket ball? You did it with hand grenades.&quot; 35th over: Bangladesh 127-4 (Hasan 25, Ashraful 2) This innings is really grinding now. Another wicket and a seriously sub-200 total will be on the cards. 36th over: WICKET! Hasan b Bond 25 (Bangladesh 127-5) First ball back in the attack and it&apos;s a snorter from Bond that roars directly into middle stump. Hasan played all around it, but he simply couldn&apos;t deal with the pace and accuracy. &quot;Re: Ronan Hayes (33rd over). Exactly which problems has OBO actually solved?&quot; wonders Anton Lawrence. &quot;I don&apos;t recall anything of worth. I mean what has OBO ever done for us?&quot; I give you Gus. 36th over: WICKET! Rahim b Bond 0 (Bangladesh 127-6) The 18-year-old Rahim&apos;s stay is a short one as Bond grabs his second wicket of the over with his final ball, an absolute stinger that starts on middle and off, and quickens on to the youngster&apos;s off stump. There&apos;s a long way to go, but I&apos;d say it&apos;s game over. 37th over: Bangladesh 129-6 (Ashraful 3, Rafique 1) Checking out Sky&apos;s handy form table for one-day cricket before this game, the Kiwis were top and will now move to nine wins in their last 11 games. Bangladesh, remarkably, were third, but even more stunning was England&apos;s lofty third position. Not for long, me thinks. &quot;The queen of puddings must be Sussex Pond Pudding with a hefty dollop of quality vanilla ice cream,&quot; recommends Lee Wilkey. &quot;I would suggest the Bangladeshis serve it up to the Kiwis during the break as it is likely to induce an immediate coronary.&quot; 38th over: Bangladesh 129-6 (Ashraful 3, Rafique 1) Bond is back and he&apos;s well out of the Bangladeshi batsmen&apos;s league. Quite a tagline for Bond 22, I&apos;d say. An over packed with pace, venom and remarkably consistent length ends in a maiden and just adds to Bangladesh&apos;s problems. 39th over: WICKET! Ashraful b Styris 3 (Bangladesh 129-7) This is getting uglier than a Kallis convention, as now Ashraful plays on a full-length Styris delivery. &quot;Re. what&apos;s OBO ever done for us,&quot; writes Dominic O&apos;Reilly. &quot;It&apos;s got Chance to Shine a \u00a3500 donation and someone running a fundraising event for us. Fantastic.&quot; Hats off. 40th over: Bangladesh 131-7 (Rafique 1, Mortaza 2) It&apos;s all that the batsmen can do to survive Bond&apos;s latest over, while picking up a couple of singles. &quot;OK,&quot; begins Ben Hendy with purpose. &quot;Mohammad Ashraful is playing his 95th ODI for Bangladesh. He&apos;s 22 years old. And yet England&apos;s captain has only played 81 (all right, he&apos;s always injured) and of the other players in the squad, we only have Collingwood (116) and Flintoff (118) who&apos;ve played more. And I have a feeling that there aren&apos;t many others who&apos;ve made it to that many appearances. How come we have so little ODI experience in general?&quot; 41st over: Bangladesh 138-7 (Rafique 8, Mortaza 2) A spanking great six from Rafique, who drills Styris over the long-on ropes for some long overdue batting excitement. &quot;All right. Apart from a \u00a3500 donation, and some failed matchmaking, what has OBO ever done for us?&quot; adds Anton Lawrence. Um, it begins with R, ends with less, and is a gloopy, moreish revitaliser. You&apos;d better believe it, Anton. 42nd over: Bangladesh 140-7 (Rafique 10, Mortaza 2) This, my friends, is dire. I&apos;m seriously hoping for a declaration. &quot;The OBO immortalised forever in print the fact that Scarlett Johannsen (accidentally) touched my bum whilst in the Groucho Club a couple of years ago,&quot; dreams Rob Smy ... sorry, writes Jascha Elliott. &quot;I was willing to never mention it again until someone called the force for good that it the OBO into question. Plus I remember it allowed two people to swap Ashes tickets that they couldn&apos;t use on a specific day meaning they both got to see the Aussies losing live without resorting to eBay. Is the case well rested enough?&quot; 43rd over: WICKET! Mortaza b Styris 2 (Bangladesh 140-8) How in the good name of Frank Bough did India ever lose to this lot? Styris finds Mortaza&apos;s gate wide open and clips his off stump with alarming ease. 43rd over: WICKET! c sub Razzak b Styris 0 (Bangladesh 140-9) And copy, and paste. How in the good name of Frank Bough did India ever lose to this lot? A hapless hoick to mid-on from Razzak and substitute fielder Mark Gillespie takes a simple catch. 44th over: Bangladesh 153-9 (Rafique 22, Rasel 1) Following a huge six over the mid-on boundary off Styris at the end of the last over, Rafique edges his team towards the 150 mark, which he then takes them past with a high flash over the slip cordon. &quot;You bloody ripper. Go the Black Caps!&quot; yells Zane Maloney, who&apos;ll no doubt be delighted by Bond&apos;s final figures of 2-15 with four maidens from his 10 overs. 45th over: Bangladesh 159-9 (Rafique 22, Rasel 6) Syed Rasel somehow manages to smuggle one past McCullum as the Tigers keep the innings alive and prolong my stay in the office. Just for you Tom Lutz fans out there, the great man will be in the hot seat for the second half of the Kiwis&apos; victory later on. 46th over: Bangladesh 164-9 (Rafique 24, Rasel 7) &quot;Ben Hendy asks why we&apos;ve played so few ODIs (40th over),&quot; writes Peter Williams. &quot;It&apos;s because we concentrate on Test cricket whereas in the subcontinent the focus is on the extremely lucrative ODI market, increasingly played in front of ex-pats in Dubai, Canada et al. Also, we refuse to give the Banglas any more than two Test at a time so they&apos;ve got to do something to fill their year.&quot; Like playing better than they have today, with any luck. 47th over: Bangladesh 170-9 (Rafique 27, Rasel 9) Rafique is now just two runs from being his team&apos;s top scorer as he prolongs the agony. &quot;I&apos;d say that &apos;pace, venom and remarkably consistent length&apos; is a far better Bond tagline (38th over), wouldn&apos;t you?&quot; fnar fnars Richard Nott. 48th over: Bangladesh 173-9 (Rafique 29, Rasel 10) By the way that Rafique has been tidily going about his business, I&apos;d say his colleagues higher up the order might be taking a look at themselves after this game. 49th over: WICKET! Rasel 10 b Oram (Bangladesh 174) Oram closes out the innings, yorking the tail-ending Rasel and leaving Rafique high and dry on 30 - the top score of the innings. It&apos;s been a pleasure, ladies and gentlemen. The very capable hands of Tom Lutz will be taking over for New Zealand&apos;s reply. Have a very pleasurable evening, and thanks again for all your emails. James. * Legal disclaimer: at no stage during today&apos;s report was Barry Glendenning drunk.

The proposed scheme involves St James&apos; Park increasing its capacity by almost 8,000 to 60,000 and also features the building of adjacent hotels, flats and a conference centre. The Newcastle chairman, Freddy Shepherd, who has been increasingly concerned about his team falling behind Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool, yesterday said: &quot;What we are proposing is something not just for the club but for the whole city and the people of Newcastle. Having a conference centre would enable Newcastle to attract top events in all fields and the whole project will stand as a monument to vibrant development of the city.&quot; With Newcastle&apos;s plc status preventing the disclosure of potential outside investors, funding details remain unclear but the club, which only last week announced an operating loss of \u00a36.9m, says the scheme&apos;s financing will be independent of its own revenue streams. Even so, the plans must clear several planning permission hurdles before the first bricks are laid and it is conceivable that compromises may be demanded in certain areas. Yesterday&apos;s news provoked mixed reactions on Tyneside. Frank Gilmour, the chairman of the Newcastle United Independent Supporters&apos; Association, reflected widespread concerns when he said: &quot;Some fans in the Gallowgate End could find themselves affected by new corporate seating. I am in favour of investment in the club but the thing we worry about is transferring the money away from the playing staff. We are falling way behind the top four clubs.&quot; Shepherd, who is well aware that Glenn Roeder&apos;s side are slipping towards the relegation zone after four Premiership games without a win or a goal, stressed that football remained his priority. &quot;The squad will be strengthened in the close season,&quot; he said. &quot;We know the team needs looking at in more ways than one and that&apos;s what we are concentrating on.&quot; Meanwhile, having evidently raised eyebrows at St James&apos; by spending the weekend at the horse racing in Dubai, Michael Owen stepped up his training yesterday.

The Yorkshire trainer, and Collier Hill&apos;s legion of followers, will be hoping it is not the end of a remarkable career for the nine-year-old gelding who was a late withdrawal from Saturday&apos;s Sheema Classic at Nad Al Sheba. &quot;His preparation wasn&apos;t too good and an x-ray showed a recurrence of his old joint trouble,&quot; said Swinbank yesterday. &quot;He had missed bits of work when we had a problem with one of his shoes as well, but I haven&apos;t given up hope that we can get him right again. &quot;I&apos;ll be speaking to a veterinary centre in Newmarket. If they can do something with that joint problem, we might get him back. The Irish St Leger entries close on Wednesday and I&apos;ll be putting him in that. But whatever happens, you have to say he has done a grand job for us.&quot; If Collier Hill does have to be retired, he will bow out the winner of over \u00a32m in prizemoney, with a string of big-race victories in seven different countries. He had been placed in the two previous runnings of the Sheema Classic and is a tribute to the skill of his trainer, who started Collier Hill off in bumper races and then low-grade handicaps on the Flat. From training around 40 horses three years ago, Swinbank now has a team of more than 100 assembled at his Melsonby base near Richmond. &quot;We have a new yard of 60 boxes being built,&quot; says Swinbank. &quot;They should be up and running in September.&quot; Flat or jumps, the Swinbank stable is a firm favourite with punters up and down the land. At next week&apos;s Grand National meeting, two of the best prospects will be unbeaten bumper horses trained at Melsonby. Between them, Theatrical Moment and Turbo Linn have won seven races. Just as he did with Collier Hill, Swinbank will campaign his latest star bumper horses on the Flat. &quot;Theatrical Moment will go straight to the Flat after the Champion Bumper at Aintree,&quot; says the trainer, who sent out Alfie Flits to finish fourth in the race 12 months ago. Alfie Flits has a long way to go before matching Collier Hill&apos;s exploits, but he has won Listed races since switched to the Flat and there is the promise of better to come. &quot;Things didn&apos;t go right for Alfie in the Winter Derby,&quot; says Swinbank. &quot;He&apos;s a mile and a half horse, really, and he&apos;ll go for the John Porter Stakes at Newbury.&quot; Meanwhile, Aintree announced they had started to water the track. &quot;With the ground drying out, we started watering over the weekend and will continue to do so right the way through, if necessary,&quot; said clerk of the course Andrew Tulloch. &quot;Aintree&apos;s policy is to try and provide ground no faster than good,&quot; he added. &quot;We want to go into the meeting on the best ground possible. Hedgehunter, winner of the 2005 Grand National and runner-up last year, was yesterday reported in good shape by his trainer, Willie Mullins, following his run over hurdles at Limerick on Sunday. &quot;He trotted up sound this morning and he seems fine,&quot; said the trainer. &quot;We were happy enough with the way he ran.

Four years after the catastrophic invasion of Iraq, the wisdom of Powell&apos;s aphorism contrasts sharply with the pathetic inability of the Bush White House to make the Shias, Sunnis and Kurds of Iraq work together in harmony. But instead of learning from the debacle of Iraq, and desisting from destabilising another country in a volatile region, the Bush administration shows no sign of calling off its two-year old clandestine campaign to destabilise Iran. Revelations in the New Yorker and the Washington Post in January-February 2005 showed that the Pentagon had been flying drones over Iran since April 2004 for espionage. This had come about after the spying network established by the Central Intelligence Agency in Iran had been exposed and eliminated, according to James Risen, the New York Times reporter on national security, in his book State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration. Briefed by their experts on Iran, the American policy makers became aware that Iran is also multi-ethnic and multi-sectarian. So they saw an opportunity to weaken the Tehran government by funding and arming ethnic minorities on the ground that the regime&apos;s primary support comes from ethnic Persians. According to the CIA, relying on figures supplied by Iranian exiles, Persians are only 50% of the population. So, if the ethnic minorities can be roused to rebel against the central authority, the theocratic regime will be endangered. These figures are flawed, and the strategy based on them is dangerously misconceived. The ethnic composition of Iran is Persians, 65%; Azeris, 20%; Kurds 7%, Arabs 3%; Baluchis, 2%; Turkmen, 2.5%; and Armenian, 0.5%. Creating disaffection among Azeris is a non-starter. Iran&apos;s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamanei is an Azeri speaker. An Azeri insurgency cannot take off without the active cooperation of Azerbaijan. There is no sign that the government in Baku wants to be part of this destabilising plan. In any case, the bond of Shia Islam that Azeris and Persians share is much stronger than any differences arising from the different languages the two communities speak. It is that segment of the Iranian population that follows Sunni Islam which provides a realistic chance of engaging in insurgency. Among them the predominantly Sunni, yet secular, Kurds are pre-eminent. Ever since the Islamic revolution in 1979, a section of the Kurdish community concentrated in the area adjoining the Iraqi Kurdistan has been up in arms against the theocratic regime in Tehran. In recent years the Komala-e Jian Kordestan (Association of Revival of Kurdistan; also known as Kurdistan Free Life party), has emerged as an insurgent group. It is allied with the Kurdistan Workers party of Turkey. Taking refuge in the mountains of the Iraqi Kurdistan, the two factions have been engaged in violent activity against their respective governments. According to the Turkish sources, cited by the Guardian, the US is funding and indirectly arming the Komala-e Jian Kordestan. The CIA also seems to be aiding dissident groups - albeit through proxies - in the Iranian province of Baluchistan-Sistan adjoining Pakistan. A faction, called Sipah-e Rasul Allah (Soldiers of God&apos;s Messenger), and headed by Wahid Baksh, has been conducting a campaign of bombing, shooting and kidnapping. Baksh claims that Sunnis are being persecuted in Iran. A more militant faction, named Jundullah (Army of God), has resorted to car bombings and kidnapping and beheading Iranian soldiers. According to Iranian exile sources in Pakistan, Junduallah recently received a large consignment of arms and vehicles. &quot;They are getting money from somewhere,&quot; said one source. &quot;We heard that it&apos;s coming from Americans.&quot; Washington denies the allegation. But leading Iranian exile leaders from Dubai and Britain have visited the area regularly to deliver funds - which most likely originate from the CIA. The ethnic Arab minority, concentrated in the oil-rich province of Khuzistan which shares its border with Iraq, is another community which has tempted the CIA.

The Iraqi director was kidnapped by insurgents off the streets of Baghdad while filming Ahlaam, only the second feature film to emerge from the country after the fall of Saddam Hussein. Bound and left for dead by the banks of the Euphrates, the 28-year-old awoke in a Baghdad hospital only to find himself taken hostage by another set of militants and tortured in the basement. He would finish off the day being shot at by US troops convinced he was himself an insurgent. Al-Daradji was in London as part of the 2nd Bafta Arab cinema weekend (30th March- 1st April). Though his story was perhaps the most extreme example of courage under fire, a new generation of Arab film-makers are emerging across the region intent on breaking taboos and challenging audiences both at home and abroad. Marwan Hamed is another such case in point. The 30-year-old Egyptian director was entrusted with adapting blockbusting novel The Yacoubian Building for his feature debut. With a then-record budget of $4m for an Arab film, an all-star cast including Egyptian comic legend Adel Imam and a plot that dealt with homosexuality, Islamic fundamentalism and police brutality, Hamed succeeded in delivering a masterful depiction of Cairo in decline. The film was Egypt&apos;s biggest box office hit in 2006, fighting off a campaign by Egyptian MPs affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood to have the film banned. Not that he fared quite so well in other Arab countries. &quot;This is a three hour film, but in Kuwait it&apos;s only an hour an a half. Some of the characters like the gay newspaper editor aren&apos;t even in the film there,&quot; he told the audience. Censorship, as well as piracy, lack of funding and an often ineffective distribution network are long-standing gripes of film-makers, both in the Arab world and beyond. Despite all these obstacles, not to mention the continuing political turmoil across the region, Arab film-makers have shown a determination to have their voices heard. Whether Djamila Sehraoui&apos;s Algerian civil war road movie Barakat!, which won the inaugural Best Arab film prize at last year&apos;s Dubai international film festival, Ghassan Salhab&apos;s Beirut-set vampire story The Last Man, or Moroccan director Faouzi Bensaidi&apos;s genre-busting tale of a love-struck Casablanca assassin in WWW: What a Wonderful World, Arab cinema is experiencing something of an awakening. That trend is set to continue. Despite teetering on the brink of civil war, Lebanon has more than half a dozen features in advanced stages of production, from Philippe Aractingi&apos;s war drama After the Summer Rain to Nadine Labaki&apos;s salon set comedy of manners Caramel. Palestine&apos;s two most prominent directors, Hany Abu-Assad and Elia Suleiman, are both set to start shooting their new features before the end of the year, while Iraq will host an undeterred Al-Daradji attempt to film his next feature Um Hussein on location in the north and south of the country. Even Gulf states such as the United Arab Emirates and, most surprisingly, Saudi Arabia - where cinemas have been banned since the 1970s - have features in production. In the latter&apos;s case it will be a woman, Haifa Mansour, who will begin filming her debut feature this summer under the patronage of media mogul and billionaire Prince Waleed bin Talal, despite the conservative kingdom&apos;s notorious lack of liberties afforded its female population. With the Middle East currently flavour of the month in Hollywood - everyone from Robert Redford to Michael Mann, Oliver Stone, Brian de Palma and even Jerry Bruckheimer have a post 9/11 project in tow - it&apos;s refreshing to see Arab film-makers themselves claim a space in the debate.

The five-year-old&apos;s sire, Dansili, is known for getting all-weather winners and Dansili Dancer (3.50) is best on fast ground on turf, so he should adapt. His trainer, Clive Cox, has never lost faith in his gelding despite what was a stuttering start to last season. It was when he was upped in distance to 10 furlongs that Dansili Dancer blossomed. Wins at Sandown and Haydock were followed by a close fourth placing in the competitive Newbury handicap won by Pinpoint. He finished hot on the heels of Charlie Cool that day and was several places ahead of Blue Bajan, who serves as a good yardstick both on turf and the all-weather. Charlie Cool reopposes on the same terms and he is fit from some good efforts in Nad Al Sheba, where he twice finished ahead of Cimyla. Sure to be dropped out the back by Jamie Spencer, as is his wont, Charlie Cool&apos;s prospects will depend on getting a strong gallop. That can never be assumed in all-weather races. Grand Passion was having his 15th start on the all-weather and went close to recording win number five when beaten a neck by Gentleman&apos;s Deal in last month&apos;s Winter Derby at Lingfield. The notable absentee that day was Sri Diamond, who had beaten Grand Passion in the previous year&apos;s race but had to miss the latest renewal owing to a bruised foot. Said to be back on song, Sri Diamond is the one to beat based on his fine all-weather track record. However, John Gosden&apos;s Imperial Star is another newcomer to this code who could make matters interesting. Kempton 2.10 Don&apos;t Dili Dali came back from racing in Dubai to win the Masaka Stakes here last spring. She has been running creditably in the desert again but faces a progressive sort in Barry Hills&apos; Persian Express. Winner of three of her four AW starts, this Bahri filly is thought capable of further progress and her stable is in fine form. Carlisle 2.25 Though he has done all his winning over shorter trips, Shannon&apos;s Pride stays three miles well enough. His stable is back among the winners and he will appreciate the drying ground. Kempton 2.45 An official mark of 88 could seriously underestimate the ability of Tybalt. John Gosden&apos;s Guineas entry finished five lengths clear of the remainder when short-headed by the well-regarded Adagio first time out last season, then proceeded to trot up on the Lingfield Polytrack. Putra Square may also have got in lightly and Paul Cole&apos;s runner looks the danger. Haydock 3.00 In a wide open handicap, Mohayer is one for the short-list. He has been competing on heavy ground but has such a high cruising speed that the switch to a faster surface should not be a problem. Festive Chimes, unlucky on the Flat earlier this week, and Capitana are others to consider but Adopted Hero might be the one now that he has re-joined his former trainer. The seven-year-old is down to a handy mark, 5lb lower than when third behind Desert Quest at Ascot first time out this season. Kempton 3.20 William Knight, a recent addition to the training ranks, is going places judging by his adept handling of Illustrious Blue, who has improved since joining his stable. He bought Invention for 32,000gns out of John Gosden&apos;s yard and there should be better to come from this lightly-raced four-year-old. All the better for his first taste of all-weather racing at Lingfield, Invention is an eye-catcher at 20-1 with the Tote. Tabadul has been priced up as favourite but there is a slight question-mark over the form of trainer Ed Dunlop&apos;s horses at present. Haydock 3.35 Appreciating the return to racing on fast ground, Oscardeal fairly skipped over the brush obstacles at Southwell to slam the 120-rated Santando by 29 lengths. He was a decent bumper horse a few seasons back when conditions were in his favour and Oscardeal could have been dealt with more harshly by the handicapper.", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "title": "Horse racing: Dansili should prove a smart bet on sand debut", "sentences": ["Kempton 2.10 Don&apos;t Dili Dali came back from racing in Dubai to win the Masaka Stakes here last spring."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/apr/07/horseracing.sport", "publicationDate": "2007-04-06T23:07:28Z"}, {"article": "Sol Kerzner, the leisure and gaming tycoon, has lost control of the five-star Le Touessrok hotel in Mauritius, where he launched his One&amp;Only resort empire in 2002.

I was in Iran and I was about to be kidnapped. &apos;I am a guide, I speak English,&apos; announced Ahmad Pourseyedi as he grabbed my arm, &apos;come, we will go to the Fin Gardens.&apos; There was no arguing. The fact that I had arrived in Kashan half an hour earlier and was on my way out to dinner only allowed me to put off the inevitable for 12 hours. The next morning I belonged to Ahmad. In fact I had become part of Ahmad&apos;s family. At each of the beautiful traditional homes for which Kashan will, one day, be justifiably famous, the ticket seller was expected, no commanded, to offer me the family discount. It was a typically Iranian encounter. I cannot remember the last country I visited where there was such an overwhelming urge to make you feel welcome, to roll out the Persian carpet, to include you in the family gathering. That night, in the Khan-e Tabatabei, a fine old house where the central courtyard became a restaurant for the evening, the family at the next table introduced themselves. &apos;You are by yourself, why don&apos;t you join us?&apos; When I told another chatty group that I lived in Melbourne, I was reminded that the best thing Australia ever did to foster better relations with the Islamic Republic was not to win a football match. In late 1997 Iran drew with Australia in a World Cup preliminary in Melbourne, thus ensuring a place for Iran in the 1998 World Cup. Repeatedly the mere mention of the word &apos;Melbourne&apos; brings a smile to an Iranian face.  This is what life is like on the Axis of Evil. I arrive in a shiny Emirates Airbus from Dubai, sipping a glass of wine which I assume, wrongly, will be the last alcohol I&apos;ll see for a couple of weeks. I grab my bag off the carousel, my passport is stamped, I clear customs and I&apos;m in Iran. I have made absolutely no plans, not even booked a hotel for tonight. I&apos;m just going to cruise into the city and see what happens. The three young women at Tehran Airport&apos;s tourist desk have their hair discreetly covered, but otherwise we could have been at Heathrow or JFK. Clearly tourists don&apos;t turn up every day, certainly not ones without a hotel booking. They joke about not doing this too often, comment that they don&apos;t know the hotel I&apos;ve pulled out of my guidebook, phone through to book me a room and finally wish me a pleasant stay in Iran. It&apos;s the first of many contacts I&apos;ll have with the opposite sex in Iran and a firm reminder that this is not the Arab world. The very idea that you might be asking a woman to book a hotel in Saudi Arabia is inconceivable. I sling my bag in the back of a taxi and head out into Tehran&apos;s terrible traffic. It&apos;s not just the volume, it&apos;s also the crazily exuberant driving style and the often-battered vehicles challenging for their space in the jam. It seemed bad on my first visit to Tehran, way back in 1972, but it&apos;s far worse now.  I&apos;ve got a special affection for Iran&apos;s national car, the Paykan or &apos;Arrow&apos;. Thirty five years ago, I was a young engineer with the Rootes Group car manufacturers in Coventry. I worked on the old Hillman Hunter, a project known in-house as Arrow. Rootes, which was taken over by Chrysler just before I joined them and bankrupted not long after I left, managed to sell not just the car but a whole car manufacturing plant to the Iranians during the Shah&apos;s era and in a remarkably short time the sturdy Paykan flooded the Iranian market. In Britain, production of the old Hillmans and their assorted clones ground to a halt decades ago, but in Iran they just kept rolling off the assembly line. By the 1990s, the old Paykan was years out of date - a clunky, polluting, unsafe menace compared to modern vehicles. Every year the government announced that Paykan production was about to end and a year later they were still there. Now it finally looks like the Paykan era is about to finish, but there are so many out there they will remain the most popular car for many years. The next morning I stroll a couple of blocks east from my hotel to the &apos;Den of US Espionage&apos;. The former US embassy was seized by the revolutionary Iranians in 1979, held for 444 days and contributed substantially to Jimmy Carter&apos;s re-election defeat. Today it&apos;s occupied by a hardline militia group and the wall around the compound is decorated with anti-American slogans and murals including a painting of a skull-faced Statue of Liberty. I&apos;ve got a contact at the British embassy, let&apos;s call him Graham, and after checking my emails at an internet cafe across the road, I zigzag through the concrete barriers and enter the fortified embassy compound. &apos;We&apos;re the American Embassy proxy,&apos; Graham explains. &apos;If there was an American Embassy they&apos;d be stoning them and chanting &quot;death to America&quot; outside their walls. Unfortunately we stand in for them. Of course the protests are well organised. The police could easily stop them completely and as it is they always move in before things get too heavy. Although we did have 80 windows broken last week.&apos; Despite all of which, there is a long visa applications queue. Before I arrived in Tehran I&apos;d made an Iranian contact through a university course in Australia and I&apos;ve got an invite to a party this evening. It&apos;s in a classy area of Tehran and dress wise, once we&apos;re indoors and the doors are closed, things are very different. The men look the same, but the women suddenly ditch the scarves and appear in jeans, T-shirts. Hair and bare arms, never seen on the street, suddenly appear. This could easily be a party in the West. There&apos;s even a bar ... and booze. &apos;Where does the beer come from?&apos; I ask Mansoor. &apos;One of the religious militia groups,&apos; he explains. &apos;This one has the monopoly on beer imports from Turkey. They&apos;ll bring in a container of &apos;arms&apos; which is actually Efes beer,&apos; he continues, handing me another cold can. I&apos;m being so charmed in so many different directions by the people I&apos;ve met in Tehran it brings me up short when an Irish woman explains in colourful detail what a hassle the men can be and how she has put a great deal of effort into learning Farsi insults to hurl back at men who come on to her. &apos;Telling them &quot;I&apos;d rather sleep with your sister&quot;, works pretty well,&apos; she explains. This doesn&apos;t sound like particularly good advice. Perhaps like me she&apos;s had a few too many cans of Efes tonight. It&apos;s 2am by the time the taxi drops me off at my hotel and I have trouble walking an absolutely straight line up the stairs to my room. Water features everywhere in Iran, flowing along street edges in the open drains known as jubes, cascading down channels in gardens and parks, sprinkling in fountains and in pools in the open courtyards of traditional old houses. It&apos;s also dispensed with remarkable civic generosity. In museums, parks, mosques - even along every length of street - there&apos;s usually a public refrigerated water dispenser, an Iranian version of a drinking fountain. In the big cities piped water is safe to drink and a happy consequence of this ready availability of cold drinking water is that Iran is not afflicted with the litter of empty plastic mineral water bottles which plagues so many developing countries. In Yazd, 450 miles south of Tehran, the water channels may be hidden from view, but examples of its other traditional architectural feature are very evident. Any worthwhile old home is topped by what looks like a cross between a stylish chimney and a lookout tower. They&apos;re badgirs, wind towers cunningly designed to catch a passing breeze and funnel it down over a pool of water in the house to provide a surprisingly effective form of natural air-conditioning. Restoring and reopening traditional old badgir-equipped houses as hotels and restaurants has become a local craze. I stay at the handsome Malek-o Tojjar, a fine example of one of these old houses. That afternoon, sipping tea in the courtyard cafe and reading Reading Lolita in Tehran, Azar Nafisi&apos;s novel about a reading group dipping into forbidden western literature, I&apos;m invited over to join a real reading group. The four Yazd university students, three of them female, are keen to practise their English and talk about the English language books they&apos;re studying. Young couples openly hold hands, women shake hands with you, talk to you and smile at you. In Saudi Arabia not only is there virtually no opportunity to talk to a Saudi woman, even if you did you&apos;d see no more than her eyes, and possibly not even those. Despite (or because of?) their modest attire, Iranian women are always eyeing you up. It&apos;s all shy smiles and seductive glances. Photographing the passing traffic in front of a mosque that evening a woman, passengering behind her boyfriend on a motorcycle, tosses me a wink and a wave; later that evening three old ladies chorus &apos;hello&apos; from their watermelon feast in an old city back alley. Dinner tonight is at the Silk Road, another photogenic hotel in a renovated old house. Once again the courtyard centres around a pool, the architecture is beautiful, the evening light glows, the badgir rises up as a backdrop. Some of the guests and diners sit at tables, some of the tables at knee height, others at a normal level. Others, like me, lounge back on wide, carpeted, sofa-like affairs, sitting cross-legged and sideways, leaning back against the armrest. When your meal is served it&apos;s arrayed in front of you, in the centre of the &apos;sofa&apos;. If there are two of you then you face each other. The sofa is wide enough to accommodate four. I&apos;m served some tea and sweets, but no food emerges from the kitchen until well after 9pm. The Iranians clearly rival the Spanish when it comes to eating late. It&apos;s no problem because simply watching what&apos;s going on is a delight. There&apos;s a buzz of happy activity, families, individuals, a handful of tourists, but mostly Iranians. Occasionally people climb upstairs for the view and we can see them silhouetted on the flat-topped roof. Lots of people smile over at me, stop to exchange a few words, enquire about my impressions of Iran or offer a &apos;welcome&apos; if nothing more.  Next stop is Esfahan. This single city alone could justify a trip to Iran, but it&apos;s hard to decide whether the prime attraction is the magnificent sweep of the Imam Square, with its perimeter of shopping arcades and its breathtaking blue-tiled mosques, or the gentle curve of the Zayandeh River with its multi-arched bridges. One of my favourite photographs from the trip my wife Maureen and I made across Asia in 1972 is of Maureen sitting on the river edge with the Khaju Bridge in the background. She is in an outfit, quite respectable, but which would have got her arrested by the Morality Police in 21st-century Iran. I wander down one side of the river, past couples strolling along holding hands. Later, a family asks me to pose with them in their photograph, standing on a teahouse balcony with the square as a backdrop. As the sun drops lower and the temperature cools, the square is full of evening activity. Once again that Persian passion for spreading out a rug on any patch of grass and having a picnic comes into play.  The next day I start with the square, walking past the shops, dropping in to the Sheikh Lotfollah and Imam mosques and exploring the Ali Qapu Palace. The Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque is a jewel box, so intricate and detailed it&apos;s hard to believe it&apos;s a building, not something you can pick up and carry away. There&apos;s the trademark Persian blue and turquoise tilework, but it&apos;s also tiled in green-white-gold. In contrast, the Imam Mosque is the whole damn Tiffany&apos;s, big and slightly odd, the entrance forming the end of the square, facing straight down the plaza.  On the balcony of the Ali Qapu Palace, I meet a young Iranian-American couple. Hassan and Sanaz live in Los Angeles, a city with probably the biggest Iranian populations in the US. He left Iran when he was a child, before the revolution, and has never been back before. She left 18 years ago, after the revolution. &apos;I was expecting it to be much worse,&apos; Sanaz admits. &apos;I think it&apos;s actually improved since I left but everybody complains,&apos; Hassan continues. &apos;Of course people always want change. Last Thursday we went to Jaam-e Jam. It&apos;s a shopping centre in North Tehran, very popular with young people and on Thursday afternoon they come out to show off.&apos;  &apos;Young guys with rings in their eyebrows and girls clearly pushing it as far as they can, scarves falling off to show their hair, lots of makeup. I&apos;d like to have taken some photographs, but they&apos;d probably not want their sins recorded.&apos; On the way from Esfahan to Kashan there&apos;s a brief encounter with that other Iran, the one that features in the press and TV much more often than beautiful hotels and friendly people. &apos;It&apos;s a nuclear research centre,&apos; my driver explains as we pass anti-aircraft gun emplacements and half-buried buildings.  Back in Tehran, I emerge from the bus station, check my guidebook and start to cross the road. Half way across the highway I&apos;m hit, not by a car, bus or motorcycle, but once again by the realisation that Iran can be a surprisingly sophisticated country, well aware of the outside world and how they connect to it. &apos;Hey, Lonely Planet,&apos; yells the cop directing the traffic and simultaneously pointing at my open guidebook. &apos;Which way you going, man?&apos; Holidays on the edge North Korea Attractions: The isolation - it&apos;s the one place in the world where no one has heard of David Beckham.

The Premiership&apos;s second-ever Iranian - Karim Bagheri made a substitute&apos;s appearance for Charlton in 2000 - has spent the best part of a year settling into England and, since signing from FC Aboomoslem last summer, 10 of his 16 appearances have come as a substitute. But having scored two goals in two league starts and two goals in two FA Cup starts it is easy to understand why Sam Allardyce describes the defensive midfielder as his &quot;little diamond&quot;. Wigan quickly discovered that Teymourian is razor sharp with an uncanny ability to shine at important moments. At \u00a3255,000, Bolton initially felt their investment was a bargain; now they are starting to view the player as priceless. &quot;He is a lad who has found coming to a new country a bit of a challenge, but it&apos;s a dream that is coming true for him,&quot; said Allardyce, the Bolton manager. &quot;For him to play in the Premiership means he will be a god back home if he can succeed, and that&apos;s his driving force. &quot; &quot;I don&apos;t think we realise how big the Premiership is but when players like him come and tell you how much it&apos;s watched in Iran, Kuwait, Dubai and places like that you realise that their love for the Premiership means if they get the opportunity to come here they can&apos;t wait to grasp it with both hands.&quot; That is exactly what he did here. In the 68th minute and with the match evenly poised - Emile Heskey&apos;s 100th league goal was equalised by Nicolas Anelka just before half-time - Jussi Jaaskelainen punted deep into Wigan territory, prompting Teymourian to set off from his own half, more in hope than expectation. El-Hadji Diouf produced a piece of exquisite control to kill the ball and his astute hold-up play enabled Teymourian to progress almost unnoticed. Diouf then sliced open the Wigan defence with a sumptuous pass and Teymourian slotted under John Filan&apos;s body with a first-time finish. It was a goal that left the JJB gasping for breath. His second five minutes later was less eye-catching - Kevin Davies bamboozling Leighton Baines before crossing for him to head beyond Filan - but equally well worked and finished. The 24-year-old played all three of Iran&apos;s games at last summer&apos;s World Cup but snuck under the radar of Europe&apos;s biggest clubs and appears to be the latest in a long list of players Allardyce has gambled on and been rewarded. &quot;We got a call saying there was a young lad in Iran who wants to come to play in England if he can get the chance,&quot; said Allardyce. &quot;We got his name from the agent and he told us the price. Over there $500,000 is a lot of money and we said what a lot of money that was going to be. But it was a steal. We were only pretending, as you do when you negotiate.&quot; Bolton&apos;s victory lifts them to within two points of fourth-placed Arsenal. Earlier this month Allardyce had warned his side they were in danger of missing out on a Uefa Cup spot unless their form improved. But the Gunners have lost their last three Premiership games and the final Champions League spot is now within touching distance, not that Allardyce is keen on the idea of competing in Europe&apos;s elite competition. &quot;Forget that, it could destroy this club if we went in the Champions League,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re not big enough for that.&quot; Wigan, conversely, are in big trouble. Paul Jewell&apos;s men have not won for over a month and are displaying all the signs of a team heading for relegation, with the Latics&apos; manager conceding &quot;we are certainly in a dogfight&quot;. His side have dropped more points from winning positions than any other team in the division and, after being pegged back on Saturday there was only ever going to be one winner. Should Wigan lose at Aston Villa today and Charlton beat Reading at home, Wigan will be one place and two points above Sheffield United, who are third from bottom, having played a game more. Intriguingly, the Latics travel to Bramall Lane on the final day of the season.

But its appetite for the fight remains undimmed. The failure of the bid means that private equity has still to buy out a FTSE 100 company, although that event seems likely to be just around the corner after Alliance Boots opened its books two weeks ago to a bid fronted by its own deputy chairman. Investors, including pension funds, have had their heads turned by some of the spectacular returns boasted of in the private equity industry. The result is that the firms continue to raise eye-watering amounts of capital - all but compelling them to make ever bigger bids. According to figures supplied by Thomson Financial, $62.5bn (\u00a331.5bn) was raised by private equity funds in Britain last year. That was up from $46bn (\u00a323bn) in 2005 and just $11bn (\u00a35.6bn) in 2004. Funds will then commonly borrow another four or five times the cash raised to pay for buyouts. Andrew Burrows, director of the Centre for Management Buyout Research at the Nottingham University Business School said the volume of deals in the first quarter this year had slowed due to an absence of any big deals closing. But he said there was no reason to suspect the failed offer for Sainsbury&apos;s would interrupt the longer term flow of deals. &quot;Last year was the biggest ever for private equity deals in Britain and I don&apos;t see the market changing,&quot; he said. The value of private equity-backed deals in Britain reached $89bn last year, according to Thomson Financial. The latest big bid could be about to emerge. There were reports yesterday that CVC Capital, one of the failed Sainsbury&apos;s bidders, was preparing to gatecrash Imperial Tobacco&apos;s \u20ac12bn (\u00a38.2bn) offer for the Franco-Spanish cigarette maker Altadis, which owns Gauloises and Gitanes. There have also been market rumours about bids for Unilever and Ladbrokes, among many others. The market is still awash with smaller takeovers. Countrywide, Britain&apos;s biggest estate agency group, yesterday agreed to a \u00a31.05bn bid from the US private equity group Apollo. Another estate agency, Foxtons, and the Indian food specialist Pataks both recently invited offers from private equity firms. The private equity group TA Associates backed a \u00a3740m buyout of asset management firm Jupiter from Germany&apos;s Commerzbank last month. The secondary market for private equity firms is also busy - when one private equity firm sells to another. Permira and Apax, which bought the fashion retailer New Look for \u00a3700m three years ago, have put the business up for sale. The car parks group NCP recently changed hands. Also last month, Dubai International Capital sold Tussauds Group to the Blackstone-backed owner of Legoland. The \u00a310.1bn bid for Sainsbury&apos;s (\u00a311.4bn including debt), which collapsed on Wednesday, would have been the biggest leveraged buyout ever done in Britain, but the consortium of CVC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone and Texas Pacific began to unravel last week. Even as ever higher sums are raised by private equity firms, they are facing stiffer resistance from company boards and shareholders. There is increasing suspicion that they have been getting companies on the cheap. The commonly cited case is Debenhams, where private equity investors made more than three times their investment in little more than two years. In the case of Sainsbury&apos;s, the founding family, which still owns an 18% stake in the business, argued successfully that the predators were bringing nothing new to the supermarket chain that it could not achieve as a public company. The argument had merit. The private equity bidders intended to leave the management team in place and had no clear intention to alter the trading strategy. What it did hope to do was sell off the freehold of Sainsbury&apos;s larger properties, and no doubt take big dividends - precisely the kind of deal that unions and politicians have railed against. Future deals will need a more compelling argument to succeed. Attention now will turn to Alliance Boots. Another private equity firm, Terra Firma, fronted by financier Guy Hands, teamed up last week with the Wellcome Trust, the medical research charity, to become the second group to approach the company. It began due diligence over Easter. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Italian billionaire Stefano Pessina have already made an informal offer of \u00a310.1bn. The mere fact that Alliance Boots has agreed to open its books suggests a takeover will happen. The failure of the Sainsbury&apos;s bid in the face of active opposition will have done little to enhance private equity&apos;s already sullied reputation. But the pressure to do deals will not subside. Not least because of the vast sums at stake for private equity fund managers - they commonly take 20% of the profits from a successful deal.", "tags": ["Private equity", "Supermarkets", "Business"], "title": "\u00a331bn says funds will come back fighting", "sentences": ["Also last month, Dubai International Capital sold Tussauds Group to the Blackstone-backed owner of Legoland."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/13/privateequity.supermarkets", "publicationDate": "2007-04-12T23:03:17Z"}, {"article": "Mighty Man kept his 100% Aintree record intact on Thursday.

The mare disappointed at Cheltenham last month but Tom Mullins, her trainer, yesterday issued a positive bulletin on Asian Maze (2.50). &quot;I think she&apos;s in similar form to last year,&quot; he said. &quot;If she did what she did then, she won&apos;t be beaten.&quot; Afsoun ran well to be third in the Champion but, with 100-1 shot Kawagino fifth and Detroit City running no sort of race, the form may not be reliable.

It will be another monstrous engineering work that risks environmental disaster, and will cost upward of $5 billion. Whatever transpires, it will be another episode in the extraordinary story of western man&apos;s compulsion to wrestle with nature in the central American swamps and rainforests. Ever since, in 1513, the Spanish explorer Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa stood with the Atlantic behind him &quot;silent upon a peak in Darien&quot;, and saw for the first time with European eyes the unknown Pacific just 40-odd miles away, the linking of the oceans had been a great cause. For some it promised to unify the world, for others to bring infinite riches. Panama was one of five possible routes surveyed and to this strange spit of land were drawn between 1870 and 1913 idealists, dreamers, speculators, soldiers, scoundrels, bankers, statesmen, and an army of labourers who came mainly from the British West Indies. The artist Paul Gauguin was one of the few who went and made his fortune. Vast numbers never returned. Crossing the isthmus, says Matthew Parker, a historian equally at home with geography, central American politics and Victorian medical advances, was closer to waging war - against the forests and mountains of Panama - than it was to other engineering projects. In the 30 years that the canal took to build, he says, at least 25,000 people died of fevers and accidents, and many more were maimed or debilitated. In that time a mountain was literally laid waste by men with shovels and gunpowder; more than 300m cubic yards of rock and spoil were extracted. This was history&apos;s greatest engineering marvel, the most expensive and deadly enterprise ever attempted. Victory, it was said, would be an achievement for mankind. Parker does justice to this political and social drama. This was the culmination of the Victorian dream of progress, the last great act of nations before the first world war. The elite truly believed they could do anything, at whatever human or ecological price, and the forces of progress would prevail. They did, but at what cost. This was war waged not just on the rocks and the trees by humans, but on whoever came to Panama for the cause. Typhoid, dysentery, smallpox, pneumonia, yellow fever and above all a vicious form of malaria were rampant. Three out of four French engineers died within months of arriving; in 1885 70 men in every 1,000 died. In 1906 nearly 22,000 men were treated for illness and 80% of the workforce had malaria. Five hundred lives were lost for every mile of canal dug. One West Indian remembered: &quot;You turn up in the morning with a gang of 125 men and by 11 o&apos;clock 40 of them fall down with malaria. They spin like a top before they fall&quot;. Why did these brave men flock to work in such conditions? They were desperate for cash, but underpinning the whole enterprise, argues Parker, were concepts of national duty, patriotism and self-denial for the greater good. For the campaign generals the draw was history itself. Ferdinand de Lesseps, fresh from his triumph completing the Suez canal, woefully overreached both himself and France by opting for a sea-level route. In its last years the project was guided by the American president Theodore Roosevelt, who arrogantly claimed that he alone had &quot;taken the isthmus&quot; and started the project. He told the workforce they were soldiers in &quot;one of the few great wars of the world&apos;s history&quot;. Did the end justify the means? Parker notes the poet Heinrich Goethe&apos;s prediction in the 1820s that the canal would have &quot;incalculable results&quot;, which turned out to include the dawn of an age of American imperialism and of state-sponsored great projects; but he is ambivalent on the environmental cost. Today other armies of impoverished workmen build Dubai, Shanghai or the Three Gorges Dam with barely a murmur of the real price paid by them and by nature. It is a shame.

Jamie Carragher attempted to suggest something similar a few weeks ago, when the evidence was not quite so overpowering, and was embarrassed when his words appeared in the papers as a taunt to the Italian and Spanish league that our top four would beat either of theirs. Now it is beginning to look as if that might be the case anyway and, considering Arsenal reached last year&apos;s Champions League final, it might not be long before English domination of Europe could soon be back on the agenda.  This is not a time for complaining that the Champions League is strangling domestic competition, or pointing out that very few of the managerial or playing personnel of the Premiership&apos;s top four are actually English. No one was doing that when Italy had three teams in the last four in 2003 or when Spain provided three semi-finalists in 2000. This is England&apos;s moment in the sun and, while the recent experiences of Italian and Spanish clubs offer a warning of how transitory this kind of success can be it would be silly not to admit that whatever its faults and inequalities, the Premiership must be doing something right.  It is certainly doing its sums right, for a start. Full stadiums every week, give or take the odd Wigan or Blackburn, and a new television deal kicking in next season that is going to make anything seen so far look niggardly. It is true that Premiership clubs are being snapped up by foreign investors at an alarming rate and that Chelsea&apos;s wealth comes from one man&apos;s whim rather than any sustained economic growth, but what do Roman Abramovich, Malcolm Glazer, Randy Lerner, Tom Hicks and George Gillett have in common? They all wanted to be in the Premiership. Not Serie A, not La Liga, not Formula One or Dubai bloodstock and not even the endlessly proposed European breakaway league. Yes, it could be argued that international moneymen are positioning themselves for the moment the G-14 clubs decide to go it alone, but if that is the case why are they all buying teams in England? And why are all the best managers in England? Not to mention most of the best players. If the present trend continues for just a couple more seasons, a European breakaway league will come into existence anyway. It will just have to change its name from the Premiership. At this rate any other sort of breakaway will be instigated by continental clubs seeking to exclude the English.  Real Madrid could have swiftly altered this perception by prising Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United, but it didn&apos;t happen. Even if it had, for the sort of money they were talking about United could have restored the balance, Glazers permitting, by cherrypicking a big name or two from Barcelona. Ronaldo might find Real Madrid hard to resist in the longer term, but United have at least two strong arguments in their favour. They have a very good team and they have a very good chance of winning the major prizes. Real Madrid can currently say neither and even with Ronaldo that situation would not have changed instantly. Ronaldo would simply have been expected to make it change, that&apos;s all. When you are billed as the best player in the world, that&apos;s how it works. Zinedine Zidane managed it, but of the two options you can&apos;t blame Ronaldo for leaving the BPITW pressure with Ronaldinho for a few more seasons while continuing to see how much he can win with the young buccaneers of United.  What Roma might find difficult to believe is that the present incarnation of United have hardly won anything yet. They have still to establish themselves as the best team in England and, if Chelsea have their way and gain any more help from shock results in the league such as last Saturday&apos;s, United could finish the season empty-handed. And then there&apos;s Liverpool, who have the capacity to inflict damage only in the European Cup, but remain the one team no one in Europe ever fancies taking on in that competition.  Everyone has been making rather blithe assumptions about United and Chelsea in the final, though Jose Mourinho will not be taking anything for granted, even if his side will be powerfully motivated after the events of two years ago. And deep down, in their heart of hearts, United supporters, or at least the ones I talk to, are queasy about the prospect of meeting Liverpool in a Champions League final. That is to say, they would love to beat Liverpool in a Champions League final, nothing could be finer, they could sing about it for years and finally have a retort to Scousers chanting about winning it five times. But the prospect of losing is grim indeed, and this applies to both teams.  Neither set of supporters would hear the last of it for generations. True rivalries are like that. No one from Manchester particularly wants to lose to Chelsea in Athens either, particularly as there is bound to be some more Premiership and FA Cup history between the two sides by then, but Scousers and Mancunians will still be hating each other long after Abramovich has sailed off into the sunset. Or Mourinho, which seems more likely at the moment.  It hardly seems credible that Chelsea are contemplating parting with Mourinho just when he has a powerful team playing in exactly they way he wants them to play, but much of what has happened at Stamford Bridge over the past few years hardly seems credible. It basically comes down to the fact that Abramovich can do what he likes, and probably will. Yet only if Chelsea were to fail again in Europe, after reaching three Champions League semis in the last four years, would Abramovich have the slightest case against his manager. Should Chelsea win a European Cup, or even give United or Milan a decent game in the final, it is hard to guess where the club might start looking for anyone better.  Last time they needed someone, they just went out and bought the guy who had won the European Cup with Porto. Liverpool did something similar at the same time. Once Gerard Houllier had been eased out, the bloke who won the Uefa Cup with Valencia was eased in. As long as you have the money, buying proven managers is the easiest and most obvious route to success. Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson took different routes to the top, it is true, though top-four clubs no longer start looking for new managers in Nagoya or Aberdeen, which is why Chelsea&apos;s professed admiration for Mark Hughes had a slightly phoney ring.  But Chelsea are going to have to do something different for having, hit on a policy that works, they will not find it so straightforward recruiting Champions League-winning managers if English clubs intend to dominate the competition. Not unless they plan to offer employment to Ferguson, Wenger or Rafa Benitez, each of which seems a highly unlikely appointment. Considerably less fanciful, if Chelsea insist on discarding their most successful manager, is the idea that United might come along and scoop him up. Well why not? Ferguson cannot last forever and could bow out if this season ends on a suitable high. Hughes and Roy Keane are still relative beginners with little or no managerial experience of European club competitions and they will still be around in a few years. Mourinho has nothing to prove, everything to gain and is younger than the usual suspects for the United succession. The time for Marcello Lippi or Ottmar Hitzfeld has surely passed. Fabio Capello? Suddenly a CV that includes Roma, Juventus and Real Madrid does not look quite so compelling.  Mourinho might be interested in Capello&apos;s present job, though that is merely another reason for United to act quickly should he become available. Real Madrid might be hard for managers to turn down for all sorts of personal, historical and sentimental reasons, but United cannot be far behind. And in terms of footballing potential, United put their cards on the table against Roma.  In short, if Chelsea release Mourinho they make a problem for themselves and solve a long-standing worry for United. No wonder the normally bumptious Peter Kenyon has gone so eerily quiet. Of course this is wild hypothesising and entirely conditional on Chelsea being daft enough to dump Mourinho in the first place, but how many other English-speaking, Premiership-winning, Champions League-winning, loyalty-inspiring and genuinely charismatic managers are likely to come on to the market in the near future? The English policy of recruiting top managers from abroad and marrying their skills to the ability of the international players Premiership clubs can afford has proved such a success it can no longer continue.  The top managers and the top clubs are now in England. Up-and-coming coaches such as Sevilla&apos;s Juande Ramos want in. Real Madrid might want Mourinho or Benitez, but they are playing catch-up. The logical progression for English clubs is to appoint from within. Mourinho has said he doesn&apos;t fancy taking over another Premiership club straight after Chelsea, but as with anything else it depends what offers he gets. Chelsea appear to think if they freeze him out he will reappear somewhere in Europe. They could be in for a shock. England is where it&apos;s at.

Ouch. Mind you it&apos;ll hurt the Bangladeshis too - they hate short pitched bowling. Here&apos;s an audio link, kindly provided by Sunil x for all you non TMS listening expats. 2nd over: Bangladesh 7-0 (Iqbal 1 Nafees 0) Jacob Reed, your email just wants to make me poor scorn and abuse on your head. I&apos;m using my last reserves of good will to stop myself doing just that. You berk. Langford-Smith is causing havoc at the other end. But not as much havoc as my computer, which is blanking out my words, so I can&apos;t see what I&apos;m writing. I wonder if I got through this without any typos. 3rd over: Bangladesh 11-0 (Iqbal 1 Nafees 4) Nafees takes four from this over. I take only a pause to reflect. 4th over: Bangladesh 13-0 (Iqbal 2 Nafees 5) Here&apos;s a nice spot from Heather: &quot;Kevin Pietersen was just on TMS. He said he only got going in the Australia match when Ponting started screaming abuse at him. He then tried to pretend he didn&apos;t hate Graham Smith. Should do well on Tuesday.&quot; Tamim gets a thick edge wide of the slips and the total rolls on by one. 5th over: Bangladesh 18-0 (Iqbal 2 Nafees 5) Jeff Feim&apos;s got something to say so listen up: &quot;I was just listening to the Stan James audio when they made a reference to  www.cricketjokes.com. So I checked it out. Someone needs to get a day job. There&apos;s a section of quotes by famous names. Examples, Brian Johnson, &quot;The bowler&apos;s Holding, the batsman&apos;s Willey.&quot; So I was wondering why there are no entries by OBOers Bull or Smyth. After all, your job is to take the piss out of the game, the players, the administrators and your e-mailers in an attempt to counter the tranquilizing effects of the many gripping and not so gripping contests of late. We dedicated OBO e-mailers need a new challenge. Let&apos;s pick an amusing aside of yours to submit to that site and immortalize your rapier-like wit. After all, if they have quotes from the Duke of Edinburgh, Farook Engineer and Groucho Marx, surely you blokes can do better than those yobos.&quot; I&apos;ll never come up with anything as good as the bowler&apos;s Holding the batsman&apos;s Willey. May as well give up trying. Neither did Brain Johnson mind - the story is apocryphal. Back in Barbados, Rankin is giving an authentic Harmison impression as he scatters wides and unplayable bouncers everywhere. 6th over: Bangladesh 18-0 (Iqbal 2 Nafees 5) 226 runs needed to win. Which allows Trent Johnston to bring in a third slip. It&apos;s a fantastic maiden from Langford-Smith, six balls pitching outisdie off and swinging back in. Iqbal played and missed with wild swipes at all six of them. &quot;There was some discussion yesterday about whether it was fair to label Aussies as bullies.&quot; Indeed there was Gary Naylor, well: &quot;Shane Warne&apos;s Hampshire are playing the callow youths of Cardiff University, in order to get their first class averages off to a flyer. Hampshire lead by 666 runs, but, suffice it to say, Warne is yet to declare.&quot; Tee hee. I love it when students get thrown in to play against pro sportsmen: world cup winner and Aussie rugby union legend Joe Roff was lining up in centre for Oxford this season. No doubt he slaughtered more than a few hungover 19-year-olds. WICKET! Nafees 7 c O&apos;Brien b Rankin (7th over: Bangladesh 19-1) Rankin spears down a brute of a ball and Nafees is a little late on his hook, he top-edges the ball high into the air behind the wicket, and Niall O&apos;Brien takes an easy catch. Aftab Ahmed comes in, having been promoted up the order. 8th over: Bangladesh 23-1 (Iqbal 5 Ahmed 1) John Mooney has an incredible look in the field you know, long, chunky sideburns and a substantial &apos;tache. He looks like he&apos;s walked off the set of the Sweeney. Ah, my computer keeps crashing. Can you folks hold on while I switch across to one of the PCs that wasn&apos;t left over from the 1980s? Ta. Tamim slams a couple of runs through mid-off. 9th over: Bangladesh 40-1 (Iqbal 8 Ahmed 11) Aftab plays to leg, but squirts a leading edge through the covers for four. That seems to get his juices flowing and he twists his short frame around an extraordinary lofted on-drive that disappears into the sky and doesn&apos;t come down again till it&apos;s over the crowd. An amazing shot. It flumoxes Rankin into sending down two wides with his next two balls, Ahmed takes a single and then it&apos;s yet another wide. Iqbal slices a hook around the corner for one more and that&apos;s 18 off the over. A few more of them would suit me just fine. 10th over: Bangladesh 45-1 (Iqbal 13 Ahmed 12) Shameless publicist of all things bearded Keith Flett has dropped us a line to remind us of the The Latest Super 8 shortlist for the Beard of the 2007 World Cup Award: &quot;1) Ravi Bopara 2) Kenneth Carroll [Ireland] 3) Corey Collymore 4)Chris Gayle 5) Muralitharan 6)Shahriar Nafees 7) Monty Panesar 8)Scott Styris 9)Andrew Symonds.&quot; Iqbal strokes a four off the back foot through cover and away for four. WICKET! Ahmed 12 lbw Botha (11th over: Bangladesh 46-2)  Johnston is having an amazing day as captain: he&apos;s brought on Andre Botha who has now taken a wicket with his first ball. It was wide and more than a touch rank but Ahmed swung at it and got the faintest of edges. When O&apos;Brien gathered the ball, Billy Bowden swung up his crooked finger. Saqibal is in, and out my window there is an absurdly pretty sunset, a rich range of oranges and reds as the still flickering rays of dying sun are caught in the fug of smoke and grit that hangs over the city. WICKET! Saqibal 3 run out Botha (13th over: Bangladesh 48-3)  197 runs needed. Only one came off the 12th over, which I somehow managed to miss altogether. Botha is back on now, and the Bangladeshis can&apos;t get him off the square. We may have a wicket here, the Irish are utterly ecstatic, they think they&apos;ve got Saqibal, backing up at the non-striker&apos;s end. Iqbal thrashed a straight drive down the pitch and Botha dropped his hand on it, flicking the ball with his finger as it sped on into the stumps. What an unlucky way to go. &quot;He&apos;s gone he&apos;s gone he wasn&apos;t backing up properly&quot; shouts Kevin O&apos;Brien and monents later the third umpire confirms that yes, Saqibal has gone. &quot;Who was backing up?&quot; whispers Nasser Hussain before announcing the information as if he&apos;d known it all along - someone should really tell him not to speak his asides into the microphone. 14th over: Bangladesh 53-3 (Iqbal 17 Ashraful 0) Iqbal is a dream to watch bat. He&apos;s only 18, and I never get tired of remembering that. He&apos;s just blazed a unbelievable square drive across the turf to the rope for four. 15th over: Bangladesh 61-3 (Iqbal 17 Ashraful 4) Ashraful splits the gully and slips with a peachy late cut. Ah and he&apos;s just toying with them now, lofting an uppercut over slip and away for four more to third man. 16th over: Bangladesh 67-3 (Iqbal 17 Ashraful 13) Apologies everyone, I&apos;ve just been out for a cigarette and a moment, and for the first time in this whole world cup I&apos;m just thinking: &quot;I want to go home and sit down and do nothing&quot;. This is my fifth OBO of the week and I can&apos;t even remember what the first three of them were. How long has this Cup been goin on for? It&apos;s unbelievable. 17th over: Bangladesh 77-3 (Iqbal 17 Ashraful 24) At least we&apos;ve got the Bangladeshis to watch, and you know they won&apos;t bore you: Botha drops short, Ashraful hooks him away for six. Botha pitches up and Ashraful hits the perfect cover drive down on one knee, that was the shot they&apos;d carve if they were making a statue of the man. 18th over: Bangladesh 82-3 (Iqbal 23 Ashraful 27) Iqbal shows off his own skills with a straight drive that fizzes into acres of space at long-on and runs to the ropes for four. Some nice man has emailed to call me a poetic bastard. Others, communicating the same sentiment in a different manner, have pointed out that I&apos;ve had Ireland in again for the last four overs. What can I say? 168 overs into a twenty-hour working weekend that coincides with the hottest weather we&apos;ve had all year, I&apos;m shot. Done. 19th over: Bangladesh 88-3 (Iqbal 25 Ashraful 28) 156 needed to win. Maybe some coffee is what I need? Maybe it&apos;s what Clare Davies needs too: &quot;are you and Smyth OBOers? I always thought WE were the OBOers and you were the GU facilitating gurus. Am I confused? Probably.&quot; WICKET! Iqbal 29 b Johnston (20th over: Bangladesh 93-4)  Ashraful dabs one to leg. Thank god for the Banglas, almost any other team would be robbing me of my will to do anything other than fall asleep. Tamim chips a four with a wallop down to the long-off boundary. Johnston gets him next ball though, and we&apos;re treated to another Irish jig/chicken dance thing in celebration. Iqbal came down the pitch and Johnson called his bluff and sent him a yorker, which the batsman chopped onto his own stumps. 21st over: Bangladesh 98-4 (Ashraful 34 Bashar 0) Kyle McCallan is on, another fine performer for the Irish over the last month or so. He&apos;s offered a touch too much width here though, and been driven tidily to the cover fence by Ashraful. Clare Davies, I know exactly what you&apos;re saying: &quot;I more than sometimes feel this World Cup has been going my entire life. I have no recollection now of the early matches, and although dreading the weeks ahead, know having done this much, I just have to stick with it. It makes the ordeal of the Ashes and CB Series pale into insignificance.&quot; And how long did we get between the CB Series and the Cup? Two weeks. And how long do we get between the end of the Cup and the first Test of the English summer? Two weeks. WICKET! Ashraful 35 c Langford-Smith b Rankin (22nd over: Bangladesh 102-5) Rankin returns with a couple of wides. Ashraful swipes an ungasinly hook high but short of fine leg. Bashar scores his first with a cut down to the boundary past point. The commentators are making a lot of how badly Bashar is running out in the middle, and they&apos;re right - his mind is clearly somewhere else. As is Ashraful&apos;s, he hooks down to fine leg and straight down the throat of Dave Langford-Smith. He takes the catch and Bangladesh are throwing their wickets and their bats. 23rd over: Bangladesh 103-5 (Bashar 2 Rahim 0) &quot;He&apos;s like Ole Gunnar Solskjaer! Let&apos;s get the baby faced assassin!&quot; shouts Niall O&apos;Brien in one of the limper sledges I&apos;ve heard in recent times. &quot;All this talk about weather - in Delhi it is 1.03 am and 32C.&quot; I hope I win hands down. I am a very competitive person. Shreela Debi, you do indeed win, though I didn&apos;t know we were having a competition. 24th over: Bangladesh 104-5 (Bashar 2 Rahim 0) &quot;After reading what you/I wrote just there, I suddenly have a really genuine dawning of understanding about poor old Marcus Trescothick. If you feel like this as a commentator, and I as a mere dilettante fan, who can come and go at will, christ, what must it be like for the players? Not surprised he said what he did this week about mental pressure and burn-out.&quot;You&apos;re right Clare, one thing that we are all to culpable of is that professional sport, especially cricket where you play up to five days a week, is a job like any other. And the players get depressed and fed up with work just like the rest of us can. 25th over: Bangladesh 104-5 (Bashar 3 Rahim 0) Nasser Hussain is relating the woes of just that right now: &quot;when you&apos;re out of nick, your brain is completely scrambled, all these thoughts racing around your mind, are my feet moving? Is my head still? do I need more time in the nets? Naylor makes a similarly erudite point: &quot;The Bangladeshis may be young, but they have over four times as much experience of ODIs than the Irish team - you wouldn&apos;t know that from observing this innings.&quot; 26th over: Bangladesh 108-5 (Bashar 3 Rahim 0) Dropped him! In terrible fashion too - Rahim whipped a hook round to square leg and Langford-Smith was underneath it. For a long time. There is an extraordinary look of fear in his eyes as it happened, his face red and his mouth open, tension all over. He dropped to his knees, the sun blinding his eyes, and the ball dropped down in front of him. Well sorry about that the computer I was on finally gave up the ghost and stopped working. I&apos;ve switched across now, and we pick up play three overs later with Bangladesh on 120-5. Rankin is on, trying to winkle out a third wicket to make amends for the 40-odd runs he&apos;s given up sp far. Rahim cuts him square to the cover boundary for one. Bangladesh need a run-a-ball from here onwards to win. WICKET! Rahim 16 b McCallan (31st over: Bangladesh 133-6)  Molly Malone rings out around Barbados, though it&apos;s quickly hushed up by a pair of stunning shots from Rahim. The first sees him step down the pitch and drive in the air down to long-off for four, the second is slipped through the covers off the backfoot. And then McCallan gets him, in most satisfying fashion: the ball is floated up and it bites back off the turf and goes through his gate and into the stumps. WICKET! Mortaza 0 c&amp;b Langford-Smith (32nd over: Bangladesh 134-7) There&apos;s so much pressure on Habibul now: he has to win this match himself, even more so now! Mortaza, a dangerous hitter, has gone. In limp fashion too - popping a full toss straight back to Langford-Smith, who takes the catch and breaks out that fat drunken uncle at your cousin&apos;s wedding style dance. And now Rafique is in. There have been more than a few emails asking what a win here means for Ireland&apos;s world rankings: I haven&apos;t answered them because I don&apos;t know. But, at a guess, I suppose if they win here they move into the top ten and start getting to play series against the big boy&apos;s teams more often. Maybe one of you could do my work for me and find out? 33rd over: Bangladesh 138-7 (Bashar 15 Rafique 1) Ok, even before I asked, Pete Baker had answered: &quot;An Irish win would see Ireland officially ranked 12th of the ICC One Day International sides and for two years will be able to play ODI series against the other ranked sides.&quot; Top 12? Is that all? They&apos;re clearly the 10th best team in the world right now. Don&apos;t they already have a series booked in against West Indies later this year? There I go again, asking questions I should answer myself. A tremendous diving stop by Porterfield at short mid-wicket denies Bashar the four runs that that shot deserved. WICKET! Rafique 2 b Langford-Smith c Johnston (34th over: Bangladesh 138-8) Jeff Ando is sending me repeated emails asking who I want in the Test XI against the Windies this summer. Even though this game has nothing to do with Test cricket. Or England. Or later this summer. Or the fact that Ireland ahve taken yet another wicket. They&apos;ve totally outplayed Bangladesh all day long, and now Rafique has gone: miscuing a pull so it span up in the air off the top edge, allowing Trent Johnston to take a good catch running back from mid-off. 35th over: Bangladesh 140-8 (Bashar 17 Razzaq 2) Anyway, my Test team: Mark Butcher, Darren Maddy, Ali Brown, Graeme Hick, Mark Ramprakash, Rob Key, Paul Nixon, Robert Croft, Alex Tudor, Andy Caddick, Darren Gough. Alright? Now, no more questions on that innocuous selection please, and back to the brilliant battling Irish. Just for the next over, not this one. 36th over: Bangladesh 144-8 (Bashar 18 Razzaq 3) Naylor&apos;s right, Naylor&apos;s right, I was wrong: this is the last word on the English Test team: &quot;Tell Jeff Ando that for the England&apos;s First Test, I want Trent Johnston in as captain.&quot; 101 needed from 86 balls. 37th over: Bangladesh 149-8 (Bashar 18 Razzaq 3) Bangladesh are still scrabbling around, caught between not tossing away any more wickets and keeping up with a run rate that is slipping away from them. Ok, and Lou Roper has wangled a place in the English team for Niall O&apos;Brien too, and actually I&apos;d quite like a bit of Andre Botha and Dave Langford-Smith too. Maybe we could squeeze in McCallan and Bray as well? And Rankin&apos;s not far off. 38th over: Bangladesh 157 -8 (Bashar 25 Razzaq 6) Bashar gets a thick edge on a wider ball from a tiring Langford-Smith, and it gives him not just his first boundary of the innings, but his highest score of the tournament so far. The bowler is struggling to see this over out, and can&apos;t help but give up a pair of wides as he finishes off his excellent spell of ten overs, two wickets for 27 runs. 39th over: Bangladesh 161-8 (Bashar 27 Razzaq 8) Stephen Todd does cynicism rather well don&apos;t you think: &quot;Why don&apos;t we all just accept that cricket has turned into a pyramid scheme for Malcolm Speed and the ICC, and instead of actually playing the game, we can all line up in a stadium and throw our hard earned money at Mr. Speed and the rest of the officials in the ICC. Or, better yet, why don&apos;t we just go to Dubai and write them cheques. That way we might actually enjoy a week in the sun!&quot; Botha bellows out an lbw shout but Billy Bowden isn&apos;t keen so he shakes his head and strolls away. Am I imagining it or did Sky just flash up a still shot of someone holding an apple in close up? What the hell was that about? WICKET! Razzaq b McCallan 41st over: Bangladesh 169-9 The 40th over was another of those that just seemed to pass me by. Johnston bowled a couple of wides, the two Bangladeshis swapped some singles and then Bashar biffed the sixth ball for four. McCallan has come back on, and it&apos;s probably time to start paying some attention again becuase Bangladesh need 75 off 60, and until they&apos;re out, they&apos;re not going to give up. Razzaq has a couple of wild heaves, as he fancies the spinner to go over the top. And there&apos;s the wicket they needed! McCallan comes around the wicket and darts in a quicket ball that beats Razzaq&apos;s ropey looking drive and hits leg stump. We&apos;ve some theories coming through on that very weird static shot of some fruit by Sky: &quot;Ruairi here in Dublin. It was a plum - bad joke (especially seeing the umpire didn&apos;t give it). The commentators are desperately trying to distance themselves from whoever decided to flash that one up!&quot; Indeed. WICKET! Bashar 32 b Johnston (42nd over: Bangladesh 169) They&apos;ve won, by a huge 74 runs, and how fitting it&apos;s Johnston who took the final wicket. He&apos;s had a fantastic World Cup and a great game today. He put that last ball on a length and as Bashar swiped across the line, the ball shaped in a touch and hit the off stump. The Irish go crazy , and Bangladesh are now out of this tournament. Ireland win by 74 runs. So thanks for all your emails. I&apos;m pretty shattered, but at least we&apos;ve had a good game today. Thanks for all your emails and I&apos;ll see you back here tomorrow for Australia v Sri Lanka. Bye.

Tony Loyden&apos;s father dived into the sea to try to catch the boy but could only watch helplessly as he was swept inshore by winds of almost 30mph. Initially the boatmen in charge of the parasailing trips were convicted of manslaughter, because the driver of the speedboat was not properly trained and the pair had not checked the weather forecast. However, they were cleared on appeal after it was judged they could not have anticipated the squall. The schoolboy from Plymouth and his parents, Tony, 49, and Patsy, 48, were living in Dubai when the family decided to go parasailing with friends. The boy was so excited that his father let the youngster go ahead of him. Within minutes of Tony going up on the parachute the wind speed increased from 7.3mph to 29.9mph. The force of the parachute made the boat heel over and the rope snapped, sending the boy flying towards shore. The boat tried to follow him but his father Tony leapt into the sea and swam ashore as the boy flew towards the roof of the Rashid Mosque.

The boatmen in charge of the parasailing trips were initially convicted of manslaughter because the driver of the speedboat was not properly trained and the pair had not checked the weather forecast.

The schoolboy, from Plymouth, and his parents, Tony, 49, and Patsy, 48, were living in Dubai when the family decided to go parasailing with friends. The boy was so excited that his father let the youngster go ahead of him. But within minutes of Tony going up on the parachute the wind speed increased from 7.3mph to 29.9mph. The force of the parachute made the boat keel over and the rope snapped, sending the boy flying towards the shore.

Insofar as one can judge, and participants are always blinkered, the Labour election campaign is falling apart, and with it the career of the chancellor and the future of the UK. A strange blend of the personal - all this is happening to people from one&apos;s own past - the comic (Scottish elections score high in farce, from John Galt&apos;s The Provost to Eric Linklater, in Fife East in the 1930s, in Magnus Merriman), and the cosmic. John Buchan was son of the minister of Dysart, and Hugh MacDiarmid, whose slogan was so bold no one could use it: &quot;Honour yourself: Vote Communist!&quot;, appears in Merriman. He would have loved the current clamjamfrae. There are communist councillors yet in central Fife, where coal is still won from opencast. This is a literary kingdom, as its best-known author Ian Rankin always reminds us. Ian Banks is Chancellor Brown&apos;s North Queensferry neighbour, Ian Jack was born in Inverkeithing, Tom Nairn at Freuchie. Douglas Dunn, John Burnside and Robert Crawford teach at St Andrews. Chris Smout, doyen of Scots historians, lives at Anstruther. With two writer-filmmakers, Christopher Hope and Tim Neat, the poet, publisher and MacDiarmid biographer Duncan Glen, Tom Hubbard, founder-librarian of the Scots Poetry Library and wandering scholar (last year Hungary, this year Ireland) a good bookshop with anarchist leanings - Midnight Oil - at Kirkcaldy, we are well served for literary polymaths. When I was adopted for the Lang Toun, the local party&apos;s convenor, George Kay, said I was the first professor the party had fielded. &quot;No he&apos;s not!&quot; came from the back of the room. Douglas Kerr, 94, had supported the Greek scholar Douglas Young who nearly won in 1944, and went on to translate Aristophanes&apos; The Frogs into broad Scots as The Puddocks, in a memorably messy and anarchic fringe production, involving boats, dams and lakes, and an ancient royal theatre. The Brown tragedy - and for all his mistakes and arrogance, it is a tragedy - is equally literary; out of Stevenson or Hardy. He could be the diligent Henry Durie in The Master of Ballantrae, the Job-like Michael Henchard in The Mayor of Casterbridge. Some Westminster accounts by aggrieved parties suggest a more brutal local anti-hero in George Douglas Brown&apos;s The House with the Green Shutters. John Gourlay, carter of &quot;Barbie&quot; in Ayrshire, who ruled the roost until the railways came, whereupon his helots rose up and destroyed him. The parallel here is the chorus of &quot;bodies&quot; - local worthies: schoolteacher, town clerk and minister, who first squirm and defer, and then crow over his fall. Scotland remains richer in &quot;commentators&quot; than in political actors or creative writers. The Fife coast is dramatic, soaked in history and in the wonderful spring weather everything grabs significance to itself. The Wemyss villages twinkle their way out to the East Neuk, looking almost Mediterranean at a distance (and with recent restoration, equally good close up). Out on the Forth lie the Bass Rock and the distant Lammermuirs - &quot;Ding doon Tantallon, build a brig to the Bass!&quot; was medieval Scots for mission impossible. From the cliffs and steep fields above Kinghorn you can see the daily procession of ships up and down the Forth, like the Breughel picture in Auden&apos;s Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts where Icarus slips under, near-unnoticed by ploughman and captain, to join Sir Patrick Spens:  &quot;Half-ower, half-ower from Aberdour,&apos;Tis fifty fathoms deep,And there lies bold Sir Patrick Spens,Wi&apos; the Scots lords at his feet.&quot;  There is a link here to the tides of Anglo-Scots relations. Spens was sent to Norway to bring the heiress to the Scots throne back, an echo of the dynastic crisis of 1286, after King Alexander III was killed in a fall at Kinghorn. Until then there had been, not Mel Gibson&apos;s fictional oppression in Braveheart, but a union of sorts, with peace and some affluence: Scottish kings swearing fealty to the Plantagenets, and Scottish nobles holding English estates. On the monument to Alexander on the Kinghorn cliffs is the first poem in Scots:  &quot;When Alexander our king was deid,Who Scotland led in laugh an&apos; lie,Away was sonst of yill an&apos; breid,Of wine and wax, of gamyn and of glee.Our gold was turn\u00e8d into lead. O Christ conceivit in virginitie,Succour Scotland and remeid,That is steyed in perplexitie.&quot;  Edward I used the chance to subjugate the Scots as he had the Welsh, and started the series of invasions (countered by national rebellions and threats to his own finances) which provoked the Auld Alliance between Scotland and France and dire relations with England until the reformation in 1560. Its master work, the King James Bible, was begun in 1601 in Burntisland&apos;s new Calvinist kirk. Such tendencies - drifts towards, recoil from - have marked subsequent centuries. The union of 1707 was a tactful compromise between elites rather than a takeover. Aristos, kirk, law, burghs and universities patrolled the place and oiled the engine of patronage. After the kirk split in 1843 - the author of this, Thomas Chalmers, was a Fifer - much authority went south, some of it recouped by administrative devolution in the 1880s and the expansion of the Scottish Office under Walter Elliot and Tom Johnston, two brilliant &quot;administrative patriots&quot;, between 1935 and 1945. We are rather good, in fact, at unions: the Romans called the Scots the Foederati, or &quot;treaty people&quot;. Professor James Lorimer, laird of Kellie Castle, inland from St Monans, drafted the first scheme for a federal Europe, in 1884. In 1997-8 legislative devolution formally reserved macroeconomics, defence, foreign affairs and media to London, only for New Labour to go for broke on most of them. This exaggerated Westminster&apos;s capacity to influence things really reserved to the City, the Pentagon, Brussels, and Rupert Murdoch, and they have whipped the unfortunate Brown into line. I am doing an old-fashioned doorstep canvass and being well-received. The Langtonians are never less than courteous, and often stimulating, like the 96-year-old lady who suggested that her engineer grandfather&apos;s plan for the town&apos;s desolate front - &quot;build a breakwater out from either side of the bay, with promenades and pleasure domes on it.&quot; - might still work. Indeed it might. The local Imam, scunnered with Labour over Iraq, might put a word in for us in Dubai. Though there are, too, the wraiths who haunt run-down streets, with rubbish heaped on the garden, or tattooed young musclemen with big dogs, big cars and dead eyes: &quot;Ah want naethin&apos; tae dae wi&apos; youse.&quot; Methil, just out of the constituency, has a dead coal-port, dead rig-building yard, dead power-station. Saddest of all are its massive dead Co-op stores, once the measure of the miners&apos; gains. But they are starting to build wind-turbines. In the Lang Toun we have from Wednesday the Links Fair, Europe&apos;s biggest street-fest, they say. Whatever happens nationally on May 3, proportional representation will end the era of the &quot;People&apos;s Republics&quot; among the local authorities. From June there will be an experimental hovercraft service over the Forth. Let joy be unconfined! Let there be drinking in the bars, necking in the parlours, and dancing in the streets! Thank you Groucho Marx. All of this is being observed, goggle-eyed, by our local symbols, the daft china cats and pigs of Wemyss Ware. These were invented by Karel Nekola, a Pole, in the 1880s.

First clue: it&apos;s not Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan or John Higgins. Any ideas? What about if the second clue was that he isn&apos;t British or Irish? Chinese sensation Ding Junhui then, right? Wrong. The man who has outperformed everyone is in fact Neil Robertson of Australia. Which goes to prove two things. First, that even the relatively insular indoor world of professional snooker isn&apos;t safe from the Aussies. And second, that this year&apos;s world championship, which begins on Saturday, is a wide-open contest. All of which is good news for those who like to bet on such things. Particularly as the draw has been so brutal to some fancied names. Before that though, here are a couple of stats from the last five years to consider. No player has won two championships in that time, with the most successful cueists being reigning champion Graeme Dott and 2002 winner Peter Ebdon, who have also been losing finalists. During this period six other men have contested finals - unthinkable variety to those who grew up in the eras of Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry and Jimmy White. So who to back? The only place to begin is with two-time winner O&apos;Sullivan. Many may consider opposing the most naturally talented player in history to be a ludicrous concept. But it isn&apos;t. In fact, the opposite is true. Betting on Ronnie is fraught with danger and should be avoided. He is chronically bad value at 7-2 because, as he admits himself, whether he wins depends entirely on which of the two Ronnies turns up. If Bad Ronnie walks out at the Crucible for more than one session he simply won&apos;t win. The marathon-framed matches (by modern standards anyway) ought to suit him but he has lost to Dott and Ebdon in the last two years. Both are players whose stubborn and gritty style, characterised by their refusal to concede even the most lost of causes, always upsets his flowing rhythm and now seem the prevailing qualities necessary to become champion. Then there is the draw. O&apos;Sullivan plays Ding in the first round which should be the match of this or any other tournament. Whoever wins that, in all likelihood, faces Robertson (who is 22-1) with the possibility of Higgins in the quarters and Dott in the semis. Which is tough by any standards, particularly as the erratic Mark Williams and occasionally unplayable Stephen Maguire are also in that half of the draw. Not having a bet might be sensible but isn&apos;t an option (obviously) so taking a chance on Ding at 14-1 is the call, simply because his price doesn&apos;t equate with his incredible talent. With such talent in the top half of the draw, things look a little lopsided lower down. Therefore it may pay to follow two men, both former champions, in the bottom half who stand out at value prices. There looks to be little in the way of in-form 12-1 shot Shaun Murphy before a potential quarter-final with Ken Doherty, and the same can be said about Ebdon, who is 14-1. He has thrived since moving to Dubai (much like the horses he follows) and he should comfortably make the quarters, where he is likely to meet Hendry. There was a buzz surrounding the seven-time champion a few months ago after he revealed he was practicing solo in the way he did when he was younger. The Scot&apos;s brief resurgence has, a UK Championship final aside, ultimately delivered a lot less than it promised. He is a weak second-favourite given that he hasn&apos;t won a title for two years. So in a tournament where concentration and grit has been king in recent years, Murphy and Ebdon have the proven mental credentials - and by backing them both each-way, along with Ding, we would make a profit if one of them reaches the final.", "tags": ["Sport"], "title": "O'Sullivan no value in wide-open contest", "sentences": ["He has thrived since moving to Dubai (much like the horses he follows) and he should comfortably make the quarters, where he is likely to meet Hendry."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/apr/19/comment.leehoneyball", "publicationDate": "2007-04-19T10:43:57Z"}, {"article": "Few issues force politicians to calculate the value of human life as starkly as in the case of redeeming captives. While Britain assesses the aftermath of its Iranian hostage crisis, and its diplomats break their embargo on Hamas in a quest for information about Alan Johnston, Israel continues in its efforts to release its missing soldiers. In each case policy makers are forced to face the question of how far they should go to secure the release of captives. Three Israeli soldiers were kidnapped in cross border raids last summer: Gilad Shalit was taken by Hamas-affiliated operatives into Gaza; Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev by Hizbullah into southern Lebanon. This month, Hamas issued a list of 1,400 individuals being held in Israeli jails they wish to see released in return for Gilad Shalit. Having previously declared itself unwilling to negotiate, Israel now says it will consider an exchange, but that at 1,400, the price is too high. A macabre negotiation is now playing itself out. Hamas knows that Israel values the return of its soldiers very highly. The question is, how highly. From Israel&apos;s perspective, the risk is not only that released terrorists may take more lives in the future, but that by negotiating, Israel rewards the captors, and creates an incentive for future hostage taking. The British government was keen to insist two weeks ago that no deal was done to release its servicemen. Some Israeli observers looked enviously at the manner in which Britain was able to resolve the situation. The details of Britain&apos;s dialogue with Iran, and whether or not they truly paid a price, were obscured from view. But Israel does not appear to have the option of doing a deal &quot;under the table&quot;. With negotiation taking place through interlocutors, every hint of progress is being telegraphed to the public through Israeli or Arab media. Even reports that Gilad Shalit had received spectacles provided by his family were front-page news. In the current negotiations over Shalit, the equation does not simply include how many prisoners will be released, but what kind of prisoners. Israeli politicians would prefer to draw the line at those they believe to have &quot;blood on their hands&quot;. The most high-profile example is Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, who was convicted on five counts of murder in 2004. Despite being in prison, Barghouti is a key political figure. Even in Israel he is spoken of in optimistic terms as someone who might be able to unify the Palestinian people. In deciding whether or not to free prisoners such as Barghouti, politicians must not only face the families of the captive soldiers, they must also face the families of those killed in the attacks for which the prisoners have been convicted. The dilemmas of course, are not only on the Israeli side. The militants must decide which detainees get a place on their coveted lists, and how many lesser known individuals equal the value of a senior figure like Barghouti. Few would envy the decision makers who must face the choice of who should be spared and at what cost. Israel has long experience in this area. In January 2004, the bodies of three Israeli soldiers who had been ambushed by Hizbullah in 2000 were returned to Israel, along with a reserve Colonel kidnapped in Dubai. They were exchanged for the release of 429 Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, and the bodies of 59 Lebanese fighters. Two of the returned prisoners, Sheikh Obeid and Mustafa Dirani, were senior figures in the Shia Lebanese militias. They had been captured by Israel in an attempt to release another captive, Ron Arad, an airman shot down in Lebanon in 1986. Dirani himself had been one of Arad&apos;s captors. Three IDF soldiers captured in the 1982 Lebanon war, but never returned - Zachary Baumel, Yehuda Katz, and Tzvi Feldman - also remain well-known names in Israel. Israeli politicians&apos; preferred position of not negotiating with terrorists cannot withstand the emotional pressure of this issue. The subject has heightened sensitivity in a country where most families have members serving in the army or in the reserves. Everyone knows acutely that it could be their relative, or themselves. Some family members of captive soldiers are household names, regularly interviewed in the Israeli media and doggedly working to keep the issue on the agenda. The most prominent current example is Noam Shalit, the father of Gilad. When Palestinian civilians were killed and injured in an Israeli shelling in Gaza, he went to visit the wounded in a Tel Aviv hospital with a message of peace and reconciliation. He recently offered himself in place of his son as collateral in any exchange deal. Should the crisis be successfully resolved, one can only hope that it will be a gateway, and not a barrier, to wider negotiations. One intriguing statement to emerge from Britain&apos;s crisis in Iran was that &quot;new and interesting lines of communications&quot; had been opened up between the two sides as a result. The late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin said in relation to a prisoner exchange in the 1980s, &quot;[when] we have no military option, it is legitimate to discuss a deal&quot;. Currently, Israel and Hamas are not ready to engage directly with one another, but their mutual interest in a deal is forcing them to negotiate, albeit through third parties. If this kind of pragmatism succeeds in freeing captives, perhaps it could also be applied to the broader peace process.", "tags": ["Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Lebanon", "Iran", "Islam", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Macabre negotiations", "sentences": ["In January 2004, the bodies of three Israeli soldiers who had been ambushed by Hizbullah in 2000 were returned to Israel, along with a reserve Colonel kidnapped in Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/20/theprisonersdilemma", "publicationDate": "2007-04-20T13:30:00Z"}, {"article": "Coconut Chaosby Diana Souhami 272pp, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, \u00a314.99 Diana Souhami has parcelled out her distinguished biographical career by writing about two distinct kinds of subjects: posh lesbians and raggle-taggle mariners. Her previous books include studies of Gertrude Stein, Natalie Barney and Alexander Selkirk, the closest thing we have to a real-life model for Robinson Crusoe. In Coconut Chaos Souhami neatly combines these two interests, producing a book that splices the events surrounding the Mutiny on the Bounty with her own romantic encounter on the high seas with a woman known only as &quot;Lady Myre&quot;. Souhami would doubtless resent this attempt to impose a meaningful pattern on her work. For the preoccupation that drives her in Coconut Chaos is that of randomness or, indeed, chaos. Souhami is fascinated by the idea that when Fletcher Christian helped himself to one of William Bligh&apos;s carefully husbanded coconuts in 1789 he set in motion a series of events that led to the founding of a community on the previously uninhabited island of Pitcairn. Bligh&apos;s disproportionate response to the theft led to him being bundled into a boat with 18 of his crew and cast out to sea. Christian and the other mutineers then proceeded to wash around the South Seas in the Bounty, looking for somewhere to hunker down and avoid the vengeful search party that was bound to ensue. Their tatty gang, augmented by some Polynesians whom they&apos;d snaffled on the way, were left to live out the remainder of their years on a midgy, muddy rock that, although only 1,350 miles from Tahiti, was about as far away from Paradise as it was possible to imagine. The 50 or so people who inhabit Pitcairn today have the same names as the mutineers (Christian alone seems to have great-great-grandfathered half the island). But, just as the original community nearly destroyed itself in fighting over sexual access to a dozen Polynesian women, so at the time of Souhami&apos;s visit in 2004 the island was in the grip of a sex scandal. Seven men had been accused of molesting young girls on the island, tearing pleasure from their bodies with the same thoughtless greed as their ancestors. The incestuous nastiness of the attacks (given Pitcairn&apos;s puddle of a gene pool, it&apos;s inevitable that many of the victims and perpetrators were related) had been plastered over with a joyless Seventh Day Adventism quick to purse its lips over minor sins while allowing large ones to flourish. A community founded over 200 years ago on psychological violence seemed unable to cast off its bullying past. In 2004, and with the court case just months away, Pitcairn was particularly difficult to access. Souhami&apos;s cover story is that she is in pursuit of the flightless rail, a dull bird which, as it turns out, she never gets to see. All the same, someone has looked her up on the internet and discovered that she is a writer, which is close enough to a journalist to be alarming. She is bundled off the island and forced to make the return journey on a small yacht skippered by a Swiss man, in the process encountering sailing conditions that make The Perfect Storm look like a breeze. Souhami&apos;s chance companion on these adventures is the mysterious Lady Myre, a gabby force of nature who cannot be relied upon for the truth about anything. Having attached herself like a limpet to Souhami, Myre seems to be under the impression that they are on their way to Picton, a safe little town in New Zealand. When Souhami talks about going to Tubuai, Myre talks excitedly about the shopping possibilities to be found in Dubai. Now married to the mysterious Sir Roland, who may or may not be an admiral, Myre lives on Pot Noodles, rum and peach juice and is given to impromptu renderings of show tunes that she used to perform during her career as an entertainer on the Shaw Savill line. Quite out of the blue, she and Souhami end up in bed together. &quot;Put your hand inside my jim-jams and make me come,&quot; wheedles Lady M one night, and a rather sweet, tentative love affair ensues. For all that Souhami is fascinated by randomness, she is too practised at story-making to let synchronicity and coincidence float by without flagging them up. It&apos;s her contention that Bligh was buggering Christian and that the real cause of the mutiny was not a purloined coconut so much as the younger man&apos;s angry rejection of Bligh&apos;s oppressive attentions. Thus at the heart of her narrative about drama on the high seas Souhami places two unlikely and fleeting homosexual love affairs that play out as companion pieces to one another across 200 years. Mixing autobiography and biography is not new, and indeed has become something of a dreary default setting in recent years. In anyone else&apos;s hands the contemporary account of the narrator&apos;s love affair would serve as nothing but an annoying distraction from the &quot;real&quot; story of how Christian and his men set about colonising Pitcairn. But Souhami&apos;s instincts are so fine that she knows exactly when to let the appalling Lady Myre blunder into the narrative and when to send her back under her mosquito net. She is confident enough, too, to play with her readers&apos; desire for narrative authenticity. In a debunking Afterword, Souhami explains that while her account of the events of the 1790s is firmly anchored in fact, she has &quot;half remembered, half imagined&quot; the contemporary part of her story. It is true that she went to Pitcairn, and yet &quot;the narrator&apos;s . . . love affairs and preoccupations are not mine&quot;. All the same, the book is teasingly dedicated to &quot;the real Lady Myre wherever she now is&quot;, hinting that Souhami is more implicated in her narrative than perhaps she quite wants us to think. \u00b7 Kathryn Hughes&apos;s biography of Isabella Beeton is published by Harper Perennial", "tags": ["Books", "History", "Culture"], "title": "Review: Coconut Chaos by Diana Souhami", "sentences": ["When Souhami talks about going to Tubuai, Myre talks excitedly about the shopping possibilities to be found in Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/21/featuresreviews.guardianreview7", "publicationDate": "2007-04-21T22:57:50Z"}, {"article": "It could be the stuff of World War III: Arabs, Americans and Russians trying to outfox each other and seize control of valuable land.

The second is status: when the world&apos;s wealthiest buyers want to add another prestigious address to their real estate portfolio, they look to Pimlico rather than Paris, to Marylebone instead of Manhattan. &apos;London has what the world&apos;s richest people want - security,&apos; says Charles Peerless of Winkworth estate agents. &apos;It speaks the new universal language of English, has an easy air hub at Heathrow, good schools, a welcoming tax regime for foreign owners, and the world&apos;s financial capital in the City.&apos; In the past year Peerless has visited Singapore, Dubai, the US and (three times) Shanghai, to explain London&apos;s property market to wealthy would-be buyers. &apos;The number of high net-worth individuals (HNWIs) is expanding more rapidly in North America than in Europe for the first time since 2001, while Singapore, South Africa, Hong Kong, India and Australia have seen the highest growth in HNWI numbers,&apos; explains Liam Bailey of Knight Frank, an estate agent that at any one time has about 300 of London&apos;s most expensive homes on its sales books. Bailey says Britons now buy only half of the most expensive homes in prime central London, where apartments routinely cost over \u00a31m and houses usually over \u00a32.5m. That share drops to just 40 per cent of the &apos;super-top-end&apos; homes costing more than \u00a34m. The surge in overseas interest means central London&apos;s market is the hottest in the country and now operates to totally different rules to those of other major cities in the UK. For one thing, foreign buyers don&apos;t have a home to sell in London, so they add to demand without helping to maintain supply. Therefore prices go up faster and competition intensifies. Another issue is safety. &apos;Security is key,&apos; says Peerless. &apos;Although fear of terrorism has eased, there&apos;s a lot of concern that any property lived in by a wealthy buyer&apos;s family must have the security associated with exclusive new developments in the very prime areas of London - CCTV, direct access from underground car parks to flats, and so on.&apos; The underlying economic attraction of London has rarely been stronger. City bonus payments this winter have hit \u00a38.8bn, of which about 60 per cent will be spent on property, mostly in London. Oxford Economic Forecasting, a consultancy, says the City&apos;s financial institutions - where average annual pay is already over \u00a3120,000 - will add another 12,700 to their staff by late 2007. Over 65 per cent of Fortune&apos;s Global 500 companies, a key barometer of the world&apos;s financial operations, have chosen London as their European or world headquarters, and the capital has more foreign banks than any other city. So where does this leave British buyers in the capital? &apos;Wealthy Brits buy a small mews house or pied-a-terre in London, then have a main house or estate in the country,&apos; says Robert Bailey, who believe the summer will see another influx of foreign buyers just as domestic purchasers start their holidays. &apos;If Britons want a substantial house in the capital, they&apos;ll probably find themselves relegated to south London - Battersea, Wandsworth or Clapham,&apos; suggests Bailey. &apos;These are lovely houses, of course, but a little further away from the action in the centre. That&apos;s where the rest of the world is.&apos; Where the money is Belgravia Property: It doesn&apos;t get much grander than this - think big, then bigger again.

Ed Balls, the City minister, has also asked National Savings &amp; Investments to look into the possibility of the government issuing financial products that retail investors wanting to comply with sharia law can buy. The Treasury and the Debt Management Office, which handles bond issues for the government, are to conduct a feasibility study into the costs and benefits of issuing financial instruments that are acceptable to investors who cannot accept interest. The report is expected in the autumn. Under sharia law, making money from money, such as charging interest, is not permitted, which restricts opportunities for investing to trade and assets. The Islamic financial model is based upon risk-sharing between financial institutions and customers. For instance, customers are able to get credit by asking a bank to buy an item, which it then sells on to them on a deferred basis. The market is expected to grow quickly as there are estimates suggesting that there are more than \u00a3125bn of Islamic finance assets worldwide. The decision to consider launching government-sponsored products follows a meeting this month at 11 Downing Street when an Islamic finance experts group was formed. Mr Balls will outline the latest plans in a speech at a Financial Services Authority conference today. &quot;Domestically, we will do everything we can to promote new ways for British Muslims to bank, save and borrow using Islamic finance products,&quot; he will say. &quot;I believe there are great potential advantages for the UK government issuing sharia-compliant government debt. The feasibility study will also be assessing the opportunity for issuing such instruments, taking into account the government&apos;s debt-management objectives.&quot; The government needs to borrow almost \u00a360bn for the 2007-08 financial year - some \u00a31.4bn in Treasury bills and the rest in gilts.

London has hosted the issuing of a number of these types of products - one of the largest was issued by Dubai Ports this year. The government is changing the rules to allow Sukuk bonds to be issued, held and traded in the same way as corporate bonds to try to encourage more of them to be issued in London.

At those tournaments players can challenge two line calls per set. An instant replay is shown on large screens, allowing both the players and the spectators to watch whether the ball was in or out. &quot;We can confirm the introduction of Hawkeye,&quot; said Ian Ritchie, the chief executive of the All England Club. &quot;We are going to have some final testing on grass courts in May to make sure we&apos;ve got it absolutely right.

At first glance this seems an unlikely choice of speaker. It is tempting to speculate on Lucarelli&apos;s themes (&quot;At the end of the day you&apos;re talking about a decay of the post-capitalist economy situation&quot;), his insistence on taking the positives, giving 120% and always remembering that left-leaning political theory is a funny old game. Tempting, but in this case probably misguided. Lucarelli is an unusual footballer, a self-avowed communist and an oddity both in his own country and in the context of our ideologically neutral Premiership. At the top level at least, footballing socialists are an almost extinct breed. This is hardly surprising. The Premiership player lives a rarefied life. Alienated by celebrity and his own vertiginous wealth, bombarded with the tedious superlatives of a deeply introverted industry, it seems barely conceivable he might still be capable of making the distinctions required to call himself a socialist, a monetarist, a disciple of Chairman Mao, or anything else for that matter. Premiership football has very little political content; it&apos;s all on one note. As the former Scotland international Gordon McQueen says: &quot;Football is all about money and greed and everyone&apos;s involved in it.&quot; McQueen played for Leeds and Manchester United in the 1970s and 80s. He was also well known as a Labour party supporter who wrote an article explaining his politics in the Daily Mirror. &quot;I came from a family and from an area that was and still is solid Labour, &quot; he says now of his native Ayrshire. &quot;In fact, there were more communists than Tories. I just did what I was asked to do. I went to local meetings. I helped with fundraising.&quot; McQueen was hardly a raving Trotskyite; just an everyday Labour man who also happened to be a professional footballer. This is something he believes is pretty much incompatible with the modern game. &quot;There are plenty of smashing lads involved now, but whether they could be bothered with something like that is a different story. The difference is they don&apos;t live in the real world. They&apos;re cosseted in a way we never were. I&apos;d say 99% are totally uninterested in politics.&quot; The players might not be interested, but in its own way modern British football is a deeply political affair. Just take a look at the Premiership to find out what 15 years of hot-housed free-market economics looks like. From the first BSkyB broadcast deal in 1992 the revenue from subscription television has utterly transformed the game. The new Sky and Setanta TV contract is worth \u00a31.7bn over three seasons, a significant amount of which will end up in the pockets of the men kicking the ball around. The escalation to a current average Premiership wage of \u00a312,300 a week has been like an unplanned social experiment. The players have come to represent an acme of consumption, a brutally linear expression of a certain way of living. In our footballers we see a funfair mirror reflection of the same forces working on the people watching them from the stands. We don&apos;t admire them, so much as aspire to their lifestyle, crave their large American cars and holiday homes in Dubai, bandy their salaries around with a Gollum-like mixture of avarice and disgust. The top tier of British football stands as an extreme expression of a certain kind of politics, rampant capitalism with the volume turned up to 11. A Premiership socialist? It might not even be possible. This is all relatively new. We&apos;re not talking about golf here. Historically, football&apos;s politics, such as they are, have tended to loiter on the left wing. The majority of Premiership clubs have their roots in either a local church or a local pub. For 100 years these clubs existed as an extension of their local community, a living riposte - albeit an occasionally violent and shambolically administered one - to the Thatcherite notion that there is no such thing as society. Bill Shankly is probably still British football&apos;s most celebrated socialist. Wisecracking, dapper and a charismatic orator, Shankly was a hugely successful manager of Liverpool through the 60s and early 70s. What seems most remarkable about him now is his insistence on talking politics, even while talking football: &quot;The socialism I believe in is everyone working for each other, everyone having a share of the rewards. It&apos;s the way I see football, the way I see life.&quot; Shankly traced his political beliefs to his upbringing in the Ayrshire mining village of Glenbuck. A childhood spent in areas dominated by heavy industry and trade union influence has been a common theme among football&apos;s senior socialists. Sir Alex Ferguson was a Govan shipyard shop steward before he became a player with Rangers. His backing for the Blair Labour leadership is well documented. At the last general election he posted a message on the government&apos;s website praising &quot;two brilliant barnstorming speeches from Tony and Gordon&quot;. Ferguson, with his fine wines and his multi-million pound racehorse ownership disputes, has frequently been subjected to the familiar jibe of &quot;champagne socialism&quot;. Football is fond of this kind of reasoning, based on the idea that those with socialist beliefs are expected to live exemplary altruistic lives, whereas rightwingers can pretty much do whatever they want. Nottingham Forest legend Brian Clough, a sponsor of the anti-Nazi League and a regular on picket lines during the miners&apos; strike, had his own riposte. &quot;For me, socialism comes from the heart. I don&apos;t see why certain sections of the community should have the franchise on champagne and big houses.&quot; Clough was pretty much the standard-bearer for football socialism in the 1980s, a decade that saw the emergence of a new strain of rightwing footballer. Certainly something about Margaret Thatcher touched a chord with the aspirational pre-Premiership player, with his golfing sweaters, his sponsored Rover and his first intimations of the spiralling financial rewards that would reach frantic levels in the decades to come. The famous photo of Kevin Keegan and Emlyn Hughes cosying up to Thatcher on the Downing Street steps remains a pungent image. It wasn&apos;t just Keegan. Thatcherism mobilised footballers in unprecedented numbers. Coventry players Keith Houchen and Steve Ogrizovic campaigned for their local Tory candidate at the 1987 election. Footballers even managed to muscle their way in among all the Tarbies and Brucies at the grisly party glad-handings: Arsenal manager Terry Neill and star striker &quot;Champagne&quot; Charlie Nicholas were among those to appear on stage at a Thatcher rally. For reasons that are still unclear, Thatcher herself was installed as honorary vice-president of Blackburn Rovers. In the 20 years since, the footballing socialist has all but disappeared. Certainly, we&apos;ve not had a lot to go on: Thierry Henry wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt; Diego Maradona smoking Montecristos with Fidel while detoxing in Cuba; Eric Cantona and his elusively loopy left-of-centre persona. &quot;Perhaps you may find it odd that I think happiness does not come from being able to buy a car that one wants,&quot; he challenged in his autobiography, before reminding us that &quot;the woods are full of bows and arrows&quot;. This is a confusing time for any top-level footballer with a twitching of social conscience. The problem is, he often ends up looking a bit silly. Take Rio Ferdinand, for example. Ferdinand is an intelligent man. He lent his name to a campaign against knife crime in London. Peckham-raised, he discreetly offered his support in the aftermath of the Damilola Taylor murder. But somehow it seems that just making a bit of a difference isn&apos;t enough. Not when you&apos;re this important. &quot;I want to join forces with the Government,&quot; he wrote in his autobiography, before going on to describe his plans for a countrywide rehabilitation of the nation&apos;s youth via his inspirational chain of Ferdinand-branded leisure centres, a vision of a brighter tomorrow he once tried to share with Gordon Brown after discovering they were staying in the same hotel (&quot;unfortunately he had gone out for something to eat&quot;). The suspicion is that socialism - in the everyday sense practised by the likes of McQueen - is simply incompatible with the life of the Premiership footballer. Leftwing sympathies are still present in isolated gestures. Liverpool player Robbie Fowler celebrated scoring in a European Cup-Winners&apos; Cup game in 1997 by pulling up his shirt to reveal a T-shirt expressing support for striking Liverpool dockers. As a gesture it was widely appreciated. But solidarity only goes so far: Fowler is also English football&apos;s fourth-richest man, estimated to own almost 100 houses as part of a \u00a328m buy-to-let portfolio (inspiring the Yellow Submarine-style terrace chant, &quot;We all live in a Robbie Fowler house&quot;). Wigan manager Paul Jewell&apos;s dad was a trade union activist in Liverpool. He keeps a pet tortoise called Trotsky. And then there&apos;s Gary Neville, the man most people would pick out as an example of a modern footballing socialist. Neville&apos;s &quot;Red Nev&quot; nickname was given to him by the tabloid press after his stewardship of a revolt in the England dressing room over Ferdinand&apos;s punishment for missing a drugs test. It&apos;s not exactly flogging Marxism Today outside Sainsbury&apos;s, but the nickname has stuck. Neville is one of the Premiership&apos;s more thoughtful players. He has called on his colleagues not to use agents, although having always been represented by his father makes this an easy position to adopt. He signed up to the recent initiative for footballers to donate a day&apos;s wages to a nurses&apos; hardship fund. He might even, you never know, see himself as a socialist. Still, you come up against the insurmountable stumbling block of his profession. In Neville we can see an intelligent man placed in an unintelligent situation. Earning \u00a380,00-a-week for playing football places him on one side of a very real divide, whatever his potential leftwing leanings. The old distinction of champagne socialism doesn&apos;t really do it justice, unless perhaps we&apos;re talking about taking an Olympic swimming pool-sized Jacuzzi in the stuff every morning. Which is possibly something Neville might be planning to do in the \u00a33m home with golf course, gym, pools, stables and a cinema he is having built in Lancashire. Clough is right. Socialism doesn&apos;t necessary exclude you from living in a big house; but there are limits to everything. Does any of this matter? Certainly, football&apos;s central relationship, that between fans and players, seems to have suffered some collateral damage. The working man&apos;s ballet is now very much the middle-class man&apos;s ballet, too. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but the speed with which the demographic of football&apos;s target market has shifted is unprecedented. Not least in the idea of actually having a target market in the first place. Andy Lyons is editor of When Saturday Comes, the UK&apos;s only independent national football magazine. WSC began as a fanzine in 1986, at a time when following football was a relatively marginalised activity. &quot;There used to be a sense of a shared experience of being a football supporter,&quot; Lyons says. &quot;This has splintered now, due in part to the sheer weight of numbers of the Sky generation of new supporters.&quot; Various forces have been working on this relationship between supporters and players: the repackaging of the game as televised entertainment and the dilution of the idea of a geographical fanbase; the hyper-inflationary hikes in ticket prices and the emphasis on football as a corporate hospitality product. Going to watch a game at Arsenal&apos;s new Emirates ground feels more like attending a stadium rock concert or visiting the Ideal Home exhibition. Your relationship to everyone else inside the stadium has changed. You&apos;re united by consumer choice. The people performing in front of you are skilled entertainers. This is not necessarily what football&apos;s traditional consumers (formerly &quot;fans&quot;) actually want. A feature of some recent Liverpool home games has been a habit among home fans of a concerted holding up of scarves en masse and singing of their traditional anthems in a self-consciously &quot;Liverpool Kop&quot; manner. Always a club tradition at bigger games, at every home game it is a relatively new thing, fetishising the club&apos;s own past, perhaps out of a sense of nostalgia for a still-present but undeniably fragile sense of footballing community. This feeling of a collective identity is what sustained football through its lean years. Will it still be there when they come again? British football is ahead of the rest of the world here. Lyons believes that in other countries players are not only more openly political, but possibly also have a greater bond with their supporters. &quot;You find in countries where the working classes tend to be more political, such as Argentina, where there is still a strong trade union movement, there tends to be more of a sense of communal identity,&quot; he says. &quot;Society is perhaps based around older social patterns that no longer exist here, such as heavy industry. In among these, football is one of the forces that bind people together.&quot; There are plenty of examples of political South American footballers. The World Cup-winning Brazilian striker Romario is a high-profile supporter of the progressive President Lula and has also assisted with projects to relieve poverty in the favelas. Italian club Internazionale were persuaded by their Argentinian captain Xavier Zanetti to donate \u20ac5,000 (\u00a33,400) to help Zapatista rebels in Mexico. &quot;We believe in a better, unglobalised world enriched by the cultural differences and customs of all the people,&quot; Zanetti said, possibly surprising some of his team-mates in the process. Where all this leaves us is hard to say. Is it really impossible to be a socialist and a top-level footballer? Probably, in the hard line &quot;property is theft&quot; sense of the word; the bar has simply been raised too high. But then, all of this is very new. There is no precedent for the Premiership, outside of the transcontinental sporting conferences of the US - never exactly a hot bed of leftwing politics and, what with the market-led sports &quot;franchise&quot; system, certainly not an environment where the social bond between supporters and club is valued. It would be nice to see someone trying, however. In the future, perhaps a few of our footballers might be willing to challenge their environment, rather than simply accepting its rewards. Former England goalkeeper David James made the relatively radical suggestion last week that players might be paid only on a performance-related basis. This might not exactly be up there with Paul Breitner, a West German World Cup winner in 1974, who combined a mastery of attacking full-back play with growing a bushy beard, espousing Marxism. But James&apos; notion of footballers-as-estate-agents at least goes pleasingly against the tide. It&apos;s an acknowledgment that there might be another way. And, like Lucarelli who cuts a slightly cartoonish figure with his Che Guevara T-shirts and clenched-fist salutes, it&apos;s also appealingly silly; a counter to the po-faced sense of entitlement that has too often been the Premiership player&apos;s defining trait. This is only football, after all. It doesn&apos;t have to mean anything.

But I&apos;ve had horses by his dam and they stayed, and Richard [Hughes] said he would be better at a mile and a half,&quot; said John Gosden, the trainer of Raincoat. After showing a good turn of foot to beat Dubai Twilight by four lengths, Raincoat will have his sights raised. &quot;The Dante Stakes and the Chester Vase are now options and we will keep testing the water,&quot; added Gosden. Ante-post punters will be relieved to find that all the leading 2,000 Guineas contenders stood their ground for the Classic at yesterday&apos;s forfeit stage. Teofilo is the Irish-trained colt that has attracted all the headlines, if not always for the right reasons. But yesterday Kevin Prendergast warned that it would be dangerous to ignore his 2,000 Guineas hope, Haatef, who finished three lengths fourth behind Teofilo in last season&apos;s Dewhurst Stakes. Haatef will be his trainer&apos;s first Guineas representative since he won with Nebbiolo in 1977. Clearly, Prendergast does not have &quot;social&quot; runners at Newmarket. &quot;Haatef is in good shape. He&apos;s not a robust horse, so we were always planning to go for the Guineas without a prep run,&quot; said Prendergast yesterday. By Danzig, Haatef has plenty of speed in his pedigree, but Prendergast has no worries about stamina. &quot;We had Haatef&apos;s sister and she won the Athasi Stakes over seven furlongs on heavy, so I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll get a mile,&quot; he says. Prendergast, who has his horses in tremendous form, viewed Epsom on television yesterday but plans to be there on Derby day with Mores Wells, who has come out of Sunday&apos;s win at Leopardstown in excellent shape. &quot;We might take him to the Derrinstown Trial next, or go straight to Epsom,&quot; said the trainer. Ron Cox&apos;s tip of the day: Palmetto Point 8.10 Southwell Following Hughie Morrison on the all-weather at Southwell has proved most profitable - the trainer&apos;s runners here over the past five years are showing a level-stakes profit of more than 58 points. From a lowly mark of 54, Palmetto Point can boost the stable&apos;s tally.

The five-year-old made rapid strides last season and today&apos;s Gordon Richards Stakes at Sandown looks the ideal starting point for another successful campaign. Although Notnowcato (1.45) is saddled with a 7lb penalty, the result of his victory in the Group One Juddmonte International at York, he should still be good enough to score first time out, as he did last year. Strictly on the book, his stable mate Mountain High has the edge at the weights. When Notnowcato won at York he beat another Stoute runner, Maraahel, by a short-head and the latter was only a head in front of Mountain High at Royal Ascot previously. Ten furlongs is ideal for Notnowcato, however, and he can have too much pace for Mountain High today. Red Rocks, the Breeders Cup Turf winner, has to bounce back from a moderate effort in Dubai. Zaham (2.15) had plenty of use made of him when holding off the challenge of Tybalt at Kempton and, from the favoured rails draw in the Betfredcasino Esher Cup, Mark Johnston&apos;s colt can confirm the form. Jockey Richard Hills has his critics, but he is a dab hand on front-runners and Zaham appeared to win with a bit to spare last time. Tybalt is 2lbs better off for a length and there is unlikely to be much between the pair again. The jump races on Sandown&apos;s mixed card have cut up disappointingly and Arcalis (1.10) faces his easiest task for some time in the Betfredcasino Hurdle. Penzance could make a race of it if the first-time blinkers have the desired effect. Ron Cox&apos;s tip of the day Kirkby&apos;s Treasure 2.40 Wolves Having his first outing for the in-form Alan Swinbank stable here, this experienced handicapper can bounce back to form. He had a quiet time of it last season, when trained by Alan Berry, but has dropped markedly in the weights as a result. Rated 75 at the start of last season, he races off 57 now.

That&apos;s the line on Paul Wolfowitz coming from editorial pages around the world. It&apos;s neither: not the act (the way he disregarded the rules to get his girlfriend a pay rise); and not the hypocrisy (the fact that Wolfowitz&apos;s mission as World Bank president is fighting for &quot;good governance&quot;). First, let&apos;s dispense with the supposed hypocrisy problem. &quot;Who wants to be lectured on corruption by someone telling them to &apos;Do as I say, not as I do&apos;?&quot; asked one journalist. No one, of course. But that&apos;s a pretty good description of the game of one-way strip poker that is our global trade system, in which the United States and Europe - via the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation - tell the developing world: &quot;You take down your trade barriers and we&apos;ll keep ours up.&quot; From farm subsidies to the Dubai Ports World scandal, hypocrisy is our economic order&apos;s guiding principle. Wolfowitz&apos;s only crime was taking his institution&apos;s international posture to heart. The fact that he has responded to the scandal by hiring a celebrity lawyer and shopping for a leadership &quot;coach&quot; is just more evidence that he has fully absorbed the World Bank way: when in doubt, blow the budget on overpriced consultants and call it aid. The more serious lie at the centre of the controversy is the implication that the World Bank was an institution that had impeccable ethical credentials - until, according to 42 former World Bank executives, its credibility was &quot;fatally compromised&quot; by Wolfowitz. (Many American liberals have seized on this fairytale, addicted to the fleeting rush that comes from forcing neocons to resign.) The truth is that the bank&apos;s credibility was fatally compromised when it forced school fees on students in Ghana in exchange for a loan; when it demanded that Tanzania privatise its water system; when it made telecom privatisation a condition of aid for Hurricane Mitch; when it demanded labour &quot;flexibility&quot; in Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami; when it pushed for eliminating food subsidies in post-invasion Iraq. Ecuadoreans care little about Wolfowitz&apos;s girlfriend; more pressing is that in 2005 the World Bank withheld a promised $100m after the country dared to spend a portion of its oil revenues on health and education. Some anti-poverty organisation. But the area where the World Bank has the most tenuous claim to moral authority is in the fight against corruption. Almost everywhere that mass state pillage has taken place over the past four decades, the World Bank and the IMF have been first on the scene of the crime. And no, they have not been looking the other way as the locals lined their pockets; they have been writing the ground rules for the theft and yelling &quot;Faster, please!&quot; - a process known as rapid-fire shock therapy. Russia under the leadership of the recently departed Boris Yeltsin was a case in point. Beginning in 1990, the World Bank led the charge for the former Soviet Union to impose immediately what it called &quot;radical reform&quot;. When Mikhail Gorbachev refused to go along, Yeltsin stepped up. This bulldozer of a man would not let anything or anyone stand in the way of the Washington-authored programme, including Russia&apos;s elected politicians. After Yeltsin ordered army tanks to open fire on demonstrators in October 1993, killing hundreds and leaving the parliament building blackened by flames, the stage was set for the fire-sale privatisations of Russia&apos;s most precious state assets to the so-called oligarchs. Of course, the World Bank was there. Of the democracy-free lawmaking frenzy that followed Yeltsin&apos;s coup, Charles Blitzer, the World Bank&apos;s chief economist on Russia, told the Wall Street Journal: &quot;I&apos;ve never had so much fun in my life.&quot; When Yeltsin left office, his family had become inexplicably wealthy, while several of his deputies were enmeshed in bribery scandals. These incidents were reported in the west, as they always are, as unfortunate local embellishments on an otherwise ethical economic modernisation project. In fact, corruption was embedded in the very idea of shock therapy. The whirlwind speed of change was crucial to overcoming the widespread rejection of the reforms, but it also meant that by definition there could be no supervision. Moreover, the payoffs for local officials were an indispensable incentive for Russia&apos;s apparatchiks to create the wide-open market that Washington was demanding. The bottom line is that there is good reason that corruption has never been a high priority for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund - their officials understand that when enlisting politicians to advance an economic agenda guaranteed to win those politicians furious enemies at home, there generally has to be a little in it for the politicians in bank accounts abroad. Russia is far from unique. From Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean dictator who managed to accumulate more than 125 bank accounts while building the world&apos;s first neoliberal state, to Carlos Menem, the Argentinian president who drove around in a bright red Ferrari Testarossa while liquidating his country, to Iraq&apos;s &quot;missing billions&quot; today, there is in every country a class of ambitious and bloody-minded politicians who are willing to act as western subcontractors. They will take a fee, and that fee is called corruption - the silent but ever present partner in the crusade to privatise the developing world. The three main institutions at the heart of that crusade are in crisis - not because of the small hypocrisies, but because of the big ones. The World Trade Organisation cannot get back on track, the International Monetary Fund is going broke, displaced by Venezuela and China. And now the World Bank is going down. The Financial Times reports that when World Bank managers dispensed advice, &quot;they were now laughed at&quot;. Perhaps we should all laugh at the World Bank. What we should absolutely not do, however, is participate in the effort to cleanse the bank&apos;s ruinous history by repeating the absurd narrative that the reputation of an otherwise laudable anti-poverty organisation has been sullied by one man. The bank understandably wants to throw Wolfowitz overboard.

Photograph: Rabih Moghrabi/AFP. As if they don&apos;t have enough trouble at sea, BAE and the Royal Navy are at the heart of one of the biggest standoffs for years in defence policy. The future of the government&apos;s defence policy, and defence industrial strategy, could hang on the plan to build two big aircraft carriers - a project eminent critics now say will cost more than replacing Trident. The navy says it needs the carriers to remain credible, and viable, as a fighting service. BAE says the carrier contract, like that for the new generation Trident submarines, is vital if they are to stay in the naval construction business, worth tens of thousands of jobs in the UK. If they don&apos;t get this kind of work, they&apos;ll take their bat and ball, and set up as a primarily US-based company. Such threats have done them well in the past, giving them a virtual monopoly in large areas of defence procurement for the UK forces. The news that the US has lodged a serious diplomatic protest about the blocking of the fraud enquiry into BAE&apos;s deal for Typhoon aircraft with the Saudis makes the threat to quit UK shores look pretty hollow. Just before Easter, the government was set to place the main construction contract for two 60,000-tonne fleet aircraft carriers for the navy at an estimated cost of about \u00a33.6bn. According to critics, like the former head of the Ministry of Defence, Sir Michael Quinlan, this would not even be half the bill. He estimates that the carrier programme as currently envisaged would cost more than the project to replace the Trident missile system - missiles, submarines, bases and all. Trident replacement, according to the government&apos;s own white paper published before Christmas, would cost between \u00a320bn and \u00a325bn. Critics, some recently retired from the MoD&apos;s procurement and logistics wings, believe that the estimate by Greenpeace that Trident replacement, taking everything into consideration like bases, updates, maintenance and refits, would cost something like \u00a376bn over a 30-year lifespan, is much nearer the mark. Critics of the carrier project as currently conceived come from within the Royal Navy, past and present, as well as specialists like Sir Michael Quinlan. Admiral Sir Sandy Woodward, who commanded the Falklands task force in 1982, thinks they are too big and too difficult to manage by the navy and air force at their present size. He would like to see the navy order three smaller carriers, slightly larger than the present Invincible class. These would be able to launch new jump-jet fighter-bombers to protect the fleet and any amphibious force it lands. Sir Michael Quinlan is concerned about the almost total absence of any public discussion on the project, which could become a huge white elephant (my words, not his) particularly if current projects such as the Type 45 air defence destroyer, at \u00a3600m a time, are anything to go by. The plan for the navy to get two big carriers was first made public in the Strategic Defence Review of 1998. The carriers were needed, the review argued, for Britain to be able to mount &quot;expeditionary missions&quot; for the modern age. Since then, the argument has been reinforced by notions that local powers will be increasingly reluctant to give bases to British and allied forces and not permission to overfly. So the expeditionary force has to be launched and supplied from the sea. This is fine in theory, but there are questions about human and fiscal resources to do the job properly. Some argue the navy is too small to be able to provide sea and air crew for such large ships, which will each require a complement of about 3,000 at least, plus shore teams and replacements. The biggest difficulty is the aircraft. The new carriers are designed to fly the American Lockheed Martin Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The bill for this aircraft already stands at about $260bn, and it is going north steadily - so much so that there are growing doubts in sections of the Pentagon that even the US can afford the programme. The conundrum is that the aircraft carrier is built round the plane, and not the other way around; and to date, there is no credible alternative to the F-35 JSF. Britain is due to get between 120 and 150 of the new aircraft, to be flown jointly by the navy and the RAF. This is in addition to the 232 Eurofighter Typhoons currently being delivered to the RAF. The problem is that, today, there only enough crew to fly 90 combat planes by the UK forces. The third unknown is what is termed &quot;combat systems&quot; - the computers, radars, communications architecture, airborne early warning, special jamming aircraft and drones. These, in the main, have not even been designed, let alone costed, and they will amount to more than the \u00a33.6 to \u00a34bn for the hulls. Totting up the cost of the combat systems, the aircraft, the building of the hulls, the maintenance facilities, and the need for at least half a dozen major refits in a 40-year lifespan, you can see how Sir Michael Quinlan has come to his calculation that the carrier programme is likely to cost more than the replacement of Trident. The new carriers, CVF, already named as HMS Queen Elizabeth II and HMS The Prince of Wales, are to be the keystone of the Defence Industrial Strategy designed by the minister for defence procurement, Lord Drayson. He wants to base his strategy on long-term partnerships with key contractors like BAE, Thales UK, and Finmeccanica, now a major player through Agusta Westland, and the former GEC Marconi companies. Some fear this could hand an unhealthy monopoly to big players like BAE in sectors like submarines. Lord Drayson wants to streamline the naval yards, which suffer from over-capacity, and wants most of the seven to merge. Vosper Thorneycroft says it will only get into bed with BAE if the carrier deal is guaranteed. Drayson says he wants to see the marriage first. Meanwhile, there is the question of money, and where it comes from. The problem with the Strategic Defence Review of &apos;98 is that it was never properly costed. Gordon Brown has told the defence ministers, according to industry sources, that they can have the carriers, but provided the money comes from within the defence funding laid out in the Comprehensive Spending Review due to be announced later this summer. The MoD says that this cannot be done unless other programmes are cut or halved, such as the one to replace the army&apos;s ancient vehicles now being beaten up in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some old salts fear that the carriers have such a strong whiff of the Blair era of expeditionary adventures - and that they will be cancelled as soon as Chancellor Brown shifts residence from No11 to No 10. However, much of the building work will be done in Scotland, on the Clyde and at Rosyth, hard by the constituencies of Mr Brown and defence secretary Des Browne. There is a good case for the fleet having modern, adaptable, medium-sized carriers, like the US Marines amphibious carriers. They are needed to land and protect amphibious forces and keep sea lanes open - but not to launch highly sophisticated fighter-bombers to attack distant capitals. The contradiction at the heart of the present project for 60,000-tonne fleet carriers is its odd mixture of megalomania and desperation. To the eye, it looks like another great defence white elephant is about to be launched, to join the herd with the Eurofighter and the Daring class Type 45 destroyers. To the nose, it has a slight, but distinct aroma of two large grey pork barrels.", "tags": ["Nuclear power", "Airline industry", "Travel and transport", "Military", "Defence policy", "The BAE files", "US news", "House of Lords", "Gordon Brown", "Transport", "UK news", "Environment"], "title": "A whiff of corruption", "sentences": ["By royal appointment: Prince Charles trying a prototype Eurofighter for sizein Dubai in 1999."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/27/awhiffofcorruption", "publicationDate": "2007-04-27T12:20:00Z"}, {"article": "Alderburn, Reveillez and Hot Weld, three chasers in form and, in theory, well in at the weights, stand out in today&apos;s Betfred Gold Cup at Sandown. This has always looked the right race for Alderburn and he can provide trainer Henry Daly with a measure of consolation after Mighty Man&apos;s injury at Punchestown. Daly has had to exercise patience with Alderburn (3.20), who pulled muscles on his first run of the season at Wincanton. The eight-year-old has come good with victories at Kempton and Newbury, where he defied 11st12lb in a race that has worked out extremely well. Able to run off the same handicap mark today, Alderburn is officially 12lb &quot;well in&quot; compared with his new rating. The trip is half a mile further than he has tried but, on his favoured fast ground, he should stay. He was going on strongly at the finish last time at Newbury. Reveillez, who would have 11lb more to shoulder if his new rating had come into effect, stepped up to 3m1f at Aintree and won by seven lengths in a manner which suggests he will come up the Sandown hill well enough. There are no doubts on that score about Hot Weld, who bids to become the first horse in 50 years to win both the Scottish Grand National and today&apos;s Sandown prize, best known as the Whitbread, in the same season. Although originally set to carry 9st3lb here, Hot Weld is still favourably treated compared with the new mark he received for winning last Saturday. This, however, looks a better race than Ayr, where the topweight was an out-of-form horse rated 150. My Will runs off 161 here and seems to face an impossible task, while stablemate Cornish Sett is held by Reveillez on a line through Lacdoudal. Sandown 2.10 Treasury Counsel appreciated the better ground at Kempton when winning a handicap in decent fashion (Absolut Power third) but this looks a better race, whereas Dusky Lord takes a drop in class after contesting the Coral Cup at Cheltenham. He made up a lot of ground to finish eighth and that was only his second run since he beat Slew Charm over two miles here in November. Ripon 2.30 See tip of the day, below. Sandown 2.40 Dempsey, five lengths in front of River City when second in the Queen Mother Champion Chase, is the clear form pick. He is a three-times course and distance winner here and doesn&apos;t mind fast ground. His stable has been quiet after a bout of coughing, though, and it might pay to oppose him with Peter Bowen&apos;s tough novice, Yes Sir. Provided his jumping holds up - he made a few errors when slamming Natal at Ayr last weekend - Yes Sir should make a bold bid, as he has come back better than ever from a midwinter lull. Ripon 3.05 This looks a good opportunity for Melalchrist, who is well drawn here but was possibly racing on slower ground than the first two when third, beaten a neck and the same, behind Desert Opal and subsequent winner No Time at Nottingham. Ripon 3.40 While he simply may not have the pace to win at this level on the Flat, Burntoakboy is worth one chance at least. He has done nothing but improve over hurdles since joining his present trainer from Ireland and is potentially very well handicapped. Sandown 3.55 In common with some of his stable&apos;s runners, Road To Love did not sparkle at the Dubai Carnival, but he can bounce back to form here. Best going right-handed, Mark Johnston&apos;s front- runner should get his own way at the head of affairs. He will exploit any stamina flaw in Jeremy, who is trying a mile for the first time. Ron Cox&apos;s tip of the day Ebn Reem 2.30 Ripon With the starting stalls placed on the stands&apos; side, Michael Jarvis&apos;s colt is ideally drawn in stall one to confirm the good impression he made on his comeback at Kempton.

It&apos;s a big day in the north. Manchester United have an outrageously good record at Goodison Park - 13 wins in 16 matches since football began in 1992 - but a defeat here in 1995 did untold damage to their title challenge and even a draw today could do the same if Chelsea beat Bolton. Essentially it comes down to the fact that, at the moment, the title is not in Chelsea&apos;s hands. United can afford to lose at Chelsea and still win the league provided their win the other three games: here, a massive match away at Manchester City next Saturday and then at home to West Ham. But if they drop any additional points, Chelsea know that, if they win all their matches (Bolton at home today, Arsenal away next week, United at home and then Everton at home) they will make it three in a row. It&apos;s not called squeaky-bum time for nothing.  It could also be called squeaky-joints time. A load of injuries mean that United, in particular, are having to function with the same group of around 14 players, even though they have huge match after huge match, and it&apos;ll be interesting to see if Ferguson rests anyone today with Wednesday&apos;s trip to Milan in mind. I don&apos;t think he should - rotation is like wearing garish yellow Y-fronts; you can do it as much you like at home but never away - although I half expect Giggs to be on the bench, with Fletcher, Carrick and Scholes in midfield, Rooney and Ronaldo wide and Smith up front. The game, of course, is of huge significance to Everton, too. They currently have a four-point cushion in the Uefa Cup places, and also have a mathematical chance of finishing fourth ahead of Arsenal and qualfying for the Champions League. But that isn&apos;t going to happen. Either way they have lost only three out of 17 home fixtures in the league this season and I quite fancy a 1-1 draw, with Chelsea doing the necessary at home to Bolton. Team news: Those of a Red persuasion are not going to like these apples: United have left Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench. File alongside the title-losing non-selections of Hughes v Forest in 1992, Hughes v West Ham in 1995 and Keane and Scholes v Middlesbrough in 2002? Time will tell. I can understand the decision because Ronaldo, not unreasonably, has started to look a bit tired in the last couple of weeks, but I still wouldn&apos;t have made it. Which is probably why Sir Alex Ferguson has won 20-odd trophies and my biggest achievement was getting Gillingham into the Uefa Cup on Championship Manager. Everton, interestingly, pick the young Scot Iain Turner in goal ahead of Richard Wright. They&apos;ll regret that if he drops the ball at John O&apos;Shea&apos;s feet in the 61st minute. They are also without the injured Andy Johnson. Chelsea, meanwhile, have benched Drogba, Lampard and Joe Cole for their game at home to Bolton, who are without six first-teamers. Calculated risk is the name of the game at this stage of the season, but it feels like the risk is outweighing the calculation today. Everton (4-4-1-1): Turner, Hibbert, Yobo, Stubbs, Lescott, Arteta, Neville, Carsley, Fernandes, Osman, Vaughan. Subs: Wright, Naysmith, Van der Meyde, Beattie, McFadden.  Man Utd (4-2-1-1-1-1): Van der Sar, O&apos;Shea, Brown, Heinze, Evra, Solskjaer, Scholes, Carrick, Giggs, Rooney, Smith. Subs: Kuszczak, Ronaldo, Richardson, Eagles, Lee.  Ronaldo update apparently he got a knock in training and Fergie doesn&apos;t want to risk exacerbating it. Unless United aren&apos;t winning, of course. 1 min Everton kick off from right to left - and then do so again, after Alan Wiley orders a retake. United are playing their usual system with Rooney wide left and Giggs in behind the lone front man, Smith. &quot;I&apos;m in Dubai, trying to work,&quot; says James Townrow, &quot;so if you could make your MBM as boring as possible that will be a big help.&quot; You&apos;re in capable hands on that score. 2 min Lescott hits the bar! It was a beautiful, whipped corner from Arteta, and he lost his man, the blundering O&apos;Shea, far too easily. Lescott was five yards out and unmarked when he made contact, but he couldn&apos;t quite get on top of his header and rammed it off the top of the crossbar. 4 min Everton have started strongly here, really in United&apos;s face, with United looking a bit one-paced so far. &quot;No Darren Fletcher?&quot; says Neil Colquhoun. &quot;If MU only have 14 fit players, that&apos;s a strange decision (unless of course he&apos;s no longer one of the healthy ones!).&quot; I&apos;m sure he must be injured, or recovering from the shock of having had a decent game on Tuesday. 7 min Arteta is pulling the strings at the moment - he&apos;s such a classy player - and United haven&apos;t really got going at all. Smith spanks one miles over from 25 yards. &quot;Would the sensible thing not be to start with your strongest 11, get into an unassailable position then take them off with plenty of time remaining, rather than send them on to try and win the game which is what inevitably happens?&quot; says Mark O&apos;Neil. &quot;Like you say, Fergie has won more trophies than us, but he does make some bizarre choices at times.&quot; He never paid \u00a35.5m for Mike Duff, though, which I did on Champo Manager only for him to turn out to be absolute gash. 9 min United win their first corner. It&apos;s cleared comfortably but then Rooney almost squeezes the second ball through the defence and into Solskjaer. Everton scramble it away. It&apos;s a bitty game thus far, with Everton marginally the better side. &quot;Can&apos;t understand why United are 4-5 on here, especially without Ronaldo,&quot; says Sean Ingle. &quot;Have laid them to the hilt ... think 1-1 is a good shout. But then I backed Rana Naved to be top wicket taker in the cricket World Cup....&quot; GOAL! Everton 1 Manchester United 0 (Stubbs 11) After Evra tries to play piggy-back with Arteta, Stubbs lashes a free-kick from 30 yards, right to left, and it takes a decisive deflection off Michael Carrick. The ball didn&apos;t deviate much from its course, but Carrick&apos;s touch took the ball over the dive of Van der Sar, who would otherwise have saved it comfortably. 13 min Solskjaer looks in a bit of bother with his ankle. Ronaldo could be coming on already. 14 min United simply are not at the races, just as they were(n&apos;t) at Portsmouth. Vaughan, muscling in at the far post, heads Arteta&apos;s free-kick over the bar from eight yards. 18 min Solskjaer looks OK and is still on although, like Giggs and Smith and Rooney, he has hardly touched the ball. Everton have been excellent, hassling United high up the pitch, and using the ball with impressive economy, but United have been absolutely dreadful and worryingly pedestrian. They really do miss the firecracker menace of Louis Saha, who has probably played his last game for the club. 20 min Scholes pings a pass from right to left to Rooney, lurking on the left corner of the box, and his low drive is palmed round at the near post by Turner. A good save; no more, no less. THAT OTHER GAME: CHELSEA 0 BOLTON 1 (Michalik) Blimey. THAT OTHER GAME: CHELSEA 1 BOLTON 1 (Kalou) ?!\u00a3&amp;$R\u00a3. 23 min Carrick&apos;s floated, straight pass finds Rooney beyond the back post 10 yards out, but he can only plant his header into Turner&apos;s hands. United are having more of the game now but they&apos;re still not really on their game. 25 min Smith misses a sitter. He played a really nice one-two with Giggs on the edge of the box but then dragged his shot across goal and wide from 12 yards. He should have scored. 27 min The feisty Vaughan, who has been kicking lumps out of Heinze all day, gets booked for another overzealous challenge. 29 min Vaughan is increasingly isolated and Everton look like they have, subconsciously at least, settled for 1-0. So far they&apos;re holding on pretty comfortably, but 70+ minutes is a long time to play on the back foot. 31 min More of the same: United in possession and probing, Everton working their virginal white socks off. 34 min Everton have a timely spell of pressure and win a corner, which is wasted by the otherwise splendid Arteta. CHELSEA 2 BOLTON 1 (Jaaskelainen og) Oh dear. 37 min Lovely stuff from United. Scholes pinged a 50-yard crossfield pass to Giggs, who sidefooted it first time on the volley across the face of the six-yard box. Rooney, on the stretch, couldn&apos;t quite get there. &quot;Forget Ronaldo, why wasn&apos;t the splendid Kieron Richardson picked for the starting XI?&quot; chuckles Lou Roper. I&apos;d try and laugh with him but frankly I am far too depressed. 38 min Ronaldo has to come on at half-time, for Solskjaer, who is sadly out of his element in top-level football these days (his peerless finishing, of course, is as good as ever but he just can&apos;t run). I&apos;d say 99% of United fans would prefer the Premiership to the Champions League, but Fergie wants them both and because of that you wonder if he&apos;ll up with nothing. 40 min See 31 min. Without Ronaldo and Saha, United are just too slow. Nobody in the front six has genuine pace, so we get admirable, technical football but without much genuine penetration. 43 min &quot;I presume after this little sideshow of a curtain raiser, you will be switching to an all-important double MbM on Brighton vs Oldham and Chesterfield vs Bradford,&quot; says Iain Pearson. &quot;The entire planet is waiting to see if the Seagulls can guarantee their place in Div 1 for next season.&quot; Sure, if I can see through the tears I&apos;ll happily report on it. 45+2 min The ever-abrasive Heinze is booked for cleaning out Arteta from behind, a ludicrously naive challenge. Half time: Everton 1 Man Utd 0 Everton just about deserve to be ahead after a nothing sort of half. They started superbly, got a lucky goal and then sat on their lead reasonably comfortably. United have had loads of the ball but, without Ronaldo, have struggled to create chances. I fancy Everton to sneak one on the break after half-time. See you in 15 minutes. This is massive Absolutely massive. United have 45 minutes to save their season and, arguably, determine their great manager&apos;s legacy. If they don&apos;t win here they will not win the league, and the impact of bottling it so badly - and the fact that Chelsea will be nowhere near as vulnerable next season - could do huge damage to this mostly young side. &quot;Re: 40 min. Surely Giggs has &apos;genuine pace&apos;?&quot; says Aidan Wylde. Not any more. He is quick but not blistering, and relies more on craft and passing, hence his reinvention as a No10. If you&apos;ve got a problem... bring on Kieran Richardson. Yes, he&apos;s coming on. Words fail me. Ah, no he isn&apos;t: United lined up for the second half with 12 players on the pitch, then that eejit Richardson realised he was about as welcome as a piles pill and trotted back to the bench. 46 min United kick off, with Rooney back in his rightful position up front. 48 min United have started well and win a corner when Giggs&apos;s attempted through ball is knocked behind by Hibbert. The corner comes to nothing, but when the ball is fed back in Rooney spanks one towards goal that is blocked by three lunging defenders. Brilliant, desperate defending. GOAL! Everton 2 Manchester United 0 (Fernandes 49) That&apos;s an absolutely stunning goal. Arteta slipped a gentle, inviting ball down the inside-right channel and Fernandes, marauding forward, shuffled it away from Brown on the edge of the box and then screamed it in at the near post. What a hit. 52 min Giggs plays a stunning sliderule pass through to Rooney, but Turner gets out very quickly and down to scramble the ball away. 53 min &quot;Looks to me like this is 1998 all over again,&quot; says Robert Hisnay. &quot;Then United blew a big lead to Arsenal, mainly due to injuries. In 2007 it will be to the totally unlikeable Chelsea. Ferguson&apos;s tinkerings along with injuries are their undoing this time.&quot; The injuries haven&apos;t helped but it&apos;s Fergie&apos;s fault that the attacking part of his squad is so thin. CHELSEA 2 BOLTON 2 (Davies) I don&apos;t think I can take much more of this. 55 min That Fernandes goal, at a time when United were really on top, has knocked the wind right out of their sails. They&apos;ve switched tactics again, with Rooney up front, Smith wide right and Solskjaer wide left, but they surely have to get Ronaldo on. Solskjaer and Smith are passengers. Smith, in fact, is useless and entirely the wrong type of player for this attacking unit. 56 min United substitution: Richardson on for Evra, who gave a really air-headed performance. 59 min Smith, 25 yards out, chests down a bobbling ball but then slices his volley over the bar. GOAL! Everton 2 Man Utd 1 (O&apos;Shea 61) O&apos;Shea, who has scored United&apos;s last two away goals in the Premiership, makes it three. The assist goes to Iain Turner, who dropped a Giggs corner under no pressure at all and gave O&apos;Shea an open goal from four yards. A shocking error, and Ferguson immediately signals to Ronaldo to get ready. 62 min Almost an immediate equaliser. Rooney turned Yobo brilliantly 35 yards out but then overran it and tried to lift the ball over the advancing Turner. It was probably going wide, but it definitely hit Stubbs on the arm. Alan Wiley said no penalty. Jose Mourinho&apos;s bleating is rewarded. Who says slime doesn&apos;t pay? 63 min Ronaldo is on for Smith.  66 min It&apos;s all United. Giggs slides the ball through the defence to put Rooney one-on-one, but he was put off by Turner charging outside his box and Rooney&apos;s touch, while taking him round Turner, was far too heavy and the chance was gone. GOAL! Everton 2 United 2 (P Neville og 67) You could not make it up. Ronaldo rose majestically at the far post to meet Carrick&apos;s corner and, though Turner saved with his feet, the former United player Phil Neville jabbed the loose ball into his own net from two yards. Mourinho is going to love this one. 71 min Everton are making a double substitution: Beattie and McFadden are coming on for Vaughan and Osman. &quot;Phil &apos;Sleeper Cell&apos; Neville comes good,&quot; says Adam Hirst. 72 min It&apos;s end-to-end stuff now, really ragged, and Beattie introduces himself by clattering into Heinze. 75 min United now have Rooney and Solskjaer up front, Ronaldo wide and Giggs left, while Everton have gone to a genuine 4-4-2 with the two subs up front. 76 min Ronaldo shifts it past Lescott but, from a very tight angle, spanks it wide at the near post. This is devilishly tense because one Chelsea (or Everton) goal makes this a bad for United. But then if United score and Chelsea don&apos;t, they go five points clear. &quot;How did Phil celebrate?&quot; says Adam Hirst. &quot;Slid on his knees to the corner flag? Jumped into the United end?&quot;  GOAL! Everton 2 United 3 (Rooney 78) The comeback is complete and I can hardly feel my fingers. O&apos;Shea&apos;s cross finds its way across the box to Rooney, who keeps his cool, touches it past Hibbert and sidefoots the ball coolly into the corner. A splendid goal, although the move started with a dreadful pass out of defence from Hibbert. 80 min Corner to Everton. Van der Sar came a long way for it but didn&apos;t get there, and Yobo headed over. A half-decent chance. 82 min Richardson&apos;s brilliant, fizzing cross just eludes Ronaldo at the far post. Three minutes plus injury time to go at Chelsea, and Everton are getting Van der Meyde ready. &quot;$%^*%^&amp;$&amp;*$^&amp;($^&amp;*$%^*$^&amp;\u00a3***&quot; says my United-loving housemate Tom Walker. 84 min Van der Meyde is on for Carsley. 85 min Rooney works Turner with a good hit from 25 yards, but it was a comfortable save. United are still having most of the play, and Everton looked spent, struck dumb by the laughable goals they&apos;ve conceded. 86 min Turner saves one-on-one against Ronaldo. That was a really big chance, because he had ages to compose himself and pick his spot, but Turner smothered him expertly on the left corner of the box and palmed away the shot with his left hand. 87 min Chris Eagles in on for Solskjaer, his first first-team game for over two years. 89 min Stubbs just beats Rooney to Giggs&apos;s cross at the near post after a nice link-up with Ronaldo. 90 min Chelsea have drawn 2-2, as Ronaldo&apos;s shot is beaten away by Turner. Four minutes&apos; added-time to come. GOAL! Everton 2 United 4 (Eagles 90+4) What a delightful goal from Chris Eagles! He went charging through from right to left onto Rooney&apos;s pass, came back infield and just bent the ball beautifully into the far corner with his right foot for his first-ever United goal. What an extraordinary day this has been. Full time: Everton 2 United 4 Fitba? Bloody hell. That was amazing. After an hour Everton were deservedly 2-0 ahead, but then they started giving away some ludicrous goals - shades of the farcical, title-winning goals that Leeds scored at Sheffield United in 1992 - and United, so courageous and fearless, took full advantage. They go five points clear with three games to play after Chelsea&apos;s draw with Bolton. They have very nearly got their trophy back and Sir Alex Ferguson is skipping onto the pitch, hugging Carrick and Ronaldo. What sort of clown would ever write this man off? United need four points from three games to win the league and the celebrations say that they are sure they have won the Premiership today. I&apos;m off to try and get some feeling back in my fingers.

An oil-rig, perhaps. A coal mine. On the editorial staff of Nuts magazine. But not all that many. When Angela Hartnett went to work for Gordon Ramsay in 1994 - before anyone had ever heard of him and the staff turnover was so high it was more like a body-count - nine out of 10 employees simply did a runner. Hartnett routinely worked a 17-hour day, six days a week, in conditions that she describes, in an offhand way, as &apos;psychological warfare&apos;. Chefs in other restaurants simply referred to the place as &apos;Vietnam&apos;. Before the interview, I go to see Hartnett in action in her kitchen at the Connaught and it&apos;s while we&apos;re chatting that she mentions her favourite TV programme is Life on Mars, the BBC cop show set in 1973. &apos;It just really appeals to my sense of humour, all that chauvinism. It&apos;d have to I suppose, otherwise I couldn&apos;t do the job that I do.&apos; Too right. You&apos;d have to be mad, otherwise. Or have sustained a heavy blow to the head. Because when it comes to sensitive handling of gender issues, Life in Ramsay&apos;s kitchen circa 1994 makes Life on Mars look like a moderate and progressive manifesto for well-meaning liberals. And Hartnett has survived 12 long years. More than survived: five years ago she was put in charge of one of the most ambitious outposts of the Ramsay empire: Angela Hartnett at the Connaught. She&apos;s perhaps the leading female chef in Britain today. Certainly, she&apos;s at the top of her game right now. She got her first Michelin star within the first year of the restaurant opening, an MBE from the Queen for Services to the Hospitality Industry, she&apos;s just opened another Ramsay restaurant in Boca Raton, Florida, she&apos;s just about to see the publication of her first cookery book, and while the Connaught closes for the next seven months for a multi-million pound refit, she&apos;s off to do a television programme - Kitchen Criminals All of which, could make her seem like, well, let&apos;s just use the words that Gordon Ramsay employed when she first went to work for him, a bit of a bitch. Which she isn&apos;t, far from it, in fact. These days Ramsay calls her &apos;warm and natural with everybody she meets ...she has no airs and graces&apos;. And she is. Her sheer normality is almost enough to mark her out in itself. I like her book too, Cucina: Three Generations of Italian Family Cooking. It&apos;s the usual, here&apos;s-how-to-whip-up-a-couple-of-stuffed-rabbit-legs-type thing, but there alongside the glossy photos of osso buco and saltimbocca, there&apos;s also what seems to be her entire family album. Some of the photographs are sort-of relevant - snapshots from the Thirties of her Italian grandmother, for example, and her great Aunt Ilda - but others, her brother, in a tie-dyed T-shirt, her sister-in-law at a birthday party, seem to be there, for no other reason, than for the hell of it. It&apos;s a rather lovely and sentimental thing and a nice change from all those books where there&apos;s page after page of shots of televisual types stirring sauces and sniffing truffles (although there&apos;s a few of those too). More of the family later, though, because right now I just can&apos;t get enough of her tales from Gordon&apos;s kitchen. This was back in the days when he was just starting out at his first restaurant, Aubergine. In 1994, she went for a day&apos;s trial. &apos;I&apos;d been to other places. But he was the most exciting. For starters because he was in the kitchen. He was there at seven in the morning, and he was still grafting away until one the next morning with all the other guys. He was just really driven. And slightly mad. You were going into this crazy environment where everyone was screaming and shouting. And all the cooks were as nervous as hell and just completely wiped out. They were wiped like there was no tomorrow.&apos; Weren&apos;t you scared? &apos;Yes. Definitely. But I thought it was quite fun. I like people who are quite, arrogant is the wrong word, but in your face.&apos; In your face? Marcus Wareing, who&apos;s now the chef-patron at Petrus, another restaurant in the Ramsay empire, and a fellow veteran from the early years, puts it slightly differently. He remembers Hartnett&apos;s first day, too. &apos;We had a sweepstake on how long she&apos;d last. After she&apos;d gone home, Gordon said, all right, what do you reckon? And some people said an hour, others said a day, I think I said, &quot;two weeks&quot;. Maximum. And f*** me, 12 years later, she&apos;s still there. You&apos;ve got to hand it to her. It was f***ing hell. And Angela would take as much as anyone could. The hardest thing for us was the number of people who came and left. Less than one in 10 actually stayed. But Angela Hartnett is a grafter, she just battened down the hatches and got on with it. She&apos;s a true-grit chef.&apos; True grit, though, came at a price. &apos;You worked a six- day week there,&apos; she says. &apos;You worked Saturday night so you had a lie-in until 12am on a Saturday - big bloody deal. And then we had Sunday off, your one day off. At the time, my grandmother had cancer and as a family we&apos;re extremely close. I was living with my aunt, which was great because I never had time to shop, or to put my washing out, and on a Sunday, we&apos;d go and visit my grandmother and I&apos;d sleep in the car on the way there. I was just permanently knackered.&apos; Didn&apos;t you ever have times when you thought it&apos;s just not worth it? &apos;Oh God, all the time. When I started I thought I&apos;ll get through to Christmas. I&apos;ll do three months here. And then afterwards you get better. Things change. You go through weeks when everything&apos;s going wrong. And then you have a good service and you think actually, it&apos;s all right.&apos; Did he change the nature of his insults for you? Or was he still, &apos;Put your bollocks on the table!&apos;. &apos;Oh yeah. He called me a bitch a few times. And the first time I was like Jesus Christ! And then afterwards, you become blanketed against it, you get a thick skin. He used to call me Dizzy Lizzy. The thing is that if he&apos;s peed off with you, you hear about it. And he never forgets anything. I think that&apos;s the worse thing. If you screw up at the beginning of service, then he&apos;ll go on and on about it all night. And even now, he says, ooh, do you remember the nage you cocked up? Yeah, about 20 years ago, give me a break. But in a way, it&apos;s a good thing. And in a way he sets the standard for himself. He&apos;s got impeccable standards. He&apos;s not one of these chefs that just bollocks you and doesn&apos;t explain after. And I think that&apos;s his secret. Every single time he bollocks you, he&apos;ll pull you over at the end of service and say &quot;Do you know what you did wrong?&quot; It&apos;s not just fire and brimstone. Marcus was harder on me in some ways.&apos; I can believe this. When I talk to Wareing on the phone, he&apos;s full of admiration and respect for her and then says, &apos;but you can tell when Angela Hartnett is a bad mood. It&apos;s written all over her face. And it happens every bloody month&apos;. What? You&apos;re saying you could tell if she was pre-menstrual? &apos;Too bloody right. I worked with her for five years. And if she denies it, she&apos;s a liar.&apos; Oh Marcus, get back in your Ford Cortina. Ramsay, of course, is also prone to making crap proclamations on women in the workplace. &apos;Oh yeah,&apos; agrees Hartnett. &apos;He&apos;s always saying things like &quot;women can only work three weeks out of four&quot; and I think, oh, just give it a break.&apos; Hartnett&apos;s not immune to the odd crap proclamation herself. All her closest friends are women, she says. But her colleagues are men. Every kitchen she&apos;s ever worked in has been dominated by men and she&apos;s had to compete with them on their terms. And, in some ways, she&apos;s absorbed and continues to perpetuate those terms. &apos;Sometimes I say to the cooks, &quot;Oh stop moaning. You sound like a woman&quot;.&apos; &apos;You can&apos;t say that!&apos; I say. &apos;I know,&apos; she says. &apos;It&apos;s terrible, isn&apos;t it? I know. I shouldn&apos;t do it.&apos; But then, even when she&apos;s being praised it&apos;s in strictly male terms. Ramsay is always telling her that she has &apos;bigger bollocks than most men&apos;. She was the first woman to manage a year in his kitchen, an achievement of which she seems as proud as winning her Michelin star and receiving her MBE. But then, it was very tough and it&apos;s been the making of her career. She&apos;s tremendously loyal towards him because he&apos;s the reason why she&apos;s where she is today. She grafted and sweated her way up through the ranks, until, five years ago, she was rewarded with her own restaurant: Angela Hartnett at the Connaught hotel. Run like a gentlemen&apos;s club, the gentlemen did not take kindly to the news, but she pulled it off. She won her first star with her Italian-inspired cooking and is now going for her second. Do men and women cook differently, I ask her? &apos;I think that by nature, men can be more pernickety. I&apos;ve worked with Marcus Wareing and Jason [Atherton - head chef at Maze] in Dubai and they have to have all their ladles just so. And don&apos;t get me wrong, I like to be organised. But my office is pandemonium, there is shit everywhere. And I think the food men produce is sometimes more tight, it&apos;s not relaxed. Whereas I think if you go to Sally Clarke&apos;s or the River Caf\u00e9 [run by Ruth Rogers and Rose Gray] it&apos;s more relaxed. It&apos;s more natural. I&apos;ve been to three-star restaurants in Italy that are run by women and even there it&apos;s not as stiff. I&apos;m not sure how to describe stiff food ... I think that sometimes women make food with a bit more feeling compared to some male chefs.&apos; The Italian connection is what separates Hartnett from the rest of the Ramsay empire. She was born in Kent and spent her first eight years there while her dad was in the navy. Then he died and everything changed. For somebody who entered such a male-dominated profession, there was an absence of men in her childhood - which Hartnett agrees may not be such a coincidence. They moved to Essex to be near both sets of grandparents and for the rest of her childhood, she lived five minutes down the road from her Nonna - her mother&apos;s Italian mother, and she was the one who taught her how to cook. &apos;I was the eldest daughter and being from an Italian background, the son gets away with doing sweet FA, so if Nonna needed shopping or if someone needed food it would be me who did it. By the age of 11 or 12, I would be cooking the dinner. Mum was working as a nanny up in London so she wasn&apos;t getting back until six or seven. Upminster is one of those upper-working-class/ middle-class sort of towns, where the kids are being picked up from school, whereas we were walking home ourselves and just getting on with things. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the worst thing in the world. You just grow up quicker.&apos; Her family are Italian, by way of Wales. Every town in the South Wales valleys has an Italian cafe run by an Italian family, all of whom come from a single Italian town: Bardi in Emilia-Romagna. Her mother moved to Essex at 18 but her Aunt Ilda still has the original family fish and chip shop in Ferndale in the Rhondda valley. &apos;Do you know the Carpaninis in Treorchy?&apos; I ask. I met them a month ago when doing a story on the Burberry factory, two sets of them, running two lovely old-fashioned cafes, set up in the Forties by two brothers who married two sisters. &apos;I think maybe a cousin might have married into them. It&apos;s all so interconnected. When I go back to Bardi in the summer, you just hear all these Welsh accents. One minute it&apos;s all &quot;Oooh, there&apos;s lovely!&quot; And the next minute they&apos;re all talking Italian.&apos; At 18 she went off Italy for a year to work as an au pair and then to Cambridge poly to do a history degree. It&apos;s still unusual enough, this, to be worth mentioning: to be a chef and to have a degree. It meant that by the time she worked in her first kitchen, in Cambridge, after graduating, she was already older than most of the cooks. In the catering trade, it&apos;s traditional to start at 16 as a semi-indentured slave. Hartnett was older, female, degree-educated, and had never been to catering college. She learnt on the job, first in Cambridge, then at a restaurant her old boss found her in Barbados, and it was only after she returned and moved to London that she met her Svengali, one Gordon Ramsay. The Hartnetts are still a close, tight-knit family. Angela lives with her sister, Anne, in a Georgian house in Spitalfields that she half-owns with her brother, Michael, who&apos;s now in New York. &apos;We&apos;ve got my mother staying with us at the moment while she&apos;s having an extension built and she&apos;s driving me up the wall. I love her but we just really wind each other up.&apos; She goes on family holidays with her brother and his wife and kids and socialises with her uncle. &apos;It&apos;s the Italian connection, I think. It&apos;s definitely Nonna&apos;s influence. My family are a huge part of my social life.&apos; Marcus Wareing goes even further. &apos;She is tremendously loyal towards her friends and family. I&apos;d say that they&apos;re the most important thing in her life, more so even than her job, her great passion is her family and friends.&apos; You can see it on the pages of her book and you can hear it in the ways she talks about them. She loves her brother&apos;s children, her nephews, loves children, would love to have her own. And she&apos;s 38 and, at the moment, unattached. Her working day starts at nine and finishes around 11pm. It&apos;s not an easy schedule to fit a boyfriend around or even meet one. &apos;If a man under 40 comes into the Connaught, we&apos;re like, &quot;What&apos;s he doing here?&quot; Most of the men who come in are 60 and married with four children.&apos; &apos;Do you feel that you have had to make sacrifices because of your job?&apos; &apos;Oh yes, without a doubt. There&apos;s been a couple of guys who I could have married but I chose another path. Mum definitely thinks that. She says, &quot;I&apos;ve given up on Angela now&quot;. When I went out with this guy, one of the things he said was &quot;I hate your job. It&apos;s so restrictive, I can&apos;t just ring you up and say c&apos;mon, lets go to the cinema, or do you fancy going down the pub?&quot; It takes all the spontaneity out of a relationship. And it does in a way. Because you plan. And I&apos;ll be the one going, &quot;What do you want to do a week on Saturday?&quot;, and then the blokes think you&apos;re some freak who&apos;s trying to plan his life and it&apos;s not a case of that, it&apos;s that it&apos;s the only way to see him. I&apos;m a bit of a hopeless romantic in that I think there is someone out there. Which is sort of Jackie-like, isn&apos;t it? A bit nerdy. &apos;My brother said to me recently, &quot;All the bits of your life are working - your professional life is working, your financial life&apos;s working; now you&apos;ve just got to spend the next seven months sorting out your personal life. Focus, Angela, focus. Just go and get totally bladdered and go to a club and cop off with someone, get yourself pregnant, and you&apos;ll be fine.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Oh yes, I can really tell Mum that one ... &quot;So who&apos;s the father of your child?&quot; &quot;Dunno, Mum. I was off my face&quot;.&quot; Would you contemplate having a child without a partner? I ask. &apos;I&apos;ve thought about it. But I think it&apos;s a lot of hard work, and I think it&apos;d be even harder if I wanted to do the job that I do and have a baby by myself. I think that would be quite tough.&apos; She&apos;d like to meet someone, have a family, and prove that you can do it: that you can be a woman, run a Michelin-starred restaurant and have some semblance of a normal life. &apos;It really pisses me off when people say, &quot;Oh you couldn&apos;t have a kid doing a job like yours&quot;. Why not? I don&apos;t have to be there all the time. You train your staff and you have to trust them. I&apos;d like to prove them wrong. It&apos;s different to France and Italy where the three-starred restaurants are in the country, they&apos;re family affairs, they might not even be open every day. It&apos;s very different in London but still it is possible. Sally Clarke is a friend of mine and she&apos;s got a son now.&apos; It&apos;s so depressing all of this. Not Angela, she&apos;s warm and charming and open and engaging as well as being successful and all the rest, and of course she&apos;ll meet her Mr Right. But depressing because this is still an industry that discriminates against women reaching the top because they self-select out. The hard choices that face women in all walks of life are exaggerated in the restaurant trade. There are only four female chefs in her kitchen out of 25. It&apos;s still not a job for women because if a male chef wants a family, he can have one. Just so long as he has a wife who&apos;s happy to stay at home and look after them. This isn&apos;t a biological thing. There&apos;s nothing at all about cooking that makes men better suited to it than women. It&apos;s simply to do with archaic working practices that see restaurant employees working split shifts from 7am to midnight. Wareing, who has two children and a third on the way, tells me in another candid aside that if it was his wife who was coming home at midnight, &apos;I don&apos;t think we&apos;d still be together&apos;.

I&apos;m standing on crispy, firm sand, liberally scattered with exotic shells, some of which are prehistoric. This is part of &apos;Thailand&apos;, yet I&apos;m in the middle of the Arabian Gulf, just off the coast of Dubai. The sand has been mechanically squirted from the sea bed (hence the prehistoric shells) to form a man-made island, part of &apos;The World&apos; - one of the sea-defying developments dreamt up by the ruling Maktoum family. The island is one of 300 &apos;countries and continents&apos; created by Nakheel, a government-backed development company that is also behind the famous palm-tree-shaped sand islands that connect directly to the Dubai coastline. The first of The World&apos;s islands to be fully developed, Greenland, is owned by the royal family and has been used for state meetings. Several of the other islands, all still in rudimentary sandbank form or being created, have been snapped up by celebrities (Rod Stewart is rumoured to have bought the UK) and millionaire businessmen who want a bit of privacy and peace close to the madness that is Dubai. &apos;Thailand&apos; belongs to Profile, a relatively new development company owned by British businessmen Imtiaz Khoda and John Irving. The pair are planning to build 131 villas and apartments in Thai style, with prices starting at \u00a3400,000 for a studio suite and \u00a31.82m for a villa. The most exotic will be the 10 four-bedroom water villas built out into the sea on stilts, with their own private berths. Other properties will have access to &apos;parking spaces&apos; in a marina, although Nakheel is planning a regular ferry service and water taxis for all the islands. The development, called Jasmine Gardens, will include restaurants, a delicatessen, spa and gym, but is not intended for full-time occupation. However, the signs are good for anyone planning to rent out their property as a holiday home when they are not using it (Profile is planning to offer a managed rental pool), or just wanting it as an investment. Dubai&apos;s hotels are enjoying 98 per cent occupancy, and the place is oozing with celebs - during my visit I stayed at the Grosvenor House Hotel, where I spotted Chris Eubank in the top-floor bar, and Ronaldo in the ground-floor restaurant. On the back of all this expansion, property prices have apparently shot up. &apos;Flipping&apos; - the selling-on of properties that have been bought off-plan before they are even built - is rife, and developers claim that early investors have enjoyed returns of 50 per cent a year from some developments (there are, however, no official property inflation figures). So why would you want a holiday home in the middle of the sea rather than on the mainland itself? Well, even those who love Dubai will admit the city is a full-on experience. Some say it is like Las Vegas without the gambling. Peaceful it is not: there are building sites everywhere; the roads are a work in progress, clogged in rush hour; there is no public transport yet (a local train system is being built); and it&apos;s virtually impossible to walk anywhere as there are no pavements. It will eventually offer mile after mile of sparkling new developments boasting every type of entertainment theme you can think of - a dinosaur park, skiing, horse riding, racing (car, horse and camel), football (Manchester United and Arsenal have training facilities here), cricket, tennis, golf, water sports, shopping, gourmet restaurants, luxurious spas ... and long stretches of white sand and blue sea. &apos;A property in Jasmine Gardens will enable owners to make the most of everything Dubai has to offer, but relax in private when they want to,&apos; says Khoda. \u00b7 For sales information, contact Profile on 0800 731 4798 or visit www.jg.ae", "tags": ["Money", "Moving overseas", "Buying property abroad", "Dubai", "United Arab Emirates"], "title": "Celebrities and the super-rich are snapping up new country-themed islands", "sentences": ["The following correction was printed in the Observer&apos;s For the record column, Sunday May 6 2007  The article below said Dubai had &apos;no public transport&apos;, and yet 417 bus services are run on 62 routes covering 168,000 kilometres every working day.", "This is part of &apos;Thailand&apos;, yet I&apos;m in the middle of the Arabian Gulf, just off the coast of Dubai.", "The island is one of 300 &apos;countries and continents&apos; created by Nakheel, a government-backed development company that is also behind the famous palm-tree-shaped sand islands that connect directly to the Dubai coastline.", "Several of the other islands, all still in rudimentary sandbank form or being created, have been snapped up by celebrities (Rod Stewart is rumoured to have bought the UK) and millionaire businessmen who want a bit of privacy and peace close to the madness that is Dubai.", "Dubai&apos;s hotels are enjoying 98 per cent occupancy, and the place is oozing with celebs - during my visit I stayed at the Grosvenor House Hotel, where I spotted Chris Eubank in the top-floor bar, and Ronaldo in the ground-floor restaurant.", "Well, even those who love Dubai will admit the city is a full-on experience.", "&apos;A property in Jasmine Gardens will enable owners to make the most of everything Dubai has to offer, but relax in private when they want to,&apos; says Khoda."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/apr/29/movingoverseas.observercashsection", "publicationDate": "2007-04-29T09:25:09Z"}, {"article": "Dundee, Scotland&apos;s fourth-largest city, is a textbook example of how Labour is attempting to fight back in this Scottish parliament election. In the unusual position of being the underdog, the party is resolutely trying to focus voters&apos; minds on local issues: the regeneration of the city waterfront, education spending, even a last-minute attempt to get London&apos;s Victoria and Albert museum to shift part of its collection to the city. Labour&apos;s candidate in Dundee West is Jill Shimi, the 45-year-old leader of the city council. On the record she will diplomatically warn voters that now is not the time to punish Labour in Scotland for mistakes - Iraq, cash-for-honours - Tony Blair made elsewhere. &quot;I would warn anyone thinking of abandoning Labour for the playground politics of the SNP to just look around this city - at its transformation - and think again,&quot; she says. &quot;The SNP have never run anything. They are schooled in opposition politics, in nit-picking, in picking fights. They&apos;re incapable of working cooperatively, of building alliances, of shared interests. &quot;This is not the time to make protest. It is not a byelection. We are working very hard to remind voters that this is a Holyrood election. Only Labour or the SNP can win it. &quot;And don&apos;t vote nationalist unless you actually want independence and the years of uncertainty that go with it.&quot; The SNP holds the other city seat, Dundee East, and are hoping to take Dundee West to make a clean sweep of the city. In Dundee West, Ms Shimi is &quot;inheriting&quot; a slim Labour majority of 1,066 - ordinarily enough to give the incumbent party at least some breathing room - from the retiring Labour MSP, Kate MacLean. &quot;But these are not ordinary times - they are interesting times!&quot; Shimi says with a wry, resigned grin. Once known as the city of the three &quot;Js&quot; - jute, jam and journalism - Dundee faced rough times in the 1980s as manufacturing jobs were lost and the freight port closed down. Journalism is still in the city in the form of DC Thompson, which produces the Dandy comic and the Dundee Courier, among other publications, but the jute warehouses are either empty or being converted into flats and the boast that jam was invented in Dundee was probably little more than a local legend to begin with. Now the city trades on being the biggest single UK centre for science outside Cambridge, and a small but thriving digital creative industry. The first ZX Spectrums were built here, and, more recently, the PlayStation game Grand Theft Auto was dreamed up here. However, the campaign has been partly dominated by the loss of several hundred jobs from a Tesco distribution plant and the closure of an NCR (National Cash Registers) factory. A well-known local face, Shimi has been on the council since 1995, and leader since 2003. She joined the Labour party in the city in the late &apos;70s, and remembers George Galloway cutting his teeth on the city council. Back then, Dundee was twinned with the West Bank city of Nablus. It still is, but in a sign of changing times, and a changing Labour party, it is now also twinned with the Gulf city-state of Dubai - a financial and retail centre. Shimi points to what she insists is the &quot;transformation&quot; of Dundee - a pedestrianised City Square, \u00a39.3m for the rejuvenation of the city waterfront, \u00a3117m spent on the city schools, the highest investment per capita in the city for 30 years. &quot;We are costed, tried and tested,&quot; she says of Labour. &quot;Who are the SNP apart from Alex Salmond? He&apos;s charismatic, but the reaction I get on the doorstep is that he&apos;s also bit slippery. And no one can name any of his potential frontbench.&quot; And if the worst comes to the worst on Thursday, and the nationalists overtake Labour as the largest party in the Scottish parliament, Shimi points to her own council in Dundee as a possible way forward. &quot;In the 2003 elections we came out with one less councillor than the SNP - but it was us that formed a working coalition with the Lib Dems, and even the Tories, because we can work with people. The SNP proved incapable of that. &quot;Even when they agreed with us on 97% of things, they would nitpick and campaign against us even on where to put the city Christmas tree. &quot;They are playground politicians.&quot; And it is true that, despite the SNP&apos;s poll lead, it is still just possible for Labour to emerge the second largest party at Holyrood, and, in the coalition jostling and pact-making that will follow on May 4, attempt a &quot;rainbow coalition&quot; of pro-unionist parties. This is very different from Westminster politics. This morning Shimi welcomed Jack McConnell, Labour&apos;s first minister, to the city to unveil a feasibility proposal to house some of the V&amp;A&apos;s collection on the renovated waterfront. Her opponents, and even the rector of the University of Dundee, accused Labour of last-minute stunt; no location, let alone costs, have yet been attached to the proposed project. But, on a brilliantly sunny spring day on Dundee&apos;s Tay bank, it is hard to argue that the city is not on the up, at least by comparison with its recent history - if not its Victorian heyday. But whether that will be enough to allow Labour to hold on in Dundee West against a national poll lead of upwards of 6% for the &quot;playground politicians&quot; of the SNP is another matter.

Yes, he really did!  2) Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan is no longer in the tournament.

Anyway, that&apos;s modern snooker. State of it. Now, players today are extremely technically proficient, much more so than in the days of Reardon, Higgins, Davis, White and Taylor. So well done, everyone, well done! Sadly, if technical proficiency was what really got most people&apos;s rocks off, the BBC could simply fill the schedules with stop-motion photography of civil engineers hoiking up a bridge, and stop wasting everyone&apos;s time. Because what enticed viewers in the sport&apos;s 1980s heyday wasn&apos;t the quality of the snooker - although you&apos;d do well to ever see something as fantastic as this or this or this fags, lapels and male-pattern baldness-fest ever again - but the back story. This year could potentially see a &quot;grudge&quot; final between Murphy and Stephen Maguire - they simply can&apos;t stand each other - but the rancour only exists because Murphy once agitated to claim a frame on a technicality after Maguire forgot his chalk. Compare and contrast to the great hate-fuelled rubbers between Alex Higgins and Dennis Taylor: the former piqued because Taylor was wresting his &quot;people&apos;s champion&quot; status from him, the latter not unreasonably because Higgins had threatened to set the Ulster Defense Association to work on his temple. While Higgins was the dominant splash of colour in the sport, even without him the scene was vibrant: coke-addled genius Kirk Stevens; Bill Werbeniuk and his 14-pint steadiers; Tony Knowles the Bolton lothario; Joe Johnson, the swashbuckling two-year supernova; Jimmy White; Jimmy White; Jimmy White. Even the hard-as-nails intensity of your Thorburns, Davises and Hendrys compares favourably to modern-day grinders such as Peter Ebdon, with their self-help management-consultant books in one hand and tourist brochures for Dubai in the other. In the modern game - O&apos;Sullivan apart - only the much-lamented Paul Hunter offered a dash of off-the-table glamour, sexiness, danger, good old-fashioned carousing and, most crucially of all, personality. Well, that return is simply not good enough. Snooker is all about late nights wasted hustling and necking pints of perfume in dark, smoky rooms - not clicking around a God-bothering chatroom for kicks before tucking up with the good book and a glass of warm milk. But what to do? How to save the sport from itself? Oh I don&apos;t know. How about this two-point plan? 1) Force all the players to trolley booze during matches. 2) If they refuse, tell them there&apos;s no God while repeatedly prodding them in the chest until they engage in vigorous ecumenical debate.", "tags": ["Snooker", "Sport"], "title": "Scott Murray: my two-point plan to save snooker", "sentences": ["Even the hard-as-nails intensity of your Thorburns, Davises and Hendrys compares favourably to modern-day grinders such as Peter Ebdon, with their self-help management-consultant books in one hand and tourist brochures for Dubai in the other."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/03/snooker.scottmurray", "publicationDate": "2007-05-03T14:10:10Z"}, {"article": "For the past 50 years Tiananmen Square has been the nearest thing the Chinese Communist party has had to holy ground.

To heighten awareness about the environment, he believes the Beijing square should be transformed into a park and forest. In his model, the vast expanse of paving slabs outside the Forbidden City are replaced by trees and grass. There are lush thickets around the mausoleum containing Mao Zedong&apos;s embalmed body and a verdant entrance to the Great Hall of the People. &quot;We want to transform this empty political square into something that can be enjoyed,&quot; Mr Ma said. &quot;Our aim is to propose not to criticise, to raise the issue of public space. The way we do our architecture is to show that we can come up with our own solutions. We don&apos;t just take orders. That is why we want to show this project to the public first.&quot; Mr Ma, who completed an apprenticeship in London under the prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid, is one of the boldest and least orthodox within China&apos;s architectural community. His firm, MAD, has offices in Beijing and Dubai, is working on five big projects in China, and is behind a curvaceous 50-storey tower arising in Ontario, Canada. The architect believes Tiananmen Square need not be considered sacrosanct, because its origins are relatively recent and foreign. The plaza was created after Mao Zedong&apos;s Communists came to power in 1949. Copying Red Square in Moscow, it was designed for military parades and giant public rallies. But this function is, he says, outdated. &quot;Tiananmen is ... the physical centre but not the real centre. No Beijing people go there,&quot; he said. &quot;The question we posed ourselves was how to make the area more enjoyable if we no longer need it for tanks?&quot; However, his plan for Tiananmen is too controversial for the authorities. The mainland media have already been told not to publish images of his green model. &quot;Tiananmen Square is a sensitive topic because many things happened there,&quot; Mr Ma said. &quot;The idea of turning the plaza into a forest makes many people feel uncomfortable.&quot; Zhang Lixin, a director at the Beijing urban planning bureau, said: &quot;This isn&apos;t just an architectural design problem. We also use this space for national events. In the long term, I think Tiananmen Square will keep its original function. We can do some work nearby to make more green spaces.&quot; It is not green but grey that dominates a model of Beijing at the Urban Planning Exhibition Centre in the city. Radiating outwards from a pillow-sized Forbidden City, to the area of a tennis court, the scale model illustrates the dramatic changes occurring in the urban landscape as the city gears up to host the 2008 Olympics. Beijing is becoming a showroom for the world&apos;s leading architects. Rem Koolhaas, from the Netherlands, is behind the spectacular tilting towers of the Central China TV HQ in the commercial district. Paul Andreu, from France, helped lay the giant egg-shaped national theatre, while the UK architect Norman Foster designed the dragon-inspired airport terminal, which will be the world&apos;s largest when it opens next year. Yet despite the new national stadium - known as the bird&apos;s nest - and the giant egg theatre, the pastoral theme does not extend much beyond the shapes and names of all the new steel and concrete designs. The city&apos;s suburbs are eating up farmland as sprawl continues. A green belt was planned in the late 1990s, but it was consumed by development. Now there are only a few small splashes of park and farmland left. With urban development twisting out of the grasp of planners and regulators, Mr Ma argues that a green Tiananmen could indicate changing priorities. &quot;I read that Beijing has 2.8% of green space, including the lakes. It was much better in the past. It is very bad now.&quot;", "tags": ["World news", "Architecture", "China", "Art", "Travel", "Conservation", "Environment", "Trees and forests", "Art and design", "Culture", "Protest", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Why Tiananmen Square could go from red to green", "sentences": ["His firm, MAD, has offices in Beijing and Dubai, is working on five big projects in China, and is behind a curvaceous 50-storey tower arising in Ontario, Canada."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/04/architecture.china", "publicationDate": "2007-05-04T14:14:56Z"}, {"article": "Climate change is revealing a further inconvenient truth. Today&apos;s UN report confirms the warnings of many campaigners; that only the most stringent of programmes to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases in rich countries - some 80-90% reduction by 2050 - will give us any chance of keeping any global warming temperature increase below 2C. Those 2C are the crucial &quot;tipping point&quot;, beyond which the likelihood of humankind being able to manage the impacts of climate change would greatly diminish. But the fact the rich world has to face is even starker than this. We must not only drastically reduce our emissions. We must also start paying back the carbon debt accrued during the past 150 years of industrialisation. In other words, we must support countries like China and India in adopting cleaner technologies as they develop. The earth simply cannot sustain another great wave of carbon-spewing development. There is finite &quot;budget&quot; for the releasing of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Rich countries have busted the bank account on route to industrialisation, and repayment is now overdue. Were it not for global poverty, the fact that we have borrowed recklessly from the earth&apos;s future carbon resources to power our economic development would not be such a problem. The world could simply take its foot off the gas - both literally and metaphorically - and concentrate on improving the quality of wealth creation rather than its quantity. But the world in which we live is horribly fractured. While people in Europe, North America and one or two other isolated outposts enjoy unprecedented material wealth, more than one-third of the world&apos;s population is still grindingly poor. The new members of the consumers&apos; club - those in former soviet countries in Europe and the emerging middle classes of big developing countries - have as yet only a fragile grip on development. It is in this reality that the truth becomes inconvenient to a perverse degree. For if the 2.6bn people who still survive on less than $2 per day enforce their right to a level of development akin to ours and achieve it by the same means, we can kiss goodbye to the climate and, in the longer term, to many of the things we currently value and view as civilised. A world with more than three or four degrees of global warming will be one in which order, stability and security are hard to guarantee. And yet people have a right to lives of dignity and opportunity and who are we, the over-exploiters of the earth&apos;s resources, to tell them that while we would like them to own iPods and cars and to enjoy weekends away in Dubai, there simply isn&apos;t the environmental space? We would like to apologise to one billion Indians, two billion Chinese and 600m sub-Saharan Africans, but the atmosphere is now used up and so they must wait 100 years or so for it to unburden itself of our greenhouse gases before they can develop any further. Christian Aid believes that, for the sake of millions of poor people in the world&apos;s most vulnerable regions, 2C must be our aim. But this goal is already well aired and even the most recalcitrant are taking it seriously. The 2C target is well articulated in the G8&apos;s draft communique and must remain so when leaders sign it off in June. It is for this reason that Christian Aid is wholeheartedly backing the Anglo-German initiative to win hearts and minds in Washington DC and other capital cities in advance of the meeting. Persuading President Bush and others to commit to a truly heroic domestic climate action plan is a challenge of Herculean proportions. But failure to make a big leap forward in the US and Europe is not only unjust, but no amount of marketing gloss applied by G8 leaders will make it sellable to a developing world hungry for change and thirsty for the spoils of consumerism. So what, in this carbon-constrained, resource finite world, ought we to do? If carbon were banked in the same way as money, then rich countries would have long since had their accounts frozen and would now be at the mercy of debt collectors. But the world is an illogical place where those who stand to lose most as a result of our profligacy are those who have hitherto gained the least. We in industrialised countries are responsible for climate change and we are in the luxurious position of having the wealth and wherewithal to prevent it spiralling out of control. It is along these lines - responsibility and capability - that we must share out the burden of reducing emissions and of reinventing development so as not to pitch the planet into meltdown. At risk of sounding glib, we need a deal on climate change that describes a path to global carbon &quot;spending&quot; less than half the current annual rate while guaranteeing poor people&apos;s right to development. Perhaps we should consider, as part of the process of tackling climate change, repaying our carbon debt. This need not only be a monetary arrangement. We must allow proper transfer of existing technologies - lock, stock and intellectual property - so that poor countries set themselves on a path towards low carbon growth. We must ensure that investment is cleaned up, which means an end to fossil fuel subsidy and willingness on the part of governments to intervene and cut off the supply of money to highly polluting activities. Perhaps most importantly, we must rethink development. Climate change is an object lesson in what happens when we live beyond our environmental means. So instead of foisting on poor countries the economic policies that have got us into this mess, we should consider how to support them to achieve human development goals and, along the way, to share out the wealth they create more evenly. Fifteen years ago, world leaders met in Rio de Janeiro to sign the UN&apos;s Framework Convention on Climate Change. In doing so, they enshrined in international law the principles of responsibility and capability in achieving the globally shared aim of preventing unsustainable levels of global warming. As the architects of such treaties begin to sketch the shape of the next, at the German G8 and at the UN&apos;s summit in Bali later in the year, these twin principles need to be its main pillars.", "tags": ["Climate change", "United Nations", "Greenhouse gas emissions"], "title": "Call the carbon bailiffs", "sentences": ["And yet people have a right to lives of dignity and opportunity and who are we, the over-exploiters of the earth&apos;s resources, to tell them that while we would like them to own iPods and cars and to enjoy weekends away in Dubai, there simply isn&apos;t the environmental space?"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/04/callthecarbonbailiffs", "publicationDate": "2007-05-04T14:30:00Z"}, {"article": "At the beginning of last month, US Ranger was available at 66-1 for today&apos;s 2,000 Guineas. This morning, 5-1 is the best available from the major firms but even that may prove a price worth taking. The horse may be unknown to British punters, having raced only in France, while his trainer, Jean-Claude Rouget, is also something of an enigma, despite having won more races than any other trainer in Europe. But the colours of Michael Tabor command respect in any race, particularly when allied to a gamble of this magnitude. Even in the absence of market support, US Ranger (3.25) would have obvious claims on the strength of his astonishing success in last month&apos;s Prix Djebel at Maisons-Laffitte, when he bounded away from a colt who had already triumphed in a Listed race this season and has since gone on to win another one. The Djebel is also only a Listed race itself but it is well established as the ideal prep-race for French-based horses being aimed at the Guineas. Both Zafonic and Pennekamp came from the Djebel to win today&apos;s race in the mid-1990s. Strategic Prince, who chased home Teofilo and Holy Roman Emperor in the Dewhurst Stakes last October, travelled like the best horse for much of that race and should appreciate today&apos;s faster ground but his preparation has not reportedly been straightforward. Haatef, fourth in the Dewhurst on his second racecourse appearance, showed admirable toughness in the face of traffic problems and may be the one to take from that race. Adagio, seventh that day, was entitled to win the Craven as he did and the value has gone about his chances. Newmarket 2.10 Voodoo Moon&apos;s all-the-way success at Beverley exemplified the batting qualities that trainer Mark Johnston can instill. Just 4lb higher, she can repeat the feat in this company. Goodwood 2.30 Pic Up Sticks can be forgiven his Epsom reappearance, as he has never been seen at his best there. By contrast, some of his best efforts have come at Goodwood and, from a yard in form, he will be sharper this time. Newmarket 2.45 Abhisheka is one of three Godolphin runners on the card, their first in Britain this season. All must be watched for a clue as to the yard&apos;s form, which was dismal in Dubai this spring. Unless there&apos;s been an unlikely revival, Echelon is the standout here. Thirsk 3.00 Last year&apos;s winner Minority Report can bring up the double as this return to a fast surface will suit. Goodwood 3.40 Chantilly Tiffany got the run of the race when landing the Wood Ditton and may be flattered by the bare result. Already a winner at this level, Expensive is a much more solid proposition. Ron Cox&apos;s tip of the day Burning Incense 4.00 Newmarket After failing to win in four maiden races, Burning Incense came to himself in handicap company last term. From eight outings, his only unplaced effort came in the Ayr Silver Cup, when he was drawn on the wrong side.

He is shortlisted for the Royal Society&apos;s prize for science writing, for his book The Rough Guide to Climate Change. Now, in a conversion that would command the admiration of St Paul, he declares that &quot;binge flying&quot; constitutes a huge threat to the global environment. &quot;If the travel industry rosily goes ahead as it is doing, ignoring the effect that carbon emissions from flying are having on climate change, we are putting ourselves in a very similar position to the tobacco industry.&quot; He readily admits the irony that he, of all people, should articulate such a warning. He appeals for moderation, for setting some limits on our insatiable appetite for travel: &quot;We now live in a society where, if people have nothing to do on a Saturday night, they go to Budapest for 48 hours. We fly anywhere at the slightest opportunity, 10 times and upwards a year. This needs to be addressed with the greatest urgency.&quot; Environmentalists would say that Ellingham is stating the obvious, adding of course that it is pretty rich coming from him. I am full of admiration for his frankness, however. Almost all of us are hypocrites about climate change. We know that it is real, and desperately serious. Yet we are in a shocking muddle about how to relate our personal behaviour to the phenomenon. For those who inhabit the developed world, opportunities for travel represent the most significant new personal freedom of the past half-century. Even as recently as the 1960s, hitch-hiking to Greece and Turkey was a big deal for the adventurous young middle class. Africa and Asia were high-ticket destinations, South America and Australia almost off the map. Today, it is possible to fly almost anywhere for a few hundred pounds, and we all do. Every arriving jet at Nairobi or Ho Chi Minh City or Buenos Aires disgorges its crowds of package tourists and backpackers. Short breaks, which mean intensive plane use, are booming. Short-break destinations include Capetown and Dubai. Common sense tells us that all this is environmentally disastrous. Yet common sense also tells us that tourism is doing great things for the economies of poor societies all over the world. Carbon emissions soar as a result of flying flowers and vegetables to Europe and America from Africa and Mexico. Yet if that traffic stopped, millions of needy people in the growers&apos; trade would suffer. All this leaves many of us as confused as Ellingham. Relatively speaking, the travel boom has hardly started. In the decades ahead, many more millions will possess the means and the desire to fly further and more often. The Chinese, for instance, have only just begun to discover the joys of holidaying abroad. Suggesting to people who live in newly emergent economies that they should forgo travel is comparable with the modern western enthusiasm for saving Africa&apos;s great animals, after slaughtering them wholesale for a century or two. Even in the west, it is dangerous politics for a government to seek to check the electorate&apos;s passion to fly, just as few democratic nations dare meddle with the freedom to drive. All credible curbs must be based on pricing. Yet if it becomes harder for the poor to travel while the rich stay airborne, this does not sound good on the hustings. The best and simplest way forward would be to tax aviation fuel, to end the crazy anomaly whereby moving a plane is cheap, while driving a car is expensive almost everywhere in the world save Iran and the US. But it is almost impossible to reach an international agreement on taxing aviation fuel that would stick. No government will act unilaterally, with the prospect of watching its aviation industry migrate elsewhere. Ellingham suggests a \u00a3100 &quot;green tax&quot; on tickets for all flights to Europe and Africa, \u00a3250 to more remote destinations. The first benefit of this would be to deter short-haul flying within the UK. It is absurd that it costs far more to take a train to Newcastle or Edinburgh than to catch a plane there. Lots of us, including me, love trains and are only deterred from using them by the cost. Some destination countries would benefit from discouraging low-budget travellers, because the environmental costs which their visits impose outweigh the cash that they spend. The Samburu National Park in Kenya is currently threatened by the building of two 500-bed hotels. Samburu is a small area, famous for its elephants. Tourists in such numbers will overwhelm its fragile ecosystem. Any rational long-term view of Samburu&apos;s interests would come down against the new hotels, and in favour of extracting more money from fewer tourists. The projects will go ahead only because a handful of people will profit handsomely from their construction. The low-budget traveller creates dilemmas for destinations all over the world. The mayor of Venice, Massimo Cacciari, wants a levy of \u20ac1 a head imposed on the 20 million tourists who come to the city each year, to help with the huge municipal costs they impose. Venice is currently struggling to enforce the ban on picnicking in St Mark&apos;s Square, and on walking the streets bare-chested or in bikini tops. If this sounds pompous, the citizens of Venice reply that, at present, a great host of visitors spend next to nothing and conduct themselves in a manner that diminishes the grace and beauty they come to see. Other Italian cities, including Rome and Florence, are drawing up codes of conduct to restrain boorish behaviour by tourists. Here, it is easy for a good democrat to explode: &quot;Do you want to restrict the wonders of the world to rich bastards?&quot; But it is an obvious truth that the more people who visit a given place, the greater damage they inflict upon it. Ellingham again: &quot;Balancing all the positives and negatives, I&apos;m not convinced there is such a thing as a &apos;responsible&apos; or &apos;ethical&apos; holiday.&quot; The bad news for the environment is that it is impossible to believe that the global travel boom will stop. Whatever is done in Britain, or in the western world at large, amid our consciousness of climate change, many other nations which have only just begun to experience prosperity have no intention of depriving their citizens of its privileges. As with other responses to climate change, however, this is no reason for us to do nothing. Even if the British government is obliged to act unilaterally, it must be right to impose higher costs on air travel through taxation. Indeed, it would be irresponsible not to do so. Ellingham urges us all to impose some discipline on our own travel, refusing to succumb to &quot;binge flying&quot;. Only a minority of thoughtful people, the same kind who buy organic products, are likely to heed him. Most of us change our bad habits only when we are made to do so. We will fly less only when it hurts our pockets too much to fly more. Ellingham is surely right that this must be made to happen, and all credit to him for saying so. comment@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business", "UK news", "Climate change", "Environment", "Travel"], "title": "Max Hastings: Binge-flying culture is just beginning.

The Rugby Football League has ruled out any possibility of transferring the two points won by Leeds in Cardiff, though it has also confirmed that no further action will be taken against the Bulls coach, Steve McNamara, over his post-match comments. On Monday Bradford&apos;s chairman, Peter Hood, issued a statement calling on Leeds to hand over the points won after a string of refereeing blunders helped give them victory but they were given short shrift by Rhinos&apos; chief executive, Gary Hetherington, and the RFL has confirmed its rules would prevent such a move anyway. McNamara, the newly appointed Great Britain assistant coach, had claimed the referee, Steve Ganson, had &quot;invented&quot; the late penalty that led to the Leeds substitute Jordan Tansey scoring a match-winning try despite being offside. McNamara had added that his side felt &quot;cheated&quot; by the sequence of events leading to their 42-38 defeat. The sport&apos;s governing body did, however, offer some small relief to Bradford by stating that McNamara will not face a disrepute charge for his comments. &quot;Due to the unique set of circumstances we are not planning to take any action regarding Steve McNamara&apos;s after-match comments,&quot; an RFL spokesperson said. Both Ganson and Ashley Klein, the video referee who also attracted criticism over Sunday&apos;s game, have been omitted from the refereeing appointments for this weekend&apos;s matches.  Klein last night followed Ganson in admitting his errors, confessing that it was he who made the call to the referee to award Leeds the penalty from which the controversial last play ensued. The Bradford hooker Terry Newton will face an RFL disciplinary hearing today after being referred on a charge of striking in the same match.

That is the very thoughtful question posed by Andy Cowles, IPC Media creative director. 5pm update: (scroll down) For the View from the Top session there are 12 people on the panel. Is this a record? Anyway, the session kicks off with a newsflash: Conde Nast is moving into India, big time! Paul Keenan, chief executive of Emap Consumer Media and chair of the Periodical Publishers Association, is anxious to put that right. It&apos;s not quite storming the Bastille circa 1789, but the PPA has created a \u00a31m marketing campaign to challenge outdated perceptions about magazines, and the theme of that campaign is the magazine revolution. Traditionally, magazines have been pretty average at marketing themselves as a medium, certainly compared with radio and the internet. Now the industry is really taking the fight to the internet and rival media. There is a danger in this type of presentation. You are either preaching to the converted, or you face a sceptical audience that have sat through similar presentations from Thinkbox for the TV industry, RAB for radio and IAB for the internet. Earlier today Jack Kliger, the chief executive of Hachette Filipacchi US and chairman of the US Magazine Publisher&apos;s Association complained of a similar problem with the American magazine failing to market itself. &quot;US magazine executives are good at telling advertisers why their magazine is better than other magazines, but not why magazines are better than cable TV or the internet.&quot; So how does Keenan fare? He makes some good points, but overall the presentation is less than the some of its parts. Keenan says that magazines are valuable to advertisers because they have both power and passion. Magazines are powerful because they connect with a mass audience, or a niche one. Compare Radio Times with Today&apos;s Golfer. They are also powerful espousers of attitudes and values. He produces US figures to show that mags are better than online and TV in prompting brand awareness and intent to purchase among readers. &quot;Madonna will flex her brand and be whoever she needs to be for GQ and Grazia,&quot; says Keenan. &quot;We can accommodate whoever she needs to be.&quot; While he is not suggesting brands turn themselves into Mrs Richie, Keenan says magazines have the diversity to accommodate brands in all their guises and to reach whatever niche or mass audience is required. In other words, magazines will help advertisers revolutionise their brands. It is neat, but somehow I get the feeling that he is preaching to the converted. 1pm update: The rewards are great for publishing in India and China but the panel disagree about the obstacles. Chris Bew, from the Economist Intelligence Unit, is enthusiastic about publishing in what he calls the BRIC nations: Brazil, China and India. He says they are large markets and therefor rewarding if you get the pricing right. But Bew warns that legal, physical and cultural barriers to publishing are formidable. Chander Rai, Cross Border Media, a consultant based in India, ripostes: &quot;I really think India apart from becoming a trillion dollar industry has great potential and I really think that the bottlenecks are being exaggerated.&quot; Cathy Runciman, international development director for Time Out, says that the listings magazine has 16 editions arond the world, most in emerging markets. She is also cautious about moving into developing markets and says that the magazine is forced to be flexible about content, frequency, even paper stock in foreign markets. &quot;You can do all the research you want but geopolitics gets in the way. Last spring we thought it would be a fantastic time to launch Time Out Beirut, who would have known that summer would bring such tragic consequences.&quot; Time Out has to accommodate political sensitivities. It is a free thinking magazine but it publishes in China and Dubai where as Runicman says &quot;criticising the government gets you lobbed into jail&quot;. Runciman cautions the audience against sitting back in UK and giving local publishers the privilege of publishing their titles. &quot;You have to take the journey with them, even if it is a licence and not a joint venture. It is a huge management commitment.&quot; The panel are asked where the next big growth markets will be. Rai nominates the Middle East, where growth rates will be the best in the world. Runciman nominates Nigeria and Pakistan, two markets the listings magazine is keen to enter. 3.15pm update: (scroll down) Is design the new journalism? That is the very thoughtful question posed by Andy Cowles, IPC Media creative director. There are soft sighs in the audience when Cowles produces the front cover of The Best of Smash Hits 80s. His point is that design for Smash Hits had such an influence on our experience of reading the magazine. It was all about pictures, typography, colour as much as the words. And that has become more and more important. Cowles says that nowdays it is tough in focus groups to get readers to talk about the content of a magazine. &quot;People just talk about how it looks, endlessly.&quot; With the industry the way it is, every issue counts, particularly with monthly magazines. &quot;Every issue of every magazine must be a real event to create momentum,&quot; says Cowles. He turns to issues of New York magazine. Each cover feels like an event - even if the cover stories are merely lists of best restaurants or an interview with a prostitute. &quot;Our attention span has degraded to such an extent that watching a three minute pop video now seems like too much. I want the edited highlights.&quot; And because readers&apos; attention spans have dwindled so fast that magazines must turn to design and be ever more determined to catch people&apos;s attention. &quot;You must be determined to remind people of the value of what they are reading - before they read it.&quot; A naked John Lennon and Yoko Ono on the cover of Rolling Stone was voted the best cover of all time not just because of the image, but also because Annie Lebowitz took the photograph the day before Lennon was shot and the impact the cover had was a result of the perfect storm of access, journalism and events. Cowles presents a compelling case that design decisions has merged with the processes of journalism. &quot;Our best editors are the ones that have the most powerful visual skill and our best designers are the ones that can best manipulate content.&quot; 5pm update: (scroll down) For the View from the Top session there are 12 people on the panel. Is this a record? Anyway, the session kicks off with a newsflash: Conde Nast is moving into India, big time! Nicholas Coleridge, the Conde Nast boss, looks almost perma-tanned as he announces that the company is about to launch several magazines in India, including Indian Vogue. Nothing that unusual there, the world and his wife launching into India. But, uniquely, Conde Nast is doing it as part of a wholly-owned company. It will not be licenced and not part of a joint venture. Coleridge said that the Indian market was characterised by many entrepreneurs appointing their wives or children as editors. &quot;I won&apos;t name which of the magazines they are but it&apos;s just about all of them.&quot; Conde Nast will audit its magazines&apos; circulation after six months. &quot;If we reach a circulation of 60,000 to 70,000 copies of Indian Vogue after that point we would regard ourselves as doing rather well,&quot; Coleridge said. Stephen Quinn, publisher of Vogue, starts asking a question and the words &quot;Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones&quot; have barely passed his lips before on the panel Sally Cartwright of Hello! magazine looks mortified. But Quinn has a point to make about privacy laws. How can Douglas and Zeta Jones demand privacy and take Hello! to court for running a spoiler when they sell their wedding pictures to OK! For \u00a31m. Cartwright looks relieved and says she agrees 100%. &quot;The only people that win now are the lawyers so I think that we will have to accept it as it is,&quot; Cartwright says. Bollocks! That is Stevie Spring, the head of Future Publishing, after she has just been asked about the future of online digital magazines, such as men&apos;s magazine Monkey and teen girl&apos;s magazine Jellyfish. Dennis Publishing, run by Felix Dennis, has launched Monkey, an online men&apos;s magazine, to general acclaim. &quot;Felix is a fantastic PR,&quot; Spring said. &quot;He has made something significant out of something that is quite ordinary.&quot; Spring says that the magazine has a ABCe audit but points out that 200,000 impacts online is not he same as impacts that you get from a magazine that you have chosen and engage and spend time with. She says it is comparing apples with pears. Spring also pours scorn about predicts of the digital future. &quot;Anyone who has a forecast beyond six months is fooling themselves because none of us have a clue.&quot; Andrew Hirsch, from custom publisher John Brown, said that he wouldn&apos;t knock Monkey. &quot;It might be crude but we are sitting here talking about it.&quot; Phippen, from BBC magazines, is sceptical about trying to deliver a magazine over the web. He calls replicating print content on the web in either a monthly of weekly period &quot;counter intuitive&quot; and says that video content will be crucial to the future of any successful website.

Stevie Spring, Future Publishing: wished that she had launched Vogue. &quot;I would love their shoe closet. And their revenues.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m going to be indiscreet and apologies to any colleagues here but the ones I wished we hadn&apos;t launched were the Highbury titles.&quot; Nicholas Coleridge, Conde Nast. &quot;I wished I had launched the Spectator but I would have to have been rather old.&quot; He wished the Maxim titles had never been launched. &quot;I don&apos;t think they added much&quot;. Evelyn Webster, IPC, wished that she had launched the Week. She apologised to David Goodchild, the H Bauer boss sitting near her, before saying the magazine she wished had never been launched was his own In the Know. Peter Phippen, BBC Magazines. &quot;I would like to have launched Heat, it&apos;s pretty profitable. He refused to answer what magazine he wished he hadn&apos;t launched but finally mutter something about Good Parenting. Duncan Edwards, NatMags, had a whole list of magazines he wanted to launch - Heat, the Week, Traveller, &quot;Glamour did quite well&quot; he said slyly, referring to the Conde Nast launch that overtook NatMags own Cosmopolitan in the women&apos;s monthly. In the wished we hadn&apos;t launched category, he said in the 1990s were was a clutch of magazines they launched with initials as titles. M, ZM and neither of them worked particularly well. Andrew Hirsch of John Brown wished he had launced Maxim in America. &quot;It made shedloads of money&quot;. He wished Bizzare magazine had not launched. &quot;It had gruesome cover imagery that terrified me.&quot; David Goodchild, H Bauer. &quot;The one I would like to have launched was heat, but I liked the original unisex entertainment version.

Chicago today moved a step closer to boasting the two tallest skyscrapers in the US when officials approved the construction of the 2,000ft Chicago Spire. The building - designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the man behind the Milwaukee art museum&apos;s Quadracci pavilion - will be a twisting tower. An apartment complex, the structure has been compared to a drill bit, a blade of grass or a tall twisting tree. It will incorporate a riverfront plaza and six levels of underground parking will be provided next to the site. The $2.4bn (\u00a31.2bn) tower will be made mainly of concrete, with its twisting exterior designed to deflect wind. Located at the point where the Chicago River drains into Lake Michigan, it will be at the centre of a Chicago skyline that already features the black Sears Tower - currently the highest building in the US at 1,450ft. The Chicago Sun-Times reported that buyers had already put down $20,000 (\u00a310,090) deposits on 92 of the building&apos;s 300 apartments during a two-week promotion last year. However, private financing for the project, to be built by Shelbourne Development, could prove the biggest hurdle to its completion. Approval of the project shows that appetite for skyscrapers remains undiminished around the world despite the 2001 destruction of the World Trade Centre in New York. But in response to the September 11 terror attacks, the Chicago Spire has been designed with two emergency stairwells. Experts say the craze for tall buildings is not just down to the boom for office property. &quot;Tall buildings are a matter of ego. Tall buildings are a sign of success,&quot; George Efstathiou, a managing partner at the architecture firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, told the Associated Press. The practice is building both the new Freedom tower, on the World Trade Centre site, and the Burj Dubai, soon to be the world&apos;s tallest building. The Burj Dubai&apos;s ultimate height is being kept secret, but developers say it will be at least 2,300ft, surpassing the current world&apos;s tallest building - the 1,671ft Taipei 101. In London, the skyline in the city&apos;s financial district is dominated by the bulbous Gherkin building, and the green light has been given for the Shard of Glass, a 1,000ft tower designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano. However, building in Europe and the US is eclipsed by the frenzy in Dubai and China, where seven of the world&apos;s 10 highest buildings are to be found.", "tags": ["World news", "US news", "Design", "Culture", "Art and design", "Skyscrapers"], "title": "Chicago approves construction of 2,000ft skyscraper", "sentences": ["The practice is building both the new Freedom tower, on the World Trade Centre site, and the Burj Dubai, soon to be the world&apos;s tallest building.", "The Burj Dubai&apos;s ultimate height is being kept secret, but developers say it will be at least 2,300ft, surpassing the current world&apos;s tallest building - the 1,671ft Taipei 101.", "However, building in Europe and the US is eclipsed by the frenzy in Dubai and China, where seven of the world&apos;s 10 highest buildings are to be found."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/10/usa.design", "publicationDate": "2007-05-10T09:26:31Z"}, {"article": "Cohabitation is a perilous proposition in a strictly Muslim society but Pakistan may be heading that way as Pervez Musharraf&apos;s domestic troubles intensify and two sets of contentious autumn elections draw close. Most likely to join the president-general in unblessed political union is Benazir Bhutto, a twice-spurned prime minister, whose return from exile is widely anticipated. But numerous obstacles may yet rupture the mooted alliance, not least that this odd couple has been at daggers drawn for almost a decade. Accident-prone Gen Musharraf is no great prospect these days and Ms Bhutto may yet feel she can do better. His pro-Washington, anti-Taliban U-turn after 9/11 has not been forgiven by Islamists in a country where anti-American sentiments runs deep. It contributed greatly to the rise of religious parties. His reneging on a pledge to resign his position as armed forces chief, as demanded by opponents and the constitution, and his expansion of the presidency&apos;s executive powers are other festering wounds. His societal theory of &quot;enlightened moderation&quot; remains mostly a theory. But Gen Musharraf&apos;s latest own goal is spectacular by even his standards: his bungled attempt to cashier independent chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry who, it is suggested, might have raised legal objections to the general&apos;s attempt to grab another presidential term. Mr Chaudhry&apos;s refusal to go quietly has become a lightning rod for street-level popular discontent and a rallying point for opposition parties. Another enormous anti-government demonstration is expected in Karachi on Saturday. Gen Musharraf claims to have acted in the national interest in suspending the chief justice for alleged misconduct. &quot;I had to decide whether personal relations or the state were more important ... and I stood for the state,&quot; he said in Rawalpindi this week. But few Pakistanis seem to believe him. With the general in a hole and still digging, and with parliamentary elections due by November, speculation grows about a pact with Ms Bhutto and her Pakistan&apos;s People&apos;s party - still the single most powerful democratic force. Speaking from exile in Dubai, Ms Bhutto is now saying she will return before year&apos;s end and has been dropping ever more explicit hints of a grand compromise. &quot;We admit there are contacts because we want transparency but we don&apos;t say the deal has been done,&quot; she said last week. The broad outlines of an agreement include the dropping of corruption and money-laundering charges against Ms Bhutto and some of her relatives and her return to public life, possibly as prime minister if her party wins the election, in return for Gen Musharraf continuing as president. If it could be made to work, such a power-sharing deal would probably be supported in Washington and London. They value Pakistan&apos;s stability and solidarity in the &quot;war on terror&quot; above democracy and honest governance - but have nevertheless been embarrassed by Gen Musharraf&apos;s lack of legitimacy. But Ms Bhutto&apos;s demands will grow as the general&apos;s authority diminishes - and could yet become unacceptable. The PPP leader is already insisting on the reinstitution of full democratic rights limited after the 1999 coup, international monitoring of future elections and, crucially, Gen Musharraf&apos;s resignation as army chief. &quot;A president in uniform and democracy do not go together ... We want the military to go back to barracks,&quot; she said. A Bhutto-Musharraf deal would in any case be strongly opposed by many PPP supporters and by another influential exile, Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister Gen Musharraf deposed. He jointly leads the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy with Ms Bhutto and is also planning to return to Pakistan soon. &quot;A deal is not on the cards,&quot; Mr Sharif said this week. &quot;She [Bhutto] said to me she will not enter into any deal with Musharraf ... [We] will not bail out Musharraf at this stage. The people would not like it.&quot; Given these contradictions, it seems somebody is not being entirely candid. And while political manoeuvring intensifies and popular unrest spreads, another fear grows: the possibility that Gen Musharraf will jilt all future partners and take the go-it-alone, authoritarian route, including postponing the elections and imposing a state of emergency, as hinted at last Saturday by prime minister Shaukat Aziz. &quot;An emergency would amount to rule by presidential decree ... It would mean despotic rule by President-General Pervez Musharraf&quot; and could lead to violence, said an angry editorial in the Daily Times. &quot;The disorder in evidence today is of the government&apos;s own making ... If the prime minister thinks that by declaring a state of emergency he can somehow stifle the people and ensure longevity for his beleaguered regime, he may have another thought coming.&quot;", "tags": ["Pakistan", "Benazir Bhutto", "Italy", "Middle East and North Africa", "Pervez Musharraf", "Europe"], "title": "Pakistan's odd couple eye up a deal", "sentences": ["Speaking from exile in Dubai, Ms Bhutto is now saying she will return before year&apos;s end and has been dropping ever more explicit hints of a grand compromise."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/10/pakistansoddcoupleeye", "publicationDate": "2007-05-10T17:00:00Z"}, {"article": "Name the last three players Newcastle United signed from Spain? That was a question doing the rounds at St James&apos; Park yesterday and it says something about Michael Owen&apos;s current status within the club that the answer is: Marcelino, Albert Luque and Owen. There may have been an element of humour involved but to be grouped together with such expensive flops whom the club could not and cannot wait to see depart reveals the level of Owen&apos;s standing. That was confirmed by the chairman Freddy Shepherd&apos;s words on Wednesday regarding Owen&apos;s perceived lack of commitment to Newcastle, which were so strong they bear repetition. &quot;I&apos;m telling Michael he has two choices,&quot; Shepherd said. &quot;He either comes out and tells our fans, who have taken him to their hearts, that he is happy here or I tell him that not one of the big four clubs, Man United, Chelsea, Arsenal or Liverpool, are interested in him.&quot; Owen and his advisors had been offered the opportunity to speak of Owen&apos;s commitment publicly but he declined, which incensed the Newcastle chairman and leaves question marks over Owen&apos;s future at the club. Owen was at Chester races on Wednesday afternoon as Shepherd considered the predicament (Sam Allardyce was there yesterday). Owen had zipped out of Newcastle&apos;s training ground in the morning to get to his native North-west and it was not lost on Newcastle officials that on the last day of March, when Newcastle lost at home to Manchester City, Owen was in Dubai again watching horse racing. These are not details that sit easily with the club so, while the rift seems sudden, it has been brewing. All season Shepherd has been in dispute with the Football Association over compensation for Owen&apos;s World Cup injury and the suspicion remains within St James&apos; that Owen&apos;s knee gave way in Germany because he rushed back from a previous injury to play for England. Such distrust takes getting over but, if a period of calm breaks out at Newcastle in the coming days, it may be recalled that Owen&apos;s non-availability has been as important a factor as his transparent ambition in contributing to where the two parties are today. He has not seen what Newcastle can give him and vice versa. But calm is not guaranteed; in fact the potential for friction has been in the air almost since the day Owen moved from Real Madrid in August 2005. To go back, this was a compromise arrangement. Owen wanted out of Spain after a difficult year at the Bernab\u00e9u; Newcastle, having allowed Graeme Souness to force out Craig Bellamy and having not scored in their opening four games of the season, wanted a partner for Alan Shearer in Shearer&apos;s farewell season. Shearer, friend, colleague and mentor to Owen, was fundamental to the deal. Shearer and Owen also share an agent. But even Shearer was not as important as money. Liverpool were also interested in bringing Owen back to England but for a valuation as close as possible to the \u00a37m they sold him for. The \u00a317.5m Newcastle slapped on Madrid&apos;s table ended that and set in train a transfer that ended with Owen talking of a &quot;spinning head,&quot; as 20,000 Geordies greeted him in the sunshine at St James&apos;. The scale of the transfer, Newcastle&apos;s record, and the clauses Owen&apos;s people were able to negotiate, may have smacked of the club&apos;s desperation, but the 20,000 told a story of sincere welcome and affection. There is a view, inside and outside St James&apos;, that Owen has not reciprocated the goodwill, taking \u00a3115,000 per week while backing out of the door. &quot;Michael is an honest man and Liverpool were his first choice,&quot; Souness was to explain in the days before Owen returned to Anfield for the first time, four months into his Newcastle career. But Newcastle&apos;s self-esteem is hurt. Tyneside and beyond awaits comment from the 27-year-old with two years left on his contract. Owen may take the opportunity to remind Newcastle that he thinks like a hired hand, not like a Geordie diehard and that the club agreed the get-out clauses. He could also point out that Newcastle are about to employ their third manager in his 21 months. He could ask Shepherd to look around the dressing room and dare him to declare that this group has been assembled with tactical foresight. Owen could, moreover, ask these questions just a few weeks after becoming the face of Newcastle&apos;s latest publicity campaign: &quot;Buy The Shirt, Live The Dream&quot;. What they said then and now August 2005 After Owen signs for Newcastle their chairman, Freddy Shepherd, denies that the contract contains a get-out clause. &apos;I have heard a little rumour that Michael has a clause in his contract which states he can leave Newcastle United in one year&apos;s time. I can tell you now that he hasn&apos;t,&apos; says Shepherd May 2007 Shepherd demands Owen&apos;s loyalty after suggestions that the striker is ready to trigger an escape clause in his contract and move for \u00a39m.Shepherd says it is an attempt &apos;to flog Owen from under our feet, sourced very close to the player. Michael has two choices: he either tells our fans he is happy here, or I tell him that none of the big four clubs are interested in him.

And the fact that the 53rd-ranked Volandri won so easily, 6-2, 6-4, was still being regarded long into the Roman night as the nearest this city has seen to a modern miracle. When Federer took the first major of the season in Australia, his 10th grand slam title, and then won his opening ATP tournament in Dubai a month later, there seemed no reason to suppose that the greatest player of his day would not continue to sweep all before him, save Spain&apos;s Rafael Nadal, and even possibly win the French Open, the one slam to elude him. Suddenly such notions appear altogether less likely. Nadal may have felt dizzy before completing his 73rd consecutive clay-court victory on Wednesday but Federerer, by comparison and by his own standards, appeared to be in a tailspin. On the US hardcourts in the spring he was twice surprisingly beaten by Argentina&apos;s Guillermo Ca\u00f1as, and although his defeat against Nadal in the Monte Carlo Masters final last month was altogether more expected the severity of the straight-sets defeat was not. Then came yesterday&apos;s defeat in only the third round of the Rome Masters, with the Swiss playing such error-strewn tennis that it seemed as if an alien had taken over his mind. There were no excuses - no fever, no injury, no problem with the heat or the crowd. It was, simply, an extremely bad day for Federer, of the sort from which other greats including Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe were themselves not exempt. It was nevertheless shocking, and Federer&apos;s disappointment was intense. He is not one to lose his cool these days, despite a fiery racket-smashing youth, but when asked if he could analyse the defeat he replied, with some terseness: &quot;I&apos;m not going to do that here. Why should I discuss it five minutes after the match?&quot; Federer has had his Australian coach Tony Roche with him throughout the clay-court season and they will have much work to do between now and the start of the French Open on May 27. There were few signs of any change in tactics, and on the odd occasion that he did attempt to get to the net he was left floundering. That said, such was the frailty and vulnerability of his ground strokes that his confidence had leached away by the end of the first set, never to return. What will have alarmed him and Roche is that he had arrived in Rome early and practised assiduously. &quot;My preparation was perfect and I played a good first round. I knew it was going to be a tough match, so give the guy some credit. But I just didn&apos;t feel like I was in the match at all today,&quot; he said. And neither was he. Volandri, 25, won more matches on clay last year than any other player and both his career titles have been on this surface. However, nothing surely will ever surpass this win, and huge were his celebrations, including a circuit around the wildly cheering court, slapping as many hands as possible. Federer managed a perfunctory salute as he trudged off. For once, nobody was the least interested in him. Andy Roddick, the third seed, also fell in the last 16, losing 6-0, 6-4 to Juan Ignacio Chela, a claycourt specialist. The American, playing his first tournament since a hamstring injury forced him to pull out of the Miami Masters in March, could not match the ground strokes of the Argentinian. &quot;I served horribly today and that made the rest of it a little tough for me,&quot; he said. &quot;First and foremost, though, he just played better than I did. It wasn&apos;t even close today.&quot; Roddick, who had won six of his seven previous meetings with Chela but all of those on his preferred hardcourt surface, dropped his serve four times. &quot;Obviously he&apos;s a bit more comfortable here,&quot; said the American.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport"], "title": "Tennis: Federer clay campaign on slide", "sentences": ["When Federer took the first major of the season in Australia, his 10th grand slam title, and then won his opening ATP tournament in Dubai a month later, there seemed no reason to suppose that the greatest player of his day would not continue to sweep all before him, save Spain&apos;s Rafael Nadal, and even possibly win the French Open, the one slam to elude him."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/11/tennis.sport", "publicationDate": "2007-05-11T22:59:16Z"}, {"article": "One of the great joys of each summer is trying to predict which side will be favoured on the straight course at Ascot.

That makes Prince Of Thebes an interesting each-way prospect for today&apos;s big betting event, the Victoria Cup. Twice a winner over a mile on the round course here, he is only two pounds higher than for the latest of those and put up an encouraging effort last time out, despite having done his level best to blow his chance in the preliminaries.

From the in-form stable of Barry Hills, he won a more valuable contest over the course and distance last July, having started from the same stall 12 he has drawn today.

Lingfield 3.15 Kid Mambo has achieved significantly more than any of his rivals bar Mythical Kid.

Lingfield 3.45 Henry Cecil&apos;s team of fillies are apparently ready to sweep all before them. His Brisk Breeze is easy to like and is believed to have come on significantly for her return to action behind Folk Opera.

Her website, the provocatively titled &quot;Arabs for Israel&apos;, promotes Muslim support for the Jewish state. These are controversial messages that have seen her banned from the campus of at least one Ivy League university. Her email inbox bulges with insults. &apos;Sometimes they say things like &quot;Jihad is our pride&quot; or &quot;You are a pig and an ape like the pigs and apes you defend.&quot;&apos; She reflects a moment. &apos;But I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever really had a serious death threat.&apos; This does not mean that it is safe to print the name of the Los Angeles suburb where she lives. Outside the front door of the large mock-Tudor house, three little concrete pigs hold up a welcome message, but in the flower bed a few feet away the security sign warns intruders of &apos;armed response&apos;. It is 50 years since the moment that has defined most of her life. In July 1956 a parcel bomb from Israeli intelligence killed her father. Colonel Mustafa Hafez was a Feyadeen commander, an Egyptian intelligence officer who organised lethal raids from Gaza that killed hundreds of Jews, including many civilians. The bomb was Israel striking back against a man many saw as the de facto ruler of the territory. At the time, Gaza was under Egyptian military control. Overnight, Colonel Hafez was transformed into a shahid; a martyr to the Arab cause. After a state funeral, Darwish, along with her brother who was also injured in the blast, and her three sisters, was summoned to a meeting with President Nasser and senior officials. &apos;We were asked, &quot;Which one of you will avenge your father&apos;s blood by killing Jews?&quot; And we all looked at each other, my siblings and I, wondering which one of us will say &quot;me&quot;. I remember we were all just speechless. I felt so uncomfortable.&apos; Darwish was eight years old and destined for a life as the dutiful daughter of an Arab national hero. Yet remarkably, given the toxic environment of Gaza half a century ago, she rebelled. &apos;In Gaza elementary school the indoctrination was incredible. It&apos;s worse now, of course, but I remember in the playground we used to sing songs with words like: &quot;The Arabs are our friends, the Jews are our dogs.&quot; We were told that Jews like to kill pregnant Arab women just for fun, to see if it is a boy or a girl. I would be warned: &quot;Don&apos;t take any candy or fruit from a stranger. It could be a Jew trying to poison you.&quot;&apos; Her father had been killed by Jews. But the anger the young girl felt left her confused. She was surrounded by people urging her down the path of jihad. &apos;It made me feel that, if I really loved my father, I&apos;d have to avenge his death. But the knowledge that I didn&apos;t want to kill anybody ... it made me think: &quot;Am I being loyal?&quot; I loved my father. How come I don&apos;t want to kill anybody even though they killed him? They filled our hearts with the fear of Jews. And when you do that to a child, hatred becomes very easy and terrorism becomes a virtue. It becomes acceptable.&apos; Deeply hurt by her father&apos;s death, she confesses to many years of resentment. &apos;I hated Israel. Oh God, how I hated the Jews. But now I can look at it more as a historical event. The pain and the anger have subsided and now I really understand why Israel wanted to kill my father.&apos; People would say, &quot;Your father is in Heaven now. He&apos;s a shahid, he&apos;s a martyr. Wouldn&apos;t you want him to be in Heaven?&quot; But she hated the idea that he had died. &apos;I wanted him to be down here with us. But I couldn&apos;t express that openly because it was against what everyone was telling us.&apos; The only person Darwish felt that she could talk to openly was her grandmother. She would climb onto the older woman&apos;s knee and reveal her true feelings. &apos;I was too scared to talk to my mom, she was in so much pain. I used to say to my grandmother: &quot;I don&apos;t want him to be glorified, I don&apos;t want all of this. I just want to have my father back.&quot;&apos; As she grew up, Darwish began observing the world around her with a more critical eye. She noticed the humiliations heaped on her mother as a woman without a husband. &apos;It really brought home the impossible situation that society - Arab society, Muslim society - puts on women who are by themselves.&apos; Even buying a car as a woman was fraught. In the 1950s very few Egyptian women drove cars. Everybody said, &quot;What kind of widow is this? Only loose women would do something like that.&quot; And I remember my mother really suffered from criticism like that. She would say: &quot;Isn&apos;t it enough that we lose our husbands? Now we can&apos;t handle our own lives?&quot;&apos; After leaving school, Darwish enrolled at the American University in Cairo. At the same time, the family hired a new maid. &apos;She was about 18 and I was about the same age. She came to us like every other maid, but my mother noticed her stomach was a little heavier than normal. She thought she was just fat at first and then she realised. This was horrific news. I had never heard of an out-of-wedlock pregnancy.&apos; Questioned by the women of the family, the truth was revealed. The maid had been raped by a previous employer. She was later sent to have the child at a government hospice for unmarried women. Sometime afterwards, Darwish discovered that she had vanished. Darwish&apos;s family were told by the agency that recruited the girl that: &apos;Her family had taken care of her disgrace.&apos; She had been murdered in an &apos;honour&apos; killing. There is a core of quiet anger that runs through Darwish like a pulse. Thirty years later, she has children of her own, including two daughters. They are indistinguishable from any other middle-class Californian teenagers. But it is a life she has never taken for granted, for herself or her children. As a young woman in Cairo, Darwish became a journalist with the Middle East News Agency and fell in love with a Coptic Christian, a religious group long persecuted in the Arab world. Her husband-to-be had to convert to Islam before the wedding could take place: &apos;Otherwise I would have been rejected by my family.&apos; Darwish was 30 when her in-laws emigrated en masse to the US and she and her husband decided to follow them to California. The couple subsequently divorced and Darwish had to support her family by going to work. She has since remarried, to an American man with whom she has a daughter. It is an unremarkable story for a divorced woman by Western standards, yet one that would have been impossible in the world she left behind. Her experiences are the ammunition for a powerful and sustained attack on the values of the Islamic world both on the lecture circuit and through her book, Now They Call Me Infidel, which is a bestseller in America. With its subtitle, &apos;Why I Renounced Jihad for America, Israel and the War on Terror&apos;, it has made Darwish one of the heroines of the Conservative Right. What raises her above the usual rhetoric of debate is the fact that she knows of what she speaks. On the subject of honour killings, she explains: &apos;It doesn&apos;t make sense in the West, but I can understand it. The honour of the man in the Middle East is so linked to the sexual purity of their wives and daughters. Society will shame you to death. This pressure does not exist in the West.&apos; Last year she was banned from the campus of Brown University, in Rhode Island, one of America&apos;s most prestigious academic institutions. The speaking invitation came jointly from a Jewish student group and the women&apos;s studies department, but was abruptly withdrawn, allegedly after pressure from Brown&apos;s Muslim chaplain, who claimed that Darwish had made anti-Islamic remarks and that her presence would be provocative. The university&apos;s female, Christian, chaplain backed the ban, although it was pointed out that she had promoted an earlier Palestinian solidarity week. The inevitable row catapulted the affair - and the book - into the headlines. Alarmed at the suggestion that they were gagging free speech, the authorities at Brown issued a fresh invitation. Darwish was allowed to return in February. Her message remained the same. Nonie Darwish has no time for Western liberal notions of moral equivalence when dealing with the constraints Islamic society places on women. When she swings a punch at the Arab world, the intention is always to deliver a knockout blow. &apos;I come from a culture that&apos;s very sensitive to criticism,&apos; she says. &apos;We were never brought up to look at what we had done to cause a particular problem. It&apos;s always about blaming others, saying, maybe it&apos;s the next-door neighbour who did it, or, no, it&apos;s the next town, or another country, or other religions. It&apos;s never, &quot;What have we done?&quot; or, &quot;What is our part in this tragedy?&quot; It&apos;s taboo. And if you do admit, &quot;We&apos;ve made a mistake and we are sorry for it&quot;, you become the bearer of the sin and everything will be thrown at you.&apos; Her mother is still alive and living in the suburbs of Cairo, but she is now too frail to travel to America and although very little publicity has been given to her activism in Egypt, Darwish is no longer sure that it would be safe to visit. She recently turned down an interview request from the Dubai satellite channel Al Arabiya: &apos;I didn&apos;t want my family in Egypt to be upset and I didn&apos;t want a fatwa against me.&apos; It has been over five years since mother and daughter last saw each other, when Darwish took her children to Egypt for the first time. &apos;I was amazed at how radical it had become. When I was at university women were wearing miniskirts. Nobody was covered from head to toe like they are now. Meanwhile there was the same old poverty, embezzlement. A lot of pollution, garbage around the Nile, flies everywhere, unemployment. Yet when I opened the Egyptian newspapers I didn&apos;t see any of this. Just America-bashing, blaming others, blaming the West.&apos; Returning to Los Angeles, the family spent much of the flight home discussing what they had just seen. &apos;I was very depressed. Every foreign man in Egypt is viewed as the CIA, every blonde woman a Zionist spy. There is always this conspiracy. All this anger.&apos; They arrived home on the evening of 10 September, 2001. &apos;I woke up the next morning, turned on the television and - lo and behold. Immediately I knew that this was the anger we had left behind.&apos; The leader of the 9/11 attacks was an Egyptian, Mohammed Atta. In America, Nonie Darwish has been compared with Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the Dutch MP who is another outspoken critic of conservative Islam, and Wafa Sultan, a Syrian-born psychiatrist also living in Los Angeles, who has accused modern Muslim clerics of perverting Islam. Darwish has much in common with Sultan in particular, whose fame is due to a televised debate seen by millions in the Arab world when she framed last year&apos;s battle over the Danish cartoons of Mohammed as &apos;a clash between civilisation and backwardness&apos;. Both are unexpected radicals, the kind of middle-aged, middle-class women you might expect to be more concerned about their next hair appointment or their children&apos;s college applications, and yet have become some of the most vehement and articulate critics of Islamic society. &apos;There are very few feminists in the Middle East,&apos; says Darwish. &apos;Unfortunately most of the Muslim women I hear speaking are the ones saying things like, &quot;We want Sharia law, we want the right to wear the veil,&quot; and defend polygamy. But Sharia law is the problem that any woman in the Middle East who wants to be liberated must face. You can&apos;t live alone - as a woman you must live with your husband or your parents. If you have sex out of wedlock you could go to prison. If you want to convert - become a Buddhist for example - you can go to jail for it. It is all a legal matter. You can actually go to court and, depending whether it is a moderate or extreme Muslim country, go to jail or be executed. When push comes to shove, Sharia law does not protect women. It&apos;s the stumbling block, it&apos;s what&apos;s making Islam impossible to change.&apos; She understands how the West must look to some in the Arab world. &apos;Muslim women look at the West and they get scared. All the rapes and murder. They see the problem of single women having children, living on government incomes, and it is not a pretty picture. Sure, there is a lot of pressure on the Western woman. She has to do everything - worker, mother, lover - and she really can&apos;t manage all of it. But they don&apos;t see the virtues of equal pay, respect for women, tackling sexual harassment at work. Yes, I know a lot of regular American folk who are struggling with their children. But they don&apos;t stab them with a kitchen knife.&apos; Finding her voice has, she says, been &apos;a gradual process&apos;, marked by pivotal moments such as the time her brother - who was injured when her father was killed - suffered a stroke. His life was saved by doctors at an Israeli hospital. She still remembers the respect and compassion the medical staff showed to all their patients, regardless of faith. Darwish converted to Christianity 10 years ago. Some of her supporters have argued that she would be a more effective voice if she had remained a Muslim: &apos;But I needed a spiritual life, I needed to be among a religious community that wants me to be a better person. I don&apos;t want to talk about how wonderful Mohammed was, how many battles he won. I was flipping channels on a Sunday morning and I saw this preacher who touched me. He was praying for the whole world, for humanity, for love and friendship. Your neighbour could be Japanese, or a Jew, or a Muslim. You should still love them. This is not a message I heard in mosques.&apos; But her principles have come at some personal cost. She misses the warmth and hospitality of ordinary Egyptians and a family she may never see again. Her face is increasingly familiar, both to her supporters and enemies. For better or worse, the quiet anonymity of suburban life may be a thing of the past. There is frantic yapping. Elvis, the family&apos;s Yorkshire Terrier puppy, races into the room. Darwish stands up to shoo him away, then instinctively begins to clear away the coffee cups. The activist takes a back seat as she notices the untouched slice of pumpkin pie. &apos;Are you sure you are not hungry?&apos; she says. &apos;Can I get you anything else to eat?&apos;", "tags": ["Islam", "Religion"], "title": "Life as an infidel", "sentences": ["She recently turned down an interview request from the Dubai satellite channel Al Arabiya: &apos;I didn&apos;t want my family in Egypt to be upset and I didn&apos;t want a fatwa against me.&apos; It has been over five years since mother and daughter last saw each other, when Darwish took her children to Egypt for the first time."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/13/islam.religion", "publicationDate": "2007-05-12T23:12:31Z"}, {"article": "These are interesting times in the killing fields of early-afternoon television. For the past few years, BBC 1 has owned the slot by screening a mathematically improbable number of episodes of Murder, She Wrote starring Angela Lansbury. Recently, ITV 1 has hit back, and hit back hard, with Midsomer Murders, starring John Nettles, cunningly scheduling each edition over two afternoons in the hope of generating carry-over. All of which has meant the traditional afternoon sports (snooker and bowls on BBC 2; horse racing on Channel 4) are threatened as never before. Magnificently, they&apos;ve responded to the threat by pretty much ignoring it. Channel 4&apos;s way of covering racing is as set in stone as Christmas lunch. They start by reviewing yesterday&apos;s racing today, which has a limited appeal, certainly compared to the ratings smash that would be tomorrow&apos;s racing today. They then methodically work their way through the card. Each race being covered in the following logical manner: Paddock, Ring, Track, Unsaddling Enclosure, Trophy Presentation. The last of which tends towards anticlimax, starring, more often than not, a middle manager from the Aviation Club of Dubai Duty Free presenting the Tradesman&apos;s Cup. All the action is broken up with adverts for seniors. It&apos;s not uncommon for a break to include separate selling pitches for bingo, dentures and stairlifts - which can depress the mood quicker than a busted yankee. Is there a bleaker punchline on telly at the moment than the current stairlift ad&apos;s &apos;I&apos;ll get back to my biscuits&apos; - delivered not with despair but optimism, biscuits being the highlight of the day and the getting back to them an act worthy of congratulation, even if the biscuits are no more likely to be going anywhere than the man stranded at the foot of the staircase without a stairlift. Perhaps that&apos;s the point. Back at the racing, while the format remains gloriously inert, the heat from the Lansbury/Nettles axis has provoked the idiot bigwigs into tinkering with the details. They did it in time-honoured TV fashion with a slice of plagiarism. Want to look modern and new? Then steal someone else&apos;s idea, in this case the makeover. This was overseen by a daft woman called Marietta from Dublin, who could exist only in a country that has more money than is good for it, and performed upon Mike Cattermole and Tanya Stevenson. Never have I seen sports presenters look so uncomfortable. They thought they&apos;d been employed to cover racing, but they found themselves having to feign interest as Marietta twittered: &apos;The three words you don&apos;t want in your wardrobe are traditional, boring and conservative.&apos; We&apos;d moved from cupboards being bare to wardrobes being full of words. Little wonder Cattermole looked confused. Little wonder Stevenson looked terrified as she was forced, on threat of instant dismissal one presumes, to wear a dress for the first time in 18 years. &apos;It&apos;ll make my mother&apos;s day. She&apos;ll think it&apos;s Christmas,&apos; she spat out before rushing back to the changing rooms to pore over her contract of employment. Finally, Sky broadcast their 1,000th game on Thursday.

The launch of the boat, HMS Astute, will take eight hours. There will be one or two sighs of relief because the submarine that brought its builder, BAE Systems, so much trouble in 2002 (shares fell from more than 300p to just over 100p when BAE was forced to admit a massive cost overrun) will have been launched at last. In fact, if the 8 June target is reached, it will have launched two months early. BAE was showing off the sub last week. Its vast bulk is impressive. So is the fact that a company can make a return on such a complicated programme, in which both specifications and ownership have constantly shifted; the contract has passed from Vickers to GEC Marconi to BAE via takeovers. BAE claims Astute, with its 540km of cabling, 7,200-tonne weight and 5,000 valves, represents an engineering challenge more complicated than America&apos;s space shuttle. The firm is not shy of doing battle in the US, which is a good thing given the other significant news last week: its \u00a32.1bn bid for Armor Group, maker of armour for the Humvee military vehicles now ubiquitous in Iraq. The deal itself received a mixed reaction. The shares were marked down on questions about the financing, which will come from a \u00a3750m share placing and internal resources swollen by BAE&apos;s sale in the autumn of its 20 per cent stake in Airbus - a transaction intended to help shift focus from Europe to the US. But analysts praised the strategy of focusing on a Pentagon &apos;sweet spot&apos; - troop protection. The deal, although expensive, propels BAE to equal first place with General Dynamics in this market when added to its past acquisitions of Alvis and United Defense Industries, maker of another US army workhorse, the Bradley fighting vehicle. If BAE gets the deal past US regulators, it claims it will immediately enhance profits, increase the share of group revenues from the US to 42 per cent, and bring future earnings from servicing and refitting. One analyst says: &apos;It&apos;s a perfectly good way of using its cash.&apos; The problem is that BAE is not flavour of the month in Washington. In January, the US formally protested to the British government about the abandonment at the end of last year of the Serious Fraud Office investigation into bribery allegations over the \u00a340bn al-Yamamah arms deal with Saudi Arabia and the sale of Eurofighters to the Saudis. The US government has also demonstrated its concern about foreign takeovers of sensitive US companies on national interest grounds, as Dubai-based DP World found out last year in its takeover of P&amp;O, when it was forced to sell off US assets. Opinion is divided on the seriousness of these factors. BAE points out that while DP World was a foreign business, the acquisition of Armor is being made by BAE Systems Inc, a fully American subsidiary with a &apos;shadow board&apos;, thereby fulfilling a requirement under US law to ensure sensitive US technology remains in US hands. Led by US citizen Walt Havenstein, BAE Systems Inc is now the sixth largest defence contractor in the US. As for the Saudi allegations, BAE maintains it has not broken the law and that it would not have launched the Armor deal without taking soundings about regulatory problems. However, there is only so much BAE could have learned on this. One senior industry figure says: &apos;I am sure they have got a sign from the Pentagon, but it would have been far harder to get a sounding from the Department of Justice, for example.&apos; Part of the difficulty is the spread of responsibility around government departments. The Department of Justice looks into anti-trust and criminal issues. A spokeswoman confirms that bribery allegations such as those made over al-Yamamah cannot be investigated under anti-trust laws. As for criminal activity - the SFO&apos;s investigation was a criminal one - a spokesman says this would be the responsibility of the US Treasury. The Treasury Secretary chairs the committee on foreign investment in the United States, which was the body most concerned with the DP World deal. The committee deals with national security, but a spokeswoman there would not comment on whether this might extend to corruption allegations. Experts believe the US government would have some explaining to do if it did block a deal, however. &apos;What would it say to Armor shareholders, who, given that this was an auction, have got the best price for their company?&apos; says one. And if it did block a deal - under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, for example - would that hamper contracts given to the rest of BAE&apos;s American operations? Much less easy to guess will be the reaction of the US Congress. Both houses have foreign affairs committees with members who may have reasons for making life difficult. If there is noise on Capitol Hill, it may affect the way the Bush administration - currently not seeking unnecessary fights with a hostile Congress - proceeds with the case. &apos;A rough ride in Congress is much more difficult to handle. It is unpredictable and one should never underestimate it,&apos; says one observer with knowledge of Washington&apos;s inner workings. Last week Congressional aides were briefed not only on the Saudi case, but on other continuing SFO investigations into bribery allegations in Tanzania, South Africa and elsewhere. These could cause problems and drag executives into hearings. This could feed back into attitudes at the White House and government departments. Whatever the outcome, the acquisition underlines BAE&apos;s westward drift. Last week, the company that owned Devonport dockyard, the refitting base for the UK&apos;s submarines, was sold to Babcock, the engineering firm that operates the Faslane submarine base and the Rosyth dockyard. BAE did not put in a bid. It also seems likely that BAE will soon place its shipbuilding business- three Clyde yards - into a separate joint venture with VT Group. It will hold a majority stake, but, for how much longer? If Astute rolls down the ramp on time next month, it will represent a successful turnaround both of a project and a company. It will also breathe new life into the debate about replacing the current Trident fleet. As things stand, those boats would most likely be built at Barrow. But whether BAE will own that facility by then has become a matter of considerably less certainty.", "tags": ["The BAE files", "Business", "US news", "Arms trade", "World news"], "title": "Congress stands by to torpedo BAE's deal", "sentences": ["The US government has also demonstrated its concern about foreign takeovers of sensitive US companies on national interest grounds, as Dubai-based DP World found out last year in its takeover of P&amp;O, when it was forced to sell off US assets."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/13/usnews.arms", "publicationDate": "2007-05-13T17:07:10Z"}, {"article": "Taliban insurgents suffered a grave loss when their top military commander, Mullah Dadullah - notorious for orchestrating massacres, beheadings and suicide bombings - was killed in fighting in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan, it was claimed yesterday. The Afghan interior ministry said Dadullah died fighting Afghan and Nato forces in Girishk district on Saturday. The one-legged strategist had been reported captured or killed before, but this time the authorities appeared certain. Nato also confirmed his death, saying it had dealt the insurgency &quot;a serious blow&quot;. Reporters from Reuters and other news agencies were shown his corpse in the governor&apos;s compound in Kandahar. The bearded face was splattered with blood, and he appeared to have suffered a head wound. The left leg was missing. Dadullah, known as Afghanistan&apos;s al-Zarqawi - after the feared al-Qaida chief in Iraq - was a member of the Taliban&apos;s 10-member leadership council and close to the movement&apos;s fugitive leader, the one-eyed Mullah Mohammad Omar. He was also the Taliban&apos;s leading public figure. In regular interviews with Pakistani, Afghan and Arab newspapers and television stations he boasted of training suicide bombers, executing suspected collaborators and beheading hostages. &quot;It&apos;s the biggest setback to the Taliban since they started resistance in 2001,&quot; said Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Peshawar-based journalist and expert on the Pashtun areas straddling the Pakistan-Afghan border where the Taliban operate. &quot;They can take revenge for the killing. There may be more reprisal attacks. But it is clear that for now, at least, there is no one who can replace him,&quot; Yusufzai said. &quot;He was an inspirational and daring commander.&quot; But Mustafa Alani, of the Dubai-based Gulf Research Centre, said the death would have little impact. &quot;In this sort of organisation, people are replaceable, and always there is a second layer, third layer. They will graduate to the leadership. Yes, it is a moral victory, but he&apos;s replaceable.&quot; Dadullah lost a leg fighting the Red Army in the 1980s. In the 1990s he orchestrated ethnic massacres during the Taliban&apos;s sweep to power. In recent years he has emerged as the top battlefield commander fighting western and Afghan government forces in the south. Analysts speculated that his media appearances - most recently in a boastful interview with Al Jazeera last month - may have compromised his security: some Taliban commanders had urged him to maintain a lower profile. He is the third top commander to have been captured or killed in the past six months. Mullah Akhtar Osmani was killed by a US airstrike in December while the former defence minister Mullah Obaidullah Akhund was captured by Pakistani security forces in March. Mullah Omar remains at large and Afghan officials have alleged he is hiding in the Pakistani city of Quetta. Pakistan&apos;s president, General Pervez Musharraf, says Omar is in Kandahar. The short-term gain of Dadullah&apos;s death may be offset by swelling anti-foreign sentiment in the south generated by a spate of civilian deaths caused by Nato forces. Nato and US warplanes targeting Taliban bases have also killed several hundred civilians including at least 21 people during an operation in Helmand last week. President Hamid Karzai has become sharply critical of the airstrikes and publicly pleaded with his allies to take greater care.", "tags": ["World news", "Afghanistan", "Afghanistan timeline", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Taliban's top military commander killed during fighting", "sentences": ["&quot;He was an inspirational and daring commander.&quot; But Mustafa Alani, of the Dubai-based Gulf Research Centre, said the death would have little impact."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/14/afghanistan.afghanistantimeline", "publicationDate": "2007-05-14T00:54:32Z"}, {"article": "Duncan Revie, son of former Leeds manager Don, has reiterated his desire to open takeover talks with Elland Road chairman Ken Bates. Revie, who declared his interest in Leeds last week, would doubtless be a popular choice among fans - under his father&apos;s 13-year tenure (1961-74) Leeds won the league twice, the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup twice and the FA Cup and League Cup once each. Revie, who heads football conventions company Soccerex, insists he would have no trouble raising the required funds as he is backed by the Dubai-based Maktoum family. &quot;We spoke to Duncan this morning and he can confirm the reports that he wants to sit down and start talks with Ken Bates,&quot; said Revie&apos;s spokesperson Faith Taylor. Former Chelsea chairman Bates was forced to call in the administrators before Leeds&apos; last Championship game of the season with debts of \u00a335m. The Inland Revenue had issued a winding-up order due to an unpaid bill of \u00a35m. But with the approval of administrators KPMG, the club were immediately sold to a newly-formed company, Leeds United Football Club Limited, of which Bates is a listed director. The sale is subject to the approval of the club&apos;s major creditors at a meeting later this month. The Football League must also approve the deal, while local property developer Simon Morris formally lodged his \u00a310m offer to buy Leeds with the administrators last week. Morris, recently named among the top 10 richest people under 30 in Britain with a fortune estimated at \u00a369m, announced plans for a further \u00a325m cash injection to bring financial stability to the club. The 29-year-old also proposes to develop land around Elland Road and build a new stadium as part of a \u00a3400m entertainment complex. Morris was the leading shareholder in the Yorkshire consortium, headed by former chairman Gerald Krasner, that was in charge at Elland Road for 10 months from March 2004. It has also been reported that other consortia are aiming to ambush Bates&apos; plans to resume control of the relegated club.

With Roland Garros barely two weeks away, it seems inconceivable, injury apart, that the brilliant young Spaniard will not successfully defend his title in Paris, particularly as Roger Federer, the world No1, is suffering from a crisis of self-doubt that was nowhere on the radar when he won his 10th grand-slam title in Melbourne at the beginning of the year. His third-round 6-2, 6-4 defeat by Italy&apos;s Filippo Volandri on Thursday was inept, with the Swiss seeming unable to raise his game against an inspired but essentially ordinary clay-court practitioner. The fallout, and this was an equal surprise, came when he dispensed with the services of his coach, Tony Roche, on Saturday. Federer has worked with the 61-year-old Australian, who coached Ivan Lendl and Pat Rafter, on a part-time basis since 2005. During their partnership Federer won six of his 10 grand-slam crowns and maintained his place on top of the world rankings. The speculation yesterday was he might try to hire another Australian, Darren Cahill, the former coach of Lleyton Hewitt and Andre Agassi. After winning the Australian Open, and his 47th career title in Dubai, Federer was twice beaten on the US hard courts by Guillermo Ca\u00f1as in the spring and was defeated with some ease by Nadal in the Monte Carlo Masters final. Federer had asked Roche to be with him throughout the European clay-court season but he will be in Hamburg from today on his own. After winning his first major at Wimbledon in 2003 under Peter Lundgren&apos;s guidance, now Britain&apos;s Davis Cup coach, Federer sacked the Swede less than six months later, so he is used to making abrupt decisions. He went on to lift three more majors in 2004 when he opted to go it alone. But the split is strangely timed, with Federer pressing to win the French Open to become only the third man, after the American Don Budge and Australian Rod Laver, to hold all four majors at the same time and also to become only the sixth player to win all four majors. Not that it seems likely that Federer or anyone else could currently beat Nadal. Gonz\u00e1lez, who knocked out Volandri on Saturday, believed he might have the solution. The Chilean reached this year&apos;s Australian Open final and, under the American coach Larry Stefanki, formerly with Tim Henman, has added control to his immense hitting and serving. It was essential Gonz\u00e1lez did everything as near to perfection in order to sow a little self-doubt in the mind of Nadal. Instead he immediately dropped his serve and never properly found his rhythm after that. Few manage to find the comfort zone against Nadal, who hits the ball with such fierce spin that it rears up off the court like a spitting cobra. The only time Nadal showed any consternation was when he inadvertently hit a return into the crowd, smacking a spectator in the face. He went over to see if she was all right and was warmly applauded. Thereafter all the pain belonged to Gonz\u00e1lez.", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "Rafael Nadal"], "title": "Tennis", "sentences": ["After winning the Australian Open, and his 47th career title in Dubai, Federer was twice beaten on the US hard courts by Guillermo Ca\u00f1as in the spring and was defeated with some ease by Nadal in the Monte Carlo Masters final."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/14/tennis.sport", "publicationDate": "2007-05-14T22:55:46Z"}, {"article": "Today, shareholders are converging in London and The Hague for Shell&apos;s annual general meeting. As investors hobnob in the Champagne Suite of the Hammersmith Novotel, those working in the oilfields that the company seeks to control are ready to strike over an oil law that Shell has helped to craft. The focus is the culmination of four years campaigning by the Iraqi Federation of Oil Unions (IFOU). Demands range from bread and butter issues such as land allocation, unpaid wages, holidays, health and safety and full-time status for temporary workers, to wider political issues which have been the founding bedrock of the union: protection of Iraq&apos;s oil wealth from foreign companies and a say in the future of the oil industry. Shell is one of the companies that the union has cautioned against entering Iraq &quot;under the guise of so-called production sharing agreements&quot;. Yet Shell has had a say and a proposed stake in the future of Iraq&apos;s oil industry for as long as the union has been organising. Whereas the demands of the union have been ignored, Shell, through doors blown open by the war and occupation, has accessed government decision makers and lobbyists on a regular basis. Shell has been positioning itself to sign long-term exclusive contracts with the Iraqi government for the past four years. Ever since Shell misled investors over its reserves to the tune of 4bn barrels, it has been seeking replacement reserves. With 115bn barrels of proven reserves, occupied Iraq is where the prize still ultimately lies. February saw the Iraqi cabinet approve a controversial hydrocarbon law. The law will grant foreign companies the dominant role in developing Iraq&apos;s reserves. If approved by parliament, foreign companies will have access to the largest reserves open to private control on the planet. Neighbouring Saudi Arabia and Iran (first and second in the world oil-wealth stakes) do not have production-sharing agreements, the type of contract that the oil law proposes. They use technical service agreements, or buyback contracts, that leave decision-making powers including development, rates of production and extraction, to the state. Private oil companies there act as contractors rather than controllers. The current Iraqi oil law will allow foreign companies to control production, with potentially unlimited profits in Iraq&apos;s undeveloped fields - accounting for two-thirds of Iraq&apos;s known reserves. This is to be done by production-sharing agreements - defined by critics as a form of privatisation by stealth. Under production-sharing agreements, foreign companies will put capital upfront to explore for oil and shoulder the risk if none is to be found or it is difficult to extract. Iraq, however, is home to some of the easiest oil to access. Known as &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; by the industry, extraction costs range from $1-$1.50 per barrel. Under terms to be agreed by contract, the state would then relinquish a fixed percentage of profit to oil companies for a period of up to 30 years. The terms and conditions agreed in 2007 - under conditions of war and occupation - could last a generation until 2037, with virtually no opportunity to renegotiate. Companies like Shell would expect concessions to offset the risks of working in a dangerous country like Iraq. Risk, as with all capital ventures, presents opportunity. The risk represented by massacres in Haditha and Fallujah, the car bombings and terror on the streets of Baghdad, military air raids, sieges, walls of separation, kidnappings and assassinations all figures into the balance sheets of companies like Shell. Shell was a key player in moulding the current oil law. Shell representatives, along with those of eight other oil majors, the US and UK governments and the International Monetary Fund, saw the law just weeks after it was written in July 2006. It would be eight months before the law would be presented to Iraqi MPs. Shell commented upon and influenced the law throughout its drafting process. Since July 2006, the British government has worked earnestly to influence the law, repeatedly consulting with Shell on the type of contracts it would like to obtain. Through the oil industry lobby organisation International Taxation and Investment Centre, Shell - along with six other major oil companies - has been pressuring the Iraqi government to grant long-term contracts that would give them exclusive rights to extract Iraq&apos;s oil. The British government, through the Foreign Office, has been helping, delivering a report strongly advocating production-sharing agreements to the Iraqi government. Shell&apos;s involvement in shaping domestic economic policy in Iraq stretches back to March 2003. Just days before the bombing of Baghdad, senior Shell managers met at 10 Downing Street to insist that Iraq&apos;s oil should benefit not just US companies, but European companies too. A month later, 100 workers activists from the Southern Oil Company formed the Southern Oil Company Union, with the explicit aim of securing workers rights and defending Iraq&apos;s oil from privatisation. American companies were shown the door by the union when they tried to work in the fields. The Union faced down British soldiers in protests over three months of unpaid wages and won. Membership leapt from 100 to 3,000. From February to September 2003, former Shell CEO Philip Carroll worked with the coalition provisional authority on plans to restructure the Iraqi oil industry. Meanwhile, Iraqi oil workers embarked on a reconstruction effort - rebuilding drilling rigs, pipelines and refining and port equipment. Union leaders also deconstructed Bremer&apos;s order 30 wage table - arguing that Iraqi oil workers needed more than the occupation set minimum wage of 69,000 Iraqi Dinar (approximately \u00a330 per month). After threatening to shut down exports, the union succeeded in eliminating the last two categories of the wage table and won a new minimum rate in the oil sector of 102,000ID (\u00a345) per month. Membership and confidence swelled. In 2004, Shell hired a Dubai-based exploration and production executive to act as its &quot;country chairman&quot; for Iraq - the most senior overseas post in the business. To assist the new chairman, Shell sought an Iraq lobbyist, advertising for &quot;a person of Iraqi extraction with strong family connections and an insight into the network of families of significance within Iraq&quot;. In the same year, workplace elections were held in the Maysan, Basra and Dhi Qar provinces, creating the General Union of Oil Employees (GUOE). Candidates with strong connections and credentials among the workforce were chosen to lead in nine oil and gas companies. The establishment of the GUOE significantly strengthened networks of influence and organisation for working people in the southern oil sector and their communities. Union membership now stands at 26,000 across four governorates in the south. So the view of a black goldrush that may have glittered from The Hague and London just got hazier. The organisational strength of the IFOU could be a major spanner in the works of Shell&apos;s lobbying and legal mechanisms. The IFOU has repeatedly warned companies like Shell to keep out of Iraq&apos;s oil fields. Union president Hassan Jumaa recently said of the strike: &quot;The federation calls on all unions in the world to support our demands and to put pressure on governments and the oil companies not to enter the Iraqi oil fields.&quot; Questions will be asked both inside Shell&apos;s AGM and outside, through a peaceful protest, about the ethics of its policies in Iraq. Likewise, through the efforts of Iraqi unions, the debate in Iraq will expand on who really does have the right to control Iraq&apos;s oil. Who will decide the fate of the resource that accounts for 95% of government revenue? And who should have a say in the future of Iraq&apos;s economy - Shell or the people of Iraq?", "tags": ["Iraq", "Oil", "Trade unions", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Profits and loss", "sentences": ["In 2004, Shell hired a Dubai-based exploration and production executive to act as its &quot;country chairman&quot; for Iraq - the most senior overseas post in the business."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/15/profitsandloss", "publicationDate": "2007-05-15T13:30:00Z"}, {"article": "Roger Federer has rarely looked as subdued as he did yesterday. In his first match since splitting with his coach Tony Roche the Swiss did not serve well, was uncertain with the timing of his ground strokes and appeared at an emotional low as he struggled to survive in the Masters Series event against Juan Monaco, an Argentinian who has only just broken into the top 50. In his longest spell without winning a title since he became world No1 three years ago Federer had to save five break points in the final set of his unconvincing 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 victory. His form remains conspicuously moderate in what is now his last tournament before the French Open but this time at least there were plenty of valid excuses. The temperature had dropped, the tennis balls were uncomfortably heavy and rain noisily pummelled the roof, which meant it was an achievement that Federer was prepared to lower his sights and scrap just to get through. Asked if it had felt different without Roche, Federer answered obliquely: &quot;I just focused on the match and got the game plan right,&quot; he said. &quot;And tried to get used to the conditions. They are totally different and the good signs are that I really focused on how to play and how to adjust. That was not always the case last week.&quot; This suggested that the parting may have affected him but he was narrowing his mind to the present. Federer nevertheless surprised many by asserting that four defeats in four tournaments had nothing to do with the decision to part with the affable Australian, other than provide time for him to think about making it. The real reason - lack of communication - had, he claimed, been brewing for longer. &quot;It sounds simple but you get into a routine and we started never having much contact and it was never like that at the start,&quot; Federer said. &quot;Maybe always after two and a half years you think this relationship needs more, and then it&apos;s too late to change it.&quot; The moment of parting had been emotional. Federer said he was sad and Roche surprised, although a moral plus had been that he managed it face to face, unlike his split from Peter Lundgren in 2003, which he had done with a phone call. Federer has apparently not thought about a replacement, nor will he have one for either the French Open or Wimbledon, because &quot;I am not that kind of person to go from one to the next&quot;. He said: &quot;I try my best till the end and then I go from there.

I don&apos;t really understand what a website is&quot;. The trial may well take a while to complete. Thursday May 17 Where was I?Janet Street Porter seems to have had a small memory lapse about where she&apos;s worked. In an interview in Word magazine she says: &quot;When I got the job as editor of the Sunday Independent I went into the office on the first day - they&apos;d just sacked the previous editor two hours before and someone said to me: &apos;Word of advice when you walk in - one third will adore you and think you&apos;re great and love the idea of you coming. Another third you can persuade through sheer force of personality and they&apos;ll end up tolerating you and there&apos;ll be one third that fucking hate your guts now the trick is not to bother with them. Life is too short.&apos;&quot; All good advice, Monkey is assured. But Janet, wasn&apos;t it the Independent on Sunday, not the Sunday Independent?

Dubbed The Apprentice meets Big Brother meets Dragon&apos;s Den it features the dashing Dragons&apos; Den star Peter Jones as he helps six budding entrepreneurs as they battle it out to become ...

They range from a woman who insists on calling herself Elizabeth &quot;Make it Happen&quot; Hackford - even though her last company went into liquidation - to a 17-year-old called Tom Thurlow who wants to set up a teenage newspaper. They&apos;re certainly not lacking in confidence. At today&apos;s press launch, Tom tried to persuade the assembled hacks their papers should include copies of his paper, Snap News. When The Sun&apos;s Colin Robertson asked him if was able to run off 3m copies, Tom said without a blink: &quot;Let me have a word with Peter, we might be able to do that&quot;. Monkey - and Peter Jones&apos;s - favourite so far though is Iain Morgan. Iain has the rights to import a radio controlled mini-helicopter. He demonstrated it at today&apos;s launch. And of course, it crashed. Straight into Peter&apos;s feet. However Iain recovered well and by the end of the morning had rapt hacks buzzing the chopper around the room, as demonstrated by Colin. Grade expectationsMichael Grade seemed to quite enjoy bantering with shareholders at his first ITV annual general meeting today. Whether that&apos;s the case next year - when he realises many of them ask the same tedious question every time - remains to be seen. For now, though, he seemed happy to take questions about violence on TV, the scheduling of Coronation Street on ITV2 and the screening of films around the news. One investor complained about Space 1999 being shown on ITV4, only to be told: &quot;Careful, my uncle made that show.&quot; Another shareholder teased Grade about the recent relegation of Charlton Athletic, where he is a board director. &quot;As a Palace fan,&quot; said Colin from Croydon, &quot;I look forward to seeing you at Selhurst Park next season.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s an intrusion into private grief,&quot; quipped Grade. &quot;Anyway, seriously ...&quot; continued Colin. &quot;But it IS serious,&quot; Grade rejoined. Friends reunitedIt&apos;s not every day you get to meet an old friend, even if you don&apos;t recognise them. One question for Michael Grade at ITV&apos;s AGM - about the company&apos;s \u00a3285m pension deficit, as it happened - came from John Howard, a former employee at London Weekend Television. &quot;I used to be a colleague of yours,&quot; he announced. &quot;Where did you work?&quot; asked Grade. &quot;In programmes.&quot; &quot;Did you work for me?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; Still a blank face. Then as Grade shielded his eyes from the house lights, all became clear. &quot;Oh, it&apos;s John! We worked in next-door offices. He used to keep my programme budgets in line when I was at LWT.&quot; Stock answersEccentric gripes aside, what shareholders really want from Michael Grade is not better drama at 9pm or good news on the contract rights renewal front - they want to see the share price go up. Since ITV plc launched on the stock exchange in February 2004 and the price touched 148p, the stock has been in the doldrums, even spending last summer below the 100p mark. It has now edged up to around 120p, presumably as Grade&apos;s chairmanship gathers momentum, but it&apos;s still below the 135p Sky bought at in November - and nowhere near 148p. When the 148p figure was brought up by one wistful investor, Grade scanned the room hopefully. &quot;If anyone&apos;s prepared to make us a formal bid we will give you a formal response,&quot; he joked. Later, when another shareholder said the share price ought to go to 225p, he affected an auctioneer&apos;s pose: &quot;Any advance on 225p?&quot; As things stand, it&apos;s safe to say he&apos;s pretty unlikely ever to get to say those words for real.

Mair is in suitably apologetic mood in today&apos;s email, which - remarkably - turned up today. &quot;This is being written more in hope than expectation.

Monday May 14 Tricky position held for 24-hour newsSun deputy political editor Andrew Porter found himself in a sticky position on BBC News 24 last night while discussing the first week of Gordon Brown&apos;s campaign for the Labour leadership. Asked to comment on Tory assertions that yesterday&apos;s Sunday Times&apos; splash story - &quot;Brown to build five eco towns&quot; - was a conveniently-spun rehashing of an announcement made last year by a housing minister, Porter looked worried. The Sunday Times story was written by his old mate and colleague, the political editor David Cracknell. Yet the story was clearly an old one. And Porter now works for the Sunday Times&apos; News International stablemate Sun. Covering himself perfectly, he admitted that it was an old announcement ... but that Brown had put &quot;flesh on the bones&quot; of the existing plan. Perfectly handled, Andrew.

Showbiz entranceSpare a thought for News of the World showbiz guru Rav Singh and the People&apos;s Lee Harpin. The two Tottenham fans rarely get to watch a match live, the Saturday afternoon kick-off times sitting uncomfortably with Sunday paper deadlines. So you can imagine they jumped at the chance to watch last Thursday evening&apos;s game between Spurs and Blackburn Rovers. Alas, the pair caught the wrong train from Liverpool Street station and instead of going to Tottenham&apos;s White Hart Lane ground they ended up on the fast service to Bishop&apos;s Stortford, some 30 miles away. Monkey hears they got back in time to watch the second half. Evans audience lossAmid all the acclaim for BBC radio&apos;s record-busting ratings last week, the audience for one of its best-known DJs somehow slipped through the net. Double Sony-award-winning Chris Evans had an audience of 4.81 million for his Radio 2 drivetime show. Impressive stuff, but around 200,000 fewer than the 5 million who used to listen to the man he controversially replaced, Johnnie Walker, in the first three months of last year. Straw in the windDespite her pearls-and-cashmere image, Sunday Telegraph editor Patience Wheatcroftrecently ran a nudge-nudge story about Jack Straw. This could have regrettable repercussions if two things tipped as likely last week actually occur: (a) Wheatcroft replaces Robert Thomson at the Times, and (b) Straw replaces John Reid as home secretary. Let us hope, if that scenario is realised, that Times hacks won&apos;t be treated as pariahs by the Home Office and any juicy leaks will not be automatically given to other papers.

Not content with its &quot;Make our rail stations safe&quot; campaign, Veronica Wadley&apos;s paper has been busy crusading with its &quot;Seat for every commuter&quot; campaign, a &quot;real food&quot; campaign and let&apos;s not forget, the &quot;Evening Standard save our small shops&quot; campaign. The Standard claimed victory in its commuter campaign, even though the promised new train carriages will not be built until 2014. A campaign to clean up London&apos;s streets, barely visible under piles of free papers, including the Standard&apos;s sister freesheet, London Lite, is presumably out of the question.

In a television interview broadcast, General Musharraf said he would not allow Ms Bhutto or his other rival, Nawaz Sharif, to return from exile before parliamentary polls scheduled for the end of the year. &quot;No, they will not be returning before elections,&quot; he said. Speculation has been rife in recent months over a deal between General Musharraf and Ms Bhutto, who fled Pakistan in 1999 trailed by corruption allegations. In return for an amnesty from prosecution, Ms Bhutto - who controls Pakistan&apos;s most powerful party, the PPP - has offered to share power with the general. But following last weekend&apos;s violence in Karachi, where General Musharraf&apos;s supporters rampaged through the city shooting dozens of rivals, Ms Bhutto has ruled out cohabitation - for now. &quot;With 42 people dead, I cannot envisage such a thing at this moment,&quot; Ms Bhutto, who divides her time between London and Dubai, told the Christian Science Monitor. The strong statements appear to close off another possible exit for General Musharraf from the crisis triggered by his attempt to sack the chief justice of the supreme court, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, in March. The judge&apos;s stubborn refusal to resign - the first senior civilian to defy General Musharraf since he seized power in 1999 - triggered a political earthquake. Since then Mr Chaudhry has led a spirited campaign for reinstatement and become an unlikely unifier of the notoriously fractious opposition. Pro-Chaudhry rallies have drawn huge crowds across the country, most recently in Lahore, the heartland of military rule. Opposition parties spanning secular liberals and Islamist clerics have rallied behind him with the exception of the MQM, a Karachi-based party with a history of thuggery. Faced with the greatest political challenge of his career General Musharraf has appeared increasingly authoritarian and the crisis has taken some sinister twists. Last weekend in Karachi a 15,000-strong force of police and army conspicuously failed to intervene as armed MQM gangs blocked roads and shot the chief justice&apos;s supporters. On Monday, Hamad Raza, a senior supreme court official close to Mr Chaudhry, was shot dead in his Islamabad home by unknown assailants. His widow said she suspected political motives. Yesterday Shakil Turabi, the editor of a local news agency, said he was dragged from his car in Islamabad and beaten by men who accused him of &quot;writing against the government&quot;. Mr Turabi said he suspected they were intelligence agents. Asma Jahangir, a leading human rights activist, said: &quot;The real face of President Musharraf is beginning to show. The so-called &apos;enlightened moderation&apos; is peeling off and the ugly face is coming through.&quot; But General Musharraf can still count on some powerful allies, most notably the US government, which has given Pakistan $10bn (\u00a35bn) since 2001 in exchange for help in hunting down al-Qaida militants. On Wednesday a US state department spokesman reiterated the Bush administration&apos;s support for General Musharraf. &quot;I don&apos;t think our assessment has fundamentally changed,&quot; he said.", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "Benazir Bhutto", "Middle East and North Africa", "Pervez Musharraf"], "title": "Musharraf bans political rivals from elections", "sentences": ["&quot;With 42 people dead, I cannot envisage such a thing at this moment,&quot; Ms Bhutto, who divides her time between London and Dubai, told the Christian Science Monitor."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/18/pakistan.benazirbhutto", "publicationDate": "2007-05-18T15:36:57Z"}, {"article": "France&apos;s new president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is prepared to take a radical approach to solving the problems of plane-maker Airbus, including selling his government&apos;s stake in its parent company, EADS.

On a whistlestop tour to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse yesterday, Mr Sarkozy said: &quot;The state will do its task if there is a need for a capital increase, with the aim of one day putting the state&apos;s stake on the market. The aim is not a partial privatisation.&quot; The French state holds 15% of EADS, the French company Lagard\u00e8re owns 7.5% and Germany&apos;s Daimler has 15%. The balance between the French and German shareholdings is reflected in a Franco-German management structure, which critics have said works to the detriment of EADS and Airbus. &quot;It is obvious that, when running a team, it is best to have a chief who is clearly designated and recognised by all,&quot; Laurence Parisot, the head of the French employers&apos; organisation, Medef, said yesterday. Airbus has been hit by production delays to its A380 super jumbo and its A350 XWB aircraft is struggling for sales in the face of fierce competition from the rival Boeing 787 &quot;dreamliner&quot; and the weakness of the dollar against the euro.

His loyalty will not be tested any further, however, after the Sheikh yesterday confirmed to Peter Chapple-Hyam, Authorized&apos;s trainer, that he will allow him to take the ride at Epsom. The Sheikh is as eager to add a Derby to Godolphin&apos;s list of achievements as Dettori is to fill the one significant gap in his career record. He is a sportsman too, though, who can see beyond his own self-interest, and must appreciate that Dettori, who is now 36, may never have a better chance to win the greatest Classic. &quot;It&apos;s very kind of His Highness to let me off,&quot; said Dettori, who admitted to an early dose of nerves. &quot;Of course I&apos;m very pleased, but it&apos;s going to be a long two weeks.&quot; Dettori will now be as much of a story in the run-up to the Derby as the horse he will ride. As far as the general public is concerned, he has been the face of Flat racing for the last 15 years, a status that was confirmed when he went through the seven-race card at Ascot&apos;s Festival meeting in September 2006. He has long since adopted a shrug of the shoulders and an &quot;if it happens, it happens&quot; approach to questions about his losing streak in the Derby, which currently stands at 14. He was beaten a length on Tamure in 1994, having led inside the final furlong, and has twice finished third, but his beaten favourites in the race include Cape Verdi in 1998 and the great Dubai Millennium a year later, whose eight-race career was otherwise unblemished. To be seen as a great jockey, or indeed to consider yourself one, it is necessary to win a Derby. Unlike the Grand National, a 40-runner handicap in which luck plays a huge part, it is a level-weights championship event in which the best horse usually wins. As a top-class jockey for nearly two decades, and with maybe half a dozen more chances ahead of him, Dettori should really have won one by now and his flying dismount will be on every front page on Sunday June 3 if he can lay the curse. Dettori&apos;s booking for the hot favourite, who trounced a useful field, will also guarantee huge support for Authorized, who is a 6-4 chance at the moment but could easily be even-money or shorter by the day of the race. &quot;For the last few years, with Kieren Fallon having so much success in the race, people had started to speculate about his ride in the Derby as much as they did about Frankie&apos;s,&quot; Simon Clare, of Coral bookmakers, said yesterday. &quot;But this year it will be all about Frankie, who is so well known and respected among those punters who only ever bet on the National and the Derby. The Derby is the second-biggest betting race of the year in any case and Authorized would have attracted plenty of support whoever was in the saddle, but when you throw in the Frankie factor, he could be one of the best-backed Derby favourites for decades.&quot; While Dettori is now a hot favourite to ride his first Derby winner, though, yesterday&apos;s news could yet have a knock-on effect for his deputy at Godolphin, Kerrin McEvoy. McEvoy is currently booked to ride Salford Mill, the second-favourite, but Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, confirmed yesterday that &quot;if Godolphin have a runner in the Derby, then Kerrin McEvoy will definitely ride&quot;. Dettori may even be entertaining dreams of a Classic double at Epsom after Measured Tempo&apos;s comfortable success in the Swettenham Stud Fillies&apos; Trial at Newbury yesterday. She is unchanged at 8-1 for the Oaks with totesport, with Passage Of Time favourite at 9-4. Less triumphant was Jalil, a $9.7m purchase by Godolphin, who was beaten for the second time in two starts, being outpaced close home. Ron Cox&apos;s tip of the day Yossi 3.00 Newmarket One of only two maidens in the field, Yossi should be able to get off the mark. Supported ahead of his reappearance run, he was outpaced by Spice Route - but that looks decent form in view of the winner&apos;s victory off a mark of 87 at York this week. Yossi gets in here on a mark of 82 and has a useful fitness advantage over his main rival Philanthropy, who is likely to relish this stamina test.", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Frankie Dettori", "The Derby"], "title": "Horse Racing: Dettori delighted to land plum Derby ride", "sentences": ["He was beaten a length on Tamure in 1994, having led inside the final furlong, and has twice finished third, but his beaten favourites in the race include Cape Verdi in 1998 and the great Dubai Millennium a year later, whose eight-race career was otherwise unblemished."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/19/horseracing.sport4", "publicationDate": "2007-05-19T00:00:59Z"}, {"article": "Senior editorial figures in Rupert Murdoch&apos;s media empire are accustomed to travelling between New York and London. Earlier this year, New York Post editor Colin Myler, a Brit, moved back from London to take charge of the News of the World. Nearly a decade earlier, Sun editor David Yelland was recalled from the same title to take up the post. But the next transatlantic traffic could well be in the other direction. Last week, Murdoch met with Sunday Telegraph editor Patience Wheatcroft, the former Times business editor whom he rates highly, in New York. Also present were Times business editor James Harding and his editor Robert Thomson. The purpose of the meeting is a closely guarded secret, but senior industry sources say Thomson is being lined up to edit the Wall Street Journal should Murdoch succeed in his audacious bid to acquire its parent company Dow Jones. Wheatcroft would return as editor of the Times, the paper she left last year, although her current bosses, Telegraph proprietors David and Frederick Barclay, would fight hard to keep her. Harding, a former Financial Times Washington correspondent, is likely to be handed a senior role at the Journal or at the Times. None of those appointments are set in stone, not least because the WSJ remains in the hands of the Bancroft family, which holds special Dow Jones shares that allow it to block a sale. But Murdoch has been wooing the Bancrofts vociferously, lavishing praise on their stewardship of the title even as he turns rival shareholders against them. It provides further evidence, if any were needed, that Murdoch&apos;s deal-making prowess has not deserted him as he enters his 77th year. Last year, BSkyB, which is 39 per cent owned by News Corp, shocked the City by buying a stake in ITV to prevent cable competitor Virgin Media from taking it over. The deal was engineered by his son James, Sky&apos;s CEO, but it bore all the hallmarks of his father&apos;s instinct to bet big when protecting his market dominance, or when entering new ones. On Wall Street, Dow Jones investors have called on management to give serious consideration to Murdoch&apos;s $60-per-share offer, which values the company at around $5bn. That pressure is likely to intensify if the paper&apos;s fortunes do not rapidly improve. Murdoch covets the Journal because, along with the FT, it is one of a handful of papers with global reach and growth prospects. But as a champion of free-market values, the title also has intellectual clout on the right, and owning it would place Murdoch closer to the centre of power on the other side of the Atlantic. In that sense, the Journal deal, like others he has struck, serves Murdoch&apos;s commercial as well as his political ends. The Journal makes a modest profit, according to industry sources. Circulation has grown to 2.6 million since it began its global expansion drive, although that figure includes nearly 790,000 subscribers who pay for access to its internet site. It could make far more, but costs are high and profit margins low, partly because of the number of journalists on the payroll. The Bancrofts want to preserve the paper&apos;s reputation for quality journalism, which could shorten the chances of Murdoch buying it. But the fact that four-way discussions have taken place between Murdoch, Wheatcroft, Thomson and Harding may be an indication that the News Corp chairman is confident his bid will succeed. If he does take possession of the 118-year old title, the Fleet Street pack would be reshuffled once more. Sunday Times editor John Witherow, the longest-serving Murdoch editor by far, is unlikely to feature in any shake-up. Sun editor Rebekah Wade was also in New York to meet Murdoch last week, but she is thought to have gone there to discuss budgets at the end of the financial year. There is speculation that job cuts could be announced at News International as early as this week. Although there has been speculation over the past few years that Wade may one day succeed Les Hinton as News International chairman, she is happy where she is, say News International sources. If Murdoch&apos;s British competitors hope his focus will shift towards the US and away from the UK, where the first pillars of his media empire were erected, they are likely to be disappointed. A recent conversation between a national newspaper editor and a senior News Corp executive illustrates the extent of his power. When, the former asked, will Murdoch stop subsidising thelondonpaper, the freesheet that is eating into the Evening Standard&apos;s sales? The editors at Murdoch&apos;s paid-for titles have been ordered to cut costs and axe jobs to subsidise the title&apos;s losses, and are said to be privately furious about it, he added. Thelondonpaper is thought to be losing tens of millions a year, but - as the executive retorted - &apos;\u00a320m is nothing to Murdoch&apos;. He is also investing around \u00a3600m on state-of-the-art presses for his British papers, despite falling circulation at his flagship titles. They will allow the company to use colour on every page, an innovation advertisers have long demanded. The investment is a vote of confidence in print at a time when Murdoch&apos;s $580m acquisition of website MySpace has restored his reputation as a visionary blessed with a unique ability to divine which way the media tides are turning. At a recently convened company summit to discuss online strategy, News Corp executives mulled how best to safeguard their assets in the internet era. The Times is expanding its online presence and launched a US edition. Tomorrow it launches a Gulf edition that will be printed in Dubai. Murdoch is busy applying the MySpace model to other parts of his media empire; the Sky News website has been relaunched recently, with more user-generated content. He recognises that News Corp must adapt to new patterns of consumer behaviour or face a lingering death. Although he wasn&apos;t the first media mogul to grasp the implications of the internet, he is perhaps the best-placed to make up for lost time. Meanwhile, back in Britain, BSkyB is trading blows, with Virgin Media. On the face of it, that is a fight which has little to do with the WSJ, or Murdoch&apos;s other interests. But this week, Trade Secretary Alistair Darling is expected to decide whether Sky&apos;s acquisition of a 17.9 per cent stake in ITV, acquired last year to prevent Virgin Media from buying it, should be referred to the Competition Commission. Darling is one of Gordon Brown&apos;s closest allies, and a near certainty to replace him as Chancellor. Will the next Prime Minister risk taking on Murdoch, and losing the support of his papers? He may have little choice, if only because the OFT has recommended the deal is referred, and ministers rarely ignore its advice, but it would be surprising if it wasn&apos;t a factor. The internet may be the coming medium, but newspapers still have their uses. Rupert&apos;s empire Rupert Murdoch first established a foothold in America in 1973 , when he bought the San Antonio Express-News. He launched supermarket tabloid The Star several years later, but gained a greater public profile with his 1976 purchase of the New York Post). Under his ownership, the liberal-leaning paper shifted to the right, and adopted a more hectoring tone, once running the immortal front-page splash: &apos;Headless Body in Topless Bar&apos;. It is the only American newspaper still in his hands, but adding the Wall Street Journal would be a coup for the man who became a US citizen principally so he could buy more media assets in the country. Murdoch&apos;s American strategy has mirrored his British plans, as he moved into broadcasting while adding to his newspaper empire only infrequently. He bankrolls the influential but lossmaking The Weekly Standard, the neo-Cons&apos; house journal. But the majority of News Corp&apos;s sprawling US empire is broadcast-based. It owns 20th Century Fox film studio and cable channels FX and Fox Sports. Fox News revolutionised TV news when it was launched in the 1990s, challenging the dominance of CNN, by offering viewers racier coverage that is rarely as &apos;fair and balanced&apos; as its motto suggests. Murdoch laboured for years to establish a US equivalent of his BSkyB satellite operation, eventually buying DirecTV from General Motors after several failed attempts. He ceded control of the network earlier this year to rival John Malone, the founder of the American cable industry, in exchange for Malone&apos;s stake in News Corp. Murdoch was criticised for failing to grasp the internet&apos;s likely impact, and News Corp&apos;s share price plummeted on worries about the future of his old media companies. But he has since been widely praised for buying social networking website MySpace. News Corp&apos;s shares have outperformed its media industry rivals, and that could help him fund the acquisition of the Journal.", "tags": ["Media", "Newspapers & magazines", "Business", "Rupert Murdoch", "US press and publishing"], "title": "Murdoch gets ready to reshuffle his pack", "sentences": ["Tomorrow it launches a Gulf edition that will be printed in Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/20/pressandpublishing.business1", "publicationDate": "2007-05-20T09:38:00Z"}, {"article": "England, eight for none in their second innings, are leading by 124; Monty took six wickets.

Read this?   7th over: England 12-0 (Strauss 10 Cook 1) Did I find anything hlaf-way edible? Does cigarette smoke count? So, can England find their way to a winning position from here? The way Plunkett and Harmison bowled in the first innings, you&apos;d have to doubt it. For the moment they&apos;ll just be trying to score runs as quickly as possible so as they can be, say, 350 runs ahead at the end of the day and then hope Monty can reproduce his magical spell of yesterday over the last three sessions of the game. Incidentally, Sky thinks that Monty has just become the first spinner to take five lbws in an innings in the history of Test cricket. Strauss has slung a brace of twos over his shoulder after this over, much like they were a pair of partridges after a morning&apos;s shooting. One of them was out cover way, the other down to fine leg.   8th over: England 14-0 (Strauss 10 Cook 1) The marvellously named Cliff Challenger wants to know: &quot;At a time when we seem to have at least two Asian cricketers in each England team, where are all the English cricketers of African/Caribbean origin? Not so long ago there was always a promising black British cricketer in the side, now the only ones who can trace their roots to Africa are Strauss and KP. OK, it&apos;s a rhetorical question - they are the ones who are playing football now.&quot; Indeed... though there are still a few out round the counties like Alex Tudor and um, Devon Malcolm. No you&apos;re right, they&apos;re all going into football. Two runs come from this over, one a leg bye that eluded a subsequent lbw appeal.   9th over: England 22-0 (Strauss 18 Cook 1) Dropped him! Strauss&apos;s bat gets a little tickle on the ball as he tries to haul it out of the way of a ball outside off stump, it&apos;s path deviates downwards too quickly for Ramdin to drop back down into a crouch and take the catch. It was a tough chance. Later, Strauss cuts a four behind point so Powell responds by bouncing him and jutting his jaw in the general direction of the stumps. That raises Strauss&apos;s hackles and he swishes a drive through extra cover for four more.   10th over: England 23-0 (Strauss 18 Cook 2) &quot;Is Monty&apos;s five lbw&apos;s the start of something truly bizarre: batsmen expecting an English spinner to turn it extravagently and being bamboozled when it doesn&apos;t turn at all? Sure makes a difference from the last 15 years...&quot; joshes Jack Lee. Indeed it does, the glory days of Salisbury, Such, Grayson, Loudon, Snape, Dawson, Schofield, Swann, Illingworth, and any of the many others you&apos;d care to mention (Martyn Ball anyone?) do seem to be long behind us. Especially with the outstandingly talented Adil Rashid making such rapid progress up at Yorkshire: England could well have a dual finger spin / wrist spin attack by next summer, and a devastating pair they&apos;d be too, at least the equal of Edmonds and Emburey, if not Laker and Lock.   11th over: England 25-0 (Strauss 18 Cook 3) Powell beats Strauss with an away-swinger, and then almost has him caught at slip with a similar delivery, though he was spared by his soft hands.   12th over: England 27-0 (Strauss 20 Cook 3) Strauss knocks two down to fine leg. There are some pigeons over long behind the press box. And a red bus. Well, it works for Henry Blofeld doesn&apos;t it? Though I&apos;ve no idea how...  13th over: England 33-0 (Strauss 22 Cook 8) Sarwan&apos;s sitting a little defensively here, perhaps planning to keep the run rate down and, through doing so, take time out of the game at the same time as increasing the pressure on the batsmen in an effort to provoke a hasty shot. Cook pushes four runs away down the hill, his first boundary of the day.   WICKET! Strauss 22 c Morton b Collymore (14th over: England 35-1)  I&apos;ll perhaps have a chance to rue my words about Gloucestershire of earlier today - though I won&apos;t repent them - seeing as they&apos;re taking on dear old Somerset in a one-dayer. But I doubt it, seeing as they&apos;re all out for 259 and we have Trescothick, Langer and Cameron White to bat. Ho ho ho. In any cricket ground, you never far away from somebody moaning about the run rate: &quot;While over-confidence now would probably be a bad idea - since we have seen that the West Indies can bat (against our &apos;attack&apos;) surely the current slow grind should be replaced by something a little more calculatedly aggresive - run rate of 2.5 when you&apos;re trying to build a total quickly? We do have seven decent batsmen after all and can afford to lose a few wickets.&quot; Well, Alexander Higgs, you should be a little happier now: Strauss has gone, undone by a neat nipping delivery from Collymore that snicked off his outside edge as he attempted a straight drive, and flew on towards the slips, where Runako Morton tumbled down and took the catch. He goes for yet another flashy 30-odd (ok, you have to extend &apos;odd&apos; eight runs either way for that to work) and Owais Shah has the second chance that could yet decode how his Test career pans out...  15th over: England 47-1 (Cook 20 Shah 0) Powell drops back a length and Cook cuts him firmly away for four with an authoritarian flourish. He gets four altogether streakier runs as he tries to leave a ball but rather ends up playing the perfect late cut, which sends the ball away fine. So that&apos;s as many runs in two balls as he&apos;d managed in the previous 14 overs. In fact, by the time teh over has ended Cook has skwiffed a genuine edge through now-vacant first slip for yet another four, and Powell is understandably miffed about conceding 12 from such a good over.   WICKET! Shah 4 c Ramdin b Collymore (16th over: England 51-2) &quot;You don&apos;t run for those&quot; intones Michael Holding as Shah gets off zero with an off-drive that whistles past the bowler and away for four. Ah oh dear, I think Owais Shah may just have ended his own Test career. He&apos;s out, gone, despondant, and with Vaughan due back in the team next week the best he can hope for is to hold onto his place as the first reserve. What a shocking match for Shah, if an unlucky one. The ball darted off his inside edge and richocheted off his thigh up into the air, and Ramdin stepped across to take the catch down the leg side. Shah set off on a run, and then, as the finger went up, just changed direction and made for the pavilion.   17th over: England 56-2 (Cook 20 Pietersen 4) Bravo comes on to bowl to KP, and the batsman has the best of their first encounter by biffing the ball through long-on for four. On replay, I&apos;m not sure the ball that got Shah out had anything to do with his thigh at all, but rather it just flicked his finger and looped up in the air. It was a good ball, one that straightened up and climbed high.   18th over: England 61-2 (Cook 23 Pietersen 6) The batsmen swap singles. Englands lead is now up to 174. Cook adds two more onto that, a single from the fifth and, well, I&apos;m contemplating having a nap.   19th over: England 62-2 (Cook 23 Pietersen 6) I open my eyes in time to see Cook take one run to the leg side. I can&apos;t help it, this is just the ultimate moment to take a nap: post lunch on a slow sunday afternoon, while everyone&apos;s waiting on the declaration. Oh look, it&apos;s drinks, I know what I&apos;ll be doing these next three minutes...   20th over: England 67-2 (Cook 27 Pietersen 6) Jerome Taylor has come on and been scythed away for four past backward square leg by Cook. Places that I&apos;ve learnt are also working on a Sunday: &quot;Beg to differ with James Lorrigan. Libya also has the weekend on Friday andSaturday...........but I&apos;ve been working so hard that I haven&apos;t had time to tune in to the cricket (cries of disbelief)&quot; that from Geoff Grant; &quot;Your Bangladesh correspondent is not the only one to work on a Sunday. Here in Dubai, Sunday is the first day of the week, too.&quot; That from Tim Morrisson, who adds: &quot;And I have the soliution for England&apos;s bowling weakness: I played (left handed) in the Dads v sons match here yesterday, to be clean bowled by my 8 year old&apos;s vicious seam attack. He&apos;ll be ready to open the bowling for England in 2020.&quot; while finally Patrick O&apos;Brien points out that: &quot;Israel has its weekend on a Friday and Saturday.&quot; All of which filled up this over rather nicely, no? (If not amusingly). Shame I didn&apos;t get time to describe the two jaffas that Taylor bowled to end it.  21st over: England 67-2 (Cook 27 Pietersen 6) As Cook plays out a maiden from Bravo, it might be a pertinent time to print this: &quot;If England are to try and force a declaration surely it would have made sense to push Cook down the order as he seems very one paced.&quot; Well, Brendan Mc Keating, it was never really going to happen was it? Batting order changes seem to have been out of vogue with the England team for a while now. Still, however Cook hit 200 in a day for Essex against Australia in 2005 baffles the hell out of me.  22nd over: England 72-2 (Cook 34 Pietersen 7) KP takes one. Cook then plays a shot that makes you forgive all his blocking, a sumptuous left-hander&apos;s cut for four that would be a study for Phidias etc etc   23rd over: England 80-2 (Cook 37 Pietersen 13) A quick flick of the binoculars around to Twickenham and I can tell you that Wasps are leading Leicester 8-6 in the 28th minutes of the Heineken Cup Final. While I&apos;m not looking Cook seems to have picked up three runs. KP then dirves a brisk crisp four out through extra-cover for four. Lawrence Dallaglio has just put in a try-saving tackle in the far corner to stop Leicester regaining the lead.   24th over: England 84-2 (Cook 41 Pietersen 13) As if to verify the slight tiredness of this period of play, Strauss is sat on the balcony engrossed in a newspaper - it is not the Guardian. While he&apos;s not looking Cook has flicked a gorgeous drive out through sqaure cover for another four runs, which takes England&apos;s lead to exactly 200.   25th over: England 84-2 (Cook 41 Pietersen 13) A missive from a fellow member of the international brotherhood of beleagured Sunday sport journalists: &quot;I&apos;m in Beijing and I&apos;m working - and I&apos;ve got to wait for the World Taekwondo Championships to end before I can go home, obviously. Cruelly, the air conditioning in my office isn&apos;t on so I&apos;m sweating as profusely as England&apos;s fast bowling coaches - I fear editing 30cms on the finer arts of beating people up is going to give me a few ideas...&quot; Charlie Gidney, I&apos;d say &apos;I feel your pain&apos; but I think that the meaning might get misinterpreted given what you&apos;ve got planned for later on. This one was a maiden.   26th over: England 91-2 (Cook 47 Pietersen 13) When Stuart Wilson pops into my inbox with: &quot;I presume that you have had chance to check the Somerset score? Maybe your Ho Ho Ho&apos;s of earlier are sticking a little in your throat?&quot; I immediately flick over to the scorecard and see: Somerset 26 for two (Trescothick caught for 11 off Carl Greenidge! Langer caught off Anthony Ireland for 5? What the frick is going on?) and my ho ho hos do indeed turn into hurgh hurgh hurghs as I choke on my own smug laughter. Still, Somerset have one KP waiting to come in (Keith Parsons) and there&apos;s always Ian Blackwell.... Back at Lord&apos;s Cook has clipped a leg glance away for four down the slope. And at Twickenham Wasps are 13-9 up in the 40th minute.  27th over: England 94-2 (Cook 47 Pietersen 15) Oh bloody hell. Cameron White has been bowled by Ireland for 10 and Somerset&apos;s much vaunted (by me) top three has been routed for a combined total of 26 runs. Who knew the commentators curse could work from such long distance? Maybe I should put in a quick word about how well Pakistan are getting on in some place called the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, where they are 199 for three off just 30 overs against Pakistan. In the previous match of that series Shahid Afridi took 78 off 34 balls, what we&apos;d give to see KP do domething similar this afternoon.... back at Lord&apos;s Chris Gayle has come on, and given up two runs to KP off a thick inside edge through mid-wicket.   28th over: England 97-2 (Cook 49 Pietersen 17) Somerset are now 37 for four. I can&apos;t believe they&apos;ve picked Keith Parsons again. Sorry, I know this if of interest only to me and a handful of other deluded cider-drinkers.   29th over: England 101-2 (Cook 50 Pietersen 19) Cook nudges one run out past gully and brings up his fourth Test fifty. What an absolutely phenomenal player he is, a real prodigy who looks set to go and break records for English run-scoring. It&apos;s not his game, but his brain that makes him the player he is. KP guide the ball away behind point to bring up a bundle of other things that merit polite applause at the cricket ground - the fifty partnership and the team&apos;s 100.  30th over: England 104-2 (Cook 51 Pietersen 20) Depressed journalists of the world use this place like a seedy saw-dust bar where they can regale us with sorry tales of life on the grind as a hack in far flung places. It&apos;s great. Here&apos;s Dean Williams: &quot;Just to regurgitate the banter about the weekends. I&apos;m sitting in the newsroom of the Gulf Daily News in Bahrain, where our week has just begun, and watching the cricket on the telly. Of course no one else in the office seems to give a toss about the cricket. No wait I think someone&apos;s getting up and wandering over to it. &quot;Test match cricket is so boring&quot;...is all the old hack can mutter before going back to his piece, which is probably about the travails of making that perfect Arabian quilt.&quot; Gah! Bet the old codger wasn&apos;t saying that in 2005, mumble mumble, git.   31st over: England 104-2 (Cook 51 Pietersen 20) &quot;I swear&quot; begins Shahril Hamdan, &quot;I saw Andrew Strauss reading the Sun. That can&apos;t be good! I wonder what the newspaper-reading composition is in the England side. They cant all be Sunnies surely?&quot; Well Saj Mahmood obvious;y writes for the Guardian. Ahem. So he obviously reads us. Ahem ahem. Excuse me, I&apos;ve just got a tickle in my throat all of a sudden. I think Ian Bell started writing for us too this week, ahem ahah ahem ahem. But yes, Strauss was reading the Sun. You could just see the shadow of a schoolboy smile flicker across his face as he turned over the front page for a first look inside....  32nd over: England 105-2 (Cook 51 Pietersen 20) Blimey, a quick peep at the rugby - don&apos;t worry, we&apos;re getting more ad libbed crowd comments from Bumble - reveals that Wasps are 19-9 up on Leicester in the fiftieth minute. I&apos;d love to stay and describe it to you, but, sadly, it&apos;s tea and I really have to find some food this time around. See you shortly.

It&apos;s &quot;aspirational&quot;. Aspirational is used constantly in debates about tactics, usually to justify editorial expenditure or to defend bits of a magazine that nobody actually reads. It indicates that the readers are wealthier and more sophisticated than may actually be the case, and gives the editor something to boast about at dinner parties. The publishing houses who have built their business on aspiration don&apos;t as a rule use the word. Cond\u00e9 Nast has just launched Portfolio in the United States, while Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9&apos;s pan-European Monocle is on its third issue over here. Each in their different way is hoping to sell luxury advertising by proposing the idea of a new kind of person. This, in itself, is very aspirational. Just as earlier business magazines were for dotcom entrepreneurs or asset strippers, Portfolio seems to have hedge fund managers and private equity partners in its cross hairs. It has pinned a large photography budget on the hope that it can persuade these seriously wealthy men to cooperate in features if it portrays them as rounded, soulful individuals with lovely wives and surprising depth. Its cover depicts Manhattan as a city of gold. Dick Whittington would have snapped it up. Monocle, which styles itself as &quot;a briefing on global affairs, business, culture and design&quot;, has a bicycle wheel on its third cover, which is brave. Monocle is presumably the magazine for Thomas Friedman&apos;s flattening world. It has a piece about the Toto lavatory factory in Japan. Its fashion feature has the editor of a Dutch style magazine cycling to work. It has lots of pictures, none of them all that remarkable. A mere flick through it leaves you as puzzled as Bill Murray in Lost In Translation. Monocle proposes the idea of a new generation of free-spirited young professionals, who work at the interface of design and technology, and operate across national borders. I know people like that but I don&apos;t know many of them, and Monocle doesn&apos;t have the raw appeal to human nature that might make it tempting for people who just want to be in that group. Actually, what Monocle should be is a TV programme. Portfolio, on the other hand and in a quite different way, does have that raw appeal. The drumbeat here is envy. It knows that the rich are only interested in those who are richer, which is why one of its features goes inside Sheikh Maktoum&apos;s racing operation in Dubai, and it knows that most of the people who&apos;ll actually pay for a copy at the newsstand will spend their time looking at the ad that shows the private jet delivering dad in the nick of time to his daughter&apos;s soccer match and think that could be me - if only I could escape from bought ledger. Portfolio may have a shout, even in this platform-neutral day and age, because although there may be websites with upmarket visitors, there&apos;s still no such thing as an upmarket website. The web is its own environment and you navigate it with your finger on the mouse, happy in the knowledge that one click can take you away from wherever you are. Portfolio, a classic glossy, provides a different and seductive experience, one that can&apos;t be reduced to a bunch of information needs. It has a high-gawp factor. Witness the picture feature about the military hardware currently selling very well to the US government. It&apos;s full of long pieces that nobody will read and little boxy things that everybody will. It&apos;s a world of its own: a night in a posh hotel, dinner at an expensive restaurant, a borrowed key to the executive washroom. Nobody in the world actually needs it except the advertisers. They need to keep planting the desire for faster laptops, better Blackberrys, higher yielding investments and cooler trainers. In truth, these battles are all about the advertising. It&apos;s these precious, bloodily acquired pages that determine the environment, make the magazine feel expensive, attract the photographers and models, focus the proposition, breed the confidence, elevate the editorial and pay for the vast team. It&apos;s a high-stakes game because there&apos;s no cutting back on luxury. But if it works everybody gets to travel business class. \u00b7 David Hepworth is editorial director of Development Hell Ltd", "tags": ["Media"], "title": "David Hepworth on what makes magazines tick", "sentences": ["It knows that the rich are only interested in those who are richer, which is why one of its features goes inside Sheikh Maktoum&apos;s racing operation in Dubai, and it knows that most of the people who&apos;ll actually pay for a copy at the newsstand will spend their time looking at the ad that shows the private jet delivering dad in the nick of time to his daughter&apos;s soccer match and think that could be me - if only I could escape from bought ledger."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/21/mondaymediasection13", "publicationDate": "2007-05-21T06:16:46Z"}, {"article": "Who are the people who compose the Daily Mail&apos;s legendary audience of Middle Englanders? This question is raised in today&apos;s Independent because the Mail&apos;s owner, Associated Newspapers, is trying to overcome negative perceptions about the paper and its readers. To that end - as media guardian&apos;s Chris Tryhorn reported two months ago - the company has launched a website and made a documentary film which is now being shown to advertising and PR companies as part of a so-called charm offensive. According to the film&apos;s presenter, Martin Deeson - GQ columnist, Loaded founder and Mail on Sunday contributor - we have to see Mail readers in a new light. They are not Hyacinth Buckets and Victor Meldrews. Instead, they are iPod-listening early adopters, who take their holidays in Dubai and like to watch Desperate Housewives on their LCD screen, having recorded it earlier on their PVR. Of course, that characterisation is just as misleading as the Bucket-Meldrew stereotype. But I was much taken with a point made by Associated&apos;s marketing director, Linda Grant: &quot;Whenever you asked people to define the Mail brands they would reference Middle England, and when you asked them to define Middle England they referenced the Mail brands. It was a bit like Hoovers and vacuum cleaners.&quot; That reads absolutely true to me. And that is a central reason for the Mail&apos;s sales success. For a newspaper to become synonymous with a whole section of society - despite it being a largely mythical construct - is a major plus. (In different ways, the Financial Times and The Guardian have achieved a similar feat, as did the 1950s Daily Mirror and the 1980s Sun). But, of course, the Mail/Middle England linkage has been portrayed by the rest of the media in largely pejorative terms. As Grant concedes, the most pervasive caricature casts the paper and its readers as &quot;old-fashioned, bigoted and narrow-minded.&quot; So the Mail is now trying to change the perception of Middle Englanders/Mail readers. It has even dared to come up with a new name for Middle England, the clumsy formulation of Modern MidBritain. That&apos;s where the new website enters the picture. It&apos;s a fascinating place to visit, worthy of Richard Littlejohn&apos;s reactionary satire. We learn that the population of Modern MidBritain is 27,409,733 (some 47% of Britain&apos;s total), and - if the pictures mean anything - apparently includes Asians but not Afro-Caribbeans. Evidently, Modern MidBritain is &quot;a mindset&quot; and &quot;Modern MidBritains are engaged, respectful and like to make a difference. They are not passive passengers; on the contrary, they really aspire to get the most out of life.&quot; The Indy article, courtesy of an interview with Grant, tells us more about them. For example, two-thirds of them fall within one of five demographic groups: &quot;wealthy executives&quot;, &quot;affluent greys&quot;, &quot;flourishing families&quot;, &quot;secure families&quot;, and &quot;settled suburbia&quot;. (See Acorn, which promotes itself as &quot;the leading geodemographic tool&quot;, for further explanation of those groups). Anyway, the central point appears to be that the Mail readership is more diverse, more up-to-date (including more web-savvy) and even more rebellious than many critics have argued. What&apos;s so interesting is that this rebranding initiative is aimed at ad agencies, implying that the Mail - despite doing so much better than tabloid rivals at attracting display advertising - feels the need to hold on to its current advertisers and win back deserters. I have a feeling that the paper&apos;s executives have become aware that media buyers have been unduly influenced by the negative connotations of the Middle England &quot;badge&quot;. In some ways the problem of the Mail being inextricably linked to an ageing conservative audience echoes the great misconception about the bulk of the Daily Telegraph&apos;s readers being retired colonels. Newspapers have to go on renewing themselves, promoting a youthful image without alienating their core audience. It&apos;s a difficult trick and the Mail is to be congratulated for being pro-active well before signs of the kind of circulation desperation affecting other titles. But Modern MidBritains?

The purchase, though substantial in its own right, is likely to be only the starting point of a $200bn foray into world stock markets and private companies by the communist government in Beijing.

But before you do so, you pass mile after mile of signs marking the location of what will soon be known as Dubailand. Once completed, this will be the world&apos;s largest theme park, twice the size of Florida&apos;s Disney World. Scheduled to open between 2015 and 2018, it aims to be the centrepiece of Dubai&apos;s tourism infrastructure, attracting up to 200,000 visitors a day. Already, a replica Taj Mahal and Eiffel Tower stand awkwardly in the desert. Dubai Holding, which is building the mega-project, says that at 278 sq km it will include the world&apos;s largest shopping mall, the world&apos;s largest observation wheel, 29 sq km of themed worlds, including &quot;Women&apos;s World&quot;, and 75 sq km of &quot;Eco-tourism World&quot;, including a safari park, a vast sporting complex and a snowdome six times bigger than Ski Dubai - the emirate&apos;s existing 25-storey skiing centre, where around 30 tonnes of snow are created each night as chilled water is sprayed from 21 snow-makers attached to the roof. Yet, according to last year&apos;s United Nations report Global Deserts Outlook, the United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is a part, is now one of the most &quot;water-imperilled&quot; nations in the world, while also one of the most water-hungry. Undaunted, Dubailand will have nearly 30,000 rooms spread across 31 hotels to accommodate its visitors, including one called Asia-Asia, which, with 6,500 rooms, will become the world&apos;s largest hotel. Dubai is unchallenged, it seems, in claiming the world record for the largest number of &quot;world&apos;s largest&quot; building projects. Nowhere else on Earth - not even in China - is anything being built on this scale. I want to see what is on offer for tourists today, not just tomorrow, in this small emirate whose bold vision is to become a major world destination. Dubai not only has some of the highest average room prices anywhere in the world, with most of the accommodation on offer to tourists classified as luxury, but it also has one of the highest occupancy rates as 6 million people a year visit, including Britons on weekend breaks. As one airline executive tells me, &quot;Ten years ago, travelling from the UK to Dubai was considered long haul, but today we call it the &apos;long short-haul&apos;. A seven-hour journey 10 years ago was pretty much the limit, but now people think 14 hours is the mental limit.&quot; A new six-runway airport is under construction, its name a clue to its ambition: Dubai World Central International airport. Given Dubai&apos;s reputation for luxury, it is fitting that my &quot;room&quot; for the night is at the Burj al-Arab, the dhow-shaped building that has come to define its location as much as Sydney&apos;s Opera House or Bilbao&apos;s Guggenheim museum. Many claim this to be the world&apos;s most expensive hotel, with prices ranging from $1,000-$28,000 a night. I say &quot;room&quot;, but the Burj al-Arab, which sits on its own artificial island, doesn&apos;t actually have any single rooms. It offers &quot;duplexes&quot; - suites that extend over two floors. And I must add that I am a guest of the hotel - few journalists could afford afternoon tea here, let alone the cost of a duplex. From my ceiling-to-floor window on the 34th floor I can see for many miles. Out at sea on the horizon, huge arcs of sand are being sprayed into the air from dredgers; in time these will form the islands of The World - 300 artificial islands that together will form a map of the planet when seen from the air. Investors can buy an island, say &quot;Great Britain&quot; or &quot;Iceland&quot;, for around $10m and then build what they want there. Meanwhile another sea development, Palm Jumeirah, the vast palm-shaped network of artificial islands off the coast, has already become a further defining symbol of Dubai. It will be dwarfed by Palm Deira, which in turn will be dwarfed by Palm Jebel Ali, which will itself quickly be dwarfed by the proposed Dubai Waterfront project, a 75 km [47-mile] waterway lined with various developments whose landmark will be Al Burj, one of three buildings currently under construction in Dubai vying for the title of World&apos;s Tallest Building. There are moments when I feel as if I am being lured into a cult, such is the self-belief in Dubai. Once my eyes have adjusted to the surfaces of gold, mosaic, marble or mirror that seem to embellish every surface of my Burj al-Arab duplex, I begin to notice details such as the 13-option pillow menu and a personal-butler service that includes, for the eye-watering fee of 2,500 UAE dirhams (about \u00a3350), the option of having a scented-oil-filled bath run for you, with caviar and champagne left beside the pile of pressed towels. Dubai is famous for its service culture: it is one of the things that always rates highly in visitor surveys. Hotel staff can even appear on the beach, asking if you need your sunglasses wiped. But how does the emirate afford to employ its vast army of service staff, from the cleaners and waiters through to the chefs and pool attendants? And what of the even larger number of construction workers who are busy building some of the other parts of Dubai&apos;s swelling tourist infrastructure? The subject is a burr on the emirate&apos;s highly polished gold. An hour&apos;s drive into an area of Dubai that is about as far off the tourist map as it is possible to get brings us to Sonapur, an unhappy place in so many ways. Even its name cruelly teases its residents. The name of Dubai&apos;s largest labour camp means &quot;city of gold&quot; in Hindi, and it also sounds very similar to the local slang word for a female orgasm, as Khaled, my translator, seems to rejoice in telling me. I doubt that most of the 150,000 male workers who live here (some claim it is as many as 500,000, but there is little official headcounting going on), smile at the irony of living in a place so empty of wealth and women. As we pass the large cemetery on the road into Sonapur, a long convoy of buses heads in the opposite direction towards the hundreds of building sites across Dubai. Curtains screening the workers from the sun flap violently in the open windows as drivers move up through the gears, spewing a dirty diesel puff at every shift. On entering the huge settlement - &quot;town&quot; doesn&apos;t seem the right term as there&apos;s no sign of cinemas, libraries, restaurants, or even any landscaping - we pass block upon block of concrete walls, some topped with barbed wire and all fronted by large metal gates. Inside, Khaled says, are housing units, some of which are home for up to 500 workers, owned by the dozens of contractors that feed Dubai&apos;s construction boom. In a room in the compound we perch rather tentatively on the bed to talk to three of the workers, friends who live together, sharing a room with five others. Rahmatula, an Afghan in his late 20s whose pumice-rough hands are in sharp contrast to his disarmingly soft green eyes, gives me a picture of his typical day. It starts, he says, at 5.30am when he quickly gets up and, without having breakfast, boards a bus. By six he is at the building site, where hundreds of luxury villas are being constructed, and immediately starts moving bricks by hand. &quot;I have 15 minutes for my lunch &apos;hour&apos;,&quot; he says. &quot;I always eat roti bread with vegetable curry made the night before, which I bring with me.&quot; He says that he&apos;s not allowed to stop again, even if he&apos;s hot and needs water. If he does, pay will be deducted from his salary. &quot;I&apos;ve been working here for five years and my salary is now 800 dirhams [\u00a3110] a month, but with overtime I get it up to 1,100. I send home 600 dirhams a month,&quot; he says with evident pride. I can&apos;t help looking at his sweat-stained shirt and thinking of the bath-and-caviar service at the Burj al-Arab. It would take Rahmatula more than three months of picking up bricks, I calculate, to earn enough money to pay for such a bath. And his friends have similar tales to tell. He finishes work about 5pm and gets back to the compound about six, due to the traffic. After a shower and a rest, he eats his dinner at nine, goes to pray, and is in bed by ten o&apos;clock. This is his life for six days a week: he gets Friday off work, but spends much of the day cleaning clothes or cooking. &apos;It&apos;s like a prison sentence, I suppose,&quot; he says. &quot;I haven&apos;t seen my wife for five years, but I&apos;m going home to Khost [a region on the Afghan-Pakistan border] next month.&quot; His emerald eyes moisten at the thought. We step back out into the heat and walk down one of the long alleyways that divide the housing units. Clothes hang drying from lines attached to every available eave. The men show me a bathroom with a long line of open-sided baths and, further along, a filthy kitchen with more than 20 gas stoves but no refrigerators. Khaled says that he&apos;s been to other camps in Sonapur with even worse conditions. At some, workers are prevented from cooking their own food and are made to pay for a canteen service, which they complain is overpriced and of highly questionable quality and hygiene. In neighbouring camps the workers have to pay for water and electricity and regularly complain about restrictions: in some extreme cases, the owners switch on the services for only an hour a day. In Dubai, where as a tourist you rarely part company with air conditioning, be it in the car, the mall, the hotel or the restaurant, it is easy to forget that not everyone can take it for granted. It is also easy to forget that Dubai today - and tomorrow - simply would not exist without these workers, nor would the hotels, pools, shopping malls and holiday homes that the millions of tourists who visit Dubai each year all enjoy. Beneath the alluring veneer lies something altogether more uncomfortable. The travel industry still clings to the convenient myth that the good ship Tourism brings economic bounty to all who sail in her. And it is still making some other extraordinary claims - that, for example, tourism nurtures world peace, love and understanding. Yet there seems to be little evidence that tourists and those who serve them engage with each other on a balanced, harmonious footing. Instead, the bounty is carved up between a select few, while far too many of the industry&apos;s workers, particularly in developing nations, are no more than wage-slaves scratching out a pitiful living. And there is plenty of evidence that many locals have been displaced to make way for tourists, often at considerable cost to the local environment. Tourism generally appears to be a one-sided transaction whereby the buyer - the tourist - comes off much the better from the deal than the sellers at the destination. The application of the same ruthless, often exploitative business logic and practices to tourism that are employed in other sectors seems to be one of the key problems. Lord Marshall, the former chairman of British Airways, got it right when he said that tourism is &quot;essentially the renting out for short-term lets of other people&apos;s environments, whether that is a coastline, a city, a mountain range or a rainforest&quot;. What of the destinations? Surely they bear significant responsibility for the plight they find themselves in? A cocktail of political ineptitude and developer greed seems to have been served up at far too many tourist resorts across the world, leading to mistakes being repeated time and again. Many places - from Cancun to Costa Blanca, Thailand to Ibiza - say that water supply has become one of their biggest concerns now that they rely so heavily on tourism. And the cause is always the same: unplanned, rapid overdevelopment. Many are now so desperate to cling on to the business they have that they are resorting to ever-more-desperate short-term measures that can only exacerbate their plight. So we now see helicopters being used in the Alps to ferry snow to pistes melting under the pressures of climate change. Likewise, marine scientists in Australia are proposing the &quot;hosing down&quot; of vulnerable parts of the Great Barrier Reef during periods of high temperatures, as well as the building of floating pontoons to provide shade, all to protect the corals from being damaged from bleaching as a result of climate change. From what I have seen during my travels to investigate the effects of the tourist industry, the concept of tourism &quot;hubs&quot; or &quot;clusters&quot; seems to offer the best model for reducing the risk to the environment and offering a sustainable future for a resident community, due to the simple fact that the impact is concentrated in one relatively small area. Both Benidorm and Cancun appeared to have adopted this model early on. But the discipline required to resist over development was lost somewhere along the way. It is the creep of tourism that appears to lead to the most damage: in Spain it is the green carpet of golf courses and villas now spreading in concentric circles from the main beaches of the costas that are creating the greatest pressures on water supply, not the towers of Benidorm. One of the best remedies being offered to relieve the symptoms of this pressure seems to be quotas. The communities living in the shadows of the Taj Mahal and Machu Picchu have long urged a cap on visitor numbers to help limit damage. Nearly everywhere I went, the local community expressed the desire to see fewer tourists paying more for their visit. Quality, not quantity.  \u00b7 The Final Call by Leo Hickman is published on June 4 by Eden Project Books in association with Guardian Books at \u00a312.99.

Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the UN&apos;s nuclear watchdog, told a news conference in Luxembourg. &quot;In other words, three to eight years from now.&quot;  He said the agency had seen no evidence that Iran was trying to &quot;weaponise&quot; nuclear material, or of undeclared nuclear facilities in the country.  Last week Mr ElBaradei angered the US, Britain and France by saying the western strategy of denying Iran enrichment capability was obsolete because the country already had it. He added that world powers should focus on capping Iran&apos;s enrichment short of &quot;industrial scale&quot;, at a level he felt would pose minimal risk of yielding atomic bombs. His latest remarks came with the US about to start a drive for a third round of sanctions against Iran. In a statement at the White House, the president, George Bush, said: &quot;My view is that we need to strengthen our sanctions regime.&quot; Leaders of Iran &quot;continue to be defiant as to the demands of the free world&quot;, he said, adding that he had directed the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, to work with European countries to develop further sanctions. Mr Bush called Iran&apos;s detention of four American-Iranians &quot;unacceptable&quot;. Meanwhile the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was reported as saying he would push ahead with Iran&apos;s nuclear programme, ruling out any suspension. &quot;If we stop for a while, they [Iran&apos;s enemies] will achieve their goals,&quot; he said, according to state television.  &quot;The enemy wants Iran to surrender so it won&apos;t have any say in the world. The aim of the enemies in thwarting Iran&apos;s exploitation of peaceful nuclear technology is not based on any technical reasons. They want to hit at the source of the regime&apos;s progress.&quot; The US ambassador to the UN, Zalmay Khalilzad, said Washington was considering further steps against Tehran. &quot;What we have done so far is not enough. More needs to be done,&quot; he said. &quot;The time has come to look at additional pressure ... to bring about a change in Iranian calculations.&quot; France today backed the US on the need for new sanctions, but China and Russia - which have significant economic ties to Iran - are likely to drag their feet. Germany has also expressed reservations about further sanctions. The Bush administration is expected to push for mandatory travel bans on specific government officials, further bans on dealings with Iranian companies and banks, and new sanctions against companies associated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. For now, arms imports from Iran are banned, while a ban on weapons exports is under consideration. Work on a new resolution is expected to start after a meeting between Ali Larijani, Iran&apos;s chief nuclear negotiator, and the EU&apos;s foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, at the G8 summit in Germany early next month. Iran is already feeling the strain from a tightening of the economic noose. US measures are driving up prices in the country, which yesterday announced it would introduce petrol rationing to ease the government burden of providing subsidised petrol. &quot;The sanctions imposed by the US, especially in the past year, have been more harmful than we expected,&quot; Saeed Laylaz, a prominent political and economic analyst in Tehran, told the Associated Press. &quot;The main impact is that all of our imported goods have become more expensive.&quot;  While US firms already are banned from doing business with Iran, Washington is putting pressure on non-US businesses to sever ties as well. International banks have cut back operations in Iran in recent months under threat that their US operations may be affected. Germany&apos;s Commerzbank halted dollar transactions with Iran in February after its officials spoke of US pressure, while other big banks are reported to be dropping some or all of their Iranian business. The measures make it tough for Iranian businesses to get the letters of credit and loans that are a staple in a nation increasingly reliant on imports.  &quot;The main problem is financing,&quot; Nasser Hashempour, the vice president of the Dubai-based Iranian Business Council, told AP. &quot;No one accepts Iranian letters of credit. That&apos;s one reason Iranians are moving out of Iran, because they have to establish relations with foreign banks.&quot; Apart from economic sanctions, the US is applying other forms of pressure. Its navy, which has strengthened its presence in the Gulf in recent months, yesterday began exercises there involving two aircraft carrier groups and ships carrying 17,000 marines.", "tags": ["Iran", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Iran 'three to eight years' from nuclear weapon", "sentences": ["&quot;The main problem is financing,&quot; Nasser Hashempour, the vice president of the Dubai-based Iranian Business Council, told AP."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/24/iran.marktran", "publicationDate": "2007-05-24T15:50:28Z"}, {"article": "Summer&apos;s upon us, and if you&apos;re anything like me, you&apos;re already dreaming of some ethical sun and sand. Which destinations are the top sustainable choices this year, and what&apos;s the most ethical way of getting there? My postbag bulges with enquiries from readers who don&apos;t want their annual getaway ruined by feelings of guilt. Well, people, my first tip is: relax. Just the fact that you&apos;re thinking about the environmental impact of your actions means you&apos;re already more ethical than a person on a package flight to Dubai. I&apos;m guessing that your new holiday wardrobe is 100% organic, your sun-cream&apos;s Fairtrade, and even your buckets and spades are vintage: well done. Next question: Is it ethical to fly? Well, yes and no. There&apos;s no denying the 10 tonnes of CO2 your average family getaway will contribute to global warming. But, increasingly, responsible travellers are turning the question around and asking: is it ethical not to fly? Fact is, examined from a holistic perspective, there&apos;s no comparison between the amount of real good you can do in two weeks outside Falmouth, and the incredible impact that just a couple of days of your presence might have in a place like Burkina Faso. In my view it&apos;s all too easy to holiday in this country - drive to Norfolk, show everyone how green you are - but much, much harder to fly some place where the economy would literally collapse without you. Last year, Rowan and I took the tough decision to take the kids to a remote atoll in the Indian Ocean, travelling for an arduous three days each way - but believe me, the knowledge that without us our cook and three maids would have been peeling yams for a living more than made up for the disapproving looks when our friends found out where we&apos;d been. And here&apos;s another tip: if, like us, you&apos;ve got talkative kids, why not just tell them the atoll&apos;s called Bournemouth? How can you be sure your presence will make a difference? Check before you leave that the region is rich in beggars, and take plenty of small change. If orphans are plentiful, think of combining your sunshine or safari holiday with a fast-track adoption. Once you&apos;ve completed the paperwork, you&apos;ll have the child as a permanent reminder of your break. Try Guatemala, or head for Madonna&apos;s favourite, sunny Mali. Alternatively, you could leave a few hours of your trip free for some unpaid work as a goodwill ambassador. The high cost of insuring celebrities means that, increasingly, amateurs are volunteering to visit places that might never, otherwise, see a concerned westerner, let alone a Powerpoint presentation on climate change. Find an area where you can swim in the morning and visit people with malaria in the afternoon, and you may even, like us, pick up some sponsorship from your local school. Even the most unethical-sounding holiday can be turned round with a bit of thought. Heading for China? Pack your suitcase with ready-sorted recyclables which would otherwise have travelled there by sea, then fill up with Fairtrade shopping for the return journey. Fancy New York? Manhattan&apos;s just the place to repatriate a North American crayfish. Finally, if you want something closer to home, try Monte Carlo. With all amenities squeezed into a country not much bigger than Bath, trust me: you&apos;ll end up guzzling less petrol on an ethical gambling break than on shuttling between Southwold and Aldeburgh.

The programme is free - you just need to be committed to launching an artistic venture within a year. See www.flyingstart-ncge.com/arts for details. Leicester launches cancer treatment MSc The University of Leicester this week added a pioneering new Master&apos;s degree to its collection.

No one else has trained the winner of the Gold Cup and the Derby. Even if he fails, Elsworth&apos;s position in the racing public&apos;s affections is secure. It is he who trained the most popular jumper and flat racer of recent times, Desert Orchid and Persian Punch. He has said: &apos;Everyone wants to know what I&apos;m giving my horses, and I&apos;ve got to come clean and say I am giving them something - lots of love, lots of attention and the best money can buy.&apos; It has been a successful recipe. Despite starting training after Martin Pipe, he became National Hunt champion trainer before him. Despite never having had the significant resources that support other stables, he has won most of the major races, often with a horse that cost less than the prize money gained. He offers good value, both as a trainer and a conversationalist. On Wednesday, with the sun shining at the Egerton stables and Salford Mill looking imperious, the 67-year-old trainer, who has a reputation for being gruff and blunt, is distinctly chipper. &apos;Look at that, what a magnificent specimen,&apos; says Elsworth. Tony Proctor, who having ridden Dubai Millennium knows a good horse, reckons Salford could be the one. Ferryman was Proctor&apos;s first winner for Elsworth when, according to the trainer, both he and the horse were 15. The jockey suggests he might have been 18. &apos;Don&apos;t let the truth get in the way of a fucking good story,&apos; says Elsworth. Salford Mill&apos;s tale is odd enough to qualify for the accolade. Bought for just over \u00a345,000 by Tony Thompson, a local waste-paper magnate, whose classic horses Salford City and Salford Express were also trained by Elsworth, the colt started his career with a loss at Lingfield on the all-weather. &apos;I like Lingfield,&apos; says Elsworth, &apos;because it is a good, sound, safe circuit. There&apos;s a maximum of 12 runners but they race tight so you get the experience of being in a big field. &apos;His next contest was an egg-and-spoon race which he powered in by two or three lengths and could have won by 10 if they&apos;d gone another half-furlong.&apos; On the evidence of these two runs, the handicapper gave him a low enough rating for a very lucrative campaign in the major handicaps to open up. It was an option Elsworth declined. &apos;I like to deal in excellence and I rarely get excellent horses. The only way we could find out if he was a potential Derby horse was to run him against potential Derby horses.&apos; Salford Mill went to the Guineas meeting and won the Newmarket Stakes by a comfortable one-and-a-half lengths. &apos;That blew our cover,&apos; says Elsworth. &apos;We were going to go for the Dante. In itself it&apos;s a prestigious race and we thought, &quot;Let&apos;s go and establish if we are going to win the Derby.&quot; It would have given us a big clue if we had beaten Authorized.&apos; Rain scuppered the plan and, instead, he had a gallop at Newmarket and one at Epsom on Thursday, neither of which was sparkling. Elsworth is baffled by these setbacks and will not run the horse if the ground is soft. That said, &apos;I&apos;ll be surprised if he isn&apos;t every bit as good as we thought he was.&apos; And if he is that good he will have a chance in a race with only one outstanding contender. I thought Authorized couldn&apos;t have won the Dante more impressively,&apos; says Elsworth. &apos;But it would be more reassuring for those who think he is a certainty if he had beaten a stronger field.&apos; We are sitting in the nerve centre of the operation, a spacious office sparsely furnished with a desk, a chair and a sofa. The man from the Racing Post has come to ask Elsworth for his opinion of some of his star pupils. Sitting behind his desk, peering over his glasses at a list that he has prepared to remind him of their names and achievements, the headmaster is gently encouraging. &apos;Make no mistake he&apos;s a very, very quick horse&apos;; He&apos;s sure to win his maiden&apos;; &apos;He took his castration very well&apos;. It is apparent he owns a few of the horses in his yard. How many? &apos;Too many,&apos; he says. &apos;I do like to get involved.&apos; He has been getting involved for 35 years. He started by helping out/running the show at Lieutenant Colonel Ricky Vallance&apos;s yard at Bishop&apos;s Canning in Wiltshire. Their most impressive winner was Red Candle, who won the Mackeson at 20-1 and defeated Red Rum to win the Hennessy. &apos;It was lovely,&apos; says Elsworth. &apos;When you&apos;re young everything is more romantic.&apos; Perhaps their best-backed winner was Well Briefed at Exeter. Too well backed, maybe, as the Lieutenant Colonel was banned and Elsworth had to work as a market trader and a security guard at Stonehenge while waiting to be granted his licence. The wait lasted until 1978 - &apos;I wasn&apos;t regarded as training material,&apos; he says - and ended thanks to the intervention of the Jockey Club&apos;s Colonel Sir Piers Bengough. &apos;I knew the Colonel when he was Captain and I was a stable lad. He very kindly stuck in a word for me.&apos; His first Flat winner was Raffia Set at Salisbury, which was backed down from 33-1 to 16-1. &apos;We drank so much champagne that we were standing in the middle of the racecourse bar surrounded by empty bottles in a circle just like Stonehenge,&apos; he says. &apos;From my first 10 runners we had six or seven winners. I had the horses organised and every time we were beat I wanted to know why. I think I was a better trainer then.&apos; Maybe, but during the next quarter of a century he organised more than one thousand winners from his West Country bases at Whitcombe, Dorset, and Whitsbury, Hampshire. Towards the end he stopped training jumpers. &apos;I went soft on it,&apos; says Elsworth. &apos;You do get a lot of stress and a lot of injuries. You leave in the dark. You get back in the dark. It&apos;s hard chasing round at Plumpton for very little money.&apos; It needed something special to entice him to move and the Egerton stables on the edge of Newmarket are quite something. Built in 1891, they resemble a cloisters more than a stable. It was from here that Richard Marsh sent out four Derby winners in 10 years, including Persimmon. Brigadier Gerard stood at the stud. &apos;I saw it advertised in Tatler,&apos; says Elsworth. Tatler? &apos;I read everything.&apos; He went to look at it out of curiosity and then reasoned: &apos;There is no point being the richest man in the churchyard.&apos; He tested the bank balance by renting the premises. It has two full-size snooker tables. Should Salford Mill, the cheapest horse in the race, prevail the trainer will definitely have a party. &apos;It will be spontaneous,&apos; says Elsworth. &apos;All the best parties I have ever been to have been spontaneous.&apos; It might be impromptu but it will mark an historical moment.", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "The Derby"], "title": "Horse racing: Mill gives Elsworth star turn", "sentences": ["Tony Proctor, who having ridden Dubai Millennium knows a good horse, reckons Salford could be the one."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/27/horseracing.news", "publicationDate": "2007-05-26T23:11:26Z"}, {"article": "Imagine crowds of beautiful women, draped in gold jewellery and red fabrics, dancing in sequence across the Pennines. Or a former Miss World falling theatrically into the arms of a muscled and almost impossibly good-looking actor on the windy beaches of the North Sea. Such scenes are a long way from the usual entertainment associated with Yorkshire, which is still, for many, more Last of the Summer Wine than big-budget movie paradise. But India&apos;s top film-makers will be enjoying just such full-on glamour next week when the eyes of Bollywood turn to the county for the biggest event in the industry&apos;s calendar. New York, Sydney and Barcelona were all in line to host the 2007 International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) awards, otherwise known as the Bollywood Oscars, but organisers opted for Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, Hull and York. Yorkshire officials hope that, by showcasing the beauty of Britain&apos;s white-rose county through four days of glitter, parties and even the odd celebrity cricket match, Indian producers will be lured towards choosing it as a future setting for films, complete with flamboyant dancing and singing through the streets (cobbled), along the beaches (windy, possibly chilly) and across the hills (steep, maybe wet). &apos;This was always an opportunity to showcase Yorkshire,&apos; said Sabbas Joseph, director of the IIFAs, who chose the county after receiving a personal request from Tony Blair. &apos;The feedback from the industry has been phenomenal.&apos; It is not just actors and film-makers. Five hundred million viewers across the world are expected to watch Bollywood&apos;s elite arrive next week. Stars who across south Asia are more famous than Brad Pitt and more loved than Nicole Kidman will be soon be wandering through the streets of Sheffield and Bradford. Among them will be Amitabh Bachchan, the godfather of Bollywood, who has appeared in more than 130 films and won nearly 20 top awards. Other names, barely known here but renowned across the subcontinent and among India&apos;s vast diaspora, include Akshay Kumar, Rani Mukherjee and Preity Zinta. With them will be Shilpa Shetty, made famous here by Big Brother, and British stars Sienna Miller and Colin Firth. The Bollywood stars will bring their own entourage and host colourful shows with dancing and singing. Of course, it would not be Bollywood without another great Indian love. After hosting a test match between England and the West Indies, Headingley will be prepared for a celebrity spectacular. A cricket match will be umpired by Dickie Bird, introduced by Zinta and include a team packed with famous Indian actors. Shetty will be there to carry out the toss. For Bollywood fans it will be like watching George Clooney come in to bat against Antonio Banderas, with Cameron Diaz commentating. The match will take place on the second day of the event, which will also include a forum bringing together Indian business people worth a total of \u00a360bn, a polo match, film premiere and the highlight - an awards ceremony attended by most of Bollywood&apos;s top talent. Thousands of fans will flock to Sheffield&apos;s Hallam FM arena a week on Saturday to try to catch a glimpse of their heart-throbs. Most will be hoping to see India&apos;s hottest couple - Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan. Rai is a former Miss World, he is the son of a Bollywood legend. The fact that they met and fell in love on a Indian set was almost as cliched as the perfect Bollywood script. When they married last month it was one of India&apos;s most anticipated events. Fans climbed trees to try to get a peek, but with security as tight as it was for the Beckhams&apos; wedding there was little chance of seeing anything. Even in Britain, Rai is now renowned following leading roles in films such as Bride and Prejudice and Provoked. Next week she and Bachchan are sure to be followed by a team of security guards. Why is such a spectacle coming to Yorkshire? According to Joseph, it is because it is the biggest county in Britain, has never had a significant Indian investment and is home to many British Asians who make up some of Bollywood&apos;s most hardcore fans. &apos;Cineworld, Odeon and Vue all show Indian films as part of their repertoire now,&apos; said Joseph. &apos;Sixteen per cent of releases in the UK are Indian films and last year nine made it into the top 10.&apos; He pointed out that Bollywood now contributes \u00a3200m to the UK economy every year through producers filming, distributing and exhibiting in the country. The amount is rising by 25 per cent annually. These four days will boost the Yorkshire economy by \u00a310m and the event is likely to make top Indian film-makers much more interested in the county as a movie location. Joseph would not be drawn into why New York, Sydney and Barcelona were turned down and said that they were each still in line for future bids. Since its launch in London in 2000, the IIFA&apos;s have been held in Sun City and Johannesburg in South Africa, and in Malaysia, Singapore, Amsterdam and Dubai. This time, celebrity magazines across Asia and television chat-shows will be filled with tales of the journey of India&apos;s rich and famous to Yorkshire. As in Hollywood, they will be full of gossip, ranging from bitching and backstabbing to romance and who is likely to win what. &apos;This is one of the most prestigious awards ceremonies and it can really boost an actor&apos;s career,&apos; said Akshay Kumar, one of the stars who will take to the stage in Leeds next week. He said Bollywood hits were being increasingly filmed in Britain, and Yorkshire could yet make the perfect location. Last year Kumar shot two films here: &apos;Everything is available in the UK and there is so much support.&apos; The growth in international demand for Bollywood has also led film makers to seek out new, non-Asian audiences outside India. Rang de Basanti, a film about corruption starring the British actress Alice Patten, daughter of Chris, the ex-Tory politician, is about to be relaunched by production company UTV, to attract British viewers. The film has just been re-edited to reduce the amount of Hindi and has been cut (Bollywood movies are often three hours long) to bring it closer to the usual Hollywood-blockbuster length. It will be renamed The Colour of Sacrifice The IIFAs will see the first major Bollywood premiere ever to be held in Yorkshire. The film is The Train, about a married man who falls for another woman. But a preview on a Bollywood website, glamsham.com promises &apos;something even more shocking that probably has never been seen before in a Hindi movie&apos;. It will follow another controversial film, Provoked, which tells the tale of a battered British Asian housewife who eventually kills her violent husband. The film tells the true story of Kiranjit Ahluwalia, from Slough, whose case set a precedent regarding the law&apos;s definition of &apos;provocation&apos;. Observers say it won&apos;t be long before Bollywood box-office takings start to rival those of Hollywood. Each year 3.1 billion cinema tickets for Bollywood films are sold in India compared with 2.9 billion for Hollywood hits in the US. At the moment that does not translate into the same amount of money because the vast majority of cinemas in India are single-screen and tickets cost on average 25p rather than $10. But there has been a massive growth in the number of multiplexes across India where tickets are closer to \u00a32.50. &apos;The Indian entertainment sector was worth $4.5bn last year and is already $10bn this year,&apos; said Jyoti Deshpande, chief operating officer and commercial director of Eros International, one of the world&apos;s leading international distributors of Bollywood films. &apos;Films used to be distributed through small cinemas and DVD shops. Now it is Odeons, Cineworlds and Vues, while the DVDs are available in Virgin and Asda. Films are now showcased at festivals like Cannes and reviewed in the mainstream press.&apos; Bollywood, Deshpande added, was like Hollywood in the Thirties but was now growing at a phenomenal rate. It may not be long until names such as Abhishek Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Rani Mukherjee and Preity Zinta are household names in the UK. They certainly soon will be in Yorkshire. Tinseltown, Asian-style In the late 19th century, Indian photographer, Harishchandra Sakharam Bhatvadekar bought a camera for 21 guineas in London. He took it back to India, shot several short films, and, in 1899, the Indian film industry was born. While films were shot in a number of different languages, those in Hindi quickly became the most prominent. In the early Seventies, a gossip magazine in Mumbai coined the word Bollywood, referring to the city&apos;s Hindi language film industry. It is often wrongly used to refer to the whole of India&apos;s film industry. Purists - among them some of the country&apos;s leading actors - deplore the term. They say it makes the industry look like Hollywood&apos;s poor cousin. Much to their annoyance, Bollywood has now become a permanent fixture, even holding a place in the Oxford English Dictionary. Plots are often melodramatic, with star-crossed lovers, angry families, love triangles, corrupt politicians, kidnappers, conniving villains and tales of rags to riches. Few films are made without theatrical song and dance scenes. \u00b7 Tickets for the IIFA Foundation Charity Celebrity Cricket Match are priced \u00a322 (adult) and \u00a312 (child), and are available by calling 0871 222 0994, or online at yorkshireccc.com.", "tags": ["UK news", "Film", "India", "Bollywood", "World news", "Travel", "World cinema", "Culture"], "title": "Bollywood glitter adds glamour to Yorkshire grit", "sentences": ["Since its launch in London in 2000, the IIFA&apos;s have been held in Sun City and Johannesburg in South Africa, and in Malaysia, Singapore, Amsterdam and Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/27/film.india", "publicationDate": "2007-05-27T13:10:31Z"}, {"article": "You can never be quite sure with Frankie Dettori whether the bright, easy-going exterior is merely a cover for deeper stress that lies beneath. He knows, and so does everyone else, that there is a &quot;best jockey never to&quot; label with his name on it, and it will stick like glue if he fails to win the Derby on Authorized at Epsom this Saturday. As he gave a press conference at Newmarket yesterday though - his last public utterance, he says, before the big race itself - Dettori was switched to his familiar auto-smile, insisting that he is fit and focused ahead of a weekend that could redefine his career. If Dettori is feeling the pressure, he is only likely to show it in the race itself. That, of course, is one of the few scenarios that might actually result in Authorized being beaten, but Dettori said yesterday that he has calmed down a little since first being told that Sheikh Mohammed, who retains him to ride for Godolphin, had released him to take the ride on Peter Chapple-Hyam&apos;s Derby favourite. &quot;I was driving to the races when Ray [Cochrane, Dettori&apos;s agent] rang to tell me the news,&quot; Dettori said. &quot;When I put the phone down I just screamed, and then I screamed even louder. &quot;I was very nervous and excited, but I&apos;m much more relaxed about it now. Now I&apos;ve got to go out there and do it. I won&apos;t know the runners, the riders or the draw until Thursday, and I&apos;ll have a good study of the race on Thursday night, but I&apos;ve also got Friday to worry about before that, which could be a big day with possibly Sixties Icon in the Coronation Cup and Measured Tempo in the Oaks. I&apos;m pretty excited [about the Derby] but I&apos;m in control.&quot; Dettori also confirmed that while he is still a little sore after a fall at Goodwood on Friday, he was fit enough to ride Authorized in a gallop at Peter Chapple-Hyam&apos;s yard yesterday morning, and should be able to return to race-riding on Tuesday. &quot;Peter asked me twice to see if I was really sure,&quot; he said, &quot;but funnily enough there&apos;s more discomfort when I&apos;m sitting or trotting, when I&apos;m in the jockey&apos;s position there&apos;s no pain at all. &quot;We galloped over nearly a mile, he was very relaxed and he travelled extremely well, then pulled out for the last two furlongs and finished really strongly. It was very pleasing because he&apos;s not the best of work horses. He was very clean-winded and light on his feet.&quot; Dettori also confirmed yesterday that his flying dismount from Authorized should the colt win on Saturday will not mark the end of his riding career. Nor, for that matter, will his 40th birthday in less than four years&apos; time, as he once suggested it might. &quot;Whatever happens on Saturday, I&apos;ll be riding in the French Derby on Sunday,&quot; Dettori said. &quot;I know I once said that I&apos;d like to retire at 40, but I&apos;ve got five children now and that means there&apos;s a lot of bills to pay. I think my wife would strangle me if I said I was going to stop now, and there&apos;s no other job that could give me so much satisfaction. &quot;I think there&apos;s been about four odds-on shots in the Derby in the last 50 years, so to have a ride on a horse like Authorized is pretty special. I&apos;ve ridden some great horses in the Derby, but they all had question marks about them. &quot;Dubai Millennium was a doubtful stayer, and Cape Verdi was too and was also a filly taking on the colts, so he has to be the best ride I&apos;ve had so far. It doesn&apos;t matter which corner I turn or which shop I go into, everybody is wishing me the best of luck, and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve eve been in such a media spotlight for something like this before. I guess the horse has captured the imagination of a lot of people. &quot;It would mean a lot to me if I could win this race, it would fulfil all of my childhood dreams. It&apos;s great to have a chance like this and I&apos;ll try not to waste it, but it&apos;s not as if I&apos;m going to commit suicide if he doesn&apos;t win. It would just be a shame not to win a Derby after achieving a great deal in my racing career.&quot; The last time he was this excited about a ride, Dettori says, it was before he partnered Discreet Cat in the Dubai World Cup in March. They finished last. &quot;He hasn&apos;t won yet, so I&apos;m not taking anything for granted,&quot; Dettori said. &quot;It&apos;s always exciting to be on an odds-on chance in a big race, like when Ouija Board ran at the Breeders&apos; Cup.

The new mutation of the fraud is known as &quot;contra trading&quot; and is the fraudsters&apos; latest move in the cat-and-mouse game with the EU&apos;s customs officers. The European commission admitted last year it was losing more to ordinary carousel fraud than the \u20ac50bn (\u00a334bn) it spends each year on the common agricultural policy. France, which has until now denied it had a serious problem with the fraud, recently admitted it may have lost \u20ac19bn last year. It is not alone. Germany last year smashed a carousel fraud ring where one truck full of phones had gone back and forth across the Swiss-German border for five years, generating \u20ac165m of VAT repayments. So far, only Britain seems to have got to grips with carousel fraud, but even here customs officials are on red alert for new mutations of it, such as contra trading, which could defeat them again. Carousel fraud in its simplest form is known as missing trader fraud. A fraudster sets up a company, imports items such as mobile phones from another European country free of VAT, sells on the goods with VAT added and then disappears without handing the VAT to Revenue &amp; Customs. However, most fraudsters continually re-export and re-import the goods in a &quot;carousel&quot; system, reclaiming millions of pounds of VAT at the point of export each time because goods are zero-rated for VAT when they cross an EU border. Contra trading involves setting up two overlapping carousels spinning between various EU countries and countries outside the EU. One will often involve services such as software or licences and the other goods such as mobile phones. Some of the trades will be legitimate and a gang will often make a small VAT payment in one country to disguise a much bigger reclaim in another. &quot;There is no doubt that this fraud is exploding across Europe,&quot; said Robin Hume, VAT expert at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland. In Britain, contra trading appears so far not to have taken serious hold because HMRC dealt the racket a severe blow last year when it joined the Dutch government in closing the First Cura\u00e7ao International Bank. Carousel fraud in Britain, which was costing the government \u00a3100m a week this time last year, has since collapsed. The government this week introduces a change to the rules for VAT repayments in the trade of mobile phones and computers chips. This will mean VAT only becomes payable when the goods are sold to end-users by retailers thereby preventing VAT being passed along the trading chain and stolen. Investigators have acknowledged that this is only a temporary solution. &quot;It [the fraud] will probably mutate to iPods, MP3 players or digital cameras. I have also heard it being done with cosmetics and Mont Blanc pens,&quot; said Mr Hume. Revenue &amp; Customs has hiredextra investigators and has deliberately withheld claims it thinks may be fraudulent. &quot;HMRC is cracking down on a whole industry, not just on fraudsters. They are basically saying that all traders are guilty by association,&quot; says Steven Bell, head of a computer components firm MobilX which has just gone into administration because of HMRC withholding a VAT reclaim from the firm worth \u00a38m. The HMRC says that 95% of the VAT reclaims investigated over the past year were made by crooks. It is now trying to recover more than \u00a310bn VAT stolen in recent years, much of which is thought to have ended up in Dubai and may have been laundered through the emirate&apos;s property market. Across Europe, efforts are focusing on the better exchange of information between national police forces and customs officers, though contra trading makes that harder than ever. Longer term, says European Union tax commissioner Laszlo Kovacs, the EU will need to change its VAT system to prevent the fraud. Finance ministers are meeting next Tuesday to discuss the options. They are certain to agree on better monitoring and cooperation to try to prevent the existing system being systematically defrauded. However, they cannot agree on whether to introduce a &quot;reverse charge&quot; where VAT is only payable when the goods are finally sold - more akin to a sales tax - or a &quot;country of origin&quot; scheme where the VAT is paid at the point of manufacture, or import into, the union and would be payable when goods are sold across borders. This was recommended by a House of Lords committee last week. Sale and resale nets millions Flipping cars in Canada Carousel fraud has spread across the Atlantic to Canada, where criminals take advantage of the tax-exempt status of businesses based on native American reservations. Known as &quot;flipping&quot;, it usually involved the sale and resale of cars, trucks or heavy building equipment such as bulldozers, and the fraudulent claiming of a goods and services tax (GST) rebate on each transaction. Typically, a vehicle will be sold and re-sold several times, in and out of a reservation, with the result that it is treated as an export. A 6% rebate is claimed on each transaction, and some criminals have been accused of making millions of Canadian dollars. In one case in Ontario, a group of fraudsters were jailed for up to four years after defrauding the Canadian government of $20m (\u00a39.3m) in a fraud in which cars appeared to be sold and resold several times a day in different parts of the country. None of the vehicles actually changed hands. Richard Ainsworth, a professor at Boston University School of Law, who has studied car flipping and carousel fraud in Britain, says they are remarkably similar crimes, as GST, a destination-based tax, is very similar to VAT. Prof Ainsworth believes it is not the nature of the tax, but the nature of the market - with goods passing through large numbers of middlemen - which facilitates the crime. He has concluded that the solution is for the taxman to offer certified VAT software to companies engaged in cross-border trades which would calculate and submit their VAT. Failure to install and run the software would remove a firm&apos;s right to zero-rate cross-border trades. The result, he says, would be to eliminate carousel fraud with a market-based compliance system.

The 52-year-old father of two was bundled into a car near his home in Glasgow in February last year by two men claiming to be police officers and was never seen again. There were few clues, although the lack of any ransom demand fuelled the belief that his abduction may have been some kind of vendetta. Another theory was that he had staged his own disappearance. Yesterday, any remaining hope that he would be found alive disappeared when police revealed they had found his skull. It was caught in fishing nets off the Isle of Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde on April 5 and handed over to police. Eight weeks later, forensic tests have confirmed it to be that of Mr Ramsay. Police said it had been in the water for some months and there was no evidence, at this stage, to suggest Mr Ramsay had met a violent end. After such a long time in the water, it is unlikely that a body would remain intact, they said. But the scant remains of the accountant have offered few clues as to what happened to him or why. He was taken on February 22 2006 as he walked from the pub with his girlfriend, Beverley Sinclair, to his home in Cardonald, south Glasgow. As they arrived, two smartly dressed men, claiming to be police officers, told Mr Ramsay he was under arrest and took him away in a dark coloured car. No witnesses have come forward, despite a Crimewatch appeal. Detectives say the investigation was never closed, but every potential lead, including inquiries abroad, came to nothing. With no solid facts from police, speculation quickly started. It emerged that behind Mr Ramsay&apos;s bookish demeanour lay two marriages and a colourful past. It was revealed he had been interviewed by Customs as part of an investigation into money laundering at a company where he once worked, and there were reports that he had been due to appear in a high court case as a witness in a fraud trial. Police said yesterday there was no such case and he was not known to them. Detective Superintendent William Prendergast, the officer leading the inquiry, said: &quot;Andrew had been interviewed on several occasions by officers from HM Revenue and Customs. There was never any trial set in relation to those interviews. As to whether that has anything to do with his disappearance or not, there&apos;s no evidence to suggest that.&quot; However, customs sources have told the Guardian that Mr Ramsay was being investigated as part of an inquiry into carousel fraud, the sophisticated operation in which criminals siphon VAT reserves from the Treasury by making bogus claims for imported and exported goods. Speaking some months after his disappearance, a customs investigator said of Mr Ramsay: &quot;He is either sitting on a beach in Dubai spending his millions, or he is dead.&quot; Rumours of the reasons for his abduction intensified when his former girlfriend, Marijke Vannut, a Belgian model and singer, said he &quot;owed a lot of people a lot of money&quot; and was always looking over his shoulder. Mr Ramsay, who was going through a divorce from his second wife when he disappeared, had worked in Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Europe. Detectives described him as a &quot;man who knew his way about the avenues of life&quot;. He had been involved in a number of failed companies, including a directorship of one called Golden Miles, which he operated out of the same property as a well-known Glasgow brothel. Det Supt Prendergast said that, until now, he had never given up hope that Mr Ramsay would be found safe and well. He was deeply saddened to have to inform Mr Ramsay&apos;s family of the news, he added. &quot;He appeared to be very well liked,&quot; the officer said. &quot;He was good in conversation, he could come into a room and join into company. So with this kind of outward personality we were hoping that we would trace Andrew.&quot; The police investigation will now be stepped up once more, but it will remain an abduction and not a murder inquiry.

You pass endless signs marking the location of what will soon be known as Dubailand. Once completed, this will be the world&apos;s largest theme park, twice the size of Florida&apos;s Disney World. Scheduled to open between 2015 and 2018, it aims to be the centrepiece of Dubai&apos;s tourism infrastructure, attracting up to 200,000 visitors a day. Dubai Holding, which is building the mega-project, says that at 278 sq km it will include the world&apos;s largest shopping mall, the world&apos;s largest observation wheel, 29 sq km of themed worlds and 75 sq km of &quot;Eco-tourism World&quot;, including a safari park, a vast sporting complex and a snowdome six times bigger than Ski Dubai - the emirate&apos;s existing 25-storey skiing centre, where about 30 tonnes of snow are created each night as chilled water is sprayed from 21 snow-makers attached to the roof. Yet according to last year&apos;s UN report Global Deserts Outlook, the United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is a part, is one of the most &quot;water-imperilled&quot; nations in the world, while also one of the most water-thirsty. Undaunted, Dubailand will have nearly 30,000 rooms spread across 31 hotels to accommodate its visitors. Dubai not only has some of the highest average room prices anywhere in the world, it also has one of the highest occupancy rates as 6 million people a year visit. Given Dubai&apos;s reputation for luxury, it is fitting that my &quot;room&quot; for the night is at the Burj al-Arab, the dhow-shaped building that has come to define its location as much as Sydney&apos;s Opera House or Bilbao&apos;s Guggenheim museum. Many claim this to be the world&apos;s most expensive hotel, with prices ranging from $1,000-$28,000 a night. I say &quot;room&quot;, but the Burj al-Arab, which sits on its own artificial island, doesn&apos;t have any single rooms. It offers &quot;duplexes&quot; - suites that extend over two floors. And I must add that I am a guest of the hotel; few journalists could afford afternoon tea here, let alone the cost of a duplex. From my ceiling-to-floor window on the 34th floor I can see far out to sea. On the horizon, huge arcs of sand are being sprayed into the air from dredgers; in time these will form the islands of The World - 300 artificial islands that together will make up a map of the planet when seen from the air. Investors can buy an island - say, &quot;Great Britain&quot; or &quot;Iceland&quot; - for about $10m, then build what they want there. There are moments when I feel as if I am being lured into a cult, such is the self-belief in Dubai. Once my eyes have adjusted to the surfaces of gold, mosaic, marble or mirror that seem to embellish every surface of my Burj al-Arab duplex, I begin to notice details such as the 13-option pillow menu and a personal-butler service that includes, for the eye-watering fee of 2,500 UAE dirhams (about $700), the option of having a scented-oil-filled bath run for you, with caviar and champagne left beside the pile of pressed towels. Dubai is famous for its service culture: it is one of the things that always rates highly in visitor surveys. Hotel staff can even appear on the beach, asking if you need your sunglasses wiped. But how does the emirate afford to employ its vast army of service staff, from the cleaners and waiters through to the chefs and pool attendants? And what of the even larger number of construction workers who are busy building some of the other parts of Dubai&apos;s swelling tourist infrastructure? The subject is a burr on the emirate&apos;s highly polished gold. An hour&apos;s drive into an area of Dubai that is about as far off the tourist map as it is possible to get brings us to Sonapur. Even its name cruelly teases its residents. The name of Dubai&apos;s largest labour camp means &quot;city of gold&quot; in Hindi. It also sounds similar to the local slang word for a female orgasm, as Khaled, my translator, seems to rejoice in telling me. I doubt that most of the 150,000 male workers who live here (some claim that it is as many as 500,000, but there is little official headcounting), smile at the paradox of living in a place so empty of wealth and women. The other side As we pass the large cemetery on the road into Sonapur, a long convoy of buses heads in the opposite direction towards the hundreds of building sites across Dubai. Curtains screening the workers from the sun flap violently in the open windows as drivers move up through the gears, spewing a dirty diesel puff at every shift. On entering the huge settlement - &quot;town&quot; doesn&apos;t seem the right term, as there&apos;s no sign of cinemas, libraries, restaurants or even landscaping - we pass block upon block of concrete walls, some topped with barbed wire, all fronted by large metal gates. Inside, Khaled says, are housing units, some of which are home to up to 500 workers, owned by the dozens of contractors that feed Dubai&apos;s construction boom. In a room in the compound we perch tentatively on the bed to talk to three of the workers, friends who live together, sharing a room with five others. Rahmatula, an Afghan in his late 20s whose pumice-rough hands are in sharp contrast to his disarmingly soft green eyes, gives me a picture of his typical day. It starts, he says, at 5.30am, when he quickly gets up and, without having breakfast, boards a bus. By six he is at the building site, where hundreds of luxury villas are being constructed, and immediately starts moving bricks by hand. &quot;I have 15 minutes for my lunch &apos;hour&apos;,&quot; he says. &quot;I always eat roti bread with vegetable curry made the night before, which I bring with me.&quot; He says he&apos;s not allowed to stop again, even if he needs water. If he does, money will be deducted from his wages. &quot;I&apos;ve been working here for five years and my salary is now 800 dirhams [$220] a month, but with overtime I get it up to 1,100. I send home 600 dirhams a month,&quot; he says with pride. I can&apos;t help looking at his sweat-stained shirt and thinking of the bath-and-caviar service at the Burj al-Arab. It would take Rahmatula more than three months of picking up bricks, I calculate, to earn enough money to pay for such a bath. He finishes work at about 5pm and gets back to the compound around six. After a shower and a rest, he eats his dinner at nine, goes to pray and is in bed by 10 o&apos;clock. This is his life for six days a week. He gets Friday off work, but spends much of the day cleaning clothes or cooking. &quot;It&apos;s like a prison sentence, I suppose,&quot; he says. &quot;I haven&apos;t seen my wife for five years, but I&apos;m going home to Khost [a region on the Afghan-Pakistan border] next month.&quot; His eyes moisten at the thought. We step back out into the heat and walk down one of the long alleyways that divide the housing units. Clothes hang drying from lines attached to every available eave. The men show me a bathroom with a long line of baths and, further along, a filthy kitchen with more than 20 gas stoves but no refrigerators. As a tourist here you rarely part company with air conditioning. It is easy to forget that not everyone can take it for granted. It is also easy to forget that Dubai today - and tomorrow - would not exist without these workers. Nor would the hotels, pools, shopping malls and holiday homes that the millions of tourists who visit each year enjoy. The travel industry still clings to the convenient myth that the good ship Tourism brings economic bounty to all who sail in her. Yet there seems to be little evidence that tourists and those who serve them engage with each other on a balanced, harmonious footing. Instead the bounty is carved up between a select few, while far too many of the industry&apos;s workers are no more than wage slaves scratching out a pitiful living. And there is plenty of evidence that many locals have been displaced to make way for tourists, often at considerable cost to the environment. Lord Marshall, the former chairman of British Airways, got it right when he said that tourism is &quot;essentially the renting out for short-term lets of other people&apos;s environments, whether that is a coastline, a city, a mountain range or a rainforest&quot;. Many places - from Cancun to Costa Blanca, Thailand to Ibiza - say water supply has become one of their biggest concerns now that they rely so heavily on tourism. And the cause is always the same: unplanned, rapid overdevelopment. Under pressure Many are so desperate to cling on to the business they have that they are resorting to ever-more-desperate short-term measures that can only exacerbate their plight. So we see helicopters being used in the Alps to ferry snow to pistes that are melting under the pressures of climate change. Marine scientists in Australia are proposing the &quot;hosing down&quot; of vulnerable parts of the Great Barrier Reef during periods of high temperatures, as well as the building of floating pontoons to provide shade, all to protect the corals from being damaged from bleaching as a result of climate change. One of the best remedies being offered to relieve the symptoms of pressure of numbers seems to be quotas. The communities living in the shadows of the Taj Mahal and Machu Picchu have long urged a cap on visitor numbers to help limit damage. Nearly everywhere I went, the local community expressed the desire to see fewer tourists paying more for their visit. Quality, not quantity.

Frankie Dettori has heard them all since he first clambered into the saddle to ride in the Derby 15 years ago. Didn&apos;t stay, didn&apos;t act on the track, didn&apos;t like the ground and not good enough have all had at least one outing since he trailed home 16th on Pollen Count in 1992, and some have had half a dozen. There is just one excuse missing from the list, in fact, and it happens to be the one that may be levelled against him if Authorized cannot justify his odds-on starting price today. It is jockey error - and Dettori knows that fact better than anyone. If there is a drawback to the life of a multi-millionaire Flat jockey, it is that the horse tends to get the credit when it wins and the rider gets the blame if it does not. With an odds-on chance like Authorized, there is even less margin for error. If he runs to the form he showed in the Dante Stakes at York, Authorized should win. Today&apos;s Derby, as far as the punters are concerned, is Dettori&apos;s to lose. The Newmarket rumour-mill has been suggesting this week that Dettori is showing the strain. He seems edgy, nervous, all too aware that he will never have a better chance to win the Derby. And nervous jockeys are more likely to make mistakes, to try to force the issue instead of letting the horse do the work. The more he wants it, the harder it gets. So how did one of the finest jockeys of recent years ever get here in the first place? No other rider with a licence has ridden in more Derbys without success. Johnny Murtagh, for instance, has three winners from 10 attempts. It does not seem fair. &quot;There is definitely something missing [from his record] and unfairly so,&quot; says Luca Cumani, who took Dettori under his wing as a raw teenager when he arrived from Italy in the mid-1980s. &quot;A jockey of his ability should be winning Derby after Derby and it is a strange quirk of fate that he hasn&apos;t managed to do so yet. He just hasn&apos;t been dealt the right hand so far but he is far from the first great jockey who has had to wait a long time to win a Derby and I just hope that this year will be the one when he finally succeeds.&quot; Dettori surely thought he had won the Derby as long ago as 1995, when he hit the front well inside the final furlong on John Gosden&apos;s Tamure, only for Lammtarra to finish like a Ferrari from well off the pace and nail him in the final strides. &quot;The ground dried up too much for Tamure,&quot; Gosden says. &quot;It was lightning fast by the time they ran the race and I think the time was the fastest since Mahmoud in the 1930s. &quot;There&apos;s no doubt that Lammtarra [who went on to win the King George and the Arc] was the best horse in the race but that would have been the day to beat him, as he was having his first race of the season. &quot;Frankie took it very well at the time and I&apos;d hope from his point of view that this really is his big opportunity. He certainly looks like the right horse in the circumstances and it could all fall into place for him. &quot;But you have to remember that a jockey like SirGordon Richards, who was the champion for virtually 30 years, had to wait until the twilight of his career to win the race. To be honest, I think it&apos;s something that bugs Frankie for this week of the year and then he forgets about it.&quot; Tamure is probably as close as Dettori will ever be to winning a Derby without actually doing so and that defeat, on his fourth ride in the race, was arguably the moment when people started to speculate about an Epsom &quot;jinx&quot;. Yet he has ridden just two outright Derby favourites so far and both of those, it could be argued, headed the market simply because he was on top. Nor did it help that Dubai Millennium, a brilliant horse in every other respect, suffered an unfortunate rush of blood to his loins 20 minutes before the race. &quot;Dubai Millennium and Cape Verdi were both doubtful stayers,&quot; he said this week, &quot;and Dubai Millennium got very coltish in the paddock, too. Cape Verdi was a filly taking on colts and we got into a bumping match with Richard Quinn, which didn&apos;t help. &quot;Dubawi gave me a great ride behind Motivator and I thought we&apos;d give him a race two out but Dubawi ran out of stamina, while Shantou was the opposite, a good stayer who didn&apos;t have the pace to win.&quot; It is the story of Dettori and the Derby: always an excuse, and a good one at that. Now, at last, the best jockey of the modern era never to have won a Derby has nowhere left to hide.", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Frankie Dettori", "The Derby"], "title": "Jinxed Dettori knows he'll never get a better chance", "sentences": ["Nor did it help that Dubai Millennium, a brilliant horse in every other respect, suffered an unfortunate rush of blood to his loins 20 minutes before the race.", "&quot;Dubai Millennium and Cape Verdi were both doubtful stayers,&quot; he said this week, &quot;and Dubai Millennium got very coltish in the paddock, too."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2007/jun/02/jinxeddettoriknowshellneve", "publicationDate": "2007-06-01T23:31:30Z"}, {"article": "Eleven years on from partnering Shaamit to victory in the Derby, Michael Hills has to settle for Folkestone today. It&apos;s something of a family affair, with five of his rides shared between two trainers, father Barry and brother John, and the former provides the banker with Azeema (4.50) in the finale. This Chester winner is a useful sort who is reckoned to be very well handicapped. Bonnie Prince Blue (2.35) is another big Folkestone fancy for the Hills connection, particularly if there is more rain about. Mick Channon should be on the mark with the promising Nijoom Dubai (3.35) and the West Ilsley outfit holds out serious hopes for Meeriss (2.30) in the Woodcote Stakes at Epsom. Buccellati (2.00), so unlucky at Newbury last time, is a major player in the opener at Epsom, although Newmarket runners Jeer and Bergonzi could push him all the way. Buccellati&apos;s trainer, Andrew Balding, would like to have seen a higher draw for Loch Verdi (3.30) in the &quot;Dash&quot;, but this progressive filly should still give a good account. Ian Semple&apos;s Overstayed is also capable of going close at rewarding odds here. Horse Sense readers who snapped up fancy prices for the Derby about Aqaleem before the Lingfield Trial will be on good terms with themselves today. The vibes are strong for favourite Authorized, however, and a contact with a line to Ballydoyle tells us Admiralofthefleet is the one to be on from the Aidan O&apos;Brien battalion. Richard Hannon&apos;s Song Of Passion (5.40), successful over 7f at last year&apos;s meeting, has been teed up for a repeat in the 6f handicap which closes today&apos;s Derby programme. In tomorrow&apos;s French Derby at Chantilly, we have a good mark for Zambezi Sun, whose trainer Pascal Bary is going for a sixth win in the race. Khalid Abdullah&apos;s colt will be coupled with Raincoat for betting purposes on the Pari-mutuel, so check out prices with British bookmakers on Zambezi Sun, who is unbeaten in two starts. Algarade, a one-time Oaks entry, has the look of another handicap &quot;special&quot; for trainer Sir Mark Prescott off what looks an attractive rating of 75. Even better treated is the 58-rated Copernican, whose home work suggests he has ability well in advance of this assessment. Both are set to reappear in the next week or so and Prescott, as ever, can be relied on to pick the right target. Sea Land, from the Marcus Tregoning stable, is also one to note in handicap grade next week, either at Kempton or Sandown, and look out for Fleeting Spirit and Kashoof, both potentially top-class juvenile fillies. Watch out for a major breakthrough this week in the betting shop pictures battle between Britain&apos;s major racecourses and the bookies. There were strong whispers at Epsom yesterday that one of the Big Four bookmakers, and the smart money is on the Tote, is on the verge of breaking away and signing up to the racecourses-backed TurfTV. Rumours are rife that jump jockey Paddy Brennan may not be renewing his contract as No1 rider for trainer Howard Johnson and wealthy owner Graham Wylie. Brennan&apos;s name has been linked to Nigel Twiston-Davies, for whom he has two rides at Worcester today. With Tony Evans out of favour with some of the stable&apos;s owners, Twiston-Davies had tried to sign up Tom Scudamore. Meanwhile, Irish rider Denis O&apos;Regan has been mentioned as a possible successor to Brennan at the Howard Johnson yard. One northern-based jumps jockey starting to make a name for himself is Harry Haynes, the 18-year-old son of starter Peter Haynes. The latter angered several jockeys with his botched attempts to get the Grand National away this year and he may soon be shouting orders at young Harry, who rode his first double at Hexham on Tuesday night. Set to join prolific French trainer Guillaume Macaire for a three-week stint, which should hone his skills, Haynes looks good value for his 7lb claim. Betfair&apos;s decision last week to increase commission charges angered many customers. The new owners of Timeform also have price increases in the pipeline for subscribers to the Halifax publications.

At a more mundane level, Silver Hotspur is one to take note of in the 4.50 at Brighton. He has not been out since a modest run over a longer trip at Southwell in February but he looked a sprinter when trained by Peter Chapple-Hyam last season and Michael Wigham may have found the key to him in dropping him to five furlongs again. The stable had a winner at the Sussex track last week. Course specialist Ivory Lace looks much more at home over seven furlongs these days and has the chance to shine over that distance in the 2.50 after a run over six at Folkestone.

Despite not being the best jockey of his generation - if my money were down, I&apos;d back Kieren Fallon every time - he is indubitably the best known. No one has done so much to publicise his sport and along the way he has, perhaps inevitably, become as famous as his sport. The public image that has been created has changed little since he was typecast as the cheeky chappie flirting with Sue Barker on A Question of Sport. It is somewhat stereotypical, as has been the Italian&apos;s endorsement of pizzas, ice creams, tinned tomatoes and eau de toilette. The only surprise is that he hasn&apos;t become involved in the Ocean&apos;s Eleven film franchise, for he is best known for the &apos;heist&apos; he pulled off at Ascot eleven years ago. Frankie&apos;s Seven cost the bookies a \u00a330 million pay-out as in an increasingly inspired performance he booted home a septet of differently abled horses to land original accumulator odds of 25,095-1. &apos;As a serious and frequently skint punter myself in my early days as an apprentice,&apos; he said afterwards, &apos;I was thrilled to have helped you all clean up...it&apos;s great making dreams happen.&apos; Rocky Balboa could not have put it better. The question yesterday was whether he could provide the sequel - Dettori&apos;s Derby. No current jockey has tried so often and failed each time. No current jockey attracts so much housewife money. It was said by bookmakers always keen to inflate figures that show themselves in a poor light that an Authorized victory would cost them \u00a350 million. It would be another Ascot, more dreams would come true, and this time he had to win only one race. Yet it is the race he had only once come near winning. His best effort had been a second on Tamure in 1995 when he led well inside the final furlong before being collared by Lammtarra, who came like a sprinter and had to post a track record to deny Frankie. Since then there have been thirds on Tobougg and Dubawi and ninths on favourites Cape Verdi and Dubai Millennium. More worrying, perhaps, was that a jockey who is at his best when on an up had gone eight days without a winner. A streak he looked set to break in the second race when he came to win on Bespoke Boy only to be headed by Authorized&apos;s trainer Peter Chapple-Hyam&apos;s Declaration of War. In the next event he came late, with what looked like a perfectly-timed run, but could not quite haul back Blythe Knight. There was nothing wrong with the ride, but when your luck&apos;s out it&apos;s out. At the start, an abutting jockey had thrown his hood off and it had landed on Dettori&apos;s head. It took him a few strides to release the blindfold and it may have made a difference. In his final pre-Derby race Dettori&apos;s horse, Bond City, was backed down to co-favourite but finished nowhere. And so to the Derby and against him were eight Aidan O&apos;Brien-trained rivals. Before the race, the octet were called in and reminded of the law that prohibited team riding. It turned out that even mob-handed they would not be able to touch Dettori. The word had been that Authorized would start odds-on, but he drifted to 5-4. Dettori had looked tense in the paddock, the build-up to the two-and-a-half-minute race seemingly going on for ever, particularly for Dettori, for whom it had gone on for a decade-and-a-half. For the first mile Authorized was not best placed. &apos;Pete said to me whatever you do, get the horse relaxed because it doesn&apos;t matter where you were,&apos; said Frankie afterwards. It didn&apos;t because he was on comfortably the best horse and when he swooped he stormed clear. The victory was accompanied by an anguished scream from Dettori. A howl that encapsulated all the pain of waiting and losing and hoping and, perhaps most of all, fear that he might blow his last best chance. Instead, he took it magnificently and was exultant. The only blemish on his career had been removed, he had achieved all he could ever achieve. Kissing the air repeatedly, he saluted all and sundry. In the unsaddling enclosure, and under the gaze of the Queen, he leapt on the presentation table. &apos;When I hit the front in the last furlong, actually my heart stopped,&apos; he said. He entered the press room bearing champagne and said: &apos;I won the effin Derby. You know what Peter said to me, he said ride it like you own it and I wish I did. I haven&apos;t slept for three weeks. Today was the first day I felt all right. When I passed the furlong marker I couldn&apos;t believe it that this was going to be my moment. Everything went so smooth. You can&apos;t imagine what this last week has been like for me. I&apos;m used to pressure, but this has been a bit over the top. Now I can relax and look forward to next year&apos;s Derby. I love you all.

We&apos;ve heard of a three-legged race, but never a rubber-legged one. And yet at the annual Penn Relays in Pennsylvania, USA, Heinz Kluetmeier seems to have discovered one. Kluetmeier is director of photography at Sports Illustrated magazine and has been shooting sport for more than 30 years. &apos;You try to catch a moment,&apos; he once said. &apos;You find these people, who have great control over their bodies, in a graceful and poetic moment while seriously competing.&apos; But he had never captured an image like this. The Lynx scan camera is more commonly used to take photo-finish images of horse races. Kluetmeier took one to the Penn Relays, where athletes of all ages and abilities compete. As Monica Hargrove passed the baton to USA Blue anchor Julie Stevenson in the Olympic development division 4x400metres relay, Kluetmeier took the shot and the camera created the distortion. Kluetmeier has also used the scan camera at baseball games, resulting in some peculiarly long ...#8209;armed pitchers.

Not since England prop Victor Ubogu had to change his shorts every match or Jonny Wilkinson first damaged that shoulder has a player been so afflicted by such a singular, recurring problem. We asked Corry why. &apos;It&apos;s bit gruesome, but you did ask. I had a cut on my nose about three seasons ago and didn&apos;t really think much of it as the scab developed over it. But it only takes the slightest bit of contact, either in training or a game, for it to start bleeding again. The skin is wafer thin. I suppose it&apos;s part of me now - how people recognise me. That&apos;s not exactly how I would want them to pick me out, but when you&apos;re a forward you take what you get.&apos; The $16m horse that may never race On a farm in Kentucky, the world&apos;s most expensive racehorse is munching oats and hay, costing his owners more money, and showing no sign of earning any of it back. As we reported in our issue of May 2006, The Green Monkey set back the Coolmore bloodstock empire a world record-breaking $16m, but he has yet to race. His owners, and trainer Todd Pletcher, are keeping their own counsel about whether he ever will. The colt attracted his outlandish price tag as a two-year-old. He had performed a spectacular workout at the Calder racetrack in Florida and inspired a bidding war between Coolmore and its rival, the Darley operation of Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai. Darley pulled out when Coolmore trumped its $15.5m offer. Coolmore named its acquisition after a golf course in Barbados. The first signs that all was not well came last summer, when the horse missed his planned race debut owing to a pulled muscle. Since then, news of his progress has been sparse. He is recuperating at Ashford Stud and is officially due to return to training under Pletcher soon. But an associate of Pletcher has been quoted as saying that the colt has performed disappointingly in training. The Green Monkey would not be the first hugely expensive thoroughbred flop. The Sheikh may be relieved that he missed out on The Green Monkey, but unfortunately he did buy Jalil ($9.7m), who at the time of writing has yet to record a victory. Meanwhile, the Derby favourite is Authorized, a 400,000-guinea purchase; Cockney Rebel, winner of the 2,000 Guineas last month, cost only 30,000 guineas.

However, he claims the sport nurtures his green sensibilities. He&apos;s not the first to face this quandary, because golf looks eco-friendly until you get to the greens. Living in fear of fusarium, a fungus that scars the carpet-like appearance of the grass, greenkeepers have increasingly favoured strong pesticides. Naturally, this doesn&apos;t please eco warriors who allege that the 17,000 golf courses in the US use more pesticides than anyone else, including farmers. Then there&apos;s evidence like the 1996 University of Iowa study that showed higher rates of brain and prostate cancers and non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma in golf-course workers than in the general population. The golf fraternity refutes charges of being major polluters, and another US study concluded in 1999 that the pesticide run-off into local watercourses was &apos;virtually nil&apos;. Is &apos;virtually nil&apos; enough? There&apos;s no standard for an &apos;eco course&apos;, but designers are trying low-input, sustainable courses with reduced mowing (petrol mowers emit carbon), irrigation and fertility requirements, and minimal or no use of pesticides. So cut down your golfing footprint by choosing the most naturally run course you can find. Matfenhall in Newcastle (www.matfenhall.com) is on an organic farm and has wildlife zones and nesting boxes. The world&apos;s first &apos;free-range&apos; eco-friendly golf course is off the coast of Croatia in Brijuni National Park. It is &apos;mown&apos; by animals and &apos;no pesticides are used, so the greens may not be as championship-smooth as those in Dubai or the Algarve&apos;. The eco approach to golf, then, is about managing your expectations. The more players who demand championship smoothness mean the greater the effect on the environment and fewer innovations such as the waterless course - where the green can look a bit, well, brown. The latter is pretty revolutionary because, with golf, water is the elephant in the room, wearing a large pair of plus fours. Look at southern Spain, where hundreds of courses, each consuming the same amount of water as a town of 12,000 people, are causing a headache in progressively more water-scarce areas. According to Greenpeace only two out of a sample of 28 Spanish golf courses are using recycled water. You can even green your golf bag. Eco balls decompose in water (ecogolfballs.com), and the biodegradable eco tee (www.ecogolf.com) could replace the 4.4m golf tees made annually from trees. Golf isn&apos;t inherently evil. In fact agronomists insist that ponds with shallow slopes and undulating greens can be used to stabilise banks and prevent erosion. Synthetic fertilisers can be replaced with composting, and petrol products phased out. If you bear these things in mind when you choose where to play, the grass can always be greener.

Once the natural delight for his long-standing employee has subsided, though, he must also absorb the fact that this was another bad day for Sheikh Mohammed Racing and Breeding Ltd. In PR terms, it was not a disaster to match the 2005 St Leger, when Dettori was allowed to ride a Classic winner in the dark blue colours of John Magnier and the Coolmore Stud. None the less, despite spending billions over the last 30 years, the Sheikh now has a Derby-winning jockey but no Derby-winning horse. And the colt that allowed Dettori to realise his dream was sired by a Coolmore stallion. For that reason alone, it was a generous decision to allow Dettori to ride Authorized, since it was likely to boost the wealth and influence of his fiercest competitor. And it is one that Dettori certainly appreciates, for all that his natural euphoria meant that he did not remember to offer his thanks to Sheikh Mohammed at the post-race press conference until Authorized&apos;s owners did it first. &quot;I&apos;d love to win it for him because he gave me the go-ahead to get on this horse,&quot; Dettori said yesterday. &quot;My biggest ambition [now] is to try to win it for Sheikh Mohammed.&quot; Dettori was on all the front pages yesterday morning, and was the only significant item in the sports roundup on both the BBC and ITN news on Saturday night. For the last 15 years, he has pushed racing into the spotlight like no other jockey - in a positive sense, at any rate - and for that, the sport is in his debt. At the same time, though, Saturday&apos;s success may well have hastened the moment when Dettori packs away the riding boots for good. He suggested both before and after the Derby that, as &quot;I&apos;ve got five children to feed&quot;, retirement was a long way from his thoughts. This is merely a soundbite, though, since he must have enough money to feed 50 children by now, and his earning power is not entirely dependent on riding in any case. Dettori has never been driven by an urge to ride winners in the manner of Kieren Fallon, for instance. When his body starts to complain about the demands of life as a top-flight jockey, it has always seemed likely that he would listen sooner rather than later. Dettori&apos;s desire to win a Derby would have been a clear reason to keep going. Whether his urge to win one for &quot;the boss&quot; will be quite so consuming remains to be seen. Dettori&apos;s association with Authorized can be expected to end here. Even if the Godolphin operation do not have a runner in the Eclipse Stakes, for instance, then it is likely that they will have a runner somewhere in Europe that will demand his presence, as they try to move on from an early-season Classic programme that has proved bitterly disappointing. On this basis, Authorized was, as far as his jockey was concerned, a means to an end, and who can blame him for that? There was no mystery about his failure to win the Derby before, because he had never been on a runner with as clear-cut a chance on form. When he finally climbed aboard one colt that was fully expected to win, he took his chance, and he took it coolly and brilliantly. It is Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s failure to win the Derby - or even summon up much of a challenge from one year to the next - that has always been more significant in racing terms than the gap on Dettori&apos;s CV. Luck will always play a part when you attempt to win a particular race, but his enormous expenditure on bloodstock over the years - including proven two-year-olds bought in training - should have compensated for that by now. Either he is extraordinarily unlucky, or he is doing something wrong. From that angle, Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s boycott of the offspring of Coolmore stallions at the major sales looks like a serious, and ongoing, mistake. The late withdrawal of Eastern Anthem on Saturday meant that not a single runner in the Derby was sired by a stallion from the Sheikh&apos;s Darley Stud operation, and if the boycott continues the situation is unlikely to improve. They are building the tallest tower in the world in Dubai at the moment, so Sheikh Mohammed should appreciate as well as anyone that a grand edifice needs deep foundations. Coolmore have the finest bloodlines, and unless he can annex some of these for himself, his entire breeding operation may always be built on sand. If this is the lesson that the Sheikh takes from the 2007 Derby, then it will be remembered as rather more than just the day when Dettori realised his dream. Ron Cox&apos;s tip of the day Borderlescott 8.00 Windsor  Winner of last season&apos;s Stewards&apos; Cup, this thoroughly dependable sprinter made a satisfactory return to action when finishing a close second to Sierra Vista.

So Tristan Davies, editor for the last six years, is to be applauded for his courageous revamp, which flies in the face of what is now a well-established multisection orthodoxy for Sundays to produce a more compact model with a main section of 96 tabloid pages covering everything from news to sport and the arts, with only a separate business section and a single colour magazine to keep it company. It is certainly brave; of course, it could also be foolhardy. Readers have grown used to expecting a lot from their Sunday papers on the one day of the week when they might have time to read more than just the news headlines. Mr Davies&apos;s cunning plan is to offer less in a bold &quot;back to the future&quot; move designed to attract younger readers with notoriously short attention spans. The result is more of a magazine than a newspaper, with few long reads but plenty of bite-size snippets (&quot;super nibs&quot;) designed with the internet generation very much in mind. Each story comes with a suggestion for further reading (which might only make readers think they&apos;re being short-changed) and with at least one name or phrase underscored in grey type, suggesting you click through to find out more (but, of course, unless you are reading online, you cannot click through). The design is attractive if sometimes fussy; and news and news analysis gets short shrift. Of course, Sunday newspapers sometimes struggle with news because not much (other than sport) happens on a Saturday. So it was the Sindy&apos;s bad luck to relaunch on weekend brimming with important news developments. There were riots in Germany as a prelude to the G8 summit, three people were arrested in New York accused of trying to blow up JFK airport, Gordon Brown&apos;s people were briefing madly that he would introduce far tougher anti-terrorist laws than Tony Blair, the Lebanon continued to unravel, British hostages remained captive in Iraq and David Cameron&apos;s crisis over grammar schools continued unabated. But the Sindy devoted its front page to a magazine-style cover on the Camerons&apos; &quot;Notting Hill eco-home&quot;, yet another puff-piece on the Tory leader&apos;s green credentials (I could find no mention of the developing grammar school debacle). The German riots got only a passing mention. The foiling of the JFK terrorist plot - as big as 9/11 if it had succeeded - only made it on to page six and merited only a few hundred words, as did Mr Brown&apos;s efforts to look tough on terrorism, which didn&apos;t surface until page 14 (and which the Observer and Sunday Times rightly splashed on page one). Nor was there any meticulous reconstruction of the week&apos;s vital news developments, which has long been a hallmark of the best Sunday journalism. The Sunday Times gave a typically comprehensive account of the Iraqi hostage crisis, the Observer properly devoted a spread to the growing threat from President Vladimir Putin&apos;s Russia and the Sunday Telegraph went to town on how the Tories&apos; grammar school mess is undermining Mr Cameron in the polls. The Sindy, bizarrely, had almost nothing to say on any of these matters. Of course, no newspaper format lasts forever and the Independent on Sunday is now a distinctive alternative to the multisection norm for those who want serious journalism on a Sunday, but not too much of it. There could well be a niche market for it and it could even attract younger folk who have yet to develop a newspaper reading habit. It has a freshness and accessibility which could appeal to them and Mr Davies says his revamp has tested well in market research. That would make me nervous. When, in 1986, I started to turn the Sunday Times into Britain&apos;s first multisection newspaper in the glorious post-Wapping freedom from print union tyranny, all the market research and opinion polling said that people didn&apos;t want multisection newspapers, as did every media pundit and fashionable commentator. The Observer, Sunday Telegraph and Sindy even ran TV campaigns attacking the size of the new Sunday Times. Yet within a year it was outselling the combined circulation of its two biggest rivals, all the other Sunday heavies had moved to their own multisection formats and the Saturdays were preparing to do likewise. I could see the new Sindy working if it came with a price advantage: you get less but you pay less, which could be attractive to those with hectic Sunday schedules who find its rivals too formidable. Yesterday&apos;s relaunched Sindy was on sale for only \u00a31, which makes it an attractive proposition. But that was described as an &quot;introductory cover price&quot; and my understanding is that it will return to \u00a31.80 next Sunday, on a par with the Observer and Sunday Telegraph and only 20p less than the giant Sunday Times. If this interesting experiment is to succeed Tony O&apos;Reilly will have to dig deeper into his pockets and keep the price at a pound. \u00b7 Andrew Neil is chief executive of Press Holdings Media, which publishes titles including the Spectator, chairman of Dubai-based ITP, and presenter of BBC shows including This Week and Daily Politics \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.

In a television interview today, Haji Mansour Dadullah said the al-Qaida leader had expressed sympathy for the death of his brother, Mullah Dadullah, who was killed by US forces last month. Mullah Dadullah was the Taliban&apos;s top military commander and leading public figure. He was notorious for orchestrating massacres, kidnappings, beheadings and suicide bombings, and would frequently boast to the media about attacks he had organised. The one-legged militant leader was killed during fighting in Helmand, the province in southern Afghanistan where British troops are based, something Nato said later had dealt the insurgency a &quot;serious blow&quot;. Speaking from Afghanistan, Haji Mansour Dadullah told Al-Jazeera television station that Bin Laden had said he was keeping a low media profile to maintain his safety. &quot;These are just military tactics. He prefers not to appear [in public] because if he appeared in the media or met people he might face danger,&quot; he said. &quot;He is alive, active and well.&quot; The last message purportedly from Bin Laden to the media was an audio eulogy in June last year following the killing of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the al-Qaida leader in Iraq. Haji Mansour Dadullah claimed he had also been in contact with Bin Laden. He told the Dubai-based broadcaster that he had urged Bin Laden not to meet anyone and &quot;to stay in hiding and continue to give directives ... so that al-Qaida stays active in Afghanistan and the world&quot;.

It was not clear when the interview was recorded. According to Reuters, Mullah Dadullah has been replaced as the Taliban&apos;s commander by his relatively unknown brother, Mullah Bakht Mohammad. Mullah Dadullah, who was close to the Taliban&apos;s fugitive leader Mullah Omar, was said to have been cornered after he was betrayed by associates. The US believes that Bin Laden, who had his 50th birthday in March, is hiding in the mountains on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border; the most popular current theory is that he is in Pakistan&apos;s tribal belt. There are mixed views about whether Bin Laden has significant health problems, particularly with his kidneys.

It revealed that Abu Zubaydah, believed to be a senior al-Qaida member, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a suspected mastermind of the September 11 attacks, were held and interrogated in Poland. None of the prisoners had access to the Red Cross and many were subjected to what George Bush has called the CIA&apos;s &quot;enhanced&quot; interrogation, which critics have condemned as torture. The report said that detainees had been subjected to months of solitary confinement, constant shackling in cramped cells and poor food. They were also said to have been kept naked for weeks and exposed to extremes of temperature to prevent sleep. The report said that within weeks of the 9/11 attacks, Nato signed an agreement with the US that allowed civilian jets used by the CIA during its so-called extraordinary rendition programme to move across member states&apos; airspace. Dick Marty, a Swiss senator who ran the investigation, said in his report that the &quot;the highest state authorities were aware of the CIA&apos;s illegal activities on their territories&quot;. Politicians from Poland and Romania, as well as a spokesman for the CIA, have rejected the findings of the investigation. The report stated: &quot;Large numbers of people have been abducted from various locations across the world and transferred to countries where they have been persecuted and where it is known that torture is common practice. &quot;Still others have simply disappeared for indefinite periods and have been held in secret prisons, including in member states of the Council of Europe, the existence and operations of which have been concealed ever since.&quot; It said the rendition, abduction and detention of terrorist suspects always took place outside the territory of the United States, where such actions &quot;would no doubt have been ruled unlawful and unconstitutional&quot;. &quot;Obviously, these actions are also unacceptable under the laws of European countries, which nonetheless tolerated them or colluded actively in carrying them out.&quot; Mr Marty also accused European countries of obstructing &quot;the search for the truth&quot; by invoking the concept of &quot;state secrets&quot;. &quot;This criticism applies to Germany and Italy, in particular,&quot; his report said. Mr Marty&apos;s report said collaboration by US allies was critical to the secret detention programme, which took place within the framework of Nato&apos;s security policy. &quot;While it is likely that very few people in the countries concerned, including in the governments themselves, knew of the existence of the centres, we have sufficient grounds to declare that the highest state authorities were aware of the CIA&apos;s illegal activities on their territories.&quot; &quot;High-value detainees&quot; were held in Poland at the Stare Kiejkuty intelligence training base, Me Marty cited confidential sources as saying. Americans had full control of the detainees, the report said. Mr Marty claimed the United States offered &quot;formidable&quot; support for Romania&apos;s bid to join Nato in exchange for cooperation. A Polish foreign ministry spokesman said Mr Marty did not offer &quot;any concrete proof&quot;. &quot;There were no secret prisons in Poland,&quot; he said. A Romanian spokesman said the credibility of Mr Marty&apos;s sources &quot;cannot be assessed&quot;. A CIA spokesman, Paul Gimigliano, said: &quot;While I&apos;ve yet to see the report, Europe has been the source of grossly inaccurate allegations about the CIA and counterterrorism.&quot; In Germany, a government spokesman, Thomas Steg, strongly rejected the accusation that it hindered the probe. The full extent of British logistic support for the extraordinary rendition programme was first disclosed by the Guardian, which reported in September 2005 that aircraft operated by the CIA had flown in and out of UK civilian and military airports hundreds of times. There were at least 10 flights - six from Kabul - to Poland between 2002 and 2005, according to the report.

Tomorrow afternoon Roger Federer, the outstanding player of his generation and winner of all the major titles except the French Open, will have the opportunity to become only the sixth player to win all four grand slam championships, thereby joining the exalted company of Rod Laver, Don Budge, Fred Perry, Roy Emerson and Andre Agassi. Not only that but Federer would hold all the major titles at the same time, a feat that only Laver (twice) and Budge have achieved. The Australian and the American managed it in the calendar year, the so-called grand slam. For the purists that is the greatest achievement but in a modern age of such immense competition and strength in depth the Federer quartet, which began with his third Wimbledon title last year, would be colossal. To achieve it he will have to beat Rafael Nadal, the man who defeated him in last year&apos;s final. After Federer had dispatched Nikolay Davydenko yesterday, the Spaniard defeated Novak Djokovic 7-5, 6-4, 6-2. Last month the Swiss defeated Nadal for the first time on clay, although the courts in Hamburg bear no relation to those here. Davydenko, the world No4, had lost eight previous meetings with Federer between 2002 and the US Open semi-final last year. It would have been understandable if the Russian&apos;s inferiority complex had prevented him even leaving the locker room and taking to the Philippe Chatrier Court, so there was a good deal of owl-like blinking among the fans who watched the beginning of the semi-final rather than linger over their lunch when the Russian won the opening two games and then served for a 5-3 lead. This was not the Federer of blissful execution and languid dominance. Davydenko scurried around the clay like a man who had been told this might be the last match he ever played. And not for a minute was he prepared to compromise. The Russian had clearly decided that the only way to beat Federer for the first time was to go for broke and he threw everything at the world No1. A little more patience might ultimately have brought Davydenko victory, too, for he had the opportunity to have won all three sets. But just when he most needed to deliver the telling winner, he missed. Such was the pressure he was playing under; such is the influence Federer exerts even when he is not playing particularly well. And he was not. But he won 7-5, 7-6, 7-6 and that was everything he wanted. There were, of course, moments of exquisite brilliance - a forehand service return from a grotesquely wide position that flew past Davydenko and landed plumb in the corner, a sliced backhand from behind the baseline that curved just over the net and landed like a falling autumn leaf before the Russian had so much as half a chance to move forward. Here was the disguise and sleight of hand that have earned Federer friends and admirers worldwide as he has swept to 10 grand slam titles - four at Wimbledon and three apiece in Australia and the United States. However, these moments of sublime talent and skill were relatively scarce. Just as Davydenko was making mistakes in trying to force the issue, so did Federer, particularly on the forehand. That shot could never be remotely described as ugly but here was waywardness to wince at. And in the second set his serve also went awry as he pressed for cheap and quick points. The crowd grew ever edgier. This was not what they wanted to see on a full stomach, the unexpected tension doing nothing for the digestion. They need not have worried. Whenever Davydenko engineered a position of maximum opportunity, the old feeling of inferiority appeared to kick in, never more so than in the two tie-breaks. Still, Federer never sustained the imperious sweep that had disposed of Spain&apos;s Tommy Robredo in the quarter-finals. &quot;There&apos;s days you can do it, days you can&apos;t,&quot; he said. &quot;Nikolay is not the greatest server, so you always expect to come back. The first set was key. Instead of being down a double break, I came back and broke him. And that was basically the way it was going to be, too, in the second and third set. You have to always stay with your opponent so that, if he does mess it up, then you&apos;re right there to take advantage.&quot; And Davydenko messed it up. Federer was watched from the players&apos; box by Belgium&apos;s reigning French Open champion, Justine Henin; he will watch her final against Serbia&apos;s Ana Ivanovic today. &quot;I know I&apos;m in great shape so I can prepare perfectly, and I&apos;ve got my game plan ready,&quot; said Federer, who is a match and a game plan away from tennis immortality.

Griffith, a former welterweight and middleweight champion, knew what would happen if his private life collided with his boxing life. The most notorious clash came in March 1962, during the weigh-in before his third match against Benny Paret for the welterweight title. Paret directed a homosexual slur at Griffith, whose trainer, Gil Clancy, instructed him not to react. As usual, Griffith obeyed. The bout was televised and millions watched as Griffith recaptured the title after he sent Paret slithering down the ropes and onto the canvas for a 12th-round technical knockout. Paret died several days later. &apos;They could have stopped the fight at any time,&apos; said William Henderson, founding president of the Stonewall Veterans&apos; Association, a group made up of several participants in the 1969 uprising in Greenwich Village that started the modern gay-rights movement. &apos;It&apos;s not Emile&apos;s fault that they allowed it to go on too long. It was a grudge fight and he set a precedent there, about not calling someone, a gay person, a slur word. That should be monumental in gay history. &apos;Now when an athlete comes out,&apos; Henderson added, &apos;they&apos;re regarded as being a hero to the community.&apos; Simply by frequenting the clubs, Henderson said, &apos;Emile did that a long time ago. When are they going to declare him a hero?&apos; Griffith, 69, was due to ride in the parade of champions at the international boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, New York, yesterday, as he has done almost every year since he was inducted in 1990. On 24 June Griffith is committed to taking part in another parade - the Gay Pride march down Fifth Avenue. Before last week&apos;s interview with the New York Times, Griffith had never said unequivocally that he was gay. But last week at his home in Hempstead on Long Island, he said: &apos;Yes, I&apos;m gay. I give up. I give up trying to explain it.&apos; His concentration lapsed occasionally and his memory often failed - the effect of 112 professional fights over 20 years and a brutal mugging in 1992 - but he easily remembered the distinction between the boxing and gay subcultures and how he managed to navigate between them while he was in his prime. &apos;My fights came first,&apos; said Griffith. &apos;But when I had my free time, sometimes I&apos;d go to gay clubs.&apos; Aware that being seen carried the risk of being outed, he guarded his privacy as best he could. &apos;I was always worried,&apos; he said. &apos;I&apos;d never go alone. I&apos;d always go with my friends, they made sure no one would bother me.&apos; SPECIAL OLYMPICS Final preparation Special Olympics Great Britain chairman Lawrie McMenemy and former Olympic sprinter Darren Campbell are supporting the 159-strong SOGB team in Manchester this weekend for the team&apos;s last training session ahead of the World Summer Games in Shanghai.

SAILING Alinghi setback Only conjecture aided by the evidence of other incidences can assist in predicting whether the Swiss Alinghi team will defend the America&apos;s Cup successfully, or whether the Emirates Team New Zealand can recover the trophy it lost four years ago. On Friday, in light winds, Alinghi raced unofficially against Luna Rossa, the beaten finalist in the challenger selection series for the Louis Vuitton Cup and the result was as unexpected as the fact of a challenger helping the defender in the final stages of practice. After two aborted races, merely used as starting practice, Alinghi was trounced. Before the surprise defeat sail trimmer Simon Daubney had expressed quiet confidence. &apos;We haven&apos;t seen anything to make us otherwise, he said on Thursday. Whether he would be as confident now is not known.

That meant a play-off with France&apos;s Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rem\u00e9sy, who hit a superb closing 64 to set the clubhouse target on 16 under. The players returned to the 18th and this time it was Rem\u00e9sy who faltered, his approach to the par five finding the rocks on the edge of the water surrounding the green.

I was fortunate that I got into a play-off and still had a chance. My brain was pretty scrambled signing my scorecard but a couple of good words from my caddie gathered my thoughts a little bit. He told me to remember my play-off record, having won Dubai and the Australian Masters in extra holes.I lost in Holland to Simon Dyson but it&apos;s nice to make it three out of four.&quot; Green led by three shots overnight but fell one behind after a four-shot swing in the space of a few seconds. The left-hander found heavy rough off the 3rd tee, failed to find the green and then three-putted to run up a double-bogey six, and moments later heard the roar from the group ahead as Jim\u00e9nez holed his second shot to the 5th for an eagle two to jump into the lead. Green bounced back with birdies from on the 5th and 6th to regain the lead on 15 under par before the weather intervened. On the resumption Jim\u00e9nez bogeyed the 8th and, despite a birdie on the 9th, it was Rem\u00e9sy who came out of the chasing pack with five birdies in six holes from the 11th. The 43-year-old narrowly missed for another on the 18th but was happy with his performance after making three cuts in the first 13 events of the season. Rem\u00e9sy won the French Open in 2004 and 2005 but admitted he had slacked off after those successful seasons. &quot;I did my best so I am pretty happy about what I&apos;ve achieved after the last few months. I didn&apos;t work, I didn&apos;t focus on my game after the great time I had in 2004 and 2005. I was a little tired and just practised enough, I thought my talent would be enough to keep me in contention. The level is so high now, if you don&apos;t work hard it&apos;s like the train has already left and you are still standing on the platform.&quot; Yorkshire&apos;s Georgina Simpson, meanwhile, had her best result on the Ladies&apos; European Tour this season when she finished third after a final round 73 in yesterday&apos;s KLM Ladies&apos; Open at Eindhovensche in the Netherlands. Gwladys Nocera, the French Solheim Cup player, led from start to finish to claim the \u00a317,000 prize and her fourth victory on the Ladies European Tour. Nocera opened the tournament with a course-record 64 and closed with a 67 for 10 under par and finished two ahead of compatriot Virginie Lagoutte-Clement (69).

Her round included eight bogeys and two double-bogeys. &quot;I just have to be patient with myself,&quot; said Wie, who had been sidelined for four months with a broken left wrist and tendinitis in her right wrist.

It&apos;s the last few days of your holiday and you&apos;ve finally begun to unwind. The worst of the bags under your eyes have all but disappeared and you can almost last a morning without a thought of what might be going on back home. And then ... you get back to work and it all goes pear-shaped. Most people haven&apos;t even noticed you&apos;ve been gone, the rest are pissed off you&apos;ve brought back such rubbish biscuits, your email queue is a long, red hell and you really can&apos;t imagine how you are going to last until lunch without walking out. Within hours, your holiday isn&apos;t so much a distant memory as a false consciousness. You might just as well have never gone. At least that&apos;s always been my experience. Until just recently, when I got back from a trip to South Africa and discovered - much to my amazement - that I was still feeling quite chilled a couple of weeks later. I kept waiting to feel the usual pangs of low-level misery and bitterness, but they remained curiously out of reach. I even managed the odd night&apos;s uninterrupted sleep. It was all worryingly anxiety-free. So what was going on? Perhaps the main difference came before I&apos;d even left to go on holiday. Normally I&apos;m counting down the days in anticipation, but this time I really didn&apos;t want to go away that much. Not because I was so in love with my job that I couldn&apos;t bear to leave the office, but because I couldn&apos;t remember a single holiday that hadn&apos;t been in some way disappointing. There was the building site in France, the building site in Dubai, the building site in Cyprus - I think we&apos;re detecting a pattern here - and I really wasn&apos;t expecting to have a good time. To be more precise, I wasn&apos;t even necessarily expecting to come home. The week before I left, I listened - quite by accident - to a radio programme that claimed South Africa was the third most dangerous tourist destination after Baghdad and Colombia. It was beginning to look like we&apos;d have been better off going to Angola, Darfur or Afghanistan than South Africa. Not that the thought of my own demise was particularly distressing (as a paid-up depressive, an unplanned early exit does have its upsides), but I really didn&apos;t want my wife or kids to get topped. So the mere fact that we got back alive and hadn&apos;t been car-jacked or macheted, savaged by lions or poisoned by puff adders, inspired a rare sense of joie de vivre. Under these circumstances, getting back to work understandably felt more like parole than a death sentence. It also helped that I knew precisely what I was coming back to. On previous holidays my wife had always insisted - often demanding a pre-vac contract in blood - that I made no contact with work. No phone calls, no email, no nothing. &quot;You&apos;ve just got to switch off completely,&quot; she would insist. But how can you relax when you don&apos;t know what the hell is going on? When a career-threatening email could be pinging its way into your inbox? So this time I sneaked out to an internet cafe from time to time when we were in town. And when we were out in the middle of nowhere I managed to blag access to a satellite link - all without raising the suspicions of my wife. OK, it might seem to be a lot of effort just to log in to pick up the usual spam and unwanted press releases, and I understand this isn&apos;t the approach that many shrinks and counsellors would recommend, but sometimes you have to accept your limitations. Why would a hopeless neurotic at work instantly morph into a well-adjusted human being on holiday? For me, it was definitely time well spent. Only once I knew for certain there really wasn&apos;t anything exciting going on at work could I get on with enjoying my holiday. My return to work luckily coincided with an unexpectedly warm spell of weather, which meant I could almost fool myself into believing the transition was seamless. London might be a little light on beaches, mountains, rivers and wildlife but I could still slob around in jeans, T-shirts and flip-flops at work and no one batted an eyelid - mainly because few people in the office seemed to have one open anyway. We were still a long way short of the enervating heatwave of high summer that raises any workplace tetchiness to fever pitch, but the pleasantly warm temperatures meant that most colleagues were too dozy to be too demanding. And, this, I suspect, is the critical factor. Much as you might think - or hope - that sustaining the holiday feeling is all down to you, it&apos;s actually out of your hands: your colleagues make or break your return to work. Make no mistake, your holiday will have been a source of constant resentment to those whom you left behind. At worst, your absence will have caused them a great deal of extra work and effort and, at best, will have been an unwelcome reminder that you have swanned off somewhere nice while they are cooped up indoors. So everything they do on your return is designed - under the guise of sincerity and kindness - to eradicate your holiday from the office&apos;s collective consciousness as fast as possible by way of punishment. My good luck was not that my colleagues chose to be nice to me when I got back, but that they were too relaxed themselves to have noticed I had even gone.", "tags": ["Work & careers"], "title": "John Crace on the post-holiday return to work", "sentences": ["There was the building site in France, the building site in Dubai, the building site in Cyprus - I think we&apos;re detecting a pattern here - and I really wasn&apos;t expecting to have a good time."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/jun/11/careers.theguardian2", "publicationDate": "2007-06-11T22:41:59Z"}, {"article": "Mining stocks came to the rescue of the market today, after shares seemed to be heading lower in early trading.

Clearly, George Gershwin never tried to pack for Glastonbury. Once upon a time, it&apos;s true, summer dressing was simple. If you were posh you went to Henley and Ascot in lumpy pastels and a ropey hat. If you were a crusty student you jazzed up the combat trousers you&apos;d been wearing for two months with a bit of crappy gap-year jewellery and climbed over the fence into Glastonbury. Everyone in between threw the sarong and flip-flops they&apos;d had for five years in a suitcase and went on holiday. Oh, innocent days! When the pashmina appeared on the scene in the summer of 1998, it caused a national sensation, so slow was the pace of change back then. Fast-forward to summer 2007, when Wags go crazy for Ascot, toffs love festivals, and the fashion rules have mutated so many times that this week&apos;s Grazia contains a two-page feature on gladiator sandals, subdividing them into three distinct and not-to-be-confused subspecies. Yes, gladiator sandals, which, without exception, look completely hideous on everyone except Kate Moss, are supposed to replace flip-flops in our wardrobe - just a year after we were being encouraged to fly to Brazil for a pair of must-have Havaiana flip-flops. Oh, and they are not called gladiators any more, they are called glads. Keep up! Frankly, if there are any rocket scientists out there who fancy tackling the conundrum that is the 2007 summer wardrobe, I&apos;ll be more than happy to swap lab coats. To keep our heads above water until then, here is an elementary primer on how to wear the summer&apos;s key pieces. Hats It&apos;s Ascot next week, with Ladies&apos; Day on Thursday, and the gloves are off. Or rather, the hats are on. The rise of the Wags has breathed new life into Ascot as a social event, and after the memorable girls&apos; day out at Aintree back in April - Alex Curran&apos;s Little Lord Fauntleroy-esque frilly playsuit has rarely been far from our thoughts ever since - we are waiting with bated breath for the first ladies of football to make their entrances. Sadly, Curran is getting married tomorrow and will therefore presumably be busy donning a special honeymoon frilly playsuit in the Maldives or Dubai or somesuch. But still, Coleen McLoughlin channelling Isabella Blow: what&apos;s not to love? But as the irreplaceable Issy knew better than anyone, the best time to wear a hat is when no one else is. The right hat in a sea of hatlessness is weapons-grade sartorial ammunition. Unfortunately, it&apos;s no longer easy to find an occasion when a hat will stand out, because everyone has cottoned on to hat power. You have far more hope of turning heads by wearing a hat at most weddings than you do at Glastonbury, where you&apos;ll probably stand out more if you don&apos;t wear a faintly silly hat. For some years now, the dominant Glasto hat has been the straw cowboy one. The cowboy hat craze started in Ibiza, where it looked cool once on Zoe Ball and was reprised with increasing camp cheesiness by everyone else. Then, just when it seemed that the fake stetson, by now often pink and sequinned, had slipped all the way down the food chain to lapdancers/Big Brother contestants, it reappeared at festivals, albeit in a more wholesome, ragged, Worzel Gummidgey form. Now that the stetson has gone mainstream (they sell an excellent faux-vintage one in Marks &amp; Spencer at the moment), those wishing to use headwear to project the fact that they embody the very spirit of rock&apos;n&apos;roll are turning to the pork pie hat. This is a dangerous move, as the pork pie hat looks ugly on everyone apart from Brad Pitt, but such are the perils of life on the cutting edge. Wellies No longer just something for children and characters on The Archers, wellington boots are now more Radio 1 than Radio 4. Drag last season&apos;s skinny jeans out from the back of the wardrobe to wear underneath, or nod to Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller&apos;s current look on the set of their Dylan Thomas love-triangle film by pairing a tea dress with wellies. (Bear in mind that if you are not a dead ringer for Knightley/Miller, this is likely to result in a look more Archers frump than Hollywood glamour. But hey, it&apos;s fashionable!) At the time of going to press, long-range weather forecasts for Glastonbury are grim: rain on Friday and Saturday, showers on Sunday, rain again Monday. There will be a run on wellies next week, so if you need a pair, get moving. If you only have novelty floral-print wellies, then your need is all the greater, because they are over, my so-two-years-ago friend. Hunters are the Rolls-Royce of wellies: expensive, comfortable, classy. Pucci wellies are the equivalent of a Hummer. You can&apos;t go wrong with a black, olive or navy Hunter, but the hippest welly for 2007 is a Hunter welly in old-school yellow, the colour of fishermen&apos;s waterproofs: very Nu Rave. Shorts &quot;They&apos;ll never catch on,&quot; we cried. Er ...  Shorts have replaced the denim mini as the go-to look for the practical good-time girl. Less self-consciously come-and-get-it than a miniskirt, and less of a knicker-flashing liability on breezy days and at picnics. Can be pole-dancer short or Girl Guide long, depending on your thoughts on exploitation of female stereotypes and, of course, the state of your thighs. City shorts, however, are the pencil skirt of the shorts world and therefore have no place at festive summer occasions. Moss wore lilac silk short shorts to the wedding of Bobby Gillespie and Katy England last year, but nearer the knee is likely to be more appropriate at less rock&apos;n&apos;roll nuptials (see: common sense). Parka See under &quot;Wellies&quot; for Glastonbury forecast. A hooded parka is looking like a smart investment. Loving this season&apos;s fluoro safety colours, but if you&apos;ve already got the yellow Hunters on order, best stick with a trad olive-green parka to avoid looking like a striped ice lolly. An oversized hood is key: the drowned-rat look might have been the high point of Chris Martin&apos;s style career (remember the video for Yellow?) but nine out of 10 hairstyles prefer a cosy Kenny from South Park-style hood. Many parkas are ruined by an overabundance of drawstrings, pockets and zips. Look for as sleek a version as possible to avoid the impression of being trapped in a utility fashion timewarp circa 2001. Please note that the parka is likely to be a victim of its own success this year: in particular, festival-goers should avoid teaming their parka with wellies, shorts, gold hoop earrings and a waistcoat from the Kate Moss Topshop range, as after a drink or two your friends may find themselves unable to pick you out among the thousands of identically dressed lookeylikeys. Maxi dress The maxi dress deserves special mention as being the only item to break into this summer&apos;s fashion chart that wasn&apos;t around last year. Because it avoids exposing legs but is brutally revealing to arms, this is a look that has been seized upon by those in the late-20s to mid-30s, thighs-gone-wobbly-upper-arms-still-holding-up bracket. Early reports suggest it is already much in evidence in Ibiza this summer. Mud, and the fear of being mistaken for Joss Stone, are likely to prevent it from making an impact at Glastonbury. Don&apos;t bother wearing one to Ascot - they won&apos;t get it. Because it is the new kid on the summer wardrobe block, it doesn&apos;t really go with anything else in your summer wardrobe, unfortunately: cannot be worn with hats, shorts, wellies or parkas. In fact, come to think of it, you may need to buy Grazia and read up on gladiator sandals.", "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style"], "title": "Jess Cartner-Morley on what to wear this summer season", "sentences": ["Sadly, Curran is getting married tomorrow and will therefore presumably be busy donning a special honeymoon frilly playsuit in the Maldives or Dubai or somesuch."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/jun/15/fashion.shopping", "publicationDate": "2007-06-15T15:02:38Z"}, {"article": "HSBC is planning to halve the numbers of staff at its landmark Canary Wharf headquarters as it looks to free up space to sub-let to other tenants.

It refused to comment on the reasons for its stakebuilding, but retail analyst David McCarthy, at Citigroup, said: &quot;This could be a precursor to a full bid.&quot; He now expects Delta Two to take its holding to 29.9%. Beyond that level the Qataris would have to mount a full bid. Less than two months ago the Sainsbury family in effect blocked a potential \u00a310bn takeover bid from a private equity consortium led by CVC. The consortium, which also included Texas Pacific, KKR and Blackstone, had intended to cash in on Sainsbury&apos;s substantial portfolio of freehold property, which the company recently said was worth some \u00a38.6bn. The consortium pulled out when Lord Sainsbury of Turville, who speaks for the biggest family holding, said the company should not even consider opening its books to the private equity groups for less than 600p a share. Since then Sainsbury&apos;s has provided the more up-to-date \u00a38.6bn valuation of its property. However, the supermarket&apos;s chief executive, Justin King, has made it clear he has no intention of unlocking that value for the benefit of shareholders. As the grocer unveiled annual results last month Mr King said any attempt to force the grocer to cash in on its property assets would make it &quot;much harder for the company to compete&quot;. Analysts, however, are certain that the property portfolio is also the target of Delta Two. Yesterday shares in rivals Tesco and Morrisons also rose on speculation that they might now face renewed pressure to exploit the value of their property port- folios. Like Sainsbury&apos;s, both have ruled out big property sales. The Qatari group started building its stake in Sainsbury&apos;s at the end of April, when it snapped up a 15% stake for \u00a31.4bn. The Qatari prime minister had already bought a 1% stake earlier this year. Mr Taylor, 42, is a friend of billionaire Sir Philip Green and learned his trade as a structured finance specialist at NatWest. He has recruited several top City names to work alongside him. Last year former Barclays bank boss Sir Peter Middleton was appointed chairman of Delta Two&apos;s parent, Three Delta. Former Ernst &amp; Young chairman Nick Land and Sir Christopher Howes, who used to run the Crown Estate, are also directors. The Delta Two move came as details of a new document emerged, which explores the possibility of splitting Sainsbury in two: into a property company structured as a tax efficient real estate investment trust, or Reit, and a retail operating company. The document was prepared by bankers at Citigroup for R20, the property company controlled by entrepreneur Robert Tchenguiz, who owns at least 5% of Sainsbury&apos;s shares. Mr Tchenguiz, who used to employ Mr Taylor, is on record as saying Sainsbury&apos;s should be viewed as a property business with retail side interests. He has a already put his plans to Sainsbury&apos;s directors, but been rebuffed. The Citigroup document suggests the two businesses should be demerged and listed separately. It says new shares could be issued to &quot;supportive shareholders&quot; and that the total value of the restructure would be the equivalent of up to 717p a share. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, one of Sainsbury&apos;s financial advisers, have previously estimated the grocer could be worth up to 797p a share if it were split in two. Mr Tchenguiz yesterday made it clear he was not working with Mr Taylor, which would be against takeover panel rules, but said he was &quot;delighted&quot; to see Mr Taylor involved.

There was Sakhee winning the International Stakes by seven lengths, Doyen taking the King George, and Dubai Millennium&apos;s exceptional success at the Royal meeting in 2000. These days, though, you get the rather more downbeat tones of the pianist Jamie Cullum. It is probably a coincidence, but a reminder none the less that Godolphin could do with some new champions to boast about. When it was founded by Sheikh Mohammed in the early 90s, Godolphin was the most ambitious international racing operation ever conceived. Designed to promote Dubai around the world, it used the emirate as a base to send runners to every continent, and for much of the past 14 years the results have been hugely impressive. Just now, though, it seems that while the ambition remains as fierce as ever, the horses cannot keep up. The 2006 Flat season was the first since Godolphin&apos;s foundation in 1993 in which the team did not enjoy a success in one of Britain&apos;s Group One races. Frankie Dettori, their principal jockey, has not won a British Group One race in the royal blue silks since August 2004. Yet between 1999 and 2002 alone, Godolphin won 60 Group Ones around the world, including 20 in Britain. As racing prepares for Royal Ascot, the highlight of the domestic season, many punters are wondering where the major winners have gone, and whether they can expect them back any time soon. Newmarket thrives on rumour and speculation, and there are plenty of theories doing the rounds as to why Godolphin might be struggling at the top level. There is always the chance that a virus has taken hold in a stable, for instance, though it seems unlikely since the horses that do run tend to run well. Their strike-rate in Britain this year is nearly 30%, one of the best in the country. That also seems to contradict suggestions that they are training the horses too hard or, for that matter, not giving them enough work. There is no evidence, in fact, that anything significant has changed in the way the Godolphin team prepare since the glory days seven years ago. The simple fact is that no amount of exercise will turn a Group Three horse into a Group One horse. Buy enough young horses with the right sort of breeding, though, and probability suggests that there will be one or two top-notchers at the summit. These are the ones that seems to be missing at the moment. They need a good winner, badly. And if it is to arrive at Ascot next week then Ramonti, who runs in the Queen Anne Stakes on the opening day, is likely to be the one, given that he was beaten only a head in a Group One at Newbury last month. Yet he is a five-year-old, and it is in the three-year-old department that Godolphin look particularly bare, precisely two years after Sheikh Mohammed decided to stop buying the offspring of Coolmore&apos;s stallions at the major yearling sales. Coincidence? They can only hope so, since their current crop of juveniles - the Classic generation of 2008 - was purchased using the same policy. Wherever the top-class Godolpin horses have gone, it is not just the punters who miss them. Racing as a whole thrives on competition, particularly at the top level, where the investment required to succeed, in terms of both money and effort, is staggering. Without at least two major powers to contend for most of the main events, it can all become a little repetitive, like Real Madrid without Barcelona. The sport needs a balance of power. Godolphin has provided that balance for almost 15 years as the only racing operation to compete with the Irish owner John Magnier, whose empire is founded on the Coolmore stud, with Aidan O&apos;Brien to prepare their horses. They have also campaigned their horses with a long-term view, much to the delight of racegoers who hate to see the best performers sent off to stud at the first opportunity. Even Coolmore, where stud revenues are everything, has followed Godolphin&apos;s lead in recent years and kept horses such as High Chaparral, the 2002 Derby winner, in training after their Classic season. Taking the long-term view has enabled Godolphin to ride out previous fallow periods, such as the 1997 season, when its global Group One haul amounted to the King George at Ascot. A year later the team had eight, including two English Classics. This time, though, there seems to be less long-term, positive thinking. Simon Crisford, normally the most helpful racing manager, said this week that he did not want to be drawn into &quot;a big piece about Ascot and Godolphin&quot;, which suggests that expectations are unusually low. It is worth remembering that last season Godolphin did not win a Group One outside Dubai until the middle of August, but picked up seven from that point until the end of the year. Even the most powerful strings go through lean periods, and no other stable has as much of the necessary money or patience if they need to identify a problem and then solve it.", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Godolphin"], "title": "So where have all the Godolphin winners gone?", "sentences": ["There was Sakhee winning the International Stakes by seven lengths, Doyen taking the King George, and Dubai Millennium&apos;s exceptional success at the Royal meeting in 2000.", "Designed to promote Dubai around the world, it used the emirate as a base to send runners to every continent, and for much of the past 14 years the results have been hugely impressive.", "It is worth remembering that last season Godolphin did not win a Group One outside Dubai until the middle of August, but picked up seven from that point until the end of the year."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2007/jun/15/sowherehaveallthegodolphi", "publicationDate": "2007-06-15T23:44:18Z"}, {"article": "Manduro will not be the sort of mouthwatering double-figure price he was when running in the Prince Of Wales&apos;s Stakes at last year&apos;s Royal Ascot meeting, but he is in sparkling form for his return visit after two easy wins, whereas a year ago he was in the middle of a frustrating run of placed efforts. A year ago Andre Fabre&apos;s son of Monsun was a little unlucky in finishing third behind Ouija Board, becoming trapped on the rail as the winner swept down the outside. This time round, Manduro has swept away the opposition at Newmarket and Longchamp in the style of an improved animal. His latest demolition of in-form Turtle Bow means that prices above 4-1 for the Prince Of Wales&apos;s (3.45, Wednesday) need to be snapped up. Not that we should expect things to be easy against smart opponents. Red Rocks was impressive when carrying a 7lb penalty to success at Sandown and looks the biggest danger, with little to choose between Dylan Thomas and Notnowcato. Sir Percy ran poorly in the Coronation Cup at Epsom, but should not be wholly ruled out as his form in Dubai&apos;s Sheema Classic in the spring gives him a good chance. Much of the interest on Tuesday centres on the four-pronged Australian challenge for the King&apos;s Stand Stakes (3.05). Miss Andretti is favourite and has been much improved since joining Lee Freedman. Bentley Biscuit seems to take some time to find his stride and might be better over the extra furlong of the Golden Jubilee on Saturday (3.45), while Takeover Target, although better off at the weights than when winning last year, could no longer be as good. That leaves Magnus, a younger horse still on the upgrade, as the value bet at around 16-1. On the face of it, he is going to struggle to beat Miss Andretti, having failed against her when receiving 8lb at Caulfield in March. But the bare form does not tell the whole tale as it appears that Miss Andretti raced on a much faster strip of ground than the rest of the field. Following that run, Magnus had Bentley Biscuit back in fourth over five-and-a-half furlongs at Warwick Farm and he has impressed those who have seen him at his quarters in Newmarket since his arrival. A small bet on yet another raider, Freddie Head&apos;s Racinger, is in order in the Queen Anne Stakes (Tuesday, 4.20). He had Passager back in third at Saint-Cloud last time and that rival was racing on slower ground than Red Evie and Ramonti when third to that pair in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury. George Washington will dominate the betting for this race, but it takes a leap of faith to expect him to justify a short price on his return from failure at stud. He is superb on his day and will be hard to beat if his temperament does not get the better of him, but I would sooner be on Racinger at around 20-1 than Gorgeous George at 5-4. Cockney Rebel tries to emulate Rock Of Gibraltar by winning the English and Irish 2,000 Guineas and the St James&apos;s Palace Stakes (Tuesday, 3.45) and he has the turn of foot to see off Newmarket third and fourth, Dutch Art and Duke of Marmalade, and French Guineas winner Astronomer Royal. The Longchamp fourth, Excellent Art, was most unlucky in running and might prove the biggest threat. Pencil Hill beat You&apos;resothrilling at The Curragh and that form has been advertised by the runner-up since so Tracey Collins&apos; colt is my tip for the Coventry Stakes (Tuesday, 2.30). I&apos;d be scared of River Proud if Paul Cole lets him line up after his Newbury win on Thursday. Regal Step has been bought by Highclere for the Queen Mary (Wednesday, 4.55) and she looked the type for it when winning at Nottingham. US Ranger should enjoy the seven furlongs of Wednesday&apos;s Jersey Stakes (2.30), while it is hard to oppose last year&apos;s winner Yeats in Thursday&apos;s Gold Cup (3.45). Pentecost hardly knows how to run a bad race at Ascot and will be much better over the mile of the Hunt Cup (Wednesday, 4.20) than he was at the seven furlongs of the Victoria Cup last time. Shop around as some bookmakers offer five places for this handicap and Pentecost should be backed each-way. Andrew Balding&apos;s veteran won the Britannia Handicap (Thursday, 4.20) five years ago and I have been waiting for his stablemate Buccellati to run over a straight mile since the start of the season. He has shown up well at Sandown, Newbury and Epsom and is going to be one of the best bets of the meeting now that he has his optimum conditions. Another good handicap bet is Enjoy The Moment in the Ascot Stakes (Tuesday, 4.55). He ran on well for third in the Chester Cup. Mark Johnston&apos;s horses look as though they are peaking at the right time for a meeting at which he does well, but his multiple entries make life hard this far in advance. For instance, in Thursday&apos;s King George V Handicap - a race he has won in three of the last five years - he has 13 entries and he will have several in another of his favourites, Friday&apos;s Queen&apos;s Vase. I will have to pass on those races, but keep a close eye on Johnston&apos;s final line-up.", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "title": "Horse racing: In-form Manduro to make mark for Fabre", "sentences": ["Sir Percy ran poorly in the Coronation Cup at Epsom, but should not be wholly ruled out as his form in Dubai&apos;s Sheema Classic in the spring gives him a good chance."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jun/17/horseracing.news1", "publicationDate": "2007-06-16T23:01:46Z"}, {"article": "Standard Chartered is this week launching a private bank aimed at the millions of newly rich in Asia and the Middle East.

It plans to expand into another 10 markets over the next three years, probably including Taiwan, Indonesia and Pakistan. The London-listed international bank has a strong presence in emerging markets and wants to home in on the growing number of people who have joined the ranks of the wealthy.

But having spent the past 11 months treading every surface apart from the green stuff, and with Wimbledon starting a week today, her decision to enter a tournament that has a knack of derailing her preparations for the season&apos;s third grand slam must be questioned. An almost masochistic smile plays on the 27-year-old&apos;s face, though, when she confirms her fitness for the International Women&apos;s Open in Eastbourne this week, the last stop before SW19 and an event in which she has lasted a total of two days in as many years. Few of the world&apos;s top players would consider drawing inspiration from being knocked out of any competition but Mauresmo&apos;s opening-match defeats in Sussex - 6-4, 6-4 to Vera Douchevina two years ago and 6-3, 2-6, 3-6 to Nathalie Dechy last year - have had a galvanising effect. In 2005 she regrouped to go through Wimbledon without losing a set until she was pipped for a place in the final by Lindsay Davenport, and last year she lifted the title with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Justine Henin. Since then she has won only one tournament - the Antwerp Open on carpet - and her build-up has again been disrupted, by an operation for appendicitis, which sidelined her for the best part of two months, and by a 1\u00bcin tear in her right thigh sustained during her third round defeat in the French Open. Since her surgery on March 13 the world No4 has been limited to four tournaments. Yet she remains confident of retaining the Wimbledon title. &quot;Last year before Wimbledon I was not very positive about my game, about the way I was feeling and about the way I was mentally on the court,&quot; she said. &quot;This year I&apos;m happy to be back here but with not as much tennis behind me - two different conditions but some questions still about how I feel and about how I can do. But the experience has to show at some point and hopefully it will be next week.&quot; Mauresmo was speaking within hours of landing in Britain. Whereas many would head straight for their hotel - or in her case the house she rents each year - to rest, the French player could not hide her excitement at being back. &quot;Every time I enter the [Wimbledon] area it&apos;s really something different, something special that I cannot really explain,&quot; she said. &quot;I&apos;ve been proud for a year to have been the defending champion of Wimbledon and I guess it&apos;s going to be even more emotional for me when I step on to a court to practise at Wimbledon for the first time. I&apos;m really looking forward to going back - happy, proud and confi dent being back on the grass.&quot; Mauresmo&apos;s affection for grass courts dates back to 1996 when, as a promising teenager with thick glasses and a fine one-handed backhand, she won junior Wimbledon. She has since reached three semi-finals but it was not until last year&apos;s triumph that the effectiveness of her powerful serve-volley game really came to fruition. &quot;The first time I step on a grass court is always very special and I enjoy it,&quot; she said. &quot;It requires different weapons in terms of physical training but I like it, it suits me pretty well. Considering that not a lot of players play like me on grass I think I have a big weapon.&quot; One weapon many still refuse to include in Mauresmo&apos;s armoury is mental strength. The fact that she has fallen in the semi-finals at five slams, with her maiden victory in the Australian Open last year secured by Henin&apos;s early retirement because of a bout of gastroenteritis, hardly works in her defence. But Wimbledon was a chance to prove people wrong. &quot;I said, &apos;Don&apos;t talk about my nerves any more,&apos;&quot; she joked, repeating a line she came out with in her press conference after conquering Wimbledon. &quot;The win last year probably showed the media and the crowd in general that I was able to win the big ones and go to the end. Even though I was already convinced about that, I think I still had to prove it to people. Was it also important to show my opponents? Looking back at it, probably yes.&quot; Despite pointing out that the grass is playing slower each year, to the detriment of hard hitters such as Venus and Serena Williams, Mauresmo thinks the American pair, &quot;especially Serena&quot;, will pose the biggest threat to her crown. &quot;We saw how strong she was in Australia and in Miami,&quot; she said. &quot;When she is playing well and with confidence she is always a big threat, as well as Venus. With these two guys you never really know what to expect. We&apos;ve also seen Jelena Jankovic playing really, really well for almost a year now; she has stepped up to another level.&quot; Mauresmo denied that winning Wimbledon had altered her life, but added that her &quot;bank balance has changed a little bit&quot; and the incentive to succeed again this year is greater than ever before. For the first time the women&apos;s champion will earn the same prize money as the men&apos;s, \u00a3700,000, which for the women is a 12% increase on \u00a3625,000 last year. &quot;I always thought it was a matter of time before all the grand slams would make that step,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s really a reflection of how society should be and the fact that women and men are paid the same. We are always going to find some people who say, &apos;Yes, but the men play five sets,&apos; but we work and practise every day as hard as any other player, whether it&apos;s a man or a woman.&quot; Mauresmo will hope her lack of practice before this Wimbledon does not prevent her from achieving such parity.

It won&apos;t be so easy this time. Leading the private equity pack is Damon Buffini, the head of Permira, which has eaten up the AA, Birds Eye and Homebase. With an estimated wealth of \u00a3200m, he can afford the very best consultants. The committee, on the other hand, has just one economic researcher on any given report, but needs the sharpest armoury of fact and argument. These under-resourced Commons committees tackling great issues and multibillion-pound interests urgently need strengthened power and capacity in Gordon Brown&apos;s constitutional review. But the committee may have one advantage: City caesars are not used to challenge or contradiction. Up in their glass towers, rulers of both public and private companies are surrounded by obsequious courtiers in a world far removed from the rough and tumble of politics. They rarely appear in public to be called to account. How often do you see one on Newsnight? They largely escape scrutiny of their private or working lives: we don&apos;t even know where they are domiciled. Compare the reams of mindless gossip about any minor politician with the puny reporting of these City men of greater power. But tomorrow that may be their undoing when - easily outraged by unaccustomed impertinence, easily exposed as dwellers on some other gilded planet - they face fierce political questioning. The word is they will stand their ground, even though the ground has shifted beneath them since Nicholas Ferguson of SVG Capital conceded that their 10% tax rate was less than a cleaner pays. But Ronald Cohen, a venture capitalist and Gordon Brown&apos;s adviser, is now saying that - contrary to reports - he didn&apos;t support Ferguson&apos;s statement. And yesterday Guy Hands, another private equity panjandrum, was sent out to defend the tax break as &quot;risk capital&quot;. They will lay out hard-to-check figures showing what the nation gains. No doubt they will dismiss criticism as the politics of envy. But one man&apos;s tax avoidance falls on everyone else. They risk overplaying their hand. They will threaten darkly that if they have to pay a fair tax, they will all flee London, though only some 40 of private equity&apos;s top 200 earners are domiciled or resident in the UK for tax purposes. And plenty of serious City voices (including Ferguson) say few would actually go: they prefer London to Dubai, Dublin or Geneva as a well-regulated place to do business. (Little people&apos;s taxes make it so.) But the danger of under-regulated private equity runs deeper. Yesterday the Bank of England added a note of caution to the warnings already issued by the IMF, the Financial Services Authority and Standard and Poor&apos;s: ever more risky lending by banks on too little security means the collapse of just one deal involving several banks could trigger disaster. Perverse tax breaks that inflate this bubble put everyone at risk - jobs, pensions and prosperity. It&apos;s no surprise that the Treasury has an internal review on overleveraged deals of all kinds. There is a haemorrhage of tax revenue from the exchequer every time a profitable company is turned into a debt-laden one where all its debts can be offset against income. The back of a monstrous queue at Heathrow at 5.45am last Friday, heading for a meeting in Glasgow, was a good time to contemplate the fate of BAA, bought up by Ferrovial last year with many billions of debt. Now they must sweat every asset, with all space used for shops and no incentive to open extra security lanes. The public suffers but can do nothing, and the Treasury suffers whenever once profitable companies offset debt against profit instead of paying tax. Angela Eagle, one of the Treasury committee&apos;s toughest interrogators, points out that now Boots has been bought for \u00a310bn on a \u00a37bn debt, it can offset \u00a3500m of debt charges and pay the exchequer zero - instead of paying tax on the \u00a3480m profit it made in 2005. We are all losers every time this happens. Britain could, like other countries, prevent overindebted takeovers. The five princes will mount a stout defence. They&apos;ll deny private equity takeovers have asset-stripped companies such as Debenhams, sending them limping back on to the market. They will highlight their successes, the jobs created not the jobs lost. But the committee should look at the deeper cultural effect of the private equity whirlwind. Last week Terry Smith, the chairman of financial brokers Collins Stewart, opened fire on the whole regulatory framework of public companies. Writing in the Financial Times, he lashed out at criticism of top pay and bonuses at company AGMs, blaming &quot;annoying trivia&quot; from the Association of British Insurers, (ABI), charities, the Church of England and pension funds grinding their &quot;socio-political axe&quot;. &apos;If there is one thing more annoying than this focus on uncapped pay, it is the insistence on getting companies to produce a litany of platitudes on environmental and social matters,&quot; he writes. And he ends with a chilling claim that many more public companies will go private to avoid this &quot;tosh&quot;. He&apos;s right. There is no longer a level playing field. He wants to level down, but it&apos;s time to make private equity level up. Peter Montagnon, head of the ABI - the voice of shareholder interest - warns that this private bonanza is seducing the best brains from public companies. He says a level playing field means you can&apos;t have stamp duty paid on public, but not private, share transactions, or a 10% tax regime for private equity owners and no need to bother with transparency or accountability. Tomorrow the five princes will play their trump card - intimidating the government with the threat that London will lose its pre-eminence as cash and capitalists flee. But it&apos;s time to face them down, call their bluff and regulate their unjust advantage before their pernicious buccaneering destroys the culture of corporate social responsibility.  polly.toynbee@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Economic policy", "Politics", "Business", "UK news"], "title": "Polly Toynbee: Stick it to these City caesars - for the sake of the nation", "sentences": ["And plenty of serious City voices (including Ferguson) say few would actually go: they prefer London to Dubai, Dublin or Geneva as a well-regulated place to do business."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/19/comment.economy", "publicationDate": "2007-06-18T23:09:13Z"}, {"article": "Time and commerce have done for the QE2, the last survivor of the era when luxury passenger liners looked like ships and not like floating apartment blocks. The ship, which has carried more than 2.5 million passengers since it was launched by the Queen on the Clyde in 1967 - making it the longest-serving in the history of the Cunard line - has been sold to Dubai for \u00a350m. It will be moored off the Middle East coast as a hotel, shops, and a museum of its own glamorous history. The QE2 has been a record breaker both for speed and endurance, but after 40 years and 5.5m miles, keeping it at sea for much longer would have started to cost serious money. Historic ships experts yesterday thought Cunard had got a remarkably good price, given that much more money will now have to be spent after the new owners promised to restore the original glamorous interiors, which are a hymn to the swinging 60s, decked out in plastic, brightly-coloured leather, and a bar with a scarlet baby grand piano. Cunard is selling to Istithmar, the investment arm of Dubai World, owned by the government of Dubai. In 2009 the QE2 will become a floating &quot;hotel, retail and entertainment destination&quot; at the Palm Jumeirah, the enormous palm-shaped artificial island being developed as a complex of tourist hotels and apartments, also by Dubai World. Its chairman, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, said: &quot;She is coming to a home where she will be cherished.&quot; Carol Marlow, president of Cunard, said yesterday: &quot;We are delighted that when her legendary career as an ocean liner ends, there will continue be a permanent home for her that will enable future generations to continue to experience fully both the ship and her history.&quot; Over 40 years the QE2&apos;s passengers have included most of the crowned heads of Europe, politicians including Lady Thatcher and Nelson Mandela, astronaut Buzz Aldrin and explorer Sir John Blashford-Snell, stars including Vera Lynn, most of the Beatles individually, Mick Jagger and David Bowie. The 40th anniversary cruise in September, back to the Clyde where the ship was built - now almost empty of shipping - was already sold out, but tickets will now be snapped up for all its remaining voyages. &quot;She was a wonderful thing, marvellously ship-like, beautiful sweeping line,&quot; said Martyn Heighton, director of National Historic Ships, the organisation which compiles the register of the national collection of important old ships. &quot;But at 40, she really was getting on a bit. Basically ships only have 30 years in them, whether they&apos;re a modern passenger ship or a timber warship - after that keeping them going gets very, very expensive.&quot; Dubai World also includes Dubai Ports World, the company which won a bid battle last year for control of the British company P&amp;O, which operated almost 30 ports around the world. DPW paid \u00a33.9bn for the 165-year-old P&amp;O but the takeover ran into a storm of political protest in the US, where it was claimed the sale of terminals at six US ports, including New York, could have national security implications. Amid calls for the deal to be blocked, the US federal government gave Dubai&apos;s acquisition of P&amp;O its blessing. But in response to the opposition DWP agreed to sell the US operations to an American company in a hastily arranged deal. Yesterday Sultan bin Sulayem said that as a maritime nation Dubai understood the importance of the ship. &quot;QE2 is without a doubt one of the wonders of the maritime world, and is easily the most famous serving liner in the world today. I am delighted we will be able to create a home for her on the newest wonder of the world, the Palm Jumeirah.&quot; While the vessel will doubtless be magnificently restored, one feature will have to go - the Player&apos;s Club casino falls foul of Dubai&apos;s strict anti-gambling laws. The hot, dry climate should help in the long-term preservation of the ship, Mr Heighton said. &quot;I never actually sailed on her,&quot; he added sadly. &quot;But I did once wave to her as she came into port.&quot; Timeline September 1967 The 70,000-tonne ship is officially launched at John Brown Shipyard on the Clyde by the Queen. April 1969 Maiden voyage to Las Palmas. QE2 goes on to cross Atlantic 800 times, and circumnavigate globe 24 times. January 1971 Rescues 500 passengers from burning French ship Antilles. May 1982 Sets out for South Atlantic in May carrying 3,000 troops, and 650 volunteer crew, returning safely to Southampton the following month. 1986 Steam turbine engines replaced with diesel. 1990 QE2 sets diesel-engined record for fastest Atlantic crossing: four days, six hours and 57 minutes. April 1992 Extensive repairs after hitting rocks off Massachusetts. September 1995 Survives 95ft wave during Hurricane Luis. 2004 New 150,000-tonne Queen Mary 2 takes over as Cunard flagship.

The place where he has won four of his 10 grand-slam titles feels more like home than ever. Federer&apos;s feeling of contentment is undoubtedly heightened by the fact that he usually arrives here, as he has for the past three years, fresh from the clay-soiled misery of defeat to Rafael Nadal at the French Open. This year he left Paris with the rest of his body, as opposed to just his heart, feeling broken and sore, and opted to miss his customary five matches at the grass-court warm-up event in Halle. He says the rest has done him good. &quot;The clay is very energy-consuming, with a lot of media, a lot of attention, a lot of build-up. Once the French Open is over, you kind of fall into a hole for a couple of days, so for me it was good just to go home for a change,&quot; said Federer yesterday. &quot;I got five days in Switzerland before Wimbledon, and that&apos;s huge. I feel good now, relaxed and mentally fresh. To me that&apos;s more important than having played matches beforehand.&quot; Instead of improving his record of 48 consecutive grass-court wins in Halle or risking the dent his confidence would have taken if he had lost his winning streak there, Federer took a week off from the taxing business of being the world&apos;s best player. &quot;The last two years, I&apos;ve played in Halle after Paris and every time I was very sore when I played at Wimbledon,&quot; he said. &quot;After playing Paris the preparation week was very tough. I was so tired and couldn&apos;t really practise much. So this year I decided to do it differently. I&apos;m sure it was the right decision. Maybe I could have played a match or two, but then I would have lost something I didn&apos;t want to.&quot; He recently bought an apartment in Zurich, to add to his homes in Basle and the training base he has in Dubai, and spent time showing it off to family and friends. &quot;I played cards with my dad, my friend and my godfather,&quot; he said. &quot;I invited some friends over to dinner. I also went walking and shopping in the city. It&apos;s nice to be able to do things like that.&quot; Not, though, as nice as the thought of winning a fifth successive Wimbledon title and matching the record Bjorn Borg set between 1976 and 1980. Federer has been getting to know Borg a little, even hitting with the Swede when they were in Dubai at the end of last year. Federer found it surreal to be trading flawless strokes from the baseline with a man who played his last match at Wimbledon before he was born. &quot;It was a bit like when I played Sampras on Centre Court at Wimbledon for the first time,&quot; Federer remembered. &quot;We were warming up and you laugh on the inside and think &apos;Look, the backhand is still the same.&apos; It&apos;s a classic.&quot; There is talk of Borg being asked to present the trophy to this year&apos;s Wimbledon men&apos;s champion but Federer, ever the conservative when it comes to his favourite tournament, would rather they stuck with the Duke of Kent. &quot;I don&apos;t think that would be a good idea, to be honest, just because I think tradition is tradition,&quot; he said. &quot;Wimbledon&apos;s always been royal and Borg wouldn&apos;t fit in with that.&quot; That said, if Federer wins his fifth Wimbledon, they could get Jordan and Peter Andre to hand him the trophy and he would not care. Right now, three days before this year&apos;s event has even started, that moment seems a long way off. &quot;It&apos;s kind of nerve-racking, every year coming back and thinking &apos;How did I do it last year?&apos;. Once you get on the court you realise how difficult it was to win every match,&quot; said Federer. &quot;I didn&apos;t lose a set until the final last year and you think &apos;OK, let&apos;s do the same thing again&apos; but it just doesn&apos;t happen this way. &quot;But it&apos;s funny, once the tournament gets under way and you get that first set of the first match, you are into the tournament and it all goes by itself. You stop thinking about these open questions. You are in the tournament groove and that&apos;s always a good sign.&quot; Until then he will just enjoy the feeling of being back where he feels he belongs. &quot;I used to follow this tournament like crazy when I was a kid,&quot; said Federer. &quot;It&apos;s been with me since I was born, basically, so to be back playing as defending champion, there is no better place to be.&quot;", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "Wimbledon", "Wimbledon 2007"], "title": "After pain of Paris king Roger feels the Wimbledon warmth", "sentences": ["Maybe I could have played a match or two, but then I would have lost something I didn&apos;t want to.&quot; He recently bought an apartment in Zurich, to add to his homes in Basle and the training base he has in Dubai, and spent time showing it off to family and friends.", "Federer has been getting to know Borg a little, even hitting with the Swede when they were in Dubai at the end of last year."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2007/jun/21/afterpainofpariskingroger", "publicationDate": "2007-06-21T23:39:59Z"}, {"article": "Not many people can boast an address in the self-styled &quot;eighth wonder of the world&quot;, but this week a British internet entrepreneur moved into his luxury mansion on a palm-shaped, man-made island off Dubai. Andrew Dukes, 43, is one of the first people to take up residence in Palm Jumeirah, made of rock blasted from nearby mountains and sand dredged from the bottom of the gulf. &quot;I got exactly what I paid for and I&apos;m very happy with it,&quot; Mr Dukes told the Associated Press, as he moved into one of the 100 mansions amid a half-mile stretch of palm trees. In the future, Mr Dukes may well rub shoulders with the members of the England football team, as David Beckham, Michael Owen and nine others bought &quot;signature villas&quot; in the resort when they visited Dubai en route to the 2002 World Cup.  Another attraction will be the QE2, which will be berthed at the resort from 2009. Although Palm Jumeirah will be tightly packed with apartments, hotels, townhouses and penthouses, Mr Dukes has not been put off. &quot;Living in London, you&apos;re absolutely on top of each other. So if you&apos;re English-European coming here, you think the plot size is more than adequate,&quot; said Mr Dukes, who spends his days kayaking and windsurfing - the water is just a few yards from his back door. His move has already more than paid off financially. Having spent $1.3m (\u00a32.6m) on his house just over a year ago, Mr Dukes has seen its value almost double. When Palm Jumeirah is completed next year, it will have about 120,000 residents and workers inhabiting an island visible from space. The development is part of a massive building boom that has changed the coastline of the United Arab Emirates, altering sea currents and breaking up the sea view from Dubai&apos;s natural beach. Demand for properties at Palm Jumeirah has been high, with Britons making up 25% of the buyers, a mix of speculators, full-time residents and holiday homeowners. The project, led by Nakheel, the property development company owned by Dubai&apos;s government, has had its problems. Settling of the island&apos;s new land delayed the scheme by a year. Nakheel solved the problem by adding more sand and hiring a Dutch firm to compact it with vibrating machines. In June, a large fire broke out in a half-built apartment building, injuring three workers. Some residents have complained about delays in getting the keys to their houses, while others say Nakheel is squeezing extra profits out of the island by building far more houses than sales brochures showed.", "tags": ["World news", "Dubai", "United Arab Emirates"], "title": "British businessman moves into the eighth wonder of the world", "sentences": ["Not many people can boast an address in the self-styled &quot;eighth wonder of the world&quot;, but this week a British internet entrepreneur moved into his luxury mansion on a palm-shaped, man-made island off Dubai.", "In the future, Mr Dukes may well rub shoulders with the members of the England football team, as David Beckham, Michael Owen and nine others bought &quot;signature villas&quot; in the resort when they visited Dubai en route to the 2002 World Cup.", "The development is part of a massive building boom that has changed the coastline of the United Arab Emirates, altering sea currents and breaking up the sea view from Dubai&apos;s natural beach.", "The project, led by Nakheel, the property development company owned by Dubai&apos;s government, has had its problems."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/22/marktran", "publicationDate": "2007-06-22T14:00:34Z"}, {"article": "Stan Kroenke has offered to underwrite a multimillion-pound transfer budget for Arsenal but the club&apos;s directors are determined to go it alone. Arsenal&apos;s capacity to compete in the transfer market has frequently been called into question and uncertainty surrounds the position of the manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, beyond the expiry of his contract in 12 months. With that in mind, Kroenke has suggested ploughing fresh funds into the club. &quot;It seems that the anxiety about Stan Kroenke and his intentions has been well documented,&quot; said a source close to the American billionaire. &quot;But he&apos;d like to support Arsenal.&quot; Kroenke&apos;s proposal was made during a summit this month involving the American, the Arsenal chairman, Peter Hill-Wood, and the club&apos;s managing director, Keith Edelman. Hill-Wood once said of Kroenke &quot;we don&apos;t need his money and we don&apos;t want his sort&quot; but he accompanied Edelman to New York 11 days ago for the first face-to-face talks with the 12.19% shareholder since he raised his stake to that level in April. Though the directors&apos; position has softened, the message was the same: Kroenke was told the club&apos;s finances are sound and extra money was not required from outside to fund player purchases. Despite the differences of opinion, both camps have described the negotiations as amicable, although each set out with different objectives. Edelman and Hill-Wood sought to persuade Kroenke to sign up to the &quot;lock-down agreement&quot; that the club&apos;s shareholder-directors have entered. That would have required from Kroenke a commitment not to increase his investment in the club for 12 months. But despite opposition from within Arsenal, the billionaire has not ruled out purchasing the club outright and his refusal to accept the lock-down will be interpreted as a reflection of urgent ambitions. There are approximately 12% of shares in the hands of hedge funds and nominee companies and a determined bid, of possibly \u00a37,000 to \u00a38,000 per share, would draw those to Kroenke. In a warning statement made at the end of April, Arsenal&apos;s largest shareholder, Danny Fiszman - who controls 24.11% of the club&apos;s equity - urged the American not to attempt a stake-building exercise, claiming &quot;over 50%&quot; of the shares were in the hands of individuals who would resist a hostile takeover. Directors fear a Glazer-style takeover where debt payments of up to \u00a360m a year are consuming profits at Manchester United. However, Kroenke was keen to impress upon Edelman and Hill-Wood that his sports company acquisitions in the US have never involved massive borrowing. &quot;Stan doesn&apos;t use gearing in his American sports investments,&quot; said the source. None the less, it seems last week&apos;s discussions failed to advance matters very far. Though both sides have been keen to play down suggestions of tensions, a joint statement expected eight days ago has been delayed by &quot;legal issues&quot;. However, sources say a conciliatory Kroenke accepted Edelman and Hill-Wood&apos;s position and did not make demands, treating the talks as a getting-to-know-you exercise. Although the size of his investment makes him the fourth-largest shareholder, Kroenke did not insist on a boardroom position. &quot;[The meeting] went perfectly well,&quot; said Hill-Wood this week. &quot;I hope we will be able to work with him in the future, just as we would with any interested people.&quot; One individual linked with the club is Mohammed Al Hashimi, a Dubai-based investor who described the Gunners this month as &quot;a very profitable club&quot;. More is now known about Kroenke, the man labelled &quot;Silent Stan&quot; in his homeland.The Arsenal Supporters&apos; Trust, which is opposed to a heavily debt-led buyout, welcomed Kroenke&apos;s reassurances over borrowings. The Trust last night urged the board to consider using a rights issue, whereby new shares are sold to raise capital for a company, which could be a vehicle for Kroenke&apos;s investment. &quot;The AST has previously raised the proposal for a limited rights issue with the Arsenal board,&quot; said a spokesman. &quot;This would see extra money going into the club, rather than to shareholders, as currently happens when new investors buy a stake in Arsenal. &quot;The huge increase in the value of the club&apos;s shares in recent years would mean that no shareholder need suffer any financial loss from this approach.&quot;", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Arsenal"], "title": "Football: Gunners reject Kroenke's offer to fund purchase of new players", "sentences": ["&quot;I hope we will be able to work with him in the future, just as we would with any interested people.&quot; One individual linked with the club is Mohammed Al Hashimi, a Dubai-based investor who described the Gunners this month as &quot;a very profitable club&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/23/newsstory.arsenal1", "publicationDate": "2007-06-22T23:45:10Z"}, {"article": "If the best horse is the one with the best form, then a Classic winner should be difficult to oppose at the Royal meeting. This, though, is the week when spring gives way to summer and hard early-season campaigns start to take their toll, and so it proved in the Coronation Stakes yesterday as the winners of the English, French and German 1,000 Guineas all succumbed to Indian Ink, who could finish only fifth in the English version at Newmarket. Finsceal Beo, Darjina and Mi Emma, the Classic winners, were tightly knit at the top of the market, with Indian Ink - who was arguably unlucky not to finish third in the English Guineas - available to back at 25-1 yesterday morning. Regular showers throughout the day saw growing confidence in Indian Ink, however, as her best form last year came with some cut in the ground and she had been backed down to 8-1 at the off. Halfway down the home straight, Finsceal Beo looked to be going like a winner as Kevin Manning waited to pounce, but she found nothing when asked and dropped away tamely like a filly in need of a good rest. Indian Ink, meanwhile, was cantering for Richard Hughes and shot clear inside the final furlong for a six-length rout, with Mi Emma, the German Guineas winner, second ahead of Darjina, the Classic winner in France. &quot;She ran her two best races on the soft last year, so it&apos;s just come right,&quot; said Richard Hannon, Indian Ink&apos;s trainer. &quot;I don&apos;t think she needs it dead soft, but just a little give is fine. She looked to be going well, but you never know with Hughesy. He sometimes looks to be hanging on to a bit and then sometimes it doesn&apos;t happen. But it certainly happened today. &quot;We&apos;ll have to sit and watch now and see how the ground goes. The Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket was the next race I was looking at, but we&apos;ll have a look in France too.&quot; Boscobel was hardly the least exposed runner in the field for the King Edward VII Stakes, but a solid front-running performance under Joe Fanning was enough to see off Lucarno, fourth home in the Derby this month, with Yellowstone, another Derby also-ran, third. It is difficult to imagine Boscobel going on from this race in the manner of Red Rocks, the narrow runner-up last year who ended up winning the Breeders&apos; Cup Turf. He might well be good enough to run in the St Leger, though, and he is a 5-1 chance (from 16-1) with Hill&apos;s to take the first running of the Doncaster Classic at the redeveloped track in September. Like so many of Mark Johnston&apos;s runners, Boscobel is deceptively difficult to pass. Lucarno, the favourite, was pressing from more than a furlong out, yet backers never had any obvious reason to think that they might collect. Whether his stamina would stretch to the extended 14 furlongs of the Leger, though, must be open to doubt, given that he is a son of Halling with plenty of American bloodlines on his dam&apos;s side. &quot;He is a horse who has gone through the ranks, starting on the all-weather, and he has proved tough as a result,&quot; Johnston said. &quot;He was in Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s second colours and I thought that the others might ignore him and so it proved as he got an easy lead.&quot; Nijoom Dubai, a 50-1 chance, was the most unlikely winner of the meeting in the Albany Stakes, holding off the 7-4 favourite You&apos;resothrilling to record the first win of a three-race career in this Group Three event. The runner-up, a full sister to Giant&apos;s Causeway, also emerged with credit as she was short of running room at a crucial stage two furlongs out.

In Frank&apos;s case, those books are The Sportswriter and Independence Day, Richard Ford&apos;s supremely eloquent expressions of suburban malaise now joined by this third (and apparently final) instalment, which sees Frank slipping a few rungs further down the aspirational ladder. He has a bladder full of radioactive ball-bearings to counter prostate cancer, his second wife has left him, and the insanity of the property market has depleted his pleasure in selling houses. It&apos;s a huge book composed of small moments, in which Ford makes the mundane so compelling that the sudden explosion of high drama at the end registers almost as a failure of nerve. But the workaday wisdom is as penetrating as ever: &quot;On and on, and on and on. The unseen exists and has properties.&quot; Frank keeps the details on file if you&apos;d like to arrange a viewing. Alfred Hickling Dream Angus, by Alexander McCall Smith (Canongate, \u00a36.99) Having produced what seems like a gazillion volumes in the No 1 Ladies&apos; Detective Agency sequence, Alexander McCall Smith seemed a likely candidate to knock off one of Canongate&apos;s variable series of updated myths. His legend of choice is the Celtic deity Angus, a sprightly, Eros-like figure whom &quot;you may spot skipping across the heather, his bag of dreams by his side, and the sight of him, just the sight, may be enough to make you fall in love&quot;. Alternately, exposure to such twee writing may just be enough to make you gag. For the most part, McCall Smith&apos;s intertwining of Gaelic myth and contemporary parables is as trite as their titles suggest: &quot;Angus Finds Out That His Father Is Not His Father&quot;; &quot;Another Boy Finds Out That His Father Is Not His Father&quot;. But it picks up slightly in the penultimate episode, in which Angus champions a community of people who have been transformed into pigs, &quot;something which happened from time to time in those days&quot;. It&apos;s memorable for a scene in which the persecuted porkers convene a meeting to discuss their plight - proof that Orwell was not the first to conceive of pigs as an organised labour force. AH Hav, by Jan Morris (Faber, \u00a37.99) The legendary travel writer Jan Morris has turned her attention to a peninsular country in the Mediterranean called Hav. Though not on any existing maps, it is a place that is clearly realised in Morris&apos;s imagination. Situated at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, Hav has blended Greek, Ottoman, French, Russian and British influences to become a potent symbol for an ersatz &quot;abroad&quot;. It is a land where they do things differently, albeit in entirely expected exotic ways. Morris first wrote her fictional travelogue in 1985, in Last Letters from Hav, which spanned the six months leading up to the &quot;Intervention&quot;, when this traditional sort of place - like a happy Albania - was invaded by a powerful, modernising presence. Now Morris has returned to Hav for six days to find it changed almost beyond recognition. The country has shrugged off its air of mystique and rebranded itself for a more commercial age, like a totalitarian Dubai. The resulting two-part fiction provides a strange journey in which the only certainties are that foreigners are a funny lot and that the history of foreign places is far too byzantine for its own good. Elena Seymenliyska  The Story of You, by Julie Myerson (Vintage, \u00a37.99) When Tom takes Nicole to Paris for their anniversary, the idea is for them to get away from their two boys and relax with some adult pleasures. But then it starts to snow, and Nic is transported back to two pivotal moments from her past: first, the fateful night a few years earlier when their baby daughter, Mary, died in a tragic accident, since when a gulf has opened up between the grief-stricken parents; and then further back to her student days, when she spent a night entangled in a never-ending kiss with a man who then disappeared from her life. In a dreamlike sequence, Nic bumps into this man - the &quot;you&quot; of the book&apos;s title - in Paris, and later sees him again for a couple of days of intense and potentially life-changing reunion in London. And then - poof! - it is as if he never existed all over again. Julie Myerson&apos;s sixth novel is a beguilingly easy read with some very tenderly realised scenes of maternal and erotic intimacy. Whether the confection means anything, however, is less easy to say, and the way a dead baby is used to justify her mother&apos;s sexual infidelity leaves a nagging sense of unease. ES  Kill Chain, by Meg Gardiner (Hodder, \u00a36.99) Gardiner is brilliant at making the over-the-top seem utterly convincing. Her heroine, Evan Delaney, is a paragon for our times: tough, funny, clever, brave, tireless and compassionate. In the very readable Kill Chain, she chases round the world to save her father from kidnappers, and is pitted against worthy opponents - especially the pair of chemically altered whores with the bodies of children but &quot;eyes stained with age&quot;. The pace and inventiveness never flag, and the climax, which takes place in the terrifyingly impersonal container depot in the port of Los Angeles, is both nailbiting and moving. But the brilliant writing is what puts this thriller way ahead of the competition. As Delaney sprints across central London to rescue 11-year-old Georgie from a horrific fate, she notices a neighbourhood &quot;like a scene from Peter Pan, brick Georgian buildings with dormer windows along the rooftops, from which children should fly away, first star to the right and straight on till morning&quot;. Reading the fifth Evan Delaney book first is not a problem, but you&apos;ll probably want to go back and read the others. Intelligent escapism at its best.

Artists including Maria Benjamin, Toby Smith, Minou Norouzi and Tomoko Yoneda search for paradise among ruins from the scrubby banks of the River Lea to New Orleans post Hurricane Katrina. Yoneda finds beauty in landscapes once brutalised by war, while Norouzi&apos;s film is an intimate study of the destruction of wildlife in suburban LA.

The accompanying exhibition of jewellery and objects by Peter Chang also has a sci-fi feel.

The adolescent protagonists, caught with deadpan expressions, suggest scenarios of moral dilemmas. Two boys, dressed in jeans and white T-shirts, so as not to give away any uniform of conventionality or hint of subcultural rebelliousness, are posed in front of a white clapboard house on which the American flag has been pinned upside down. The upturned flag can be taken equally as a sign of revolt or as an SOS. In the video Flag Girls, six expressionless performers stand to attention, their nakedness wrapped in the flag. Throughout, there&apos;s a brooding claustrophobia, a suspense and sense of uncertainty, a suggestion of American nationhood perhaps being transfixed by almost terminal self-doubt.RC  \u00b7 Site Gallery, to Jul 21 Zaha HadidLondon Loud, vivacious and rarely seen without her spiky high heels, Zaha Hadid is that rare thing: a female architect in what is still a very macho environment. Over the past two decades, the Iraqi-born designer has constructed buildings in cities from Shanghai to Dubai, yet frustratingly, the flamboyant Hadid is better known in this country for her proposals. Although critically acclaimed, there seemed a time in the mid-90s when her brutally elegant constructions endlessly played runner-up to designs of a more moderate appeal. Fortunately, the rest of the world, and in particular Germany, were more radical in thinking, enabling her to realise some extraordinary creations, including the Science Centre in Wolfsburg, recently shortlisted for the RIBA Stirling Prize.

For a year or two I watched her grow on the stocks beside the Clyde, but when at last she was launched in September 1967, I was sitting in the chair of a Glasgow dentist having a tooth pulled out. The fact that I could have made a dental appointment on such a day still saddens me. I intended to be among the crowd in the fields opposite John Brown&apos;s shipyard in Clydebank, the favourite location of launch spectators, watching the ship slide stern-first into the river and settle there as the launch-chains tightened and the tugs took control. That evening I turned up for my night shift in a Glasgow newspaper office and found many special pages in preparation: pieces by writers who had a feeling for nautical history and poetry, especially Masefield; pictures of the Queen on the launch platform and also of the then-famous John Rannie, who as John Brown&apos;s foreman wore a bowler hat. Perhaps we were aware then that we were celebrating the last of something, but nobody was to know it was the birth of the world&apos;s last beautiful ship. Amid this week&apos;s nostalgia, it is worth remembering the British era that produced her and its strange mixture of ailing tradition and social change. The Boeing 707 was killing the North Atlantic liner trade; 1958 was the last year in which more passengers crossed by sea than by air. Both Cunard Line and John Brown&apos;s (led respectively by Sir Basil Smallpiece and Lord Aberconway) were struggling. State subsidy was essential. Labour relations were terrible - the QE2&apos;s launch was the first at Brown&apos;s where a delegation from the men who had actually built the ship was invited to form part of the official party and attend the launch lunch (the workers took up the offer suspiciously and only after long discussion at the shop stewards&apos; committee). From these unpromising foundations rose a ship that its owners hoped would capture the new face of Britain in the 1960s. Lord Snowdon, then the bright aesthetic guru, visited the designers in their studios. His wife, Princess Margaret, said that the new ship would show that British design was &quot;not only exciting and full of vigorous common sense but ... out in front, leading the field&quot;. The QE2 would be a flagship for the new nation and not &quot;a grandmotherly, chintzy hotel&quot;. Now seen as the last in a long tradition (the Mauretania, the Queen Mary), the QE2 was meant to abolish it. The name itself was radical (not even a Roman II), the funnel looked like no other (and abandoned Cunard&apos;s red livery for black and white), many of the furnishings were moulded plastic. The ship being a British industrial product of the late 1960s, the high-pressure steam turbine broke down during sea trials, and the maiden voyage to New York was delayed by several months. Early travellers were not overwhelmed. As John Malcolm Brinnin writes in what is probably the best social history of the transatlantic sea trade, The Sway of the Grand Saloon: &quot;American passengers sighed to heaven and ascribed it all to socialism, Carnaby Street and the decline of the British working orders.&quot; It could be argued that the QE2 only began to be loved when, after her duties in the Falklands war, the funnel was made bigger and repainted in the old Cunard livery, her British turbines were replaced by diesels during a German refit, and interior designers threw away the new in favour of the retro. A &quot;grandmotherly, chintzy hotel&quot; turned out to be, after all, what people were after. She is very beautiful - and now almost alone in her beauty among sea-going ships - but this quality comes from the old conventions of naval architecture rather than the fashions of the 1960s. The QE2 was built to cross the rough winter seas of the North Atlantic at speeds approaching 30 knots, at a shipyard with a long history of the art. She has a curved bow and a round stern, a long empty foredeck between the bow and the navigating bridge, a sheer (or curvature) on the hull that has been enhanced by clever paintwork. The funnel is centred, more or less, and her hull is grey verging on black with upperworks plain white. Why this should constitute &quot;beauty&quot; is as tricky as all aesthetic questions but it conforms to the popular idea of &quot;a proper ship&quot;. Why can more ships not be built like this? Or to put it another way, why are ships now so tall, so square, so ugly? The answer is simple enough - that if form follows function, then function follows economics - but in the cruise ship business where decks are sometimes stacked 12 high it can have brutal results: suddenly in Venice, for example, a large block of flats is towering over the Piazza San Marco, moving slowly upstream to discharge its 3,500 inhabitants and have its sewage pumped. The move began with container ships 40 years ago. The container changed everything, cutting crew numbers and time spent unprofitably in ports, and demanding simpler ships with engine room and bridge perched at the stern to make as much room as possible for the cargo. A square hull can carry more than a rounded one; furthermore, curved steel plates cost more to make and to fit than flat ones. According to the maritime historian Peter Quartermaine, &quot;It may be true that a hull with a curved stern is much more kindly in a following sea, but square means you can get more in. The people who build ships aren&apos;t the ones who sail in them.&quot; The first generation of ships dedicated to cruising mainly comprised ocean liners made redundant by air travel, built to transport passengers from A to B. From the late 1970s purpose-built cruise ships were designed to fulfil the idea that the ships were destinations in themselves and could rival land resorts in their proliferation of theatres, gyms, spas, casinos, rock-climbing walls and shops. Cabins became rooms and rooms needed balconies rather than portholes. To get more balconies you needed more decks. Open deck space, once the scene of breezy outdoor pastimes such as quoits and shuffleboard, began to disappear as the superstructure was stretched from bow to stern. Quartermaine says, &quot;When you&apos;re outside you&apos;re not spending any money. The reasoning is that simple.&quot; In 2005, 16 million people took a cruise on about 280 ships. More are being built, nine to be launched next year and seven in 2009. Carnival, the world&apos;s largest cruise company, has ordered 10 at a cost of $500m (\u00a3250.2m) each from the Fincantieri yards in Italy. Typically, each will carry 3,500 passengers and 1,300 crew. Where are they all to be taken? The Bahamas and the Caribbean are saturated and the Mediterranean is quickly filling up. Several lines own small islands that have been outfitted to cater purely for cruise customers (the Disney line spent $25m developing Castaway Cay in the Bahamas) and there is speculation that they might build their own destinations, whole ports equipped with shops selling duty-free Prada handbags and scotch, like a sunny version of Heathrow. Might there be a gap in this burgeoning market for the Quinlan Terry of naval architecture and ships that look like the old Queen Mary? So far, only the Disney line has tried. Their two ships have raked twin funnels and dark rounded hulls - at a distance they could pass for the swift prewar Italian liners that made Mussolini so proud. Closer to, there are flaws. The funnels have the emblem of Mickey&apos;s ears. Hanging upside down and painting from a bosun&apos;s chair over the stern is a 15ft-high model of Goofy.

Now there&apos;s Andrew Dukes and his mansion on a palm-shaped, man-made island. &quot;I got exactly what I paid for and I&apos;m very happy with it,&quot; said Mr Dukes, 43, a tanned Englishman who just moved into his enormous home on Palm Jumeirah - an island made of rock blasted from nearby mountains and sand dredged from the bottom of the Persian Gulf. When finished, Palm Jumeirah will have about 120,000 residents in mansions built on a kilometre-long palm frond, packed among dozens of others. Sharing close quarters with neighbours doesn&apos;t bother Dukes, formerly an executive with a British internet company, who paid around $1.4m (\u00a3520,000) for his house a year ago. It is now worth almost twice that. The first of Dubai&apos;s many mega-projects has literally changed the shape of the United Arab Emirates, re-contouring its coast with a new island mass that has altered currents and marred the sea view from Dubai&apos;s natural beach. The coastal development, led by Dubai government-owned Nakheel, includes three palm-shaped islands along with a cluster of 300 islets built in the shape of a world map. The largest, the Palm Deira, is still being raised from the sea floor. Nakheel claims that the Palm Deira will be the world&apos;s largest reclaimed island, with more than one million people eventually living or working there. But that figure is called into question by frequent alterations in the island&apos;s design over the past two years. Another island, the Palm Jebel Ali, is 90% reclaimed but building has yet to start on its homes, resorts and hotels. Only the smallest of the palm islands, Jumeirah, has begun to be populated. Still under construction are the Palm Jumeirah&apos;s 32 hotels, monorail, water theme park, and the Trump International Hotel and residence tower. The developments are central to Dubai&apos;s property boom. Properties on the Palm Jumeirah, the first to be opened, have skyrocketed in value before even being built. But the smaller islands of the third project - The World - haven&apos;t fared so well. Three years after their sales launch, 45% of the islets have been sold. The islands are part of a government plan to attract tourists and lure foreign cash into the tax-free economy. Dubai&apos;s government has identified tourism and real estate as key sectors to break the emirate&apos;s dependence on high oil prices. Other nations in the region, including Qatar and Oman, as well as the UAE capital Abu Dhabi, are quickly borrowing from Dubai&apos;s model to develop similar, albeit less dramatic, plans. The construction of the Palm Jumeirah has already created a national asset worth as much as $23bn, said Nakheel chief executive Chris O&apos;Donnell. The developers say the first 4,000 flats and homes sold on Palm Jumeirah went to citizens of the UAE and other Persian Gulf countries. Britons accounted for about 25% of the buyers with the rest from 75 different nationalities. However, not all the residents of the Palm Jumeirah are mega-rich.

Sovereign wealth funds - set up by governments to invest excess foreign exchange reserves - promise to supply the next big wave of controversy as they mushroom in size and become more aggressive in their quest for higher returns. The funds have been around for years; the Economist magazine suggests the concept may have begun when the British administration of the Gilbert Islands in Micronesia in the 1950s used money raised from the sale of bird poo - which was used in fertiliser - to set up a fund that is now worth more than $500m. Sovereign funds, swelled in many cases by petrodollars, embody the increased muscle of emerging economies on global markets. Governments traditionally held assets in reserve to protect themselves from a currency crisis; these were gold, bonds or deposits, all low-risk and easy to liquidate. With more than enough set aside for a rainy day, sovereign funds are now planting their flags in overseas share and property markets, and not everyone is happy. Apart from Norway&apos;s fund, set up with its North Sea oil money, these investment vehicles are opaque, giving little or no information on their returns or strategy. The Bush administration in the US has just issued a warning that their lack of transparency is a threat to the stability of world financial markets, saying it wants the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to intervene. The nascent US debate has been stirred further by the Chinese purchase of a $3bn stake in private equity group Blackstone - a communist state embracing the uber-capitalism of the leveraged buyout. Perhaps the mutual love of secrecy explains the attraction. There is an undercurrent of protectionism behind America&apos;s ostensible worries about financial stability; the US has already blocked a bid by China for oil company Unocal and prevented Dubai from taking over P&amp;O&apos;s US ports.But there are concerns. Sovereign funds already control around $2,500bn of assets, according to Morgan Stanley - more than the $2,000bn global hedge fund industry - and are growing by an estimated $450bn a year. This wall of money will be chasing a finite pool of assets and raises all sorts of questions. What happens when countries which do not believe wholeheartedly in capitalism or democracy become major stakeholders in large companies? Will the funds be used to prop up undemocratic regimes? Will it provoke a backlash against globalisation? Where should the lines be drawn on foreign governments acquiring stakes in strategic industries? Britain will be on the front line. Temasek, the Singapore fund, is the biggest shareholder in London-based bank Standard Chartered; Dubai took over P&amp;O and the Qataris have a chunk of supermarket group Sainsbury. Again, this is not new - in 1987 there was a furore when the Kuwait Investment Office snapped up 20 per cent of BP in its disastrous privatisation after the stock market crash - but the sovereign buying will gather pace. The Chinese, for example, know that the US is resistant and will be searching for UK assets to add to their shopping list; Middle Eastern funds will probably take a similar view. Britain should not turn protectionist, but it is time to start putting pressure on these countries to open up their own markets. The UK&apos;s position in all of this might have been rather different if we had emulated the Norwegians and set up a fund with our North Sea oil revenues.

But it is understood that the Swede was accompanied by at least one advisor, which seems to raise doubts over Still&apos;s future.

At international level there are certainly questions over Eriksson&apos;s abilities, despite three quarter-finals in consecutive major tournaments which ranks him third of all England managers.  However, in club football, the 59-year-old&apos;s record places him just below the very best. He is the only man to claim league and cup doubles in three countries - Italy, Portugal and Sweden. He has also won the Uefa Cup and Cup-Winners Cup, and lost two more Uefa Cup finals. Only the European Cup is missing from his club resume, although he did guide Benfica to the 1990 final, where the Portuguese side lost to Milan.  Italy&apos;s World Cup winning defender Alessandro Nesta, a pivotal member of Eriksson&apos;s Lazio team that won Serie A in 2000, believes City fans should be happy if he does take the job. &apos;Eriksson is a different manager, but in a good way,&apos; Nesta said. &apos;He gave me the freedom to do the right thing and to work it out myself. You could also go to him with your problems. He has helped me a lot and been a very important person in my career. &apos;He has a different style and a different temperament to other coaches I have had,&apos; he added. &apos;He took a step back and let me develop.&apos;", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Manchester City"], "title": "Sven froze out Still to aid bid for City job", "sentences": ["He was present during the infamous &apos;fake sheikh&apos; incident in Dubai in January 2006 in which Eriksson claimed to an undercover reporter that there was a &apos;bung culture&apos; in English football."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/24/newsstory.manchestercity", "publicationDate": "2007-06-23T23:03:16Z"}, {"article": "The bell is tolling for ICI, the once mighty Imperial Chemical Industries that invented polythene, beta blockers and assorted materials used to make the first atomic bomb. Akzo Nobel has fired off a \u00a37bn bid for the company and although ICI boss John McAdam has rejected the offer as too low, analysts say it is just a matter of time before the Dutch firm renews its attack or others enter the fray. BASF of Germany and America&apos;s Dow Chemical are cited as possible counter-bidders. Turn the clock back 40 years and no one would have believed that ICI faced being gobbled up by a foreign predator. The firm employed 130,000 people from New Zealand to Canada and, like British Petroleum, was viewed practically as an arm of the British state. Today, ICI is a shadow of its former self following three decades of rationalisation. Its market value has fallen from \u00a311bn to \u00a35bn and the workforce has shrunk to just 26,000. But as former chairman Sir Denys Henderson says: &apos;Companies don&apos;t go on for ever and a day: they must adapt to changing circumstances.&apos; The company&apos;s fall from power mirrors the UK&apos;s own post-imperial decline as a manufacturing nation. A former industrial bellwether, ICI supplied raw materials to a country where hundreds of thousands were still employed in shipbuilding, steel and aluminium production and making cars. Heavy chemicals helped to oil the wheels of industry in Britain and the old Commonwealth. But the company&apos;s top brass remained wedded to imperial values in a post-imperial world. Their attitude would astonish investors today. Writing in 1961, ICI chairman Paul Chambers pooh-poohed the notion that the company should move into expanding and more profitable sectors. Instead, he said: &apos;There is a public duty to go on making the essential, basic, chemicals even though the sales may appear to be less progressive and less profitable. ICI could not, for example, withdraw from the production of industrial explosives without giving the government and the public many years&apos; notice of its intention.&apos; History worked against ICI. Before the Second World War, the world chemicals industry was composed of just three companies: IG Farben of Germany, which dominated Europe, DuPont, which controlled the US, and ICI, which spoke for Britain and the Empire. They set their own prices and never competed in each other&apos;s markets. All that changed after the war when regional markets began to break down and firms were exposed to the icy winds of international competition. Arguably, the sheer size of ICI worked to its disadvantage. A former senior manager who worked at the company for 28 years until 1994 said: &apos;We were too big, trying to do too many things. We were in bulk chemicals, pesticides and biosciences. ICI was more diverse than even its main global rivals. Something had to give.&apos; What gave, eventually, were the company&apos;s profits: in 1980 ICI reported its first ever loss and cut the dividend. The results sent shockwaves around the City. Martin Adeney, the former BBC industrial editor who worked in ICI&apos;s communications department for 10 years, says: &apos;The whole business was under pricing pressure and that affected ICI&apos;s ability to maintain its competitive edge. We would come up with a new product, but it was soon copied by rivals in the Middle East or eastern Europe who could supply the same thing for less money.&apos; The business historian Geoffrey Owen has suggested that Britain&apos;s failure to join the Common Market deprived ICI of the kind of growth enjoyed by European firms at a time when continental trade was going through the roof. But, in the long run, Owen reckons that ICI, like many of its competitors, was always on a sticky wicket. &apos;There has been a re-ordering of the chemicals industry and tremendous upheaval. Production is shifting to lower cost centres in the Far East and elsewhere; ICI has been caught in a historical cross-current. So too have others. &apos;Hoechst [the German firm that emerged from IG Farben&apos;s break-up in 1951] has been restructured out of existence; DuPont has survived but has been forced to streamline its operations.&apos; At ICI, there was a brief renaissance in the mid-1980s when it was the first company to make \u00a31bn profit under Sir John Harvey Jones, who sold off lower margin businesses such as soda ash (which goes into glass) and industrial explosives and focused on petrochemicals, polymers, agrochemicals and the fast-expanding pharmaceuticals operation. But when the recession came in 1990, chairman Henderson discovered that the company hadn&apos;t done enough. And then Lord Hanson struck, buying a stake in 1991 and seeking discussions with the board. ICI conducted a remarkable lobbying campaign, convincing even some ministers in the Major government that a Hanson break-up of ICI would be against the national interest. In the end, Hanson didn&apos;t bid, but the cat was out of the bag. A former director says: &apos;We all knew that if Hanson had broken up the company, he would have made a lot of money. The new mantra was shareholder value, so we began to work on ways to break the company up ourselves. &apos;ICI brought in [rising investment banking star] John Mayo from SG Warburg to help with the project. He decided that the firm was in too many product ranges and too many geographies.&apos; Mayo and his team realised that ICI was a chemicals company wrapped in an expanding pharmaceuticals business. That realisation led to the demerger of the pharma arm, renamed Zeneca and separately quoted. Zeneca eventually merged with Astra to become one of the FTSE&apos;s top 30 companies. But the chemicals business seemed to lurch from one crisis to another. In the mid 1990s, chief executive Charles Miller Smith reshuffled the portfolio again, selling what one analyst described as the &apos;cyclical, smelly industrial bits&apos;, and buying Unilever&apos;s higher-margin speciality chemicals. But debt hit \u00a33bn, almost the same as the company&apos;s market valuation. It was time for another round of cost-cutting and rationalisation. Under McAdam, ICI has paid off its borrowings to emerge as a paints company with Dulux as its most famous brand. It also owns National Starch, the US-based adhesives business. Adeney says: &apos;The ICI story is that its home market disappeared with the demise of British manufacturing industries. Linked to that trend has been stiff global competition and constant pressure from shareholders for ICI to reinvent itself.&apos; Owen says those who argue that ICI would have stood a better chance had it been in Europe, where governments are more protectionist, are probably wrong: &apos;It might have slowed down the process of contraction, but the result would have been the same,&apos; he says. In the end, the City viewed ICI as a conglomerate that had overstretched itself and was ripe for unbundling. Ironically, the same fate awaited Lord Hanson&apos;s company, which exploited acquisition accounting rules to assemble - according to investors - assorted businesses under one roof with few synergies and scant commercial logic. It would be wrong, however, to conclude that ICI has been an unmitigated disaster. Zeneca has been successful and so too has ICI&apos;s Australian business, now called Orica, the world&apos;s number one industrial explosives company. A number of ICI&apos;s chemicals operations have been acquired by Ineos, the profitable and privately owned UK mini-multinational. But the fact that parts of the group are still flourishing under new ownership will be little comfort to those who rue the demise of yet another once-great British industrial giant. Arab investors: Britain&apos;s a good home for petrodollars The tide of foreign money flowing into Britain isn&apos;t confined to City takeovers. One of the hottest spots is commercial property, where overseas investors have poured billions into offices, retail and residential premises over the past six years. &apos;There is a wall of money coming in from the Middle East,&apos; says property analyst Mike Prew at Lehman Brothers. &apos;Arab countries are awash with petrodollars, and London properties have been the destination of choice for their cash.&apos; Consultancy DTZ says the value of UK property owned by Middle East investors exceeds the entire portfolio of Land Securities (\u00a314.8bn), the UK&apos;s largest property group. Two of the most expensive homes sold in London last year were bought by Arab investors. The Qatari foreign minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jaber al Thani, paid \u00a3100m for a penthouse at One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge. Gulf investors are also understood to have bought a home in Belgrave Square for \u00a333m. But the biggest London residential deal was done in 2006 when the Abu Dhabi royal family bought 33 Cavendish Square for a staggering \u00a3445m. Elsewhere, Dubai&apos;s Maktoum royal family is said to own a huge portfolio of central London properties, with Lowndes Square often referred to as &apos;Dubai Square&apos;. Analysts say prime City office property is also being targeted by Middle Eastern money, not least because Britain is viewed as more accommodating than the US, where there was a row two years ago about Dubai Ports World taking over US ports as a result of its acquisition of Britain&apos;s P&amp;O. Some on Capitol Hill thought this could pose a security threat. The ports were eventually sold on to assuage concerns, much to the chagrin of Dubai, which views itself as a staunch ally of America and friend of the West. Prew says: &apos;London is seen as a safer bet: some investors have been redirecting funds from the US to new offices in London.&apos; According to DTZ, Middle Eastern investors have spent \u00a38.9bn on commercial property in the past five years. Prew reckons there could be a slowdown in some sectors of commercial property, &apos;but at the top end, there is probably more growth to come&apos;. However, the prospect of Middle Eastern takeovers of large, listed UK companies remains the big talking point in the Square Mile. The spotlight is on supermarket group J Sainsbury, where Delta Two, a Qatari investment group, has acquired a 25 per cent stake, sparking speculation that it could mount a bid.

The Guardian revealed allegations that BAE had secretly paid \u00a31bn to the Saudi Prince Bandar, in connection with Britain&apos;s biggest arms deal, and did so with the knowledge of the UK government. As the allegations emerged, former ministers from Denis Healey to Sir Malcolm Rifkind argued that such dealings were just the way the world worked. Sure, Tony Blair upset anti-corruption anoraks by pulling the plug on the police investigation into BAE&apos;s Saudi affairs. But the establishment view was that serious business and politics would face few ripples. That is, until yesterday. News of an anti-corruption probe by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) has changed everything. BAE&apos;s share price was soon plummeting like a Typhoon fighter making a crash landing - at one point yesterday it was down 11%, knocking well over \u00a31bn off the company&apos;s value. British and overseas investigations are already scrutinising BAE&apos;s conduct in markets as far-flung as eastern Europe, South America and Africa. The company was not hurt by these; the resilience of its price almost suggested that investors saw such inquiries as proof that BAE was serious about earning a return. But the DoJ inquiry is different. For one thing, BAE will now be put through the mill in the very market that is central to its commercial strategy. By disposing of civilian and European interests, such as Airbus, the firm has concentrated on becoming an official supplier to the Pentagon. It has bought into 15 American firms in recent years, getting the go-ahead for the latest takeover, Armor Holdings, only last week. Winning contracts might prove trickier, however, for a firm under investigation by the federal authorities. The other big difference with investigations in other countries is that the DoJ looks well placed to get to the bottom of things. The investigation takes place under the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, stronger legislation than that in Britain, passed not long after Watergate had showed the nation where corruption could lead. Whether it is in busting cartels or pursuing white-collar criminals, the tough approach of America&apos;s law-enforcement agencies balances the indulgence shown to business by US politicians. There are political reasons why they might want to play hardball. BAE is not American, and Congress has become more protectionist even than last year, when it railed against Dubai Ports gaining control of US seaports. And the weakened and unpopular president may not be able to offer much cover, despite his family friendship with the former Washington ambassador Prince Bandar. What could, however, still hinder the inquiry is less than full cooperation from the British government. For, as the Guardian has reported, the Ministry of Defence has been intimately involved in BAE&apos;s Saudi dealings, and so it seems likely that it will possess many of the crucial documents. Having halted the Serious Fraud Office investigation at home, the British government may be reluctant to provide the DoJ with the ammunition to pick up where the SFO left off. But on what grounds could it refuse? Tony Blair defended the SFO decision on national security grounds. He said it risked cutting off intelligence from the Saudi government. Even if that argument held water in that case, it does not do so now. British ministers could hardly argue that Riyadh, which is so dependent on Washington, would cut off intelligence links with America. The secrecy enjoyed by Britain&apos;s military-industrial complex dates from a time when manufacturing exports and the balance of payments dominated politics. That era has passed. It is time to let in the light. If Gordon Brown is serious about restoring trust in politics he should start by making plain that the US investigation into BAE will enjoy his full support.", "tags": ["Politics", "Foreign policy", "UK news"], "title": "Leader: BAE Systems", "sentences": ["BAE is not American, and Congress has become more protectionist even than last year, when it railed against Dubai Ports gaining control of US seaports."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/27/politics.foreignpolicy", "publicationDate": "2007-06-26T23:08:00Z"}, {"article": "&apos;If you go on to the streets of London at the moment, you&apos;ll see a million and one Kate Mosses. It&apos;s just so boring!&quot; fumes hairdresser Nina Butkovich-Budden. &quot;But the vintage look? Well, it&apos;s a little bit of rebellion, isn&apos;t it?&quot; While many young women hanker after that just-crawled-out-of-bed-with-Pete-Doherty look (denim hotpants, unbrushed hair), it seems that a growing minority are embracing good old-fashioned glamour. And not just a vintage dress here or a hint of a beehive there. Across the country, you can find librarians, project managers, city workers and IT experts sporting the full-blown hair, makeup and even underwear (think bullet bras and girdles) of 1940s and 1950s pin-ups. Down a side street in Southwark sits a hairdressers&apos; that would make most modern stylists run screaming. Nestled within the walls of the Cut &amp; Clipper salon is Nina&apos;s Hair Parlour, Britain&apos;s first vintage hair salon. Scattered around the shop are pictures of immaculately coiffed starlets - Lauren Bacall, Gene Tierney and Olivia de Havilland - all shampooed and set to within an inch of their lives. Original hood dryers bulge ominously from the walls and sinister gas-heated tongs from the 1920s rest on art deco cabinets packed with pillbox hats. Edith Piaf trills softly in the background. It is like Toni &amp; Guy never existed. &quot;It&apos;s easy to get the retro clothes,&quot; says Nina - known professionally as Nina the Head Dresser - &quot;but the retro hair and makeup is a skill that needs to be learned.&quot; A hairdresser for the past 15 years, Butkovich-Budden spotted a gap in the market after helping women at rockabilly and burlesque clubs attend to their tresses. &quot;I started doing it for friends and performers, and then more and more &apos;regular&apos; people became interested in it.&quot; Last year she began specialising in retro bouffants, helping create vintage hair designs for the Young Vic theatre, and offering one-to-one sessions with private clients - who range from students and office workers to an air hostess from Dubai who flies over specifically to see her. Then there&apos;s the couple whose lives revolve entirely around the 1940s; &quot;she&apos;s a land girl and he&apos;s a soldier from 1943,&quot; says Butkovich-Budden. With a four-month waiting list for the intensive four-hour classes (which come complete with drinks and chocolates), Butkovich-Budden teaches her customers hair and makeup styles of their choosing. &quot;People bring in three pictures of the styles they would like to have. The most popular are Rita Hayworth, Traci Lords in Cry-Baby, oh, and Bettie Page. Always the Bettie Page fringe!&quot; Today Vancouver-born performer Alisa is in Butkovich-Budden&apos;s hotseat, having her bleached hair rolled and curled. Despite only living in Britain for only eight months, Alisa is already a devoted customer. &quot;Nina&apos;s the only person who&apos;ll let me kill my hair with bleach! Other hairdressers will preach at me and tell me I&apos;m ruining my hair, but Nina gets it. She knows exactly what I want.&quot; And what Alisa wants is big, bold and beautiful 1950s hair and makeup; &quot;I love the cartoonish femininity of it. Growing up in Vancouver, everyone wears thick fleeces and sweaters all the time, so I rebelled by wearing seamed stockings and looking like this!&quot; The retro look isn&apos;t restricted to showgirls, as Helen Barrell, a librarian based in Birmingham, proves. &quot;I&apos;ve never been the kind of person to be dictated to about anything - I put my hair in vintage rolls because it looks great and suits me,&quot; says Barrell. &quot;I don&apos;t know why we&apos;re told that during the day your makeup should be &apos;natural&apos;. What&apos;s wrong with lots of eyeliner?&quot; In fact, Barrell&apos;s look is comparatively low-maintenance. She only spends five minutes a day on hair and makeup, saving time by washing her hair just once a week - using setting lotion means it doesn&apos;t get greasy as quickly. &quot;Modern girls apparently wash their hair every day and use their straighteners each morning,&quot; she says, apparently shocked by this. &quot;I just fold my hair over and pin it!&quot; At size 20, Barrell has also found that vintage clothing is far more flattering to her shape. &quot;I&apos;m blessed with curves and 50s dresses allow for an adult female figure with hips, a waist and a bust.&quot; She is also a devotee of that oft-reviled vintage relic - &quot;shapewear&quot; girdles and corsets. &quot;If you&apos;re wearing vintage clothes, you may as well wear vintage underwear,&quot; she says. &quot;Foundation wear is wonderful stuff, and it annoys me that some feminists seem to think that it&apos;s evil. Yes, I&apos;ve accepted my size, but at the same time, it&apos;s really great to have these contraptions made of strong elastic which give you a smooth line. If you wear a bra to support your boobs,&quot; says Barrell, &quot;why not wear something to support your tummy?&quot; One woman who knows good girdles is Katie Halford, the founder of vintage-inspired pants emporium What Katie Did. After the boutique she was working for closed down, Halford was desperate to get her hands on cheap seamed stockings again, so contacted her former employer&apos;s suppliers. Soon, she was running her own mail-order service. &quot;I wasn&apos;t really thinking about other women when I started What Katie Did,&quot; says Halford, &quot;I was just thinking about myself!&quot; Now the fully fashioned website - complete with models with hair styled by Nina - stocks everything from bullet bras, girdles and corsets to a large range of hosiery. &quot;The popularity of vintage style seems to be growing daily,&quot; says Halford. &quot;Our bullet bra is the most popular as no one else manufactures them in Europe. Wearing one is the easiest way to get a retro-looking silhouette.&quot; In this instance, &quot;retro silhouette&quot; means the pointy, poke-your-eyes-out chest of a 1950s sweater girl. &quot;I think current notions of beauty are really rather bizarre,&quot; says Halford. &quot;Women are having breast implants but doing the best they can to get rid of the rest of their curves. It really doesn&apos;t make sense.&quot; Paradoxically, for a look born before the days of PCs, the internet is a driving force behind the scene. Online communities have formed - including a message board on the What Katie Did website, full of women sharing tips. &quot;I really don&apos;t think that the vintage look would be so big without the internet,&quot; notes Halford. &quot;When I was growing up in Plymouth we had one vintage shop, one alternative club and that was it. Now you can shop for vintage clothes world wide.&quot; Burlesque artist Millie Dollar first asked her mother for help with creating 1940s hairstyles, but when she couldn&apos;t show her more than a simple chignon, she turned to the net. &quot;I was on my own really, but there are loads of sites to help you and you can always Google it. I&apos;m now skilled enough at victory rolls and curls to whip them up quickly, but at first it takes a lot longer till you&apos;re practised.&quot; As well as full vintage hair, Millie won&apos;t leave her house without a trademark smear of post-box red on her lips, but it wasn&apos;t always that way. &quot;I went through that dreadful teenage stage that everyone goes through where I didn&apos;t bother much with fashion, and wore baggy clothes to hide myself.&quot; A chance viewing of the classic 1953 musical Gentlemen Prefer Blondes changed all that. &quot;The women looked perfect in every scene; I wanted to look as graceful as them - they just oozed glamour, every outfit was perfectly made with such luxurious fabrics and styled in such an amazing way.&quot; Millie then bleached her hair in homage to one of the film&apos;s stars, Marilyn Monroe. &quot;Who doesn&apos;t want to look like Marilyn?&quot; she says. Well, Cambridge-based project manager Elizabeth Stevenson, for one - although her style was also shaped by the film. &quot;I always preferred Jane Russell as Dorothy to Marilyn&apos;s Lorelei,&quot; Stevenson says. &quot;She had a knowing wryness about her. I have a copy of the top she wore in the swimming-pool scene from Miss Selfridge, circa 1983. It no longer does up but I can&apos;t bear to part with it!&quot; Saturday afternoon double-bill matinees also introduced Stevenson to the likes of Ava Gardner, Liz Taylor and Gina Lollobrigida, and she&apos;s now been sporting the vintage look for more than a quarter of a century. Her recent wedding was no exception and was tiki-themed - 40s look - with every attendee wearing period outfits.

The backdrop portrays open fires and shagpile carpets, and Marco is singing Waltz of Love in his deep but oddly enervating voice. So far, so light entertainment. Then you notice his backing musicians, Allgau Power - a set of hearty young men, clad entirely in orange and olive green. Even their accordions match.  This is Volksmusik, the &quot;music of the people&quot;. Put it on television and it attracts audiences of the size normally reserved for big sports events. Put it on CD and there&apos;s no sign of the market collapse that&apos;s affecting so many forms of music. Put out spin-off merchandise - not just T-shirts, but tie-in pensions and cruises, condoms and beer mugs - and it gets bought by the barrowload.  So why is Volksmusik unknown outside the German-speaking areas of Europe? After all, other forms of traditional music from around the continent have crossed seas and borders - the fado of Portugal, the flamenco of Spain, the Gypsy music of the Balkans - but Volksmusik has never registered outside Germany, Austria and the German-speaking areas of Switzerland and Italy. Maybe it&apos;s the lederhosen and the alpenhorns. Maybe it&apos;s just a bit too, well, German for anyone else.  &quot;It&apos;s light music to cheer older people up,&quot; explains Stefanie Hertel. &quot;It&apos;s about nature and love - optimistic, positive things. It fits Germany perfectly - it&apos;s down to earth, very close to the people. It offers them the Gemutlichkeit [cosiness] that they need to survive in this crazy world.&quot;  Hertel is a blonde, blue-eyed 29-year-old who is also the biggest female star in Volksmusik. To her, and her fans, this music is as everyday as the EastEnders theme tune is to Britons. &quot;In England, you must have heard of one or two German Volkslieder?&quot; she asks. She&apos;s surprised by the answer: unless Silent Night or Oh Christmas Tree count, no.  Volksmusik was just another outpost in European folk music until about 30 years ago, when a man named Hans Beierlein decided that, despite its associations with the Third Reich, Volksmusik could be rehabilitated for a modern German audience. He persuaded state TV to launch programmes devoted to his polished and commercialised vision of the music (often known as Volkstumliche , or &quot;folksy&quot; music, to differentiate it from the pure tradition of the original Volksmusik), and succeeded to such an extent that he has become a multi-millionaire.  So would he define the music he has popularised? Beierlein, who is now 76, leans back in the vast leather sofa of his office in Munich. He touches on Kant and Brecht before deciding: &quot;It&apos;s been a point of great dispute among musicians and academics for decades. But, simply put, it&apos;s the Germans&apos; favourite form of music. It&apos;s music that sings not of a heile Welt [an ideal world - a central concept of Nazi thinking], but of a heilbare Welt - a curable world, in which there is hope that order can be restored.&quot;  More specifically, we&apos;re talking about paeans to love, marriage, friendship, relia bility, nature, mountains, trees and fresh air - simple, sugary lyrics set to bouncy, military on-beat brass and accordion accompaniments.  One of Beierlein&apos;s brainwaves was to establish the annual Grand Prix der Volksmusik, a competition to find the best singer from Germany, Austria, Swizerland and South Tirol, in Italy. The Grand Prix is in its 21st year now, and a visit to the German finals, held in a huge hall on the outskirts of Munich, proves how big the business of Volksmusik is. A couple of thousand sober fans, smelling strongly of sweet perfume and aftershave, sit clutching football rattles and posters of their favourite stars. Five million more are watching on TV. This is a serious event: it will decide who represents Germany at the overall Grand Prix final, to be held in Vienna in August.  &quot;I&apos;ve been collecting their autographs since 1975,&quot; says a slightly drunk man waiting at the stage door. He&apos;s clutching a book bulging with signatures - everyone from the Kastelruth Sparrows to the Gentlemen of Trumpets, via the Apron Hunters and the Alpine Cats.  It&apos;s unusual, it seems, for the British media to show an interest in Volksmusik. And in recognition of that, we are given a VIP seat for the event, between Lys Assia, the 81-year-old grande dame of Swiss Volksmusik and Anneliese Breitenberger, a big-haired yodeller from South Tirol.  They are both Volksmusik legends. Assia won the inaugural Eurovision Song Contest in 1956 with the song The Old Carousel, then reinvented herself as Volksmusik star, and still sings today - she will represent Switzerland in Vienna. The key to good Volksmusik, she tells me in between taking notes on her German rivals, is &quot;a song that open&apos;s people&apos;s hearts, that&apos;s emotional and good for a singalong. She defends, too, the modern habit of dispensing with a band and performing, karaoke-style, to a backing track. &quot;In fact, it&apos;s an even harder skill than performing live,&quot; she insists, &quot;because the timing is everything.&quot;  Breitenberger, who has yodelled for two popes, one Austrian empress and one shah of Persia, has spotted a favourite in Munich - a 15-year-old performing as Marcel, who plays the balalaika and sings a number called Sing a Song for Mama. It&apos;s all about getting the right song for the right performer, she explains, which isn&apos;t as simple as it sounds. In competitive Volksmusik, you can&apos;t just turn up and sing what you fancy. Instead, each singer is assigned a song by a committee. Sadly for Germany, however, the system hasn&apos;t worked for them - Breitenberger says they try too hard to please - and they haven&apos;t won the Grand Prix for 12 years. The South Tiroleans, by contrast, have won the gold medal four times, even though there are only 380,000 of them, and they only started competing six years ago.  In fact, plenty of non-Germans seem to have an explanation for Germany&apos;s failures. &quot;The Germans are too well-behaved in their Volksmusik,&quot; says Gunter Tolar, one of the leading managers on the Austrian Volksmusik scene. &quot;They are too scared of taking risks and are too kitschy.&quot; Alpenhorns and lederhosen kitschy? Surely not.  In contrast to Germany, Tolar explains, the other countries have embraced other music forms so that elements of blues, techno and even salsa are sometimes heard among the Volk. What&apos;s more, Volksmusik seems more attractive to younger people outside Germany - in some Austrian Alpine valleys, for example, you can find up to 80 different Volksmusik bands.  In truth, it&apos;s obvious why this music, for all its popularity where people speak German, is unknown anywhere else (apart from some bizarre appreciation in China, Vietnam and Dubai). One strict rule of the genre is that it must be sung in German, a language without the romance of, say, the Portuguese in which fado is sung, or the mystery of the Arabic lyrics in rai. Another is that the music must be cheerful. It lacks any hint of the melancholy that has long allowed music to cross borders. &quot;You cannot sing about suicide bombers in Afghanistan, crime in Soho, or the fact that all the coal mines are disappearing from the Ruhr valley,&quot; Herr Beierlein reminds me.  Another reason, of course, is Volksmusik&apos;s unwelcome association with Nazism. Many of the volkslieder still enjoyed by the traditional wing of the audience are the same songs that were encouraged by the Nazis. &quot;The associations are absurd,&quot; says Stefanie Hertel, getting irate. &quot;The Volkslieder are far, far older than the Third Reich. And the sound has changed considerably since then. Now we use a lot more synthesizers and keyboards and there are not so many leder-hosen as there were.&quot;  &quot;Tsarist songs were sung by the communists, weren&apos;t they?&quot; adds Beirlein. &quot;I don&apos;t see the problem. The point is, you have to see what Germany would be without it. There would be no Oktoberfest, no Christmas markets, no carnival - the mainstays of German culture.&quot; While Volksmusik may be, as Beierlein claims, Germany&apos;s favourite music, it&apos;s wrong to assume every German loves it. Even Beierlein admits there are times he can only endure it once he has some alcohol inside him. And earlier this year, a court in Frankfurt ordered a holiday company to refund 60 German tourists the cost of their Caribbean cruise after they were forced to share a ship with a 500-strong Swiss Volksmusik club, who insisted on singing their way round the West Indies.  Back at the Grand Prix in Munich, it&apos;s not hard to see why those 60 tourists got so fed up. We see Astrid Breck (who has sold enough records in Denmark to get a gold disc) sing that &quot;Germany is like Switzerland - a country of mountains ... where friendship stretches across borders!&quot; She is accompanied by a nine-man group dressed like Wimbledon umpires. And the notion that Volksmusik is about banishing sadness gets its due, too: against a set of springtime trees, a pavilion in the park and a light-dappled path we hear a performance from a woman who was put into a wheelchair by a motorcycle accident &quot;but who has got strength from Volksmusik&quot;, according to the programme notes, and another who has just lost her child to illness. Both women are chosen to go through to the final.  The winners of the night resemble a group of presenters from the children&apos;s TV show Rainbow. The Shepherds are the bohemians of the evening, singing barefooted in multi-coloured lederhosen and aproned-dirndls. Their song is called God Has Given Us Everything: &quot;God has given us the views, the mountains, the flowers - and he&apos;s yet to send the bill,&quot; they trill. And still the CD buyers of Britain, France and America remain unmoved.", "tags": ["World music", "Music", "Culture"], "title": "Queer as volk", "sentences": ["In truth, it&apos;s obvious why this music, for all its popularity where people speak German, is unknown anywhere else (apart from some bizarre appreciation in China, Vietnam and Dubai)."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/29/worldmusic", "publicationDate": "2007-06-29T22:55:47Z"}, {"article": "Protectionism is making a comeback. At least, that is the fear of many influential figures - from senior officials at finance ministries to politicians and independent economists. These experts are, generally speaking, pointing their fingers from West to East, from the US and Europe to China, Russia and the Gulf, and they are being specific about the threat. A new breed of global investment behemoths, the so-called &apos;sovereign wealth&apos; funds (SWFs) - effectively state-controlled investment funds bankrolled by huge foreign exchange surpluses or petrodollars - want to buy up, among other things, western companies. This could provoke protectionist calls from populist politicians. Last week, for example, the German government was reported to be setting up an agency to examine acquisitions by these investment colossi, concerned that they could pose a threat to national security, particularly if they bought a major bank. A day later, the IMF joined calls for greater scrutiny of what it calls &apos;black boxes&apos; through which increasing financial flows are funnelled. There are also questions about whether it is desirable for companies in the UK, say, to be owned by foreign governments whose commitment to capitalism and democracy may be shaky. A week ago, a US Treasury official, Clay Lowery, stated baldly that there was a risk that &apos;the size, investment policies, and/or operating methods of these funds fuel financial protectionism&apos;. The UK is concerned too - senior officials from the Treasury and the Foreign Office are meeting the head of China&apos;s fund to indicate that, while Britain is open for business, it would be nice to know a bit more about the fund&apos;s management and intentions. As these fears were pouring out, China announced that its state-run foreign exchange corporation would raise \u00a3200bn via a bond issue. Even before this capitalisation, China had been active on the international stage, buying a $3bn stake in private equity group Blackstone earlier this year, making investments in Africa and unveiling offers for US companies such as oil giant Unocal. Meanwhile, officials in Dubai, which operates a hyperactive global investment fund as part of the Maktoum family-controlled Dubai World group - which bought P&amp;O last year - indicated that it was prepared to collaborate with China on future projects and could get involved in asset swaps. Gerard Lyons, chief economist at Standard Chartered bank, says: &apos;It is possible that this could lead us down a protectionist route. We have already seen signs of how some countries respond. The problem is that there are few ground rules for how these funds operate.&apos; Lyons points to reaction in the US Congress to China&apos;s approach for Unocal and its demand that Dubai Ports World divest US ports on national security grounds as a condition for US clearance of its bid for P&amp;O. But he also points out that sovereign funds have been around a long time. For example, the Singapore Investment Corporation and Kuwait Investment Office have existed since the Eighties. So what has changed? The US view seems to be that things are getting serious because they are getting big. Lowery said: &apos;What is new is the number of sovereign wealth funds and their sheer current and projected sizes.&apos; The numbers are indeed dizzying. According to Morgan Stanley and figures quoted by Lowery, SWFs hold some 2.5 per cent of all the world&apos;s financial assets. In 10 years&apos; time, says Morgan Stanley, this could rise to 9 per cent. The reason is the swelling of foreign currency reserves and the increased appetite for risk since the effects of the financial crises in Russia and Asian countries in the late Nineties have receded into history. In the past five years, global foreign currency reserves have increased at a massive 20 per cent annually to stand at some $5.6 trillion. Much of the increase is accounted for by Asian countries building up reserves following the 1997-98 crisis. In the meantime, the high oil price has boosted foreign exchange earnings for Russia and the Middle East. With post-crisis safety in mind, the repository for much of these reserves has been government bonds, particularly US treasuries, of which China alone holds about $ 1trillion. Now, however, the limits of prudence have been reached, and countries in surplus are looking to target higher-risk, higher-return assets - such as western companies. Such is the weight of money behind these funds that analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that as SWFs grow toward controlling 9 per cent of global wealth in the next decade, global bond yields will rise some 30 basis points in response. In short, the world could become a riskier place as these major investors switch away from safe old government bonds. The fear is that risk will mean instability and that moving from holding debt to owning companies will make SWFs much more intrusive. The problem is that as things stand little is known about these bodies - from Dubai World to China&apos;s State Foreign Exchange Investment Corporation, to Russia&apos;s oil stabilisation funds. This only increases the risks that ownership by such bodies poses. Although China&apos;s bond issue gives a $200bn clue it is unclear if this is the extent of its finance, and similar queries exist over the scope of the other players. Meanwhile, such things as investment principles and management discipline are unknown. This, believes Lowery, could lead to protectionism. &apos;There will likely be much public attention to whether SWFs exercise the voting rights of their equity shares and if so how. If SWFs obtain operational control of the companies in which they invest, the fact that they are government entities may invite additional scrutiny.&apos; Lyons says: &apos;This is all evidence of a major change in the global economy.&apos; He points to the forecast growth in Asia over the next 13 years - by 2020, a third of global trade could be accounted for by Asia compared with a seventh for the US, with the need to create some 750 million jobs on the continent by then. His view is that it is vital to ensure a &apos;level playing field&apos; for trade throughout this period of change, rather than the current higgledy-piggledy relationships. &apos;The US and Germany do have a more protectionist feel about them today,&apos; he says. But this might be down to concerns over reciprocity: if China is able to buy companies in the US and Germany, and gain access to intellectual property, could it happen the other way around? It certainly looks more difficult. However, as Lyons argues: &apos;If China opens up its markets, the Germans might become less protectionist.&apos; He believes a multinational, multilateral approach is needed to establish ground rules governing the operation of state-controlled funds. The question is, which organisation to use. The IMF (or the World Bank) may not cut it in Beijing. Vincent Cable, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, says: &apos;The World Trade Organisation should pick it up. China is a member and should be compliant with any conclusions. And this would be a good example of the importance of having Russia as a member of the organisation.&apos; The difficulty is that there are reservations over Russia&apos;s membership - its conduct on trade and economic issues, particularly over &apos;resource nationalism&apos;, is seen as getting worse, not better. There clearly is a will for reciprocity. While Lowery has made his fears clear, another official said last week that the US welcomed investment and would like to see China channelling its dollar reserves back into the US. Whether the need for a share of investment from the new capitalist bloc overcomes the fear of economic takeover by former communist state-owned monoliths may well determine whether the world enters a new era of protectionism.

As authoritative evidence suggests that $1 trillion of illicit funds flow to secretive havens managed by financiers based in London, New York and Dubai, the Norwegian government is forming a global coalition to &apos;facilitate the recovery of assets illicitly stacked away in tax havens&apos;. Several countries are set to join, but Britain, recently classed as an offshore financial centre by the International Monetary Fund, is not among them. International attention is focusing on London&apos;s role in facilitating tax evasion and money laundering. The news will alarm incoming Chancellor Alistair Darling. The Treasury said it had not been contacted about joining a taskforce and that it worked with the OECD on such issues. It is &apos;obviously interested in where companies pay tax&apos; and it is in the midst of simplifying &apos;arcane rules&apos; that will make it less of an administrative burden for firms to pay tax here. The imminent formation of an international tax haven taskforce comes as the World Bank, headed by Robert Zoellick, is coming under pressure to establish its first forensic study into the illicit cash flowing out of developing nations. In a letter seen by The Observer the Norwegian government has taken the unprecedented step of offering to fund the research on behalf of the Bank. Exactly 10 times the $100bn spent on aid and debt write-offs by rich countries is siphoned out of developing countries, with corporations responsible for 60 per cent of that figure through a web of trusts, nominee accounts and the flagrant mispricing of goods to escape tax. Evidence is emerging of how City financiers are using new techniques on behalf of corporations and the super-rich through the creation of protected cell companies and sham offshore trusts. New &apos;redomicilation&apos; clauses enable vast sums to move from one jurisdiction to another without trace. There is concern over the formation of a Ghanaian offshore centre which it is feared will be used to siphon oil money out of West Africa. And there is anxiety about firms circumventing customs by the flagrant underpricing of exports from developing countries. Cracking down on tax havens and the evasion of taxes by some of the world&apos;s biggest companies is seen as the &apos;missing link&apos; in the poverty alleviation agenda. Investigators and lawyers at a conference on the Movement of Illicit Funds in Washington last Thursday confirmed it was corporations and not corrupt politicians in the developing world that accounted for most tax evasion. Oil, commodity and mining firms are most culpable. Bribery and corruption only accounts for 3 per cent of the estimated $1 trillion of illicit funds. Raymond Baker, director of Global Financial Integrity and an expert on money laundering, said: &apos;For the first time in 200 years we have an integrated global structure in the Square Mile and Manhattan whose basic purpose is to shift money from the poor to the rich.&apos; It is understood the Treasury is considering proposals that may see firms compelled to give details of exactly how much tax they pay in specific countries.", "tags": ["Business"], "title": "Tax evasion taskforce to probe UK", "sentences": ["As authoritative evidence suggests that $1 trillion of illicit funds flow to secretive havens managed by financiers based in London, New York and Dubai, the Norwegian government is forming a global coalition to &apos;facilitate the recovery of assets illicitly stacked away in tax havens&apos;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/01/theobserver.observerbusiness28", "publicationDate": "2007-06-30T23:04:07Z"}, {"article": "Arab investment funds are targeting Jaguar and Land Rover, the luxury car marques that US owner Ford has put up for sale for more than \u00a33bn. Abu Dhabi&apos;s Mubadala Development Company, already the owner of 5 per cent of Ferrari, and Dubai International Capital, which controls a $1bn stake in DaimlerChrysler, have instructed their financial advisers to draw up plans for bidding for one or both of the companies, which employ 16,000 British workers at Midlands factories. Trophy car brands are a favourite for Middle Eastern investors - last month a Kuwaiti investor put up \u00a3240m to help buy Ford-owned luxury car maker Aston Martin. Gulf funds eyeing Jaguar and Land Rover may receive a more friendly reception from unions than private equity groups, which are also hovering. A union official said: &apos;We would want assurances on investment and jobs, but frankly, anything would be better than private equity.&apos; The hostility to private equity firms, who are expected to be under fire again at this week&apos;s Treasury select committee, was demonstrated in 2000 when a blizzard of poor publicity contributed to the failure of Alchemy to acquire Rover. Private equity groups interested in Jaguar and Land Rover could include Blackstone, Apollo and Cerberus Capital, which recently bought US carmaker Chrysler.

It is thought that Ford wants to sell the brands as a pair as they share design, production and research facilities.

I came outside and the fire had started. People were trying to put it out with extinguishers, but it was having no effect. There were some taxi drivers telling everyone to get back in case there was a bomb in the car. It was a frightening experience.&apos; The source of panic was a botched terrorist attack at Glasgow airport at about 3.15pm yesterday. A Jeep Cherokee, containing two men of Asian appearance, tried to smash through the glass doors of the crowded terminal one building but became stuck outside. Witnesses said the driver waved a plastic canister which was lit at the top like a Molotov cocktail. Simon Howard said the man was trying to throw it, adding: &apos;I grabbed my daughter and I screamed to my wife: &quot;Run!&quot;&apos; The man then appeared to pour gasoline over himself and the car and set both ablaze in a fireball, causing a stampede as people cried out and fled the building. The burning man fought with police and, according to one account, was &apos;throwing punches and shouting &quot;Allah! Allah&quot;!&apos; A member of the public, Stephen Clarkson, told how he helped police finally detained him. &apos;I managed to knock the fellow to the ground,&apos; he said. &apos;By this time there were four policemen who got on top of him and restrained him. His clothes had partially burned from his body. His hair was on fire. His whole body was on fire.&apos; A fire extinguisher was used to douse the flames. The second man apparently tried to enter the terminal building but was wrestled to the ground by police and members of the public. Both men were arrested and led away in handcuffs, with the badly burned man taken to hospital - the only person injured. Later it emerged a suspect device was found on him, forcing the evacuation of the hospital. The attack was seemingly inept but it wreaked huge disruption for weekend travellers. Some 35,000 passengers were expected to pass through Glasgow Airport, Scotland&apos;s biggest, during the course of yesterday but it was immediately closed and all flights were suspended. Some passengers were left stranded airside, including those on planes unable to disembark. There was a knock-on effect on flights around the country and several airports moved to step up security. Police said they believed the incident was linked to the planting of two car bombs which failed to detonate in the heart of London just 36 hours earlier. Last night the Government response was swift and decisive. The new Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, announced the national terror threat level had been raised to critical, the highest possible, meaning an attack is expected &apos;imminently&apos;. Gordon Brown addressed the nation after chairing a meeting of the government&apos;s Cobra emergency committee. The week&apos;s events tested the new Prime Minister in a way no one could have predicted. Yesterday hundreds of police officers patrolled rain-drenched streets in London in the ongoing investigation to discover how a suspected British-based al-Qaeda cell had threatened the heart of the West End. Two Mercedes primed with a potentially catastrophic stockpile of petrol, gas and nails had been left in the city centre in the early hours of Friday morning. Fortunately, neither had detonated. The failed attack was discussed at a meeting of Cobra yesterday afternoon. Smith, also undergoing a baptism of fire, issued a statement urging that Britons &apos;must not let the threat of terror stop us getting on with our lives&apos;. But north of the border a fresh drama was already developing. There were conflicting reports over whether the jeep was already on fire when it ploughed into a concrete post next to the airport entrance, or whether it was ignited by the driver using gasoline. It is believed the driver tried to reverse slightly before making another attempt to force his way through the glass doors but was prevented by bollards and a tight angle. The vehicle struck directly in front of check-in desks, where dozens of passengers were standing in line to check in for flights. Jackie Kennedy, 46, a beautician, had stepped out of the airport terminal building for a cigarette as she waited with husband Stephen, 49, for a flight to Dubai. She said: &apos;There were two men in the car. They eventually got out and the man who was in the passenger seat lay down on the ground.&apos; She added: &apos;He was on fire - it was terrifying.&apos; The incidents of the last week, nearly two years after the 7/7 attacks, have underlined the ever-changing terror threat facing the police and security services. Most worrying, concede police sources, is that despite close monitoring of hundreds of suspects nothing on the radar suggested central London, the prized target of al-Qaeda, was on the verge of fresh attack. Initial concerns suggest that the security services may have switched surveillance from the car bombers on to other suspects, leaving them at liberty to hastily create a plan and target London clubbers early on Friday morning. The security services conceded it was &apos;possible&apos; they had been monitoring those involved in the double car bomb cell at some stage, which will also fuel the debate on whether MI5 has sufficient resources. Police candidly accept that they cannot monitor everyone they believe is a threat. In reality, only those whom they believe are involved in &apos;attack planning&apos; are accorded serious attention, with a continual &apos;managing of risk&apos; between the danger posed by individuals. About 50 Islamic extremist cells are &apos;active&apos; in the UK, with about 300 extremists under constant surveillance. These are classified as &apos;primary investigative targets&apos; and involve individuals the security services have reason to fear are actively seeking to carry out an attack. Some of those categorised as the most dangerous can have up to 24 security service officials monitoring them around the clock. About 1,500 Britons are known to the police and security services as possible terror suspects, many registered on a database of radicalised individuals regarded as peripheral but susceptible to al-Qaeda&apos;s message of terror. Last week was the first time Islamic extremists have deployed car bombs in Europe, but MI5 and Scotland Yard had been expecting such an attempt on the capital for months. A former Scotland Yard terrorism expert told The Observer in March that British-based operatives would soon start mimicking the massive car bombs used routinely by Iraqi insurgents, and which have killed hundreds so far this year. MI6 is examining if there is an international dimension by looking at travellers to and from Iraq, where car bombs have killed hundreds. As the manhunt continued for the cell responsible yesterday, attention focused on terror suspects on the run from control orders, which will raise fresh questions over the value of the government&apos;s controversial tool for trying to protect the public. Among those being urgently sought are Lamine Adam from London, who, it was alleged during the Crevice terror trial, discussed attacking a nightclub. Part of his control order stipulates his alleged intention to carry out gas bomb attacks against nightclubs. It is also alleged he has spoken about killing UK troops, another detail bolstering a possible Iraqi connection between the incidents. A security source said that, bearing in mind the allegations against Adam, it is &apos;possible&apos; he is connected to last week&apos;s the failed nightclub bomb. His brother Ibrahim, 20, and Cerie Bullivant, 24, have also escaped their control orders and are now said to be &apos;people of interest&apos; to the police. Others being sought are Zeeshan Siddiqui, 26, who, it was alleged also during the Crevice trial, has links to members of a cell jailed for plotting fertiliser bomb attacks in the south-east of England and which had connections to Dhiren Barot. Barot, who was jailed last year, created the &apos;gas limo&apos; project, using bombs powered by gas canisters, that was approved by senior al-Qaeda figures. Other suspects include Bestun Salim, who vanished from his Manchester flat last summer and is alleged to have links to Ansar al-Islam, a group linked to the Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Iraq&apos;s most notorious insurgent leader, who was killed in a US airstrike last year. Officers will also continue investigating claims on the al Hesbah chat forum, frequently used by al-Qaeda supporters, which had predicted &apos;London shall be bombed&apos; hours before the discovery of the first car bomb in Haymarket. Officers eventually hope to follow the &apos;electronic footprint&apos; of the message&apos;s author, Abu Osama al-Hazeen, a regular contributor to the website. What is already evident is that the double car bomb plot was not the work of a loner. Instead, experts believe those behind the foiled attack belong to one of the loosely interlocking cells which constantly swop information on the latest global terror tactics. The investigation comes ahead of this week&apos;s verdict by the jury in the 21 July terror trial in which six men stand accused of taking part in an extremist Muslim plot to carry out a series of suicide bombings. Yesterday, the biggest global terrorist investigation since 21 July 2005 continued apace. The US, Pakistan and Iraq were among the first countries contacted for assistance. With all MI5 leave cancelled, more than 1,000 officers are involved. It is understood that good-quality CCTV images of the suspect who ran from the Mercedes in Haymarket at 1.30am on Friday have been obtained. It is already likely that the suspects&apos; getaway route will have been trailed using the hundreds of cameras in central London. Details of the driver, the numberplate and the vehicle will already have been checked, but the likelihood is that the cars were stolen. Sources say it is highly unlikely that the cell members have fled the country. Whatever the motive for the attacks, the senses of all Londoners will be keener today. As the national terror threat level moves to critical in the wake of the Glasgow attack, the watchword from Whitehall is vigilance. Smith is saying over and over again that the whole nation &apos;needs to be alert&apos;. A jittery capital fears a new terror campaign.", "tags": ["UK news", "World news", "Scotland", "Glasgow"], "title": "'There was a man on fire.

The entire cast of Ugly Betty has been kitted out in cabaret costumes and thrust onstage, and although Mark Indelicato (who plays the young nephew) is a natural, Alan Dale (Jim Robinson from Neighbours) has his hands clenched tight, fails to kick in time, and is quite the unlikeliest chorus girl I&apos;ve ever seen. The cast of Desperate Housewives simply have to huddle on stage while the flashes from a hundred digital cameras capture their awkwardness. And later a host of stars including Rob Lowe, Donald Sutherland and Peter Krause - Nate from Six Feet Under - are wheeled out to the after-show party and stoically pose for pictures with fans from around the world. There&apos;s not much in the way of security. The fans paw and kiss. And it&apos;s hard to say who looks the more uncomfortable in the picture of me with America Ferrera, better known as Betty (not at all ugly, it transpires, just very, very short; she reminds me of a Shetland pony). We&apos;re both wearing fake smiles and this-wasn&apos;t-my-idea looks. But then, these aren&apos;t fans. Or at least they are, but more saliently, they&apos;re also buyers: television executives from Britain and Germany and Hong Kong and Jamaica and Estonia and Dubai and almost everywhere in between. And the reason for the reversal in the normal master-slave relations between celebrities and their audience is that these buyers&apos; decisions will have a direct bearing on their salaries. For this is the LA screenings, an annual week-long event to which the studios invite in the foreign buyers and show them their wares: the 40-odd new shows that have been sold to the American networks and that may or may not find their way on to our TV screens later this year. And the celebs-as-showdogs is Disney&apos;s attempt to razzmatazz it up a bit; they host a show and then a party on their Burbank lot that is quite dazzling in its starriness. The cast of their current hit shows - and they have more hit shows at the moment than anyone - Desperate Housewives, Grey&apos;s Anatomy, Ugly Betty, and Lost introduce what they very much hope will be next year&apos;s hit shows: Dirty Sexy Money, an everyday tale of ordinary rich folk starring Krause and Sutherland; Reaper - a sort-of teenage Ghostbusters; and six other slightly more forgettable concepts. Last year the party music came from Lionel Ritchie, this year it&apos;s Belinda Carlisle and the Go Gos. Although most of the stars bugger off the minute they&apos;re freed from their contractual obligations, some are happy to drink Disney&apos;s free booze and chat up the buyers from Sweden. Deirbhile Ni Churraighin from TG4, Ireland&apos;s smallest and friendliest station, tells me that last year she danced the night away with Bree Van De Kamp&apos;s son; this year, you can&apos;t move on the dancefloor for characters from Lost, and on a sofa at the back, I spot a sprawling Rob Lowe (another titch, they all are; only Krause approaches the smallish side of regular). This isn&apos;t just big business, it&apos;s huge business. Tom Toumazis, a Disney vice-president, tells me the event costs &apos;shitloads of money&apos;. There are 1,300 buyers in attendance and it&apos;s properly glitzy. From Britain, it&apos;s not just the buyers from all the major channels (Channel 4, Five, ITV, BBC, Sky) and a lot of the more minor ones (FX, Virgin and so on) - in attendance; I&apos;ve also spotted Kevin Lygo, Channel 4&apos;s director of television, and Andy Duncan, its chief executive. Jane Lighting, head of Five, is knocking around somewhere, as is Richard Woolfe, Sky&apos;s director of programmes. They&apos;re all big cheeses in Hollywood these days. After America, Britain is the most important market in the world: the most competitive, and certainly the most lucrative. Sky is believed to pay \u00a31m an episode for Lost - more even than the American networks - and Channel 4 not much less for Desperate Housewives. We love our American shows. They&apos;ve helped Channel 4 carve out its own special niche, and increasingly Sky and Five too. And this year, both ITV and the BBC - despite the political implications of spending licence payers&apos; money on foreign imports - are trying to grab a share of the action. In the circumstances, dressing Alan Dale up in a waiter&apos;s tuxedo and wheeling out Sally Field and Eva Longoria for a couple of snaps makes sound financial sense. Before I arrive in LA, Dan Wootton, a former reporter on TV industry magazine Broadcast, gives me the lowdown on what schmoozing to expect: &apos;You&apos;ll be incredibly well looked after, you&apos;ll get to see the inside of all the studios, you&apos;ll be showered with gifts, but you won&apos;t necessarily see the Channel 4 or Five execs around. They get their own screening rooms and at night they&apos;ll be whisked up into the Hollywood Hills, where they&apos;ll meet the stars and the producers. The chief executives tend to fly over for it. It&apos;s a real highlight of the year. They all love it.&apos; But then, why would they not? Channel 4&apos;s buyer, Jeff Ford, wrote a news piece last year on screenings week in which he described a dinner in the &apos;Babylonian&apos; garden of a Hollywood producer, with panoramic views over the city and Jeff Goldblum on the piano. Still, during the day, they&apos;re playing what is essentially high-stakes poker. In a week, they&apos;ll watch 40-odd pilots from five studios and buy just one or two. &apos;It&apos;s like getting married after a first date,&apos; Marion Edwards, president of Fox International Television, tells me. &apos;It&apos;s really rough. And your relationship with your new wife depends on how much people you&apos;ve never met - the American public - like her. You don&apos;t really know what you&apos;re getting but you have to go with your hunch. Believe me, these people are stressed.&apos; What everybody wants is the next big hit. But they&apos;re so devilishly hard to spot. Last year there were 46 new shows, and of these 85 per cent turned out to be failures. Most lasted just one season, others - a foreign buyer&apos;s nightmare - were cancelled by the networks after just a few episodes. What everyone wants is a returning series. It takes so much effort to interest audiences in new shows, and while in the past buyers could bide their time and see how the shows did in America, these days chequebooks are at the ready from the off. Which has its problems, namely that last year the British buyers bought a whole load of what transpired to be turkeys. Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip was supposed to be a sure-fire hit; Channel 4 bought the series (they will show it later this month), and then it was pulled midway through its run. ITV paid big money for Six Degrees, the new show from Lost creator JJ Abrams. It was supposed to be their first American show in primetime for nine years, a strategy that had to be quickly revised when it was axed. Oh, it&apos;s a tense business. ITV and Five are far too busy to meet me for a chat, and I chase Channel 4&apos;s Jeff Ford around a couple of parties but he successfully eludes me. Everybody is wearing nervous expressions and talking knowledgeably about slots and schedules and trends, but judging from their track records, they might be more successful if they hung out by the pool and threw a dart at the wall. There were only two hits in the States last year: Ugly Betty and Heroes. Channel 4 bought Ugly Betty and have done well with it, but Heroes? This time last year, nobody wanted it. All the terrestrials saw it and passed, and the Sci-Fi channel picked it up for a song. Later it sold to BBC2, which has now bought the second series, but for all the high-level talk and furrowed brows, this is not exactly a science. Alan Esslemont from TG4 tells me that when Desperate Housewives was first shown three years ago, &apos;it was just completely obvious it was a hit, it was so different, it just came out of nowhere and we all walked out thinking, show me the next one&apos;. But generally there&apos;s an awful lot of hindsight knocking round: Friends, the most successful sitcom of the last decade, tanked when first shown at the LA screenings. At the Peninsula, the swankiest hotel in town, I meet David Smyth, the buyer from Sky who insists that it&apos;s &apos;not quite a lottery&apos;, although he concedes &apos;there&apos;s elements of it which are lottery-like. It&apos;s very difficult to predict how viewers are going to respond to things, and how they respond to things in two countries, because if it doesn&apos;t work in the States it&apos;s not going to be recommissioned, or even last a series, so you can&apos;t risk buying it. There are times when I see things that I think Sky viewers will love but middle America will hate, so I&apos;ll not bother.&apos; It&apos;s slightly unpalatable, this, to discover that what we watch on TV in Britain is not so much about what shows we&apos;ll enjoy, it&apos;s about what American advertisers are prepared to back. Keith Le Goy, a Sony VP, tells me that last year it sold Kidnapped around the world. &apos;Everybody loved it, it was a huge sale, internationally,&apos; but it got canned after a couple of episodes anyway. &apos;These are very smart people,&apos; he says and shrugs his shoulders. &apos;But they get it wrong. We all do.&apos; There&apos;s only been one instance that anyone can remember when the international market, led by Britain, kept alive a show the American networks killed. It was - yes, be proud - Baywatch The night after the Disney party it&apos;s Sony&apos;s turn. They&apos;ve hired the Santa Monica pier, thrown out the paying punters, shipped in a job lot of Hawaiian dancers and flowery leis, and opened up the funfair and shooting alleys to the buyers, all for free; at the end of the night, people stagger out toting sacks full of cuddly toys. It&apos;s less starry than Disney&apos;s because Sony has fewer stars this season, although Melanie Griffith turns up and I think I spot Hugh Jackman. What it does do, however, is to demonstrate the global reach of American television. I chat to buyers from everywhere. From Japan and Thailand and Belgium and Dubai. The biggest imported show in China? Prison Break. In Russia? It&apos;s Lost. Germany loves House, the Czech Republic Desperate Housewives, and everyone, everywhere, CSI - it has 75 million viewers around the world. In Poland, they like &apos;anything with a bit of blood and violence&apos; but not sex, whereas in Finland it&apos;s the other way round. And even in France, the European country most likely to stand firm against imperialistic American cultural ambitions, they&apos;ve succumbed in the last couple of years to Lost and 24 I meet the buyers for MBC, the biggest pay channel in the Middle East, who tell me that Desperate Housewives goes down a bomb in Saudi &apos;although we have to cut a little bit of sex - but not as much as you&apos;d think&apos;. The head of Brazil&apos;s Rede TV is there with his wife, Luciana Gimenez, a TV presenter (&apos;she is quite well known in the UK&apos;, he says - for bearing Mick Jagger a son, Lucas). He is about to remake Desperate Housewives as a Brazilian show, while Alexander Rodnyansky, the head of CTC media (or &apos;God&apos;, as two underling Russians refer to him the next day) explains why it wouldn&apos;t work for him. &apos;These people&apos;s &quot;problems&quot;... they are not really problems, or at least not like the ones which Russian women have. For a start, 99 per cent of all women work, and this word &quot;housewife&quot;, it has no direct translation. Our word for it has negative associations. It&apos;s more like &quot;Desperate Mistress&quot; or &quot;Desperate Tarts&quot;.&apos; In Britain, a single episode can cost up to \u00a31m, whereas in Iceland (population 300,000) Gudrun Jonasdottir tells me that they buy shows for as little as $800 an hour; and in countries like Estonia, where there simply isn&apos;t any home-grown drama at all (it&apos;s simply too expensive to make), they don&apos;t so much pick shows as buy them by the metre. No other country in the world can compete with the economic power of the American networks, with their budgets and high-gloss finish. Every year, studios produce more than a hundred pilots and this is money down the drain. They cost around $7m apiece and if the networks don&apos;t pick them up, nobody ever gets to see them. What no one can tell me is what the big shows will be this year. There&apos;s so much caginess around, and a significant amount of bluffing. Amy Barham, the Living TV buyer, says that if she had to stick her neck out, it&apos;d be for &apos;the Kelsey Grammer pilot - Back to You. I&apos;d say that&apos;s a sure-fire hit.&apos; Although back in London I discover she&apos;s actually bought The Sarah Connor Chronicles, a Terminator spin-off from Fox, and Back to You will be on the BBC. &apos;There&apos;s a lot of talk and a lot of second-guessing,&apos; she says. &apos;We&apos;re always wondering what the other channels are up to and we bullshit each other like mad.&apos; Too right! Everybody I speak to discreetly pumps me for information about who else I&apos;ve spoken to, and since anybody&apos;s an expert in this game - or rather, nobody is - I&apos;m even asked what I think. I take it as politeness, but afterwards it occurs to me it might just be desperation. But then, Desperate Executives is a game that any mug can play. I watch all of Disney&apos;s shows and all of Paramount&apos;s. NBC Universal decline to let me anywhere near theirs, ditto Sony, and Fox&apos;s I only get to see when I go home, so I&apos;m missing various crucial bits of information; but for what it&apos;s worth, there&apos;s a handful I like (including Back to You) but the only one I really love is Californication. It stars David Duchovny as a washed-up writer and is very, very rude but also very funny. It&apos;s a sure-fire Channel 4 hit, I think; but then, in the first deal announced, Five goes and buys it and all the execs from the other channels roll their eyes when I say I liked it. &apos;Really?&apos; they say. It&apos;s sour grapes, but still, I start to crack a little. I begin to have doubts. Maybe it is just another Five tits-and-ass number? I experience what David Smyth calls &apos;classic buyer&apos;s paranoia&apos;, until I meet Jason Simms and Toby Etheridge from FX, who tell me they loved it too. I can&apos;t help preferring the buyers from the smaller channels. They don&apos;t get hand-fed profiteroles by Jeff Goldblum, they have time to chat to me, and they&apos;re forced to be cannier, to pick up what they call &apos;the diamonds in the rough&apos; - in FX&apos;s case, the critically acclaimed The Wire. This year, they say, the supernatural is big: undead people, time-travelling people, moving-objects-with-your-mind kinds of people - although there are also two fairly blatant rip-offs of Sex and the City, Lipstick Jungle and Cashmere Mafia, of which, Amy Barham says, &apos;only one will survive&apos; - and two shows that purport to be the new Dallas: Dirty Sexy Money and Cane - a sort of Cuban King Lear with Jimmy Smits. Everybody&apos;s talking about Pushing Daisies, a Fox show starring Anna Friel. &apos;It looks completely unique - like Amelie,&apos; says David Smyth. It&apos;s got that certain mystical ingredient &apos;buzz&apos;, but when I finally get to see it, I think they&apos;re all mad. It&apos;s so mannered and its script could come straight from a How Not to Write a Screenplay book. It&apos;s all tell and no show (voiceovers are big this year, pace Desperate Housewives). Jay Kandola, the ITV buyer, must think it&apos;s going to be a big hit though, as she&apos;s bought it for a rumoured &apos;lot of dosh&apos;. Ditto Channel 4 with Dirty Sexy Money. It&apos;s supposed to be Dallas &apos;with the intelligence of Six Feet Under&apos;, which sounds like the combination of my dreams, but, well, I think I&apos;ll give it a miss. For the younger audience, I liked Reaper, in which an 18-year-old discovers his parents have sold his soul to the devil, another Channel 4 purchase; and I&apos;m amazed and slightly impressed that ITV bought Swingtown, a wife-swapping drama set in the 1970s with Jack Davenport, or Miles from This Life. It&apos;s just so un-ITV - in fact it&apos;s unlike anything and deserves to fly, although, to be honest, it&apos;s more likely to flop. There are English actors everywhere. As well as Anna Friel and Jack Davenport, there&apos;s The Bionic Woman (which ITV is also sniffing around) starring Michelle Ryan (Zoe Slater from EastEnders!); Journeyman (Sky) has Kevin McKidd from Rome; Eli Stone, Jonny Lee Miller from Trainspotting; plus there&apos;s Jeremy Sheffield from Holby City, Damian Lewis from Band of Brothers, and Linus Roache - best known in Britain for being Ken Barlow&apos;s son. Nobody really knows why. There&apos;s a theory that having European actors makes the shows more saleable internationally, but then since they largely have American accents (or in Friel&apos;s case American-ish), this is as much a mystery as anything else. It&apos;s all semi-mystical: what makes a hit, what doesn&apos;t, why the whole world watches CSI, why anybody thought of turning Hugh Laurie into a misanthropic American doctor, why Desperate Housewives speaks to women in Doha but not Minsk, and why the Chinese love Prison Break (although, possibly, being banged up for a crime you didn&apos;t commit is more social commentary than drama there). Watch Californication, though. It&apos;s on the wrong channel and I&apos;ll admit it may offend some sensibilities - the first scene involves a nun giving a blow job - but it&apos;s my punt, dammit, and I&apos;m sticking with it. Oh, and Channel 4: if I&apos;m right, I&apos;d be very happy to go hang out with Jeff Goldblum next year. High stakes: next year&apos;s big hopes Back to You: the new Frasier. Kelsey Grammer as a washed-up anchorman back in his hometown to work with ex-colleague Patricia Keaton. Channel 4  Big Bang Theory: two theoretical physicists who live next to a hottie. Geek comedy, vaguely Will &amp; Grace. C4 Reaper: Ghost Busters for teens. Two slackers turn clean-up men for the devil, Twin Peaks&apos; star Ray Wise. C4  Dirty Sexy Money: an everyday tale of ordinary rich folk starring Peter Krause - Nate from Six Feet Under. C4 Pushing Daisies: quirky, supernatural drama about a man who can bring people back to life. With Anna Friel. ITV1 The Bionic Woman: Jaime Sommers returns in the unlikely guise of Zoe Slater off EastEnders (Michelle Ryan). ITV2 Cane: another everyday tale of ordinary rich, murderous folk. This one is set amid a Cuban-American rum family, stars LA Law&apos;s Jimmy Smits. ITV3 Swingtown: Kitschy wife-swapping drama set in Seventies smalltown America starring Jack Davenport from This Life. ITV1 and ITV3 Californication: David Duchovny as a washed-up writer who&apos;s sold his soul to the Hollywood devil. Rude, funny, it&apos;s on that most un-Hollywood quality: failure. Five Damages: a twisting legal thriller starring Glenn Close as an ice-cold litigator. BBC is &apos;poised to buy&apos;. The Sarah Connor Chronicles: a Terminator spin-off starring British actress Lena Headey.

But yesterday Moscow confirmed its reputation as the world&apos;s most decadently expensive city with the opening of a luxury hotel aimed at the mega-rich. Prices at the 334-room Ritz-Carlton hotel are excessive, even for a country riding an unprecedented oil boom. A basic room costs just over $1,000 (\u00a3500) a night. The presidential suite will set you back $16,000 but you do get your own bulletproof dining room. Breakfast is extra. For $700 staff will serve you the tsar&apos;s breakfast including Cristal champagne, beluga caviar, and a truffle omelette. The wine list features a 1961 Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus at $68,000 a bottle, and a 1969 Macallan single malt whisky priced at $400 a measure. For British guests there is an English high tea - a snip at 900 roubles (\u00a318). Were Lenin to wake from his mausoleum across the road and take the lift up to the hotel&apos;s rooftop sushi bar, he might wonder why he ever bothered leading the Bolshevik revolution. . Yesterday Sergey Logvinov, a spokesman for the hotel, admitted that the prices were a bit steep but said there were plenty of people in Moscow who could afford them. &quot;Moscow is known now for having 35 billionaires. That&apos;s more than New York,&quot; he said, as he showed the Guardian the hotel&apos;s rococo Russian empire style lobby and wood-panelled bar. On the 12th floor, with its panoramic views of the Kremlin and Red Square, the first guests were tucking into caviar rolls. &quot;There is a huge market in Moscow for luxury goods and luxury services,&quot; Mr Logvinov said, &quot;We think we have come to the right market at the right time. Our billionaires are very patriotic. &quot;Although they travel abroad they like to return to Russia.&quot; The hotel is built on the site of the old Intourist hotel, a Soviet landmark famous for its surly service and bugged telephones. The former hotel employed staff vetted for their political loyalty to guide foreign tourists on tightly controlled excursions. After the end of the Soviet Union, the concrete tower on Tverskaya street acquired a seedy atmosphere: the air conditioning didn&apos;t work and prostitutes in tiny skirts walked round the lobby. The Ritz-Carlton, built for $350m, offers services more in keeping with the new, uninhibitedly capitalist Moscow. The hotel has a vodka sommelier able to advise on which vodka to knock back after a hard day&apos;s sightseeing. It also has what is euphemistically titled a &quot;nightlife butler&quot; whose job is to guide well-heeled but possibly middle-aged and sagging guests past the strict controls of Moscow&apos;s trendier nightclubs. Yesterday the hotel said it expected about 80% of its guests to be foreign travellers, though it predicted the proportion of Russians would increase over time. The problem is that despite its moneyed elite, the average monthly wage in Russia is still only about $500, putting the hotel way out of reach for most people. Observers also point out that Moscow already has plenty of expensive places to stay, with even grotty, Stalin-era hotel rooms costing about $200 a night. The one thing the Russian capital currently lacks is budget and mid-range accommodation. But Oliver Eller, the hotel&apos;s general manager, said less well-off visitors should not be deterred. Ordinary Muscovites were welcome to come in, take a look at the hotel and order a cup of coffee, a relative snip at 220 roubles. In the lap of luxury Moscow does not have the monopoly on luxurious and expensive hotels. The Burj al-Arab, a luxury hotel in Dubai, is divided into 202 duplex suites. The smallest occupies 169 square metres (1,819 sq ft) and the largest 780 square metres. Prices for the least expensive suites range from $1,000 to more than $6,000 a night. The most expensive can cost more than $15,000 a night. One of its restaurants, the Al Muntaha (meaning &quot;highest&quot; or &quot;ultimate&quot;), is located 200 metres above the Gulf, with a view of Dubai and access via a panoramic elevator. The Four Seasons hotel in New York has a huge lobby with giant armchairs next to a vast log fire. Brunch is its speciality. Benedict Brunch, named after the New York chef Legrand Benedict, who invented eggs benedict as a hangover cure, is at its best in Manhattan. Prices range from $695 a night to $15,000 for the penthouse. Apartment prices at Claridge&apos;s hotel in London range from \u00a3479 to \u00a35,430 a night. The Royal suite, at \u00a33,330 a night, has a grand piano formerly owned by Arthur Sullivan and WS Gilbert, who used it to compose many of their operettas.

A junior doctor, Bilal Abdulla, had worked at the hospital after graduating from Baghdad University three years ago. His alleged accomplice still lay in the hospital, seriously injured and receiving treatment from the staff who had previously worked alongside the young Iraqi being questioned by police in connection with the attacks. As the investigation gathered pace and more details came to light during the day it was hospital staff who found themselves at the centre of the ongoing developments. They had heard of police raids at the doctors&apos; accommodation block near the entrance to the hospital early yesterday. Police would not confirm or deny the reports. Then in the afternoon, around 2.30pm, part of the grounds was sealed off by police as a bomb disposal team, equipped with a remote-controlled robot, moved into position. Just over an hour later, police officers took cover behind stone walls as the blasts reverberated around the grounds. The revelation that a doctor at the hospital is alleged to be one of the men arrested after driving a blazing Jeep Cherokee into the front of the main terminal building at Glasgow airport stunned medical staff and police. Colleagues at the hospital are said to be deeply distressed by the revelation that Dr Abdulla is among those arrested. It was also reported last night that the junior doctor had been warned by a colleague that he was spending too much time reading Islamic texts. One doctor who declined to be named said Dr Abdulla had worked on a general ward, but was known for taking time off sick and had been regarded as a &quot;bit of a slacker&quot;. Hamid Iftikhar, 28, who lives in the residential block at the hospital said: &quot;Police came round about 9pm last night asking for our details. I didn&apos;t know Bilal. I think he was a junior doctor on the general medicine programme.&quot; Last night Dr Abdulla was being questioned at a high-security police station in Govan, Glasgow. But inside the hospital the second man in the Jeep attack remained in a critical condition after dousing himself in petrol at the scene of the attack and setting himself ablaze. The Guardian was told yesterday that there was a heavy armed police presence outside and around one of the hospital&apos;s operating theatres. One member of staff, who would not be named, said he believed that they were operating on the suspect inside. Some reports suggest the man has suffered 90% burns. The hospital would not confirm whether the suspect was being treated. Two of the other men under arrest have also been confirmed to be health professionals, and there was speculation that two further suspects arrested in Paisley on Sunday evening may also be doctors. &quot;It&apos;s simply incredible,&quot; one Scotland Yard source said yesterday. Among those being questioned by detectives yesterday was a neurosurgeon, Mohammed Asha, 26, who was arrested while driving along the M6 in Cheshire with his wife and their son on Saturday night. He is thought to have been detained as a result of evidence uncovered near the scene of one of the two Mercedes that were packed with propane gas cylinders, cans of petrol and nails and abandoned in central London on Thursday night. Neither bomb detonated and the cars were said to have yielded a wealth of evidence, including valuable information gathered from mobile phones left in the vehicles as detonators. A Jordanian citizen whose family are Palestinian refugees, Dr Asha has been working in the Midlands for the past two years. Last night police were searching two addresses where he had lived in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, and his offices at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire. Shocked The son of the doctor&apos;s current landlord, Carl Plant, said: &quot;He has been living here for about six to 12 months. They rented it from my mother, who is in Dubai. It shocked me, as I watched it on the news - the home where I had lived as a child. It is not very nice to think that I had so many happy family memories living there and now it is being ripped up.&quot; Neighbour Molly Durham, 83, said that one of the occupants of the house was a doctor, and that his wife was a part-time teacher. &quot;She was very pleasant. She seemed very shy, a bit sheepish, but was nice,&quot; she said. Dr Asha&apos;s wife was being questioned at Paddington Green police station in London last night. It was unclear who was caring for their son. Dr Asha began practising in the UK in 2005 after qualifying in Jordan, according to the General Medical Council. A spokeswoman said he held a limited registration which enabled him to work in the NHS under supervision. Before joining the University Hospital of North Staffordshire, where he is a senior house officer, he was a junior doctor at the Royal Shrewsbury hospital between August 2005 and 2006. According to police sources, a 26-year-old man arrested in Liverpool city centre late on Saturday is also a doctor or medical student who has been working or studying at a hospital in Cheshire since arriving in the UK from India. His home near Penny Lane in the Mossley Hill area and previous home in the Toxteth area were still being searched by police yesterday.", "tags": ["UK news", "World news"], "title": "Hospital staff stunned as doctors are questioned", "sentences": ["They rented it from my mother, who is in Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jul/03/terrorism.world2", "publicationDate": "2007-07-02T23:34:40Z"}, {"article": "Foreign doctors of Middle Eastern origin are likely to be treated with suspicion and reserve following the arrest of six medics in connection with recent terrorist incidents in London and Glasgow. This is incredibly unfair. Obviously the vast majority of doctors who come to this country do so for the best of reasons. They are rightly made to jump through numerous hoops in order to practise in the UK. I work as a GP and had a foreign trainee assigned to me a while ago. She was a highly experienced family doctor from Israel who had run her own practice for 20 years. Her English was perfect, her medicine sound and her standards higher than mine. She had to do an English test, spend a year with me, pass a medical exam and submit a video of her consultations with patients. The GMC checked her qualifications. I don&apos;t suppose she was screened by the security services to check whether she posed a threat, but then no one has ever screened me either as far as I know. So getting work as a doctor from abroad in the UKis not a walkover. And life has become particularly difficult for doctors who aren&apos;t from the European Economic Area. EEA doctors are free to work in the UK without taking any special exams or checks as far as I know. But non-EEA doctors who aren&apos;t UK residents can only be considered for medical jobs if there is no suitable applicant from the EEA. There are kids who come to the UK from, say, Trinidad and Tobago, to study medicine in one of our medical schools. They can accumulate student debts up to \u00a3150,000 and then find they can&apos;t get a training job. A medical degree on its own without any specialist training is pretty worthless. The whole issue of the medical workforce is most peculiar. For the past six months, 30,000 UK junior doctors have been waiting to see whether they could get a place on a higher training course so they could move on in their careers. This follows introduction of a new Medical Training Application Service (now suspended) which has created too few jobs for the number of young doctors we&apos;ve put through medical schools. A young doctor who works with me says many of her peers are stuck without jobs. They have student debts and mortgages to pay. One of her friends is off to Dubai, another has gone into industry. So we have a glut of young home-trained UK doctors who haven&apos;t got jobs. An influx of EEA doctors who can come and go at will without being screened for medical competence. And non-EEA doctors who are extensively screened from a medical point of view but who have to wait in line for the jobs after the UK and EEA doctors have taken the best pickings. These non-EEA doctors from places like Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon may have to take jobs that the UK and EEA docs don&apos;t want. And now, they&apos;re going to have to put up with suspicion about their motives and concern about their potential involvement in terrorism. I hope patients will bear in mind that doctors from outside the EEA have been highly screened to check their medical competence. That all doctors practising in the UK are answerable to the GMC. That the arrested doctors have not been found guilty of any crime as yet and that the 7/7 bombers were all UK citizens and not from abroad. This episode has focused media attention on where our doctors come from. Victimisation of non-EEA doctors, who may be doing the jobs others don&apos;t want, is completely unjust. But so too is the fiasco of poor planning that has led to home-grown doctors being unemployed.

Bilal Talal Abdulla, an Iraqi doctor working at a hospital near the airport, had met Sheikh Ahmad al-Qubeisi at a mosque in Baghdad and would later describe him as &quot;my best friend&quot;. An uncle of Dr Abdulla, who has lived in the UK for almost 20 years, said: &quot;When Ahmad came on television he would say that he knew him. He called him his best friend. I think he brainwashed him.&quot; He said Dr Adbulla was related to al-Qubeisi through marriage. Al-Qubeisi, who has a regular television show on Dubai television, spoke of suicide bombing in 2004 telling viewers &quot;those who commit martyrdom operations who are, by Allah, the greatest martyrs in Islamic history&quot;. Dr Abdulla was also deeply angered by the war in Iraq, the family said, and he had been delighted to be able to flee the country. &quot;Of course he was angry. He was so glad to leave all these troubles. He was so happy to come here. He was so anxious to leave Baghdad, and here he was moving towards a goal.&quot; Dr Abdulla, 27, had been born in Aylesbury while his father, also a doctor, was training in the UK. Although raised in Baghdad, he was entitled to a British passport and visited Britain frequently in recent years, staying in Cambridge while he improved his English before finding work at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Paisley last summer. He was last seen in Cambridge last month. The uncle added: &quot;The type of friends he associated with, I would not want. They were very religious, too religious. He met them in the mosque.&quot; Together, he said, they would make occasional trips to the Lake District; alleged Islamist militants are said to have conducted clandestine training exercises there. Police searched a number of properties in Cambridge yesterday, including a house owned by the Abu Bakr Siqqid mosque, the city&apos;s only mosque, where Dr Abdulla stayed seven years ago. They also interviewed a number of his friends and relatives. Hicham Kwieder, secretary of the Cambridge Muslim Welfare Society, said: &quot;I often spoke to him after Friday prayers. He seemed to me to be a genuine man. We are cooperating with the police to try to establish how educated people may have turned to violence, what their motive might be.&quot; The network of close family connections, workplace relationships and chance encounters that allegedly led young health professionals from at least four countries to join forces to plan a series of car bombings has been carefully picked apart by counter-terrorism detectives and MI5 officers. Dr Abdulla is thought to have met another of those under arrest, Mohammed Asha, a Jordanian doctor, when he was studying at Addenbrooke&apos;s hospital in Cambridge. After completing his medical studies in Baghdad, Dr Abdulla moved to Paisley while Dr Asha moved first to Shrewsbury - where he and his Jordanian wife, Marwa, 27, a laboratory technician, worked in a local hospital - and then to Staffordshire. At Paisley, Dr Abdulla worked alongside two other young doctors, thought to be Saudis, who were arrested on Sunday night and whose names have yet to emerge. He also worked alongside a young doctor with the surname Ahmed. On Saturday, this man doused himself in petrol and set himself ablaze after ramming the Jeep, laden with gas cylinders and petrol canisters, into Glasgow airport&apos;s main terminal. Dr Abdulla, who had been in the passenger seat, was arrested at the scene. There are unconfirmed reports that Ahmed is a friend or relation of Sabeel Ahmed, 26, a young Indian doctor working at Halton General Hospital in Runcorn, Cheshire. His Jeep Cherokee was parked for several weeks in Wordsworth Street in the Toxteth area of Liverpool, close to Sabeel Ahmed&apos;s former home. Sabeel Ahmed attended a college affiliated to the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences in Bangalore, as did Muhammad Haneef, 27. They shared a flat in Toxteth while working together at Halton General before Dr Haneef moved to Australia. They are also related: Dr Haneef&apos;s mother is understood to be Sabeel Ahemd&apos;s father&apos;s niece. Dr Asha and his wife were later arrested on the M6 in Cheshire. Sabeel Ahmed was picked up in Liverpool. The following night, the two doctors thought to be Saudis were arrested at a halls of residence at the Royal Alexandra. Early on Monday, British time, Dr Haneef was picked up in Brisbane as he attempted to board a flight to India.", "tags": ["UK news", "World news", "Scotland", "Glasgow"], "title": "Family of suspect say he was influenced by Iraqi cleric", "sentences": ["Al-Qubeisi, who has a regular television show on Dubai television, spoke of suicide bombing in 2004 telling viewers &quot;those who commit martyrdom operations who are, by Allah, the greatest martyrs in Islamic history&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jul/05/terrorism.scotland", "publicationDate": "2007-07-05T22:54:01Z"}, {"article": "Final Call by Leo Hickman (400pp, Eden Project, \u00a312.99) Leo Hickman has had a good year. He&apos;s been clubbing in Ibiza, boozing in Tallinn, birdwatching in Costa Rica and staying in that enormous sail-shaped hotel in Dubai. But, as he&apos;s careful to point out, he hasn&apos;t been doing all this for fun: he&apos;s been investigating the tourism industry and the massive growth in worldwide travel. A Guardian columnist, Hickman has already written several books about ethical consumerism, describing his tortuous efforts to reconcile his conscience with the demands of work, family and ordinary urban life. In A Life Stripped Bare, he devoted a chapter to recounting how he and his family swapped long-haul travel for a walking tour in Tuscany, travelling across Europe by overnight train. In that book, Hickman&apos;s ecological musings are constantly interrupted by his wife, who punctures his ramblings and brings him down to earth. She doesn&apos;t make an appearance in The Final Call and I missed her brusque, honest and thoroughly sensible voice. So alone, Hickman jets around the world, pursuing British tourists and picking through the debris they leave behind. He follows sex tourists around Bangkok and describes how the dozy fishing village of Benidorm became a monstrous concrete city servicing four million holidaymakers a year. He visits the skiing centre in Dubai, where 6,000 tonnes of snow is kept frozen. But although making snow in the desert sounds ludicrous, Hickman discovers that the Alps aren&apos;t much different. Rising temperatures have removed much of the snow from the mountains, so water is pumped from reservoirs, frozen and sprayed on to the slopes. Italian thieves can apparently earn \u20ac900 for every truck of snow they steal from a glacier and deliver to a ski resort. Hickman discovers that tourists in some respects resemble armies: they strip the land of resources and leave a trail of destruction. Backpackers are the advance guard, package tours the footsoldiers. No one gives much thought to what happens to the landscape or its inhabitants when the army goes home. In Kerala, for instance, where a few hippies used to ride boats through the backwaters, so many people now take boat trips that the riverbeds are plastered with plastic bags and the fish taste of kerosene. In an excellent chapter on flying, Hickman dismisses a few myths and offers some useful ways to think about our own ecological footprint. &quot;Flying anywhere,&quot; we learn, &quot;emits broadly the same amount of emissions as if you drove there by car without taking any other passengers with you. Therefore, if you drive the UK average of 12,000 miles a year, you are creating the same amount of emissions as if you had made one London-Los Angeles return trip.&quot; He confesses that his book-related travels created 10 tonnes of CO2, mostly on flights, but dismisses carbon offsetting as little more than pointless. So, what&apos;s the answer? Hickman concludes with an idea taken from the food movement: Tourism Concern and the Fairtrade Labelling Organisation are working on a scheme awarding the Fairtrade label to hotels, resorts and travel agents that meet their stringent standards. If that doesn&apos;t appeal, then he suggests borrowing another culinary concept, from the slow food movement. Proponents of &quot;slow travel&quot; recommend we slow down and try to enjoy ourselves more, travelling by train, perhaps, staying in small hotels and lingering over meals, so that &quot;the journey itself becomes just as important as the destination&quot; and we &quot;relearn why it is we crave travel&quot;. It sounds like the recipe for a perfect holiday.", "tags": ["Books", "Higher education", "Education", "Culture", "Travel writing"], "title": "Final Call by Leo Hickman", "sentences": ["He&apos;s been clubbing in Ibiza, boozing in Tallinn, birdwatching in Costa Rica and staying in that enormous sail-shaped hotel in Dubai.", "He visits the skiing centre in Dubai, where 6,000 tonnes of snow is kept frozen."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/07/featuresreviews.guardianreview7", "publicationDate": "2007-07-07T22:36:09Z"}, {"article": "Give the professionals of the European tour a chance to lift, clean and place their ball - in other words a good lie every time they hit the fairway - and good scores are assured. This week at the K Club, home last year to the Ryder Cup, the European Open has been almost submerged under seven inches of rain and the only way to get the tournament completed has been to allow placing. And so in what has been an apparent approximation of a Swedish summer it was no surprise to see five Swedes in the top 10 after the 36-hole cut, and also to see some of the early starters yesterday recording rounds in the low sixties. Denmark&apos;s Soren Hansen shot 63 to take a clubhouse lead on 10 under par. Ricardo Gonzales, an Argentine who is seeing some success following his compatriot Angel Cabrera&apos;s win at the US Open, had a six-under 64. Peter O&apos;Malley (Australia) went one better for a seven-under total of 203, while Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland and Steve Webster (England) both got round in 65. Meanwhile Pelle Edberg, the surprise second-round leader who, with his extravagant headband looks like a refugee from Sweden&apos;s downhill ski-racing team, kept his overnight lead after nine holes. If Edberg, whose father&apos;s name is Stefan but is no relation, has anything like the tennis player&apos;s ice-cool temperament, he could be the shock winner here, given that his previous best finish in a European tour event is ninth. At nine-under at the turn he was one stroke ahead of compatriot Peter Hedblom, while O&apos;Malley&apos;s 63 had taken him into third alongside David Frost, who combines the perfect marriage between golf and wine in one package. He has been one of South Africa&apos;s most successful golfers and now has an equally successful vineyard and wine business. McDowell, the best of the Irish, saw his 65 shoot him up the placings from tied for twenty-sixth to tied for sixth and he now looking for a win. David Howell is one of the European tour&apos;s nice guys and a lucid thinker to boot. He is also something of a philosopher, which helps when you are as plagued with injury as is he. This is his first tournament since the Masters in April during which time he has endured a succession of ailments, including, after he had recovered from shoulder and neck problems, an injured wrist. For a golf obsessive, which most professionals are, three months off is an eternity and Howell has had to use all his lateral thinking powers to stay sane. &apos;I&apos;ve certainly had my low moments,&apos; he says, &apos;and I have had some miserable days. So I have had to find some nice people to speak to and try to remember that my lot is not all so bad.&apos; As a man who at the end of 2006 had won \u00a36.7million in prize money and probably made as much again off the course, his lot is actually enviable although Howell will certainly have reached the stage where tournament titles and major championships are what count most. Howell, at his best, can reasonably aim for the latter, although it is a matter of some amazement that in 10 goes at the Open Championship he has made the weekend only twice, finishing forty-second at Royal Birkdale in 1998 and forty-fifth in 1999 at Carnoustie. He has, however, a cunning plan to win this year&apos;s return to Carnoustie. In order to minimise the injuries, if possible, he is going to become &apos;more like Monty&apos; - a noted non-practiser, and &apos;less like Vijay&apos;, a complete golfaholic. He then hopes to prove that history is not bunk. &apos;My master plan,&apos; he says with a big smile, &apos;is that when I won in Dubai in 1999 I had just had eight weeks off and that was my second tournament back. When I won in Germany in 2005 I had had five weeks off and that was my second week back and when I won the BMW last year had just had a month off and that was my second week back. So by all rights I should win my next event and it could easily be the Open.&apos; What with the weather and the copious quantities of water on the course- - it affects 14 holes - the new US Open champion, Cabrera, should have been at home here. The Argentine rejoices in the nickname &apos;El pato&apos;, the duck, because of the way he walks, but Cabrera is a duck that does not take to water and yesterday, at the 4th, he first drove into a lake and then, having taken a penalty drop, pitched his ball straight back in. It added up to a quadruple-bogey eight and he finished last but one of the 68 players who made the cut.", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport"], "title": "Golf: Hansen splashes his way quietly into the lead", "sentences": ["&apos;My master plan,&apos; he says with a big smile, &apos;is that when I won in Dubai in 1999 I had just had eight weeks off and that was my second tournament back."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/08/golf.news", "publicationDate": "2007-07-07T23:06:16Z"}, {"article": "&apos;Her name is Anjum Anand and she&apos;s lovely.

Yup, that&apos;s right, making; not unwrapping a silver-foil package a man with a crash helmet just handed me through the front door. And when I say making, I don&apos;t mean opening a jar of Patak&apos;s tikka paste either. I&apos;m doing it properly, back to basics, pestle and mortar, seeds, ginger, garam masala, the works. You see I watched this programme called Indian Food Made Easy (BBC2), and I fell for it. Well, I fell for her, really. Her name is Anjum Anand and she&apos;s lovely. She&apos;s serene and beautiful, smiley and reassuring, like a sort of Asian Nigella, but more real. Not only is she perfect, but so is her kitchen. It&apos;s huge and bright, with flowers and little collections of bottles, bowls of chillies, pyramids of lemons. And look, she&apos;s got two ovens - not one of those double ones, but two of them, side by side, ready for action. That&apos;s just cheating. I&apos;m looking round my own ill-equipped, mono-oven kitchen, with its empty wine bottles and piles of old newspapers all over the place. How is anything beautiful ever going to come out of here? But I&apos;ve done what Anjum said, been to the supermarket (frankly, I would&apos;ve gone to the moon for her), got my basic spices, now I&apos;m pounding them up, peeling ginger and garlic, preparing my marinade. Toast the cardamoms? That&apos;s all very well, but how are you supposed to get them out of the toaster? Crazy lady. This is chicken tikka for dummies - not like the secret recipe of tandoori guru Mr Singh, whom Anjum visits in his London restaurant. But he&apos;s got a big moustache and a special tandoori oven, and he&apos;s been doing it all his life. You&apos;ve got to start somewhere. And, to be honest, my marinade smells gorgeous. Now I have to add the chicken and put in the fridge overnight? Overnight?! Are you kidding? What, so you have to decide that you could really murder a curry tomorrow? How does that work? Too bad, mine&apos;s getting four hours max. I&apos;ll add some more spices, to make it a super-strength marinade - Marinade Rapide Extra \u00ae. Anjum&apos;s got her mate Panthea over, who doesn&apos;t know how to cook. That&apos;s the device - Anjum teaches Panthea, we learn by watching. No celebs, which is a relief. Or swearing. And Panthea is very watchable, too. The Spice Girls, but in this case, all reunion tours very welcome. As well as tikka wraps, they do potato samosas in their perfect kitchen, and savoury semolina cake, which they&apos;re then going to take to Sherborne country fair. The countryside, that&apos;s always good for a laugh. I&apos;m just sticking with the tikka today. Right, it&apos;s ready to come out of my (only) oven ... God, you know what, that&apos;s proper that is, bloody lovely. So what if it took six hours, and cost \u00a318.40 in total; it&apos;s very nearly as good as the chicken tikka from Vijay&apos;s up the road. Anjum suggests a strawberry lassi to go with it, but I&apos;ve got 12 pints of lager in instead. At the Dorset fair, Anjum and Panthea are charming the local yokels with their lovely smiles and their tikka wraps. A lady in a puffa is congratulating Anjum on her samosas. &quot;Thank you, they&apos;re quite light, aren&apos;t they, because I haven&apos;t deep-fried them,&quot; she replies. &quot;Very light,&quot; agrees country lady. &quot;There&apos;s no heaviness about it at all.&quot; Yeah, all right, we get it, Anjum&apos;s samosas aren&apos;t big in the weight department. I&apos;m bored by her now. And I reckon I can do it without her. I&apos;m going it alone, thinking maybe a rogan josh next ... Ah, Megastructures: The World&apos;s Tallest Hotel (Five).

Off Dubai in fact, because it&apos;s built on its own stormproof island (hand-made by cheap immigrant workers). The Burj al-Arab is extraordinary, with its exterior steel skeleton and its helipad like a waterlily in the sky. Inside it&apos;s all gold leaf, crimson velvet, mosaics, marble, crystal chandeliers and giant fish tanks. A suite costs up to \u00a314,500 a night.

However, the first instalment of the new series was down on the average for BBC1&apos;s Monday 7pm to 7.30pm slot over the past month, according to unofficial overnights. Over that period programmes including Saving Planet Earth, Trawlermen and Celebrity Masterchef attracted an average of 3.8 million viewers and a 20% share. Last night&apos;s return, which included a report on badgers, was also down on the first episode of last year&apos;s month-long series. That attracted 3.4 million viewers and a 21% share when it opened with Adrian Chiles co-presenting with Nadia Sawalha, who is not in this series because she is pregnant. Last night, Chiles&apos; co-presenter was Myleene Klass. The One Show failed to dent ITV1 Soap Emmerdale, which attracted 7 million viewers and a 39% share in the same slot. On BBC2 at the same time, the first part of the spin-off series Saving Planet Earth UK drew 1.3 million viewers and a 7% share. The documentary also featured Myleene Klass; her search for the UK&apos;s biggest spider meant she achieved the rare distinction of being on both BBC2 and BBC1. Channel 4 News pulled in 1 million viewers and a 6% share at 7pm, while Five News drew 300,000 viewers and a 2% share between 7pm and 7.15pm. Mean Machines of War followed on Five with 600,000 viewers and a 3% share between 7.15pm and 8pm. At 8pm on Channel 4, Daily Mail columnist Richard Littlejohn&apos;s examination of anti-semitism in the UK, The War on Britain&apos;s Jews?, drew 1.2 million viewers and a 5% share. The show was beaten by Five&apos;s offering, a new series of Megastructures looking at big buildings including Dubai&apos;s seven-star Burj Al-Arab hotel, which attracted 1.3 million and a 6% share in the same slot. EastEnders pulled in 8.8 million and a 40% share between 8pm and 8.30pm on BBC1, while an edition of Panorama revisiting previous investigations including John Sweeney&apos;s controversial profile of the Church of Scientology attracted 2.7 million viewers and a 12% share between 8.30pm and 9pm. On BBC2, University Challenge drew 2.5 million viewers and an 11% share at 8pm. It was followed at 8.30pm by the first of six episodes of a new series called Indian Food Made Easy, which attracted a healthy 2.1 million viewers and a 9% share. At 9pm, the second episode of Channel 4&apos;s new genealogy series Empire&apos;s Children, in which actress Shobna Guilati went in search of her ancestors and learned the full horror of the deaths of four members of her family during the violence surrounding the partition of India in 1947, drew 2.1 million viewers and a 10%share at 9pm. Gulati&apos;s programme beat the series opener, fronted by actress Diana Rigg who grew up in India. Last week it drew 1.9 million people and a 9% share. Over on BBC2 at the same time, the sixth episode of Peter and Dan Snow: 20th Century Battlefields attracted the same ratings as Empire&apos;s Children. On BBC1, the first episode of the new series Fight for Life, about saving sick children at Great Ormond Street Hospital, pulled in 3.8 million viewers and a 17% share in the 9pm hour.

That was the hardest bit, but now racegoers will find it easier to get from A to B after we increased our acreage by going 20 metres into the National Stud land.&quot; With prizemoney up and &quot;tweaks&quot; made to the conditions of certain races, Prosser has been rewarded with a top-class programme for day one of the Ritz Club July Festival. He expects the meeting to start on &quot;good, fast ground&quot; after a few welcome dry days at Newmarket. &quot;We had five inches of rain in June but the track is drying out well,&quot; said Prosser. &quot;There has been no need to do any watering and the far side track which we use this week has not been raced on since last August. The going stick reading is the same for both sides of the track, so I don&apos;t anticipate any advantage in the draw.&quot; The first two races on today&apos;s card, with 19 and 20 runners respectively, will tell if there is any draw bias. Last year, the far side (low numbers) were favoured in the six-furlongs totesport.com Heritage Handicap, but that was on fast ground after watering had taken place. The draw won&apos;t matter in the day&apos;s feature race, the Falmouth Stakes, run over a mile, but tactics will. With no obvious front-runner in the field, this could be advantage South Africa in the shape of the six-year-old mare, Irridescence (3.10), who has shown she can win from the front. Her trainer Mike de Kock, who has firmly established his name on the international stage with notable victories at the Dubai Carnival, has based a few horses with Geoff Wragg at Newmarket for an assault on some top summer prizes. The three-year-old Drayton belied his 100-1 odds by finishing fifth in the Golden Jubilee at Royal Ascot. Irridescence has caught the attention of Newmarket work-watchers, including Prosser. &quot;She has worked twice on the July course with Asiatic Boy and she looks very well,&quot; he said. Asiatic Boy is no ordinary yardstick. Unbeaten in four starts at the Dubai Carnival, he won the UAE Derby by a street and has the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood on his agenda. Irridescence had two outings in Dubai on the back of a rushed preparation after she had rejoined de Kock following a spell with John Hammond in France. Not many fillies finished ahead of Ouija Board in recent years, but Irridescence managed it when she won the Queen Elizabeth II Cup in Hong Kong last year. She may just find this trip on the sharp side, but expect to see jockey Weichong Marwing make plenty of use of her. Frankie Dettori who, along with Lester Piggott, will officially open the revamped course at midday, needs a good week after the disappointment of the Eclipse Stakes. He can win the Cherry Hinton Stakes on Francesca D&apos;Gorgio (2.35), who was a close-up fourth behind Elletelle at Royal Ascot. Now 3lb better off with the winner and fitted with a first-time visor, she is fancied to follow up stablemate Sander Camillo&apos;s win here last year.

Photocopies of Girls of Riyadh subsequently changed hands for up to $500. In a country where novelists are forced to publish their work abroad (usually in Lebanon), it&apos;s not surprising that this first novel by a 25-year-old dentistry student seemed subversive; it offers a rare glimpse into the lives of women of &quot;the velvet class&quot; - the educated upper-middle class, described by the anonymous female narrator as &quot;an elite whose behaviour is normally kept hidden to all but themselves&quot;. The novel is structured as a weekly newsletter she emails to a growing list of subscribers over the course of a year. She tells us nothing about herself, repeatedly denying she is any of her characters - &quot;I am every one of my friends and my story is their story&quot;. Each instalment begins with an epigraph drawn from an eclectic range of sources - Lebanese pop songs to Egyptian Muslim televangelists, via Nikos Kazantzakis and Rabindranath Tagore. The display of learning seems slightly defensive at times - a shield against charges of sensationalism - but the narrator&apos;s nervousness, which appears to be Alsanea&apos;s own, is understandable. The eponymous girls of Riyadh are four Saudi Arabian women in their early 20s who span the spectrum of personality - rather like the characters in Sex and the City, the favourite TV programme of Gamrah, the most traditional of the four. The novel opens with Gamrah&apos;s marriage to a man she has met for only five minutes before the ceremony. After accompanying her husband to America, where he is studying for a PhD, she discovers that he has been having a long affair with a Japanese woman and has married her only to please his parents. Gamrah&apos;s return to Riyadh as a divorced single parent a few chapters after her joyful wedding is the first of many disappointments for the novel&apos;s heroines. The girls can&apos;t talk to men in public but they&apos;re constantly texting them. The &quot;aunts&quot;, the formidable elders who vet girls as marriage candidates, can&apos;t police the young women&apos;s inboxes. However, the girls can&apos;t drive or drink alcohol, and if they want to go to a shopping mall they have to be accompanied by a man. Michelle, the most dashing, gets round this by dressing up as a boy and pretending to be her friends&apos; brother. Alsanea isn&apos;t a straightforward advocate for western modernity. Michelle&apos;s upbringing is more liberal because she&apos;s half-American, half-Saudi, and moves unsteadily between the two cultures. She is too western to be eligible for Saudi boys of her own class and too Saudi to marry her American cousin. In the end, she starts a freer life in Dubai. Alsanea takes us on a wide-ranging tour of regional and class stereotypes in the kingdom: Jeddah is much more liberal than Riyadh; Bedouins are usually chauvinists; openly liberal men are sexually puritanical in private. The prose style isn&apos;t the reason to read this novel. Some of the sentences are extremely clunky (eg, &quot;Is there an inverse relationship between one&apos;s social and economic status, on the one hand, and good humour and a merry personality, on the other?&quot;). There&apos;s also an uneasy tension between the breathless narration and some of the unhappier plot twists. Girls of Riyadh is unromantic - bad things happen to its heroines - but Alsanea is clearly on the side of romance, and her exploration of whether it can exist in Saudi Arabia is brave and surprisingly informative.", "tags": ["Books", "Fiction", "Culture", "Romance"], "title": "Review: Girls of Riyadh by Rajaa Alsanea", "sentences": ["In the end, she starts a freer life in Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/14/featuresreviews.guardianreview20", "publicationDate": "2007-07-14T22:56:36Z"}, {"article": "The most romantic place I&apos;ve been ...  Was a little cottage in Pitnacree, Scotland, where I went for a week with my girlfriend. It had a wine cellar, an Aga and a river running through the front yard. All I need to feel truly happy. The worst trip I&apos;ve ever been on ...  Was to Boston by myself. I have some friends who go on holiday by themselves and rave about what a wonderful experience it is, so I decided to try it out. I went to Boston by myself and I hated every second of it. It wasn&apos;t the city - Boston&apos;s great, lots of culture and history - but I hated being alone and not really sharing the experience with anyone. I wound up spending a fortune buying an early return flight. On holiday I feel guilty ...  If I&apos;m not exploring the city properly, so recently I made a conscious decision to go to Dubai because all I wanted to do was flop on the beach and read some books and relax, and that is essentially all you can do in Dubai. It&apos;s a big ugly city, and there is not much going on, but the food is good, the beach is OK and there&apos;s nothing to do but kick back and relax. I&apos;d love to holiday ...  In London. I moved here 10 years ago, but I would like to take a week&apos;s holiday here. I&apos;d like to stay in the Covent Garden Hotel and make an effort to go to all the tourist attractions. The history, the architecture is obviously there, but also places like Soho never cease to excite me. I always bring back ...  Pottery - Gaudi-style tiles from Barcelona, vases, face masks and all sorts of crap. It all winds up in a dedicated room in my house called the jumble sale room. I think it will make my home look more rich, colourful and diverse, when in fact it just looks terrible. And so I have stopped... apart from the rare exception. My top travel tip is ...  To avoid getting stuck in the middle of an aeroplane. Always book online, reserve your seats and always book package holidays. My first trip abroad ...  Was when we rented a caravan in Nice. It was infested with cockroaches and my mother was cooking in the kitchenette and a cockroach dropped into the frying pan as she was making dinner. From then on, we ate out. That was the end of my affection for caravans or tents. Airports are ...  Getting more and more difficult. I always take a deep breath when I enter a departure hall. Aeroplane food I find appalling: it reminds me of when I used to look after my Grandma and she used to get meals on wheels. It&apos;s the sort of thing Jamie Oliver would probably like to ban. The weirdest place I&apos;ve been recognised abroad ...  Was in a shop in Ho Chi Min City when some Brits recognised my voice. They asked me if I did the Sunday afternoon radio show on XFM - which was pretty weird, being recognised by voice all the way over in Vietnam.

Then I&apos;ll be going with all my family to Cornwall, which is my first true love. My family are Cornish and I spent virtually every childhood holiday on my uncle&apos;s farm, generally getting in the way of all things agricultural and living the outdoor life.

It has just one little house, and when we bought it seven years ago it was a complete wreck. That&apos;s why we got it so cheap. It cost \u00a395,000, so we managed to buy the island, and the boat we live in on the Thames, for less than a one-bed flat in London. We spent four years doing up the house with friends who are builders. It is attached to a lighthouse which is solar-powered and is where the lighthouse keeper&apos;s family used to live. It can get pretty wild in winter - the house is 300ft up, but the spray can go over the roof. We go for six weeks every summer. Throughout the year I judge everything around how long it is till we&apos;re on the island. What&apos;s so nice is that there&apos;s no telephone, no emails, no other people. We drive to the marina, where we load up the Rib (a fast, semi-inflatable boat) with all the food, the kids - Jesse, who&apos;s four and Marmaduke, one - and everything we need, then trog six-and-a-half miles over to the island. What I find so hard about my work life and my filming life is that I&apos;m away from my family so much. Even when I&apos;m home it can be mad, with constant meetings, so what&apos;s so precious about this is that it&apos;s literally just us, no meetings, no nothing. We swim and mess around and climb and fall asleep in the hammocks and have barbecues and curl up and hide from the rain when it&apos;s wet - and I love it. It&apos;s just everything wild and cosy and family that motivates me in my life, so it has it all. Most days we&apos;ll do boat trips. It&apos;s a really fast Rib and if it&apos;s calm I can do the journey back to the mainland in 15 minutes, so I often do a run just to get a load of nice doughnuts - there&apos;s a lovely bakery near the marina. The nice thing is that all that area of coast is National Trust land, so we&apos;ll explore and find coves for picnics. But we also use the boat to water-ski, and we have a little canoe for messing around in. Jesse has been obsessed by skydiving, camping, climbing, everything adventurous, since he was six months old. We climb together, and I&apos;ve taken him paragliding. Simon, my cameraman, finds it hysterical that he&apos;s a mini version of me. It&apos;s wild, there are sea cliffs for climbing, dolphins and seals - it&apos;s my complete heaven.

I visited four years ago and they have since constructed the most extraordinary open-air spa where all the herbs that are necessary grow by the side of the beds and are picked by the attendants and rubbed into you. It has a tent a couple of miles away in the desert which is accessible only by horse, and also a very chic, very urban residential club in the middle of the souk in Marrakesh where you can seek respite from all the noisy shopping going on around you.

Irvine Welsh, writerSouth America I&apos;m off to Colombia at the end of summer, a country I probably wouldn&apos;t have trusted myself to visit 10 years ago. Then I&apos;m going to head down to Buenos Aires, another place I&apos;ve never been. I keep the guide books and internet research to a minimum and I try not to think too much about a place before I go there as I hate to be overburdened with preconceived notions.

Andy Mcnab, authorSwitzerland There are two trips this year. The first is when I go to Switzerland on a freefall parachuting trip. I have been into the sport since I learnt to freefall in the SAS and to date I&apos;ve made over 1,300 jumps. This time it will be all about jumping into restricted Drop Zones. The Swiss are experts at this. Their emergency services need to be experienced, as they regularly have to drop into tiny clearings in the middle of a forest, or land on minute plateaux on mountain tops. The second trip is a 3,000km cross-country motorbike race across South Africa. I have been riding bikes since I stole my brother&apos;s and crashed when I was 11. I am riding with the Ducati team. Everyone keeps calling it a &apos;trip&apos; but we all know they mean &apos;race&apos;.

It&apos;s a great opportunity to be near a working nuclear power station and to keep track of nuclear fuel trains as they cross the shingly peninsula at the end of their long journey down from Sellafield. It&apos;s not the perfect place for sandcastles, but it can apparently be great fun to move pebbles around to build dry-stone castles. We hope to take some walks under the power lines at night, and try lighting up a bulb from the corona discharge into the atmosphere.

Fay Ripley, actressCenter Parcs Since I&apos;ve had children, I&apos;ve become a convert to Center Parcs, so that&apos;s on the agenda. Initially it was like entering a Canadian religious sect, full of pine trees and people on bicycles waving at you, but it&apos;s a much more aesthetic experience with more nature than I had originally imagined. Of course, ultimately you are staying in prefabs in a pretend world, but it&apos;s a really nice pretend world, with log cabins that have flatscreen TVs and barbecues, as well as welcome hampers with organic food in them.  There are all these activities you can do - like fencing, or archery, although pootling off for a treatment at the spa is about as intense as I get. You do actually need a bicycle because there&apos;s a lot of ground to cover. On our last visit, we had an eight-month-old, a three-year-old and a four-year-old and we put them in these trollies that latched on to the back of the bikes and they were in heaven. Luckily, it&apos;s almost completely flat which is handy, because I don&apos;t like the idea of bicycles and hills.  Above all, everyone&apos;s very nice. I like having arguments with staff on holidays but it&apos;s quite hard at a Center Parc, I&apos;ve found. Book it: A three-bedroomed Woodland Lodge costs from \u00a3539 for four nights.

I&apos;m going because I find solace from the modern world in the velvet tones of David Suchet as he puts his little grey cells to work, assisting Inspector Japp of The Yard.

Peter Stringfellow, nightclub ownerMallorca My fiancee and I usually spend the summer at our villa in Mallorca - our dogs are there, our boat is in Ibiza and we like the heat. We don&apos;t go near clubs, or even the beach really - although Bella and I do go out to eat, especially at Di Benedetto, just south of Palma. It&apos;s owned by an English-Italian family and the food is exquisite. But actually this summer, we might go to the US. It&apos;ll be a working holiday, though. We&apos;ll start in New York, go to a few clubs there, then head down to Las Vegas for the Adult Entertainment Convention. I&apos;ve never been and it&apos;s about time I popped in and took a look at it. We might also spend some time in Miami before going to see my daughter.

In unfortunate reality, an army of blond cousins regard our visits as a chance to finesse their own MTV English. The only extension to my youngest daughter&apos;s vocabulary last summer was &apos;Ew&apos;. A balmy summer evening in the world&apos;s most northerly capital might be imagined as one where you forget to wear gloves, but make it home with the bulk of your fingertips intact. But we&apos;ve sunbathed at 10.30pm, and in August 2004 the mercury hit a record 24.8C. The midnight sun engenders an extraordinary sort of anti-hibernation. Unattended young children play in the street at midnight, and grumpy great uncles blossom into 24-hour party people. From the all-night teenage bacchanalia downtown to the 3am suburban barbecue, the Nordic summer is a round-the-clock civic celebration of life. The in-laws run a rural summerhouse - a two-floor festival of pine plonked between a lake and a lava field an hour east of Reykjavik. These days, though, we&apos;re usually invited to Gr\u00f6f, a remote farmhouse they have been renovating. Boasting all the high-octane thrills you&apos;d expect from a place that translates as &apos;grave&apos;, Gr\u00f6f is a tough sell to offspring whose combined nirvana would be an intergalactic branch of Claire&apos;s Accessories staffed by robo-hobbits.

Ask Bruce Jones, the president of Oregon-based US Submarines, to name his customers, and he fires back: &quot;If I told you, I&apos;d have to shoot you.&quot; Nonetheless, it&apos;s clear that the submarine is now a bigger status symbol than the boring old yacht. There are now an estimated 100 luxury subs beneath the seas, keeping manufacturers busy from the Pacific Ocean to the Persian Gulf. &quot;Everyone down there is a wealthy eccentric,&quot; says Jean-Claude Carme, vice-president of marketing for US Submarines. &quot;And they&apos;re all very secretive.&quot; Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, bought a 40ft yellow submarine from Washington-based Olympic Tool &amp; Engineering. The $12m boat has enough extras to remain submerged for a week. &quot;We&apos;re not supposed to talk about it, but it&apos;s a mighty nice piece of work,&quot; says Fred Rodie, one of the engineers who designed Allen&apos;s vessel. Jones built his first diesel- and battery-powered sub in 1993. His customers are &quot;people who have more money than they know what to do with&quot;, he says, and the business is a &quot;nasty, cutthroat&quot; one. At his competitor Exomos, based in Dubai, chief executive Herve Jaubert takes a more romantic view of the work: &quot;I&apos;m a poet who builds submersible yachts for rich people,&quot; he says.

US Submarines&apos; mid-size model is the $25m Seattle 1000, a three-storey-high vessel with five state rooms, five bathrooms, two kitchens, a gym, a wine cellar and a 30ft x 15ft observation portal. Exomos&apos;s 10-passenger sub, meanwhile, costs $15m - without the optional gymnasium. The company has 26 clients awaiting models such as the Stingray runabout and the 65ft Proteus liner. &quot;The Proteus is an underwater bus,&quot; Jaubert says. &quot;The Stingray is more fun - drives like a Ferrari.&quot; A Ferrari with more privacy, that is. One of the attractions for buyers is that there&apos;s no danger of the paparazzi waving their long lenses at you while you get up to mischief beneath the waves.

Yesterday, the positions were switched - Peeping Fawn easily beat Light Shift by 3\u00bd lengths here in the Irish Oaks and Cecil, though disappointed, at least got a chance to be the magnanimous one. O&apos;Brien was surrounded on all sides by the press pack as he basked in the winner&apos;s enclosure but Cecil, who generally does whatever he can to minimise contact with the media, fought his way through to place a congratulatory hand on the winning trainer&apos;s shoulder. Smiling, he told O&apos;Brien: &quot;On the day, the best filly won. But I hope there&apos;ll be another day.&quot; Though undoubtedly sincere, Cecil would surely have found the result harder to take if Peeping Fawn had been ridden, as intended, by Kieren Fallon, the jockey with whose services he dispensed in acrimonious circumstances eight years ago. Fallon, however, was forced to give up his mounts for the day by injuries sustained when he was unseated from Eagle Mountain in Longchamp&apos;s Grand Prix de Paris on Saturday evening. &quot;He had a nasty fall and had a very stiff neck,&quot; O&apos;Brien reported. &quot;The doctors thought it didn&apos;t need to be x-rayed in France yesterday but he was given painkillers and anti-inflammatories. When he got back this morning, his neck was still very stiff and he had a very sick tummy. Up to the last minute, he thought he might take the ride but he just didn&apos;t think it was the right thing to do.&quot; The fall, the injury and the missed Classic success made for a thoroughly miserable weekend for Fallon, who will stand trial on charges of conspiracy to defraud punters in two months&apos; time. Along with his co-defendants, he formally entered a plea of not guilty last week. Fallon has only ridden Peeping Fawn once, when the pair ran away with the Pretty Polly Stakes here last month, and the odds against him partnering her again before his trial lengthened when O&apos;Brien nominated the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood on August 5 as her next target. Unless and until he clears his name, Fallon cannot ride in Britain. His absence was probably one reason why Peeping Fawn drifted out to 4-1 from her morning odds of 13-8 favourite before some late money sent her off at 3-1. For most of yesterday&apos;s race, that looked an enormous price. Having given herself a hard time at Epsom with a stumbling, hard-pulling display, Peeping Fawn cruised throughout here, tracking Light Shift until Johnny Murtagh asked her to go to the front a furlong from home. She ran on strongly and the result was immediately beyond doubt. O&apos;Brien recently won his fifth Irish Derby but the Irish Oaks was one of the few major races in his native land to have eluded him, until he finally won it with Alexandrova last year. Now, he has pulled off the Derby/Oaks double in consecutive years.Of Peeping Fawn, he said: &quot;She&apos;s a beautiful filly and she keeps on improving.&quot; But there was just a suspicion that he does not rate her as highly as Alexandrova, who has been handed the tougher target of the pair - the Yorkshire Oaks on August 22. Cecil felt the unseasonal heavy going was a valid excuse for her defeat. &quot;She was struggling on the ground the whole time, she just couldn&apos;t pick up on it,&quot; he said. &quot;She&apos;s run a great race.&quot; On a card featuring a Classic and three other Group contests, the eighth race of the day, a maiden, was always going to struggle for the attention of those present. But those who made a point of watching were rewarded with an impressive victory from a two-year-old who could easily prove a future star. New Approach comes from the same local stable, Jim Bolger&apos;s, as last year&apos;s winner of the same race, Teofilo, who ended his juvenile year as a multiple Group One winner and ante-post favourite for both the Guineas and the Derby. &quot;There&apos;ll be no comparisons,&quot; ordered Bolger in the winner&apos;s enclosure but he may as well have been ordering the sun not to rise this morning. Intriguingly, he will follow the same route as Teofilo, with Leopardstown&apos;s Tyros Stakes on July 28 the next target. Bolger could offer no comfort to those waiting to see the injured Teofilo back on a racecourse, saying only that there would be news &quot;shortly&quot;.

The move will bring an end to the strife that has crippled the group for the past two years. In an astonishing volte-face the French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who met German chancellor Angela Merkel in Toulouse, agreed that German Tom Enders, the EADS co-chief executive, should head Airbus and another German executive, R\u00fcdiger Grube, become sole chairman at EADS. A third German, Hans Peter Ring, remains chief financial officer of both EADS and Airbus. Louis Gallois, ex-head of French state railways SNCF and now co-chief at EADS, becomes sole CEO and Mr Enders will report to him. A radiant Ms Merkel hailed the last-minute deal, saying: &quot;This is a balanced, fair management structure which can work efficiently.&quot; But her aides and analysts see this as a German coup in forcing considerable concessions from the new French president to Berlin which has been at war with him over his call for political moves to weaken the soaring euro, exercise greater control over the European Central Bank and postpone the agreed 2010 deadline for cutting the French budget deficit to nil. The French CFTC union at Airbus, always a prized French fiefdom, accused Mr Sarkozy of allowing the Germans to take over virtually the entire shop but the French president said it was a &quot;great day&quot; for the company and the Franco-German axis. &quot;This is the dream team,&quot; insiders said. &quot;But it only takes effect in the final quarter of this year [when shareholders approve it] and may only last two years.&quot; Mr Gallois, current Airbus chief who is in charge of implementing the Power 8 cost-cutting plan which sees six plants sold off and 10,000 job cuts, told the Guardian last month he plans to retire in 2009. But he could, sources said, step up to be chairman, allowing Mr Enders to be sole EADS chief and Fabrice Br\u00e9gier, now chief operating officer at Airbus, to be CEO at the loss-making plane-maker. &quot;The French would regain control under this master-plan,&quot; the sources said. Analysts and unions doubted whether the arrangement would genuinely end the dual-nation structure, and Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy fell out over proposals to raise extra capital to fund new planes. The Germans say it is off the agenda, the French say it is on. But both eventually want to see a new shareholders&apos; structure which is balanced between French and German interests, each holding 22.5% stakes, including 15% in French state hands. Spain holds 5.5% and Dubai 3.2% while Russian bank VTB says it wants to sell its 5% holding. The deal leaves little room for Arnaud Lagard\u00e8re, head of the eponymous media group, which is cutting its holding to 7.5% and may swiftly exit the business. Mr Lagard\u00e8re, ousted as co-chairman after falling out with Mr Sarkozy, will remain on the EADS board and could return as sole chairman in 2011, according to the French president. Nobody expects this. The new EADS board will see the French and Germans relinquish two seats each and four new independent directors will be elected at the next shareholders&apos; meeting. The latter move is in line with British proposals to the French senate last month that non-executives form a majority and chair important committees such as audit and remuneration.", "tags": ["Business", "Germany", "France", "Airline industry", "World news", "Nicolas Sarkozy", "Airbus", "Europe"], "title": "Sarkozy in U-turn over Germans taking top jobs at Airbus", "sentences": ["Spain holds 5.5% and Dubai 3.2% while Russian bank VTB says it wants to sell its 5% holding."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/17/germany.france", "publicationDate": "2007-07-16T23:05:35Z"}, {"article": "By themselves his career statistics mark him out as special: 50 European Tour wins, five World Match Play titles, eight Ryder Cup appearances and, of course, five major championship victories. But mere numbers have never been enough to convey fully the impact Seve Ballesteros had on golf.  A hero to at least two generations, he has been, no question, the most historically significant and charismatic European player of the past 60 years. As Ken Schofield, the former executive director of a European Tour built largely on the transcending appeal of the dashing Spaniard, has said many times: &quot;Seve was Europe&apos;s Arnold Palmer.&quot; There were so many memories, so many thrilling moments to savour in the career of the kid from the fishing village of Pedre\u00f1a on Spain&apos;s northern coast, the kid who played not with the plodding artisanship of a Nick Faldo or a Colin Montgomerie but with the dashing aplomb of the supreme artist. Ballesteros is, for example, the man who hit the shot Jack Nicklaus calls &quot;the greatest I ever saw&quot;, a beautifully sliced three-wood from under the face of a fairway bunker on the 18th at PGA National in Florida during the 1983 Ryder Cup match. &quot;I wish there was a tape of all the shots he has hit,&quot; says Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal, with whom Ballesteros formed the greatest partnership in Ryder Cup history. &quot;Then we would really know how special he was. No one has made a bigger contribution to the European Tour. He was the one who broke down all the barriers, all the walls. He made the rest of the players of his time believe that they could play everywhere in the world. I don&apos;t think anyone comes close to him in this part of the world.&quot; Seve, indeed, showed the way for Faldo, Sandy Lyle, Ian Woosnam and Bernhard Langer - the rest of what became known as Europe&apos;s Big Five. &quot;He was a bigger star than the other four put together,&quot; says the former Tour player Mike Clayton. First of them to win on the European Tour, first to win in the US and first to win a major championship, Ballesteros was the trailblazer as he and a generation of continental compatriots dominated the game through the 80s and early 90s. &quot;Seve was really the leader; the others followed in his wake,&quot; says the former Ryder Cup player Ken Brown. &quot;Because of the way he played and how successful he was, the others could see that they could do it too. It was like, &apos;If Seve can win major championships, so can I&apos;.&quot; No one did it like Seve, though. All five of his grand slam victories were marked by special moments, even now vivid in the memory. There was the so-called &quot;car-park shot&quot; on Lytham&apos;s 16th en route to his first Open win in 1979. Less than a year later he led by as many as 10 with nine holes to play in the 1980 Masters. As he says: &quot;I was Tiger before Tiger was Tiger.&quot; In 1983 Ballesteros chipped in at the last hole to win his second green jacket. Then at St Andrews he clinched the 1984 Open championship with a 10-foot putt on the last green. No one who was there or watched on TV will ever forget the prolonged fist-punching with which he celebrated. And finally, back at Lytham in 1988, he broke the brave Nick Price&apos;s heart with a wondrous chip from beside the 72nd green. Amid such majesty, there have been less lustrous moments. Ballesteros missed the 1981 Ryder Cup at Walton Heath because he fell out with the European Tour over appearance money. And, most famously, there was that duffed four-iron into the pond in front of the 15th at Augusta National. Surely the worst shot ever struck by a world-class player under pressure, it cost him the 1986 Masters. All of which was but a mere prelude to a sad and precipitous decline. Between 1976 and 1992 he was a permanent fixture in the top 20 of the European Order of Merit. After 1996 he was never inside the top 100. &quot;I miss the feeling of being in contention,&quot; he said in Dubai a few years ago. &quot;And I still know how to play. I just can&apos;t hit the ball.&quot; Still, perhaps the saddest aspect of Ballesteros&apos;s play, especially with the longer clubs, over the last decade or so is that he became the subject of scorn among the newer members of the European Tour. &quot;I understand why the young guys did not want to play with him the last few years,&quot; says Olaz\u00e1bal. &quot;But I would say to them to watch him around a practice green.

Eisenhower; the owner of four dozen works of art by Degas, Renoir and C\u00e9zanne, he paid $244m (\u00a3120m) in 1998 for Van Gogh&apos;s &quot;Dr Gachet&quot; and Picasso&apos;s &quot;Le R\u00eave&quot;.  This week he is sitting with eight others in the dock in Vienna accused of breach of trust and fraud in one of Austria&apos;s biggest corporate scandals. Wolfgang Fl\u00f6ttl, who has sold his art collection to cover his subsequent losses, is the son of the ex-head of Bawag, a former union-owned bank set up in 1922 for waiters and carpenters that lost \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a3940m) in currency speculation deals in the Caribbean. It was baled out from near-bankruptcy by the former government a year ago with a \u20ac900m underwriting loan. Now Austria&apos;s fifth largest bank, it was bought for \u20ac3.2bn late last year by US fund Cerberus. In stifling heat the court has heard from prosecutor Georg Krakow how &quot;everything has gone&quot; from the \u20ac1.4bn Bawag invested in &quot;forbidden speculations&quot; and &quot;disastrous clandestine deals&quot; run by a &quot;little clique&quot;. Krakow, armed with 70,000 pages of documents, is seeking up to 10 years in jail for the accused, including two ex-CEOs, Helmut Elsner and Johann Zwettler. Elsner, a 72-year-old who fled to his sumptuous villa on the C\u00f4te d&apos;Azur when the scandal broke but was extradited in February despite heart surgery and pleads innocence, was said by his lawyer Wolfgang Schubert to be &quot;a loving family man who sits with his granddaughter on his lap and reads her stories&quot;.  Can&apos;t see judge Claudia Bandion-Ortner buying that old chestnut. Fl\u00f6ttl, meanwhile, had close personal and business links with Phillip Bennett, former chief of US commodity brokerage Refco which went broke just after Bawag lent it several hundred million dollars - via Fl\u00f6ttl who is said to have cost Bawag more than \u20ac1bn in bad loans.  But Fl\u00f6ttl, who fell out with Elsner at a meeting in London in late 2000, has been singing to the authorities, according to his lawyer, Herbert Eichenseder, who proclaimed his innocence and said he had supplied 70% of the evidence. The trial, clearly worthy of film treatment, will last until October - perhaps just around the time the case against another Austrian banker and hedge fund manager, Michael Berger, could begin. He was on the run for five years from the &quot;Feds&quot; (FBI) after failing to appear in a Manhattan court after pleading guilty to charges that he misled investors during the dot.com boom - to the tune of $575m.  Is there something about Viennese bankers? Maybe the smell of the ultra-strong local coffee made them lose their heads... The French keep the tube running This week&apos;s collapse of Metronet, the PPP consortium supposed to deliver a \u00a317bn modernisation of three-quarters of London Underground&apos;s network, will probably provoke a wry smile in Olivier Houssin, head of the security solutions and services division at Thales, the French electronics group that&apos;s also designing Britain&apos;s two new aircraft carriers. He&apos;s not a great fan of PPPs for strategic infrastructure projects, he made plain in a recent interview in Paris, showing a Ken Livingstone liking for public funding. Thales is a key supplier of Tube Lines, the successful consortium of Amey and Bechtel that is rebuilding the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines on time and under budget.  But it is not a consortium member - unlike the position at Metronet which gave lucrative contracts to its supplier shareholders.  &quot;Tube Lines works well and keeps its commitments,&quot; he said before the Metronet debacle. Houssin&apos;s division, which accounts for a quarter of Thales&apos;s business, or \u20ac3.2bn in sales last year, is growing faster than the defence and aerospace units: an expected &quot;mid- to high-single digit&quot; rate this year, he says. It has orders worth \u20ac1bn in London alone, including a recent \u00a3160m extension to a contract to provide new computerised signalling for the century-old Piccadilly line by 2014, and views this as a core strategic priority. The French group, run by Anglophile Denis Ranque, is 27% in state hands but keen to shake free - eventually. Meanwhile, and despite a recent lacklustre share performance, it is expanding its overseas interests in railway signalling, air traffic management, congestion management (charging), civil security, including at power stations and pipelines, airports and even pilot training. Houssin&apos;s favourite phrase is &quot;mission critical&quot; and he wants Thales to become a global leader. The division is already second in the world for rail signalling and involved in metro systems in Hong Kong, Dubai, Madrid, Beijing, Shanghai (now building its 11th line, 120km long), Turin and New York. In May it was chosen to supply a &quot;contactless&quot; fare collection system for the new Line 3 of Cairo&apos;s metro network, including 29 stations. Somehow, the French - who designed and built the Second Severn Crossing but are derided in certain neo-liberal Whitehall circles - do these things better than the Brits.

McIlroy, 18 years old and a product of Holywood Golf Club near Belfast, outscored his hero, Tiger Woods, by a stroke and left both his illustrious playing partners, Henrik Stenson and Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez, in his wake. Perhaps most impressive of all, by the time he left the final green at about 6.30 last night he was the only player in the field not to have carded a bogey. Smiling from tee to green and swinging with total commitment - never more so than when arrowing a two-iron 230 yards upwind into the heart of the 18th green - he made Carnoustie look a breeze and summoned memories of Justin Rose&apos;s assault on Birkdale at the same age in 1998 when he finished tied fourth. &quot;I came here just wanting to make the cut and win the silver medal [awarded to the leading amateur] and that was about it,&quot; he said. &quot;I sort of came into it just trying to learn as much as possible. But it&apos;s a pretty special feeling to think that you shot one better than Tiger, and to beat your playing partners as well in Henrik and Miguel. It&apos;s just awesome.&quot; The son of a scratch golfer, McIlroy has been playing and beating friends since he was seven, and yesterday while he mastered Carnoustie some of them operated the scoreboards that marked his progress. By the end of his round it was not only his pals in the scoreboards and the large contingent from his home club who were rooting for him. As he walked on to the final green he was the toast of the stands and received a huge ovation. &quot;It was fantastic. It just sent a chill down my spine.&quot; McIlroy&apos;s talent has been an open secret in Northern Ireland for some years and he has been nurtured by support from the Sports Council and the Irish Golf Union, who have funded his career worldwide since he left school aged 16 with &quot;a few&quot; GCSEs. He resisted the lure of travelling to America to complete his golf education in the university system - &quot;I didn&apos;t really fancy the school part,&quot; he conceded - preferring to stay within the amateur fold in Europe and take up the occasional invitation to professional events. Thus far it is paying off. He won the European amateur championship last year to win his place in the Open, and made the cut in his first professional event, the Dubai Desert Classic, this year. Stenson, one of the longest hitters in the world, is among those impressed: &quot;He&apos;s a fantastic player. He&apos;s fearless, a fantastic ball striker, a good putter, he was matching my drives and he seems to have it all. I don&apos;t want to put him under pressure but I think he&apos;s got what it takes.&quot; McIlroy already interviews like a professional, a by-product of having been the subject of journalists&apos; inquiries since he was seven. He mourned the passing of two short putts that might have turned 68 into 66, and set his sights on matching Rose&apos;s 1998 effort. &quot;I didn&apos;t make a birdie at either of the two par fives, which is disappointing,&quot; he said. &quot;But I&apos;ll take 68, and I&apos;ll take three more, thanks, and see where I finish. Justin&apos;s performance at Birkdale was phenomenal and I think if he can do it at that age I&apos;m sure I can as well.

Income was falling, unemployment on the rise and governments wrestling with budget deficits. Then the oil price began to rise again, steeply. The World Bank reckons that oil income from the Middle East and north Africa has grown more than fourfold over the past decade to an estimated $547bn in 2006. The clearest manifestation of that huge inflow of cash has been the rise of towering new cities such as Dubai. But the tide of petrodollars is flowing outside of the region too. In mid-June, a Qatari investment fund took a 25% stake in Britain&apos;s third largest grocer J Sainsbury. On Thursday night, the government backed fund, Delta Two, raised the pressure on the Sainsbury family with a proposal to buy the rest of the company for 600p a share, valuing the business at \u00a310.6bn. The Sainsbury dynasty, which earlier this year fought off another private equity bid, looks to have a fresh tussle on its hands. It is becoming a familiar story. Private and government backed funds from states including Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Qatar have been looking to build a broad portfolio of investments and reduce reliance on natural resources. Last year Delta Two bought the Four Seasons nursing home business for \u00a31.4bn and was among the defeated bidders for Thames Water. With its historical ties to the Middle East and the relative ease of doing business in London, Britain has been a favourite destination. The Kuwait Investment Office has had a presence in the City since 1953. What has characterised some of the more recent deals though is how high profile they are. In March, two Kuwaiti investors Investment Dar and Adeem Investment emerged as the chief backers of the deal that brought Aston Martin back under British management. Dubai International Capital paid \u00a3800m for the Tussauds Group in 2005 and \u00a3675m for Travelodge last year. Arcapita from Bahrain paid \u00a3143m for Staffordshire Water in 2004 and added the Northern Ireland electricity supplier Viridian to its portfolio in October for \u00a31.6bn. Dubai Ports paid almost \u00a34bn for the shipping and ports company P&amp;O last year. In a sign of the region&apos;s growing clout, Saudi Basic Industries agreed in May to pay $11.6bn for General Electric&apos;s plastics business, the largest foreign acquisition ever announced by a Gulf Arab investor. Passive investors &quot;Underpinning all Gulf investment overseas is the need to reinvest their oil income in order to diversify their economic base,&quot; says Richard Thompson, editor of the Middle East Economic Digest. &quot;In the past, the Gulf oil producers have tended to be discrete. The likes of Kuwait or Abu Dhabi would take minor stakes and be passive investors. They would also stick to certain favourite sectors like banking, real estate and property. The preferred markets would be the established ones such as London and New York.&quot; Thompson says Middle Eastern investment is different this time around. &quot;First of all there is a lot more money from this oil boom. Secondly they are taking a more strategic approach, trying to tie their economies to the global markets. With Dubai, the P&amp;O acquisition last year was about linking its strategically important ports sector with the international ports market. The Saudi Arabian deal to buy GE Plastics was about tying the Saudi petrochemicals industry to the global plastics industry.&quot; &quot;But there are different factors at play in each country. In places like Qatar and Dubai one factor is the desire to establish an international presence. These are small places and they have to shout louder than others to be noticed. So, in part, these deals are about establishing credibility and positioning themselves in the world. It is a bit like establishing a brand. They are making high-profile acquisitions that are both strategic and opportunistic.&quot; The deals are not restricted to the UK. Last month, Istithmar, backed by the government of Dubai, paid $825m for Barneys, the American department store chain. Since the terrorist attacks of 2001 though, when a lot of Arab money was repatriated, the US has become a more difficult place for Gulf states to invest. There was a huge furore in the US when the P&amp;O deal meant the Dubai government would ultimately control a handful of American ports. Middle eastern investors have also increasingly turned to China, other parts of Asia, north Africa and other parts of Europe. Dubai International Capital has been one of the highest profile investors. Established in 2004, the fund is wholly owned by the ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum and has more than $6bn under management. The Tussauds and Travelodge deals are classic private equity investments. Tussauds was merged with Legoland and London Dungeon owner Merlin in March. DIC took out \u00a31bn and retains a 20% stake in the larger group, already a tidy cash profit of \u00a3200m. It has also bought Doncasters Group the engineering company for \u00a3700m and paid \u20ac850m (\u00a3573m) for German packaging group Mauser in April. DIC is also taking stakes in public companies. It took $1bn stake in DaimlerChrysler in 2005 (since sold), a substantial stake in HSBC in May and a 3.1% stake in the Airbus maker EADS this month. What seems clear is that as long as the oil price stays high, the money will keep flowing in. DIC currently has $6bn under management but is targeting $25bn by 2009. Thompson says that the investors from the Middle East have paid for the best advice and appear to be avoiding the pitfalls of the previous oil boom when riches were largely squandered. &quot;Yes they have done a good job but it is still early days,&quot; he says. &quot;If energy prices collapse they are not fully up and running yet with mature, diversified economies. But some of them are making enormous strides.&quot;", "tags": ["Business", "Oil", "World news"], "title": "Gulf states target Britain so they can invest their cash beyond the oil fields", "sentences": ["The clearest manifestation of that huge inflow of cash has been the rise of towering new cities such as Dubai.", "Private and government backed funds from states including Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Qatar have been looking to build a broad portfolio of investments and reduce reliance on natural resources.", "Dubai International Capital paid \u00a3800m for the Tussauds Group in 2005 and \u00a3675m for Travelodge last year.", "Dubai Ports paid almost \u00a34bn for the shipping and ports company P&amp;O last year.", "With Dubai, the P&amp;O acquisition last year was about linking its strategically important ports sector with the international ports market.", "In places like Qatar and Dubai one factor is the desire to establish an international presence.", "Last month, Istithmar, backed by the government of Dubai, paid $825m for Barneys, the American department store chain.", "There was a huge furore in the US when the P&amp;O deal meant the Dubai government would ultimately control a handful of American ports.", "Dubai International Capital has been one of the highest profile investors."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/21/oilandpetrol.news", "publicationDate": "2007-07-20T23:16:35Z"}, {"article": "Since September 11 2001, one figure has emerged as a mainstay of the &quot;war on terror&quot;: he is General Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan. With his convivial, British public school manner, western suits and blow-dried flick, Musharraf has glad-handed his way around the world, claiming to provide the west with a bridgehead into the badlands of Islamic south Asia. The west has been willing to overlook his drawbacks. For instance, Musharraf&apos;s military record reveals him as a close ally of the Taliban. Early in his career, he acted as military mentor to Pakistan&apos;s home-grown jihadi groups. He rose to power in a coup d&apos;\u00e9tat, deposing prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999, and has refused to restore democracy. And no one reproaches him about the terrorist plotters at large in the tribal areas of Pakistan&apos;s North-West Frontier Province - most likely Osama bin Laden and Taliban leader Mullah Omar among them. &quot;He&apos;s one of my best friends,&quot; George Bush declared at a Washington party in 2006, having overseen a 45,000% increase in aid to Pakistan&apos;s military, which now totals more than $4bn. All that has changed. A chill has descended over &quot;Mush and Bush&quot;, as the Pakistan press dubbed the US-Pakistan axis. And the storming of the Red Mosque 11 days ago - an ostentatious strike against Islamists, killing its leading rebel cleric alongside an unknown number of hostages and students - is unlikely to put him back in favour: this was a seminary Musharraf had let grow since 2002, despite its vociferous endorsement of suicide bombings and the Taliban. While Washington and London continue publicly to characterise Musharraf as the west&apos;s best hope of stopping Pakistan&apos;s descent into Islamic extremism, in reality they have concluded that it is the general who is easing the path of the jihadis. And he must be stopped. Behind the back-slaps and bonhomie, a plot is afoot to remove the current military leaders and revive an old Pakistani dynasty: regime change minus the shock and awe (and especially without the loss of thousands of lives). The aim - unchanged by the events at the mosque - is to restore democracy to Pakistan and reinstall Benazir Bhutto, the exiled scion of the country&apos;s most famous ruling family. It all began three years ago, on June 20 2004, at a low-profile dinner in Blackburn where Bhutto, then 51, was meeting old political friends. Many of the Lancashire town&apos;s 7,000-strong Pakistani population were historically Bhutto supporters, but the mood was glum, as she recalls. Pakistan had recently been readmitted to the Commonwealth after being suspended when Musharraf seized control. And, four days earlier, President Bush had named the Islamic republic as a major non-Nato ally, making Bhutto&apos;s hopes of returning slimmer than ever. She had inherited the Pakistan People&apos;s Party (PPP) from her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto; he had been overthrown as prime minister in a military coup and hanged in 1979. Having served twice as prime minister herself (1988-1990 and 1993-1996), Bhutto left Pakistan in April 1999 for a speaking tour of the US, taking only two weeks of clothes in her suitcase. &quot;As soon as I left,&quot; she says, &quot;prime minister Nawaz Sharif had me convicted of corruption and jailed my husband, Asif Zardari.&quot; When Musharraf deposed Sharif shortly after, in October 1999, he vowed never to let Bhutto return, fearful that her very presence would cause an uprising (she bore a striking resemblance to her father, whose term in office was viewed by some as Pakistan&apos;s age of democracy). After 9/11, the west forgot about Bhutto. In London, the red carpets were rolled out for the general in June 2003, when he attended dinners hosted by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, and Prince Charles. Musharraf revelled in the attention - the rigged parliamentary elections in Pakistan of the previous October apparently forgotten. For the next five years, Bhutto would direct her party&apos;s affairs alone, down a phone line. Her life in exile was centred in Dubai, where home was a pink villa in a gated estate fringed by palm trees, which she shared with her son, Bilawal, then 15, her daughters, Bakhtawar, 13, and Asifa, 10, and her mother, Nusrat, the widow of the hanged Zulfikar. &quot;As the world changed around us, I lived in my own little parallel society - islands of friends, colleagues and Pakistani communities all over the world,&quot; Bhutto says. At the Blackburn dinner, Bhutto&apos;s host, Councillor Salas Kiani, a British Pakistani who had until recently served as the town&apos;s mayor, had a surprise for her. He passed Bhutto a mobile phone. &quot;It&apos;s Jack for you,&quot; he said mischievously. Only after a minute did she twig - Jack Straw, then foreign secretary, was MP for Blackburn and so knew Kiani well. &quot;Benazir was amazed,&quot; says one guest. &quot;Here was Straw saying, &apos;Hi, come to the Foreign Office.&apos;&quot; The conversation marked the first official communication the PPP had had with a British government minister in more than a decade. Back in 1981, Benazir Bhutto, beautiful, progressive and a graduate of Oxford and Harvard, became a cause for the Labour left when she was imprisoned by Pakistan&apos;s military leader, General Zia ul-Haq. Robin Cook and George Galloway, among others, ran the Free Benazir Committee from London. When Bhutto, then 36, was elected prime minister for the first time in 1988, after Zia&apos;s death, she was feted as one of the first democratically elected female prime ministers in an Islamic country. The Labour leader, Tony Blair, a contemporary of Bhutto&apos;s at Oxford, attended a private dinner thrown by her and her husband at the Savoy in October 1995, during her second term as prime minister. However, relations with Blair cooled after she was overthrown and her husband jailed. The couple were accused by the Pakistan government of amassing an ill-gotten fortune, including a \u00a32m Surrey country estate complete with stud farm and helipad (they deny owning the property) - in stark contrast to life in Pakistan, where 37 million people lived below the UN poverty line. Jack Straw, then home secretary, refused to meet her. Now, in 2004, Straw was on the phone. One morning the following month, Bhutto was brought to a side entrance of the Foreign Office, her trademark white dupatta pulled over her face. The meeting lasted more than an hour. &quot;The British seemed oblivious to Musharraf&apos;s record,&quot; a Bhutto aide says. &quot;He was seen as trustworthy - but his primary allegiance had been with the jihadi groups that the Pakistan media described as Musharraf&apos;s &apos;ethnic storm-troopers&apos;.&quot; Musharraf had been director general of military operations during Bhutto&apos;s second term as prime minister, and had requested permission to &quot;unleash the forces of fundamentalism&quot; - Sunni irregulars sponsored by the army and intelligence community - to infiltrate the Indian-controlled sector of the divided state of Kashmir. In 1996, when the Taliban had grown as a force in Afghanistan, it was Musharraf who ensured the movement was armed and fed. Straw squirmed as this was recounted, says one of those in the room. He reassured Bhutto that his government favoured democracy in Pakistan, but stressed that Musharraf, too, was important. Bhutto thought it hopeless. But within weeks, Mark Lyall Grant, the British high commissioner in Islamabad, flew to Dubai to convey a message to Bhutto from Musharraf. The general was willing to make a gesture: her husband was to be released from jail. Perhaps she should now consider working with him? Bhutto remained suspicious. She had had first-hand experience of the brutality of Pakistan&apos;s military and the mixture of patronage, tribalism, backstabbing, blackmail and feudalism that made up Pakistani politics. Her father had been hanged; her youngest brother, Shahnawaz, was next to meet his fate. &quot;My aunt had a house in Cannes, so we would all go there for the summer holidays. We loved it, walking by the sea on La Croisette,&quot; Bhutto says. &quot;In 1985, soon after I was released from jail, Shahnawaz rented a place there, too.&quot; She flew in to see him. &quot;That night he had arranged a barbecue at the beach. He was dressed in white, suntanned and charming. Everyone was so happy. He was the centre of attention. Girls used to come and leave their name and numbers on napkins and matchboxes. The next day I got up waiting for him, but he never came.&quot;  Shahnawaz was found collapsed, a broken vial of poison beside him in a murder scene that Bhutto&apos;s supporters claimed revealed the hand of the Pakistan secret services, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). In 1996, Murtaza, her eldest brother was shot dead in an encounter with police in Karachi, for which her husband was indicted, though the case has never come to court. &quot;Their deaths were very difficult,&quot; Bhutto says. &quot;I can&apos;t redo the past, so there is little point in trying to think back. But it&apos;s so strange how life replicates itself. So many have tried to kill me, too.&quot; General Zia was the first, sending an aide to see her in her cell in 1982 in an attempt to cause a potentially fatal infection. In spring 1989, a Pakistan general hired Osama bin Laden, then a little-known sponsor of the jihadis fighting in Afghanistan, to carry out a hit on Bhutto. The plot was exposed. In 1993, two more attempts were made on her life, one by Ramzi Yousef, after he had carried out the bombing of the World Trade Centre in New York. In 1995, a group of senior army officers and clerics was found to be plotting a coup in which Bhutto was to have been eliminated. Bhutto knows the risks, but still she is eager to run for office again. &quot;The time of life is written and the time of death is written and nobody can die before their time is up,&quot; Bhutto says. &quot;The politics of Pakistan is ingrained in our family&apos;s blood, in my blood. It is a duty and a compulsion. I have to return or forgo politics forever, condemned by my supporters as a coward.&quot; Politics has always dictated her life, even the time of her giving birth. When the military tried to make political capital out of news that she was pregnant with her second child, Bakhtawar, in 1990 by forcing through legislation prohibiting a prime minister from taking maternity leave, she elected to have the baby early by Caesarean section so she could remain in power. And when her husband emerged from prison in December 2004, Bhutto, still mistrustful of Musharraf, formed an alliance with another Pakistani exile, Nawaz Sharif, the man who was in power when she and Zardari were convicted in 1999. Having himself been overthrown by Musharraf, he, too, was looking for a way to reinvigorate his political career. Both outcasts signed a &quot;charter for democracy&quot; that called for elections in Pakistan. In early 2005, Bhutto was invited back to the Foreign Office. &quot;The talk was of a post-Musharraf world,&quot; one of Bhutto&apos;s inner-circle says. &quot;What London feared was chaos,&quot; a Foreign Office spokeswoman says. &quot;What everyone wanted was a smooth transition, from Musharraf to something sustainable, preferably democratic. Bhutto had a chance of winning an election if that day came.&quot; At that stage, the US was still apparently backing the gentleman dictator, although, according to a Bhutto aide, Straw advised her that it was beginning to think about change. Condoleezza Rice, US secretary of state, was at that very moment in Islamabad pressing Musharraf to allow free elections. A series of bombings on London&apos;s transport network four months later, in July 2005, killing 52 people and injuring hundreds more, brought a new urgency to the Straw-Bhutto talks. Three of the four British suicide bombers had links to a radical madrasa in Muridke, 20 miles outside Lahore. Straw noted that, in 2001, Musharraf had pledged to outlaw jihadi groups. The Muridke school was now one of 13,000 madrasas, none of which had been regulated as the president had undertaken to do. Bhutto warned Straw that the PPP would have little chance, unless the Bush administration, too, was willing to look beyond Musharraf and back the call for elections. Straw insisted he had talked to Rice and Washington was reconsidering its position. The aftermath of an earthquake that left 75,000 dead and more than three million homeless in the Pakistan-administered sector of Kashmir gave additional cause for concern in October 2005. Under the cover of providing aid to the victims, 17 Sunni extremist groups previously banned by Musharraf (under pressure from the US state department) re-emerged with new names. Distributing food, tents and blankets, they opened tent villages, one beneath a banner proclaiming: &quot;Custodian of the blood of 10,000 mujahideen.&quot; The outlawed Lashkar-e-Taiba was there, running a field hospital in Muzaffarabad. &quot;Why should we not allow our own people, to go there and assist... whether they are jiihadis or anybody,&quot; Musharraf said at the time. Yet only a few months later, in early 2006, he was sending a new message to Bhutto, asking that she list her demands. She wrote: free elections; political prisoners released; an independent election commission formed; Pakistan&apos;s constitution [of 1973] restored. The reply came back almost immediately: Musharraf was not ready for this kind of deal. Meanwhile, Bhutto had competition in London. On January 30 2006, Nawaz Sharif and his family arrived. Ensconced in their mansion-block apartment in Mayfair, he held court on a leopard-print sofa. &quot;We were mobilising,&quot; Sharif tells us. &quot;There could be no deals with Musharraf. No deals. Full stop. It was central to our charter for democracy. We hope Bhutto was acting sincerely when she signed it.&quot; By now the Americans were on track and Musharraf at last agreed to hold a poll. It was to be staged after November 2007, when the National Assembly&apos;s term ran out. But he insisted that Bhutto and Sharif should not to be allowed to return until after the election. Prospective PPP parliamentary candidates began finding envelopes containing bullets left in their cars or on their desks - similar intimidatory tactics had been used in the previous election. As direct contact was established between the US and Bhutto, the newly appointed US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs, Richard Boucher, urged her not to encourage PPP supporters to take to the streets in protest, as they had done on previous occasions. The PPP agreed. Over a series of meetings, Boucher made clear that the US would not be dealing with Sharif, whom they blamed for putting Pakistan at risk of nuclear war with India in a conflagration over Kashmir that flared up just a few months after both countries tested nuclear weapons. &quot;But by 2006, we didn&apos;t need the US,&quot; Sharif says. &quot;It was time they realised that, in backing Musharraf in Pakistan, they were going to get their fingers burned, just like they did in Iran. Then, they had kept saying the Shah was safe until one day he was overthrown and the Ayatollahs took over the country. That could be Pakistan&apos;s future, too - Musharraf overthrown and the fundamentalists taking over. We are a better option, believe me. Regardless, I intend to go back. Like Bhutto, I have to go back and fight the election or be damned by our supporters.&quot; Sharif and his younger brother, Shahbaz, were working to rebuild their shattered party, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), in Pakistan. But Nawaz Sharif was reluctant to talk dates and timings for his return - it sounded more like an aspiration than a plan. On the other hand, Bhutto and Musharraf continued to sound each other out through emissaries. It seemed that a major sticking point was Musharraf&apos;s pride. He had never forgiven Bhutto for embarrassing him during a discussion they had about starting a war with India over Kashmir in 1993, when Musharraf had wanted the Pakistan army to launch a full-scale invasion on its own initiative. &quot;This country is run by a civilian government,&quot; Bhutto recalls snapping. &quot;I am still the prime minister.&quot; In early 2007, President Bush made his first public criticism of Musharraf, warning that he had to be more aggressive in hunting down terrorists. Under pressure, Musharraf leaned toward a deal with Bhutto - if he could stay on as president. The talks stalled again, this time because Bhutto&apos;s supporters resented her being in cahoots with the general. Then Musharraf&apos;s emissaries came up with an even stranger proposal: if Bhutto stayed away from Pakistan during the election, Musharraf would &quot;adjust the vote&quot;. A Bhutto aide said, &quot;We could not believe it. He was offering to rig the election.&quot; In Pakistan, unrest was building up, especially after Musharraf suspended Pakistan&apos;s chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. In the ensuing mass demonstrations, more than 40 people, many of them PPP supporters, were killed and 300 more were rounded up. Bhutto stepped up her demands. &quot;We wanted a free vote and I told them I was going back home to campaign for one.&quot; Then she made a remarkable concession: if she fought and won the election and became Pakistan&apos;s prime minister, Musharraf could stay on as a civilian president for the next five years. In another seismic shift, Bhutto proposed that the military retain responsibility for foreign affairs and national security over this five-year period, while her government would concentrate on the domestic agenda. Publicly, all sides denied the talks. Nevertheless, a US state department spokesman, briefing the media on June 11, was positively bullish. &quot;There are going to be some important elections coming up in the fall,&quot; he said, adding that Musharraf had pledged that, if he &quot;continues in political life&quot;, he will &quot;put aside the uniform&quot;. Bhutto is committed to returning to Pakistan in September, and informal polls have shown that, despite the rampant extremism in the country, she is likely to dominate the elections. Her constituency in the Sindh had been battered but could be salvaged and built into a movement, she claims, while the tribal areas, in which the Taliban and jihadi groups had made the most inroads, are electorally insignificant. For Bhutto, the recent siege at the Red Mosque was evidence of the calamity facing Pakistan. &quot;The country is experiencing its darkest hour,&quot; she says - General Musharraf stood by while a religious institution was transformed into a 7,000-strong army of would-be jihadis in the heart of the capital. &quot;Nothing is as General Musharraf portrays it,&quot; she says. &quot;He talks of the army battling militants who are trying to get a toe-hold. In fact, in the border regions, there are thousands of new madrasas. And they are not just madrasas, they are mini-cantonments, ruling the tribal areas through terror. Free and fair elections are the last chance to halt the expansion of al-Qaida and the neo-Taliban.&quot; Musharraf has reiterated that he is still committed to holding an election, but the pressing question now being asked is whether Bhutto, if elected, is capable of bringing Pakistan back from the brink. When the military was last forced into free elections, it was in 1988, after a decade of Zia&apos;s increasingly unpopular military dictatorship. Then it stacked the odds in its favour by dumping leaflets from the air that bore humiliating, doctored photographs of Bhutto and her mother in bikinis, beneath the slogan &quot;Gangsters in bangles&quot;. When Bhutto won, despite the slurs, military intelligence stepped up its covert campaign. Much was made of the fact that the publisher of Salman Rushdie&apos;s The Satanic Verses in the US was the same as for Bhutto&apos;s memoir, Daughter Of Destiny. Bhutto was made to look like a woman of poor judgment. Weakened, she was forced out of office in 1990, and when she attempted to stand again in the election later that year, the ISI and military, according to documents lodged in the Pakistan supreme court, deployed a \u00a31.5m slush fund with which they bribed religious candidates to slander Bhutto. The election was lost. Seventeen years on, the Pakistan military, on the verge of conceding another election, may be even more vicious, having evolved into the most powerful economic entity in the country. The military have gone into business by stealth, accruing a fortune estimated at \u00a36bn. Ayesha Siddiqa, a former research director for the Pakistan navy and author of Military Inc, which exposes the new-found wealth of Pakistan&apos;s armed forces, characterises Pakistan as &quot;a racketeer state run by soldiers&quot;. The military&apos;s empire has been built up by the auctioning of Pakistan&apos;s state assets to its own welfare organisations. Foundations established to look after servicemen and their families now run Pakistan&apos;s cement and fertiliser industries, as well as pharmaceuticals and telecommunications, banking, aggregates, aviation, transport and insurance. Everything - from the Tarmac people drive on to the petrol they put in their tanks, to the motorway tollbooths they can barely afford, to the road hauliers they hire - is owned by the military. Since Musharraf came to power, originally choosing the title of Pakistan&apos;s chief executive, he has transformed Pakistan&apos;s market economy into a military one. The Army Welfare Trust, created in the 70s with a grant of only \u00a36,000, now has assets of more than \u00a3200m. According to the IMF, such foundations control more than one quarter of Pakistan&apos;s economy. The personal wealth of Musharraf&apos;s key generals is estimated at \u00a33.5m a head. And Musharraf himself, who has a combined salary of \u00a3700 a month for his jobs as president and army chief, has acquired a real-estate portfolio worth \u00a35m. Musharraf declined an interview with us. However, he has publicly commented on the military&apos;s business world, recently claiming, &quot;We&apos;ve got fertilisers, we&apos;re involved in banking, we are involved even in pharmaceuticals. So what is the problem? Why is anyone jealous? We do things well.&quot; The Pakistan military, with their enormous economic clout, have become a new political class and ultimately might not care who wins the elections.

As the waves lapped on the idyllic Sardinian shores, the men dined and talked shop. But like the guests, the conversation was loaded. At the head of the table was Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al Thani, the prime minister of Qatar and a member of the ruling family. He had flown in his guests, Lord [David] Sainsbury of Turville and his cousin Lord [John] Sainsbury of Preston Candover, by private jet to discuss a possible 600p-a-share, \u00a310.4bn offer for the supermarket business their great grandparents founded. Also present was Paul Taylor, a shrewd financier who helped property tycoons the Tchenguiz brothers build their multi-billion-pound property empire before reinventing himself as a Cardinal Wolsey-style figure in the court of the Qatari royal family. He had drawn up the blueprint for the tiny Gulf kingdom&apos;s highest profile move yet, an attempt to buy a FTSE-100 company that is also part of the fabric of British life. Apart from Robert Tchenguiz, who has built a 10 per cent in the retailer, all the powerbrokers were around the table. The meeting was apparently arranged at the Sainsburys&apos; behest. Their grip on the family business has loosened as Taylor, through the Qatar Investment Authority-backed fund Delta Two, built a 25 per cent stake. That dethroned the clan, who collectively speak for about 18 per cent, as pre-eminent shareholders. Many were surprised the cousins had boarded the sheikh&apos;s jet in the first place. Was it an admission of defeat? After all, they are not close and in April, when Sainsbury was being stalked by CVC Capital Partners, had made their positions perfectly clear. The peers had dismissed CVC&apos;s 582p-a-share offer, which valued the retailer at \u00a310.1bn, as opportunistic. John was opposed to an offer he argued brought nothing new to the table and promised to gear the company up to its eyeballs while stripping it of its freehold property backing. David differed. Although he was concerned about a takeover that would increase the company&apos;s debt, the former science minister wanted any offer to be pitched north of 600p. But this time proved to be no different and the peers flew home without having been won over. That did not deter the ambitious Taylor and he presented the Sainsbury board, led by Sir Philip Hampton, with details of a preliminary approach last Thursday. A chain of events has now been set in train that most expect will see Sainsbury follow Boots the Chemists into private ownership. The takeover of Sainsbury is likely to follow a similar course to that of Boots&apos;s parent Alliance Boots by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. It was marred by a bitter feud over the future funding of its pension scheme and high-profile concerns about the operating methods of private equity houses. If it were wound up, the Sainsbury&apos;s pension fund deficit could swell to \u00a33bn. So should the supermarket&apos;s 153,000 employees, who have reaped the benefits of the turnaround led by chief executive Justin King, feel concerned? Delta Two was offering 600p per share in cash on top of the 7.35p dividend paid on Friday. If recommended it would be financed using \u00a34.6bn in equity and debt-related instruments along with \u00a36bn of debt finance provided by a banking syndicate. Sainsbury has \u00a31.5bn of debt at present. Observers are suspicious of Taylor&apos;s previous association with Tchenguiz, who wants management to unlock the \u00a38.6bn tied up in its property estate. The pair are not acting together but analysts suggest they have similar agendas. It is difficult to argue the Qataris are a risky prospect. Like Dubai, which owns Tussauds Group and Travelodge, they are keen to invest revenue generated by their bountiful gas fields. But is being owned by a sovereign fund a better prospect than a private equity fund? Both are opaque, and like the deal proposed by CVC, the plan proposed by Delta Two would see Sainsbury&apos;s debts quadruple. The main feature of Delta Two&apos;s plans is to spend \u00a33.5bn over five years on new stores and refurbishments, which is a lower rate than that currently envisaged by management. The supermarket would also continue to target non-food sales such as clothing and homewares and enter new markets such as the Middle East, Korea and China. Taylor has sought to distance the fund from private equity rivals, saying: &apos;It&apos;s not driven by the &apos;internal rate of return&apos; (a key performance measure used by private equity firms). &apos;It&apos;s obvious where the money comes from. The Qataris have gas reserves that will go on for 250 years.&apos; Super union Unite is against a deal, and one analyst says: &apos;Privatisation could be the worst thing that could happen to Sainsbury. It has limited potential to expand overseas and the temptation to spin off property may be too great, leaving it in a weaker position to rivals. The upside is smaller than the downside.&apos; However, the board is expected to recommend the offer. Bid speculation has propelled the shares up more than 75 per cent in the last year and the offer will undoubtedly be attractive to institutional investors. But there is a long way to go. There is the pension hurdle to jump as well as the vested interests of the Sainsbury family and Tchenguiz to overcome. Some analysts have ambitiously boosted their target price for the stock to 700p. Sainsbury is far from in the bag. Buying into Britain Qatari investors have been quietly buying up British businesses with their overflowing state coffers. But the potential takeover of Sainsbury by an investment fund backed by the kingdom&apos;s royal family is throwing the spotlight on the Gulf state. The seriousness of their intentions was highlighted by last week&apos;s meeting between Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al Thani and the Sainsbury family. Sheikh Hamad is a cousin of the Emir of Qatar and its prime minister. The move on Sainsbury&apos;s is through Delta Two, a fund controlled by the \u00a320bn Qatar Investment Authority, of which Sheikh Hamad is the chief executive. His closeness to the deal means in reality Delta Two&apos;s access to cash is almost limitless. Like its neighbours Kuwait and Dubai, the former British protectorate wants to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels by diversifying its investments. It bankrolls Arab TV network al-Jazeera and was outbid by Macquarie for Thames Water last year. Since its launch last year, the Delta Two fund has spent \u00a33bn buying up nursing home operators Four Seasons and NHP, as well as Senad, which runs special needs schools. The Qataris already employ 50,000 Britons. If they succeed in buying Sainsbury that figure will exceed 200,000.

That would follow its purchase of Pennine Natural Gas last year. The Chinese government has set up a $300 billion fund to buy Western companies, with British assets top of the list. There are sound reasons to keep Britain&apos;s economy attractive to foreign investment, but embracing liberal global markets should not be a cover for nationalisation under foreign flags. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week proposed an EU-wide response to the problem: all bids by foreign governments for European companies would be subject to the same scrutiny that the US government brings to bear on bids for American companies.

Very little is known about Delta Two beyond the fact that it controls billions worth of assets and is run by Sheikh Hamad, the Qatari Prime Minister. Effectively, it is an arm of the Qatari government, but its offer for Sainsbury illustrates that it operates in much the same way as a private equity firm - with all its drawbacks. If the bid goes ahead, Delta Two will borrow \u00a36bn to bankroll the deal, which means that it will start life as a private company saddled with debt. This in itself is curious as the Qataris have deep pockets: they are sitting on a huge quantity of gas reserves and are reaping the benefits of the oil price boom in neighbouring states. If Delta Two had wanted to reassure Sainsbury&apos;s pension fund trustees and staff that its plans were for the greater good of the company, why is it borrowing so much money? The answer, doubtless, is that Delta Two&apos;s enthusiasm for leverage stems from a desire to pave the way for a cash windfall for the new owners and senior managers. Its a wheeze that never fails: borrow to buy a company, then refinance the package under better terms by drawing down extra debt that the borrower can use to pay itself a fat dividend. Jolly good if the company is performing well, as some of the money can be ploughed back into investing in the business. But if trading takes a turn for the worse, then Sainsbury&apos;s future may be jeopardised. Like any buyout, Delta plans to delist Sainsbury from the stock market which means that overnight the company will be hidden from public view and relieved of the obligation to publish full financial statements and details about executive pay. As a consequence, it will be open to the same criticism that has been levelled at the way private equity works. There are differences, though, between private equity and Delta Two. The Middle Eastern investment group is controlled by a sovereign government rather than a buyout firm, even if it behaves in a similar fashion. Secondly, there has been no backlash against foreign ownership of British companies, unlike private equity. But there is always a tipping point, and this could be it. A private equity-style takeover by a foreign government of a company with a huge public profile won&apos;t be easy to pull off. No one said anything when Ferrovial, the Spanish construction company, borrowed millions to take over Heathrow and other British airports two years ago and there were no angry voices on this side of the Atlantic when Dubai Ports World acquired P&amp;O. But Delta Two risks flying into the storm created by private equity which today employs one in eight workers in the private sector. Globalisation and the rise of international private equity groups are altering the ownership of major British companies. Twenty years ago, the majority were controlled by blue chip UK investment institutions. Today, UK plc is shrinking as foreign companies or private equity groups move in and take large household names private. But there is a price for globalisation when the game changes as much as it has. Last week, Sir David Walker published a review of private equity, proposing greater financial transparency and more independent directors. Appointed by the industry, Walker was hoping to take the sting out of the debate which has seen private equity leaders pilloried as asset strippers and quick buck merchants. His ideas went some way to meet the demands of critics, but fell well short as they failed to address the main issue: tax. Private equity chiefs pay as little as 10 per cent on their remuneration, while generous tax breaks encourage firms to borrow to the hilt, increasing the likelihood of future defaults. This is the same tax regime, it should be noted, that Delta Two will seek to exploit if its takeover of Sainsbury is successful. But it&apos;s absurd to make such breaks available to an investment organisation that is already awash with cash. And while our open markets are undoubtedly a good thing, one has to ask whether they should be extended to countries, such as Qatar, that wouldn&apos;t dream of allowing a British company to run off with one of its trophy assets. Sainsbury&apos;s shareholders can hardly be blamed if they accept a 600p-plus offer from the Qataris, which represents a generous premium over where it was trading in January. But if more big public companies go the way of Sainsbury, people will begin to question why large chunks of UK plc are being sold off in what is beginning to look like a massive corporate car boot sale.", "tags": ["Private equity", "Business", "Globalisation", "Supermarkets", "Retail industry"], "title": "Richard Wachman: Qataris' Sainsbury bid risks flying into private equity storm", "sentences": ["No one said anything when Ferrovial, the Spanish construction company, borrowed millions to take over Heathrow and other British airports two years ago and there were no angry voices on this side of the Atlantic when Dubai Ports World acquired P&amp;O."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/22/privateequity.businesscomment", "publicationDate": "2007-07-22T16:13:12Z"}, {"article": "Rory McIlroy will leave Scotland today with a much coveted silver medal and memories that will last a lifetime, but a host of riches will imminently be bestowed on the youngster when he makes the transition from amateur to professional golf.

Delta Two, which is discussing a possible \u00a310.4bn bid for the British supermarkets group, is lining up the industry veteran Tony Campbell with the expectation that he will become chairman of Sainsbury&apos;s if an offer were to succeed. Mr Campbell worked for Asda for two decades, helping turn the company round in the 1990s, and was deputy chief executive until 2001. The appointment of Mr Campbell is seen as an attempt to deflect attacks that Delta Two&apos;s executives have little knowledge of the retail sector. Delta Two is led by a property expert, Paul Taylor. The appointment of Mr Campbell would mean he would be working alongside Sainsbury&apos;s chief executive, Justin King. The two men were at Asda together for more than six years in the 1990s. However, Delta Two faces a series of hurdles in its efforts to win control of the supermarket chain. It already has a 25% stake but needs to persuade other big shareholders, including Robert Tchenguiz, with 10%, and the Sainsbury family, which holds 18%. Reports this weekend suggested that the Qatari-backed group may need to move its terms towards \u00a37 a share, rather than the \u00a36 being mooted, to attract family backing. Delta Two&apos;s campaign to woo Sainsbury&apos;s comes amid signs of concern in Europe at the number of companies being taken over by sovereign-backed funds. This weekend, Peter Mandelson, EU trade commissioner and arch proponent of free trade and open markets, said in an interview with Italy&apos;s Il Sole 24 Ore: &quot;Maybe we could create European golden shares. But the aim must always be reciprocal market openness, not reciprocal protectionism.&quot; He added that the EU had to strike a balance between maintaining free movement of capital and protecting itself from cash-rich sovereign funds. Charlie McCreevy, the neo-liberal internal market commissioner, has indicated the EU will vet takeovers by sovereign funds paying way beyond market values because of their potential distortion effects. China is due to launch a $200bn (\u00a3100bn) investment fund this autumn and has triggered alarms in EU capitals by paying $3bn for a 9.9% stake in the US private equity group Blackstone, which, in turn, owns 4.5% of Deutsche Telekom. Dubai recently acquired 3.2% of Airbus parent EADS and the Qataris are investing heavily abroad, including its bid for Sainsbury&apos;s. EU governments, which are increasingly blocking takeovers in, for example, energy, from even European investors or firms, use golden shares to give them veto rights in &quot;strategic&quot; companies - a practice outlawed by the European Court of Justice, apart from in high-security sectors such as defence, as incompatible with treaty law. Mr Mandelson said an EU-wide system would be better than allowing individual member states to apply their own ways of protecting strategic sectors. But he admitted it would be difficult to create a system acceptable to all. &quot;I think you would need to have a shared competence between the European commission and member states,&quot; he said. &quot;You cannot leave it simply in the hands of a member state which is pursuing its own national interests. These shares must reflect the European interest, not the national one.&quot; He rejected the idea promoted by German chancellor Angela Merkel of an EU-wide body on the lines of the US Committee on Foreign Investments, which vets foreign takeovers such as BAE Systems&apos; recent acquisition of the tank-maker Armor. The Americans had often used this as a protectionist tool.

Six of the eight horses declared for the contest yesterday are already Group One winners (Yellowstone and Maraahel being the two exceptions). Assuming that all eight go to post, that is a higher percentage than five of the last seven runnings. Approach this weekend&apos;s feature race from any other direction, however, and the outlook is not nearly so promising. Some Group Ones are more equal than others, and the contests won in Italy and Germany by the likes of Youmzain and Prince Flori do not stand much comparison with the major Classics or the top-flight events in Britain, France and Ireland. The only three-year-old still in the field, meanwhile, is Yellowstone, whose only victory in nine starts came in a maiden at Cork 12 months ago. There is no getting away from it. This year&apos;s King George may well produce a competitive, exciting race, but only because there is no outstanding horse in the line-up. It will be a desperately poor renewal of our premier all-aged middle-distance race, with a winner who scarcely deserves a place alongside the likes of Dancing Brave, Ribot and Brigadier Gerard. The interesting question is whether this is merely a blip, or evidence of a continuing trend where this event is concerned. The King George has been a focal point of the domestic season since it was first run in 1951, but as the St Leger has discovered, history alone is no longer a guarantee of a race&apos;s prestige. Timing is now one of a race&apos;s most important qualities, as the international Flat season builds to its climax in the autumn. The Irish Champion Stakes, at the beginning of September, seems to be increasingly well-timed, as a Group One springboard towards the Arc de Triomphe and the Breeders&apos; Cup. The King George, on the other hand, is beginning to look a little lonely, stuck as it is as the summer highlight between the early-season Classics and the big showdowns in October. The Coolmore Stud operation, via Aidan O&apos;Brien, remains a strong and vital supporter of the King George, for all that Soldier Of Fortune, the Irish Derby winner, was scratched at the five-day stage. Without Dylan Thomas, who won the same Classic last year, the line-up would look thoroughly forlorn. There is not a single runner from France, however, to attempt to follow the lead of winners like Dahlia and Pawneese. Some may point to prize money as part of the problem, and it is true that Michael Tabor received less money for winning last year with Hurricane Run than he did when Montjeu, Hurricane Run&apos;s sire, took the same race back in 2000. Any amount of prize money will never match the potential returns from a long stud career, though, and if a race starts to be seen as diminishing a horse&apos;s chances later in the year, it is on the slippery slope. Competition, meanwhile, will surely increase in the years to come. Nobody believes that Sheikh Mohammed is spending billions of dollars on a new &quot;racing city&quot; at Meydan in Dubai in order to stage one major meeting a year, in March. An autumn festival in Dubai, which would inevitably overtake the Breeders&apos; Cup in financial terms and be a good deal easier for Europeans to reach, must be a racing certainty. Of course, this year&apos;s sub-standard renewal of the King George may be an aberration. In 12 months&apos; time, the 2008 Derby winner may be in the field, taking on this year&apos;s Arc winner and the first three home in the Breeders&apos; Cup Turf.

In all, the prize has returned to their Newmarket base on five occasions, but there seemed little optimism there yesterday that it is about to become six on Saturday. A thin field of eight runners was declared for the King George yesterday, including Godolphin&apos;s Laverock, whose form in the early part of his career in France includes a defeat of Manduro in the 2006 Prix D&apos;Ispahan. A literal reading of that form gives him the beating of Dylan Thomas, the King George favourite, who finished behind Manduro at Royal Ascot last month. All the recent evidence, though, suggests that Manduro has improved immensely over the last 14 months, and Laverock has it all to do this weekend. The five-year-old was particularly disappointing in Dubai this winter, but showed something of a return to form at Newmarket earlier this month, when he finished 2\u00bd lengths behind Papal Bull. &quot;He&apos;s not a confirmed runner, but he&apos;s likely,&quot; Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, said yesterday. &quot;We&apos;ll make a decision in the next 48 hours, but if there was a bit of ease in the ground, that would suit him. &quot;He seems to have done well since his last race, so he might just take his chance. He ran to his form, but he needs to be a lot better than that if he is to be competitive in the King George and he won&apos;t be, that&apos;s him. He&apos;s a very solid, middle-distance prospect, but he more than likely lacks the brilliance required.&quot; If a solid, unspectacular horse like Laverock is ever to win a King George, though, it is likely to be this year. Maraahel, a horse who has failed to win a Group One in a dozen attempts, is the current third-favourite at around 5-1, which indicates the lack of strength in depth this year, and despite his connections&apos; pessimism, Laverock is no bigger than 16-1. Dylan Thomas, meanwhile, is already odds-on with many bookies and the 11-10 against offered by Coral is unlikely to last unless Ascot receives a serious drenching. &quot;It&apos;s hard to be anything other than disappointed with the lack of entries for this showpiece contest,&quot; David Stevens, the firm&apos;s spokesman, said yesterday. &quot;But Dylan Thomas has the best Group One form in the book and his odds are likely to shorten further.&quot; Godolphin may not hold out much hope of King George success, but their runner Ramonti is likely to be among the market leaders for the Group One Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood next week after being confirmed a runner yesterday.

An eight-runner field with a hot favourite is what bookmakers refer to as a &quot;filthy&quot; each-way race, offering value to those who look beyond the market leader, and there will be many backers this weekend who decide that Youmzain each-way is the best bet. Mick Channon&apos;s four-year-old is an 8-1 chance in places for the King George, but he has some useful form in the book, including a length-and-a-half defeat by Dylan Thomas, the ante-post favourite for Saturday&apos;s race, at Leopardstown last year, and a narrow defeat by Rail Link, the subsequent Arc winner. &quot;He&apos;s a high-class horse and he always has been,&quot; Channon said yesterday, &quot;and he&apos;s only had 13 races, so we haven&apos;t overdone him. He ran very well in Dubai over the winter as well, and we&apos;ve always wanted to have a go at a race like this with him. &quot;I don&apos;t make the books so I don&apos;t know about the odds, but he breezed lovely this morning and he seems in great form.

He has been placed in eight of his 10 races over the past two seasons, his four victories including the Group One Preis von Europa at Cologne. &quot;He&apos;s a Group One winner and his form stands up,&quot; Channon says. &quot;People keep saying that this is a sub-standard King George, but you can only beat the best horses that are around at this moment in time. &quot;He&apos;s not short of speed either, so I&apos;m not too worried about the pace in the race. So long as there&apos;s pace on from three furlongs out, he&apos;ll be fine, as he&apos;s got a real bit of class about him. &quot;We&apos;ve won a lot of big races, but obviously this would be the biggest if he could win on Saturday.

This is nonsense on stilts - the public have very specific concerns, and politicians have ignored these in favour of pursuing their own interests. It remains to be seen whether this is sustainable - but even if it is, it will be evidence not of a rejection of a globalisation but of a serious democratic deficit. On Monday, the Financial Times released details of a poll carried out for it by Harris, which took the views of 1,000 citizens in each of six rich countries (the US, Germany, UK, France, Italy and Spain). The dramatic headline &quot;Globalisation backlash in rich nations&quot; stems from a response that three times as many people in the UK, France, Spain and the US felt that globalisation was having a negative effect in their country as felt it to be positive. Larry Elliott covered the poll here, arguing that the establishment needs to recognise the growing disgust at income inequality. While I agree fully with that interpretation, I think Larry allows himself to go along with the spin that&apos;s put on the poll results by the &quot;bosses&apos; paper&quot; (his phrase not mine), when he highlights the finding that &quot;the anti-globalisation backlash is being felt across the developed world, not just in the UK.&quot; To my mind, the poll shows nothing like a backlash. In four of the six countries surveyed (the UK, France, Italy and Spain) more than 50% of respondents said they were not sure what effect globalisation was having. In Germany, twice as many felt it to be positive as negative, and in total only about one in five of those surveyed felt it to be negative. The remaining country, and the one with the most negative view, is the US. Even here however, barely 40% of respondents felt globalisation to be negative - with half that number positive and the rest unsure. What the poll shows then is not a negative feeling towards globalisation but a deep uncertainty about its effects; judgement is largely being withheld. Before politicians think about a PR job then, they need to identify what exactly lies behind this ambivalence. Fortunately, the poll gives some very clear pointers. Unfortunately for most of our politicians, it shows the public to have a very different set of concerns from theirs. Tuesday&apos;s FT editorial concludes:  &quot;The solutions are known, but politically demanding. Better education pays dividends beyond the patience of most politicians. Flexible economies gain more from trade as failing firms are replaced by expanding ones - yet this idea is a hard sell, for obvious reasons. Some of the solutions are local - improved infrastructure in the UK, decoupling healthcare from a job in the US. But the shortage of eloquent, truly pro-market politicians is likely to be a global one. A pity.&quot;  Globalisation concerns of policymakers have for the most part reflected worries about the protection of domestic industry from foreign competition and from foreign ownership. This is why rich countries subsidies to their own industries are the largest in the world, despite their clear lack of competitiveness, and why the current trend for surplus countries like China and Dubai to invest directly in companies like Barclays and Sainsbury&apos;s is causing such disquiet. The EU trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, has even talked about the possibility of (thoroughly protectionist) &quot;golden shares&quot; to allow European governments to block such deals. What the public worry about, on the other hand, is completely different. To a large extent, I suspect, they recognise that there&apos;s little difference in terms of jobs and growth between ownership by such sovereign funds or by British institutional investors, or indeed by private equity firms run by executives who may be British but are almost certainly based offshore for tax purposes. The concerns, instead, are with direct economic effects of one part of globalisation: financial liberalisation. Over the last 30 years (Thatcher finished the UK&apos;s liberalisation, others followed after), international financial flows have become increasingly free and increasingly important in domestic economies. A number of effects are increasingly of concern. First, the freeing of capital without an equivalent mobility of labour makes it inevitable that - in the absence of international policy measures - the tax burden will fall more on labour. This in turn increasingly neuters the progressivity of tax systems, and exacerbates the inequality of final incomes. This is what citizens in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and the US are worried about. The key findings of the poll are that a majority of the public in each country supports higher rates of taxation on those with the highest incomes, and believes that social background restricts the opportunities of people to fulfil their potential. Interestingly, the latter majorities were smallest in the least socially mobile US and UK, which suggests the PR here has been better than the experience. As I may possibly have mentioned before, the absence of international financial regulation, including serious measures against tax evasion, are the basis for these particular, pernicious outcomes. But they reflect a choice by policymakers, and are not an inevitable feature of globalisation. This poll is one more piece of evidence that the public in rich countries, while embracing many aspects of globalisation, are deeply concerned about the impact on their societies of unfettered and untaxed international financial flows. Policymakers should forget trying to sell this, and focus instead on the public&apos;s reasonable worries. There is no backlash against globalisation, only against growing inequality and social immobility.

Where once it was the west that exported capital to developing countries, for the past few years the trend has been reversed. It has been cash-rich governments in Asia that have allowed consumers in Britain and America to live beyond their means. Where once countries such as China were happy to snap up financial assets such as US Treasury bonds, they now seek to branch out and want to own or part-own western companies. This week the investment arms of the Chinese and Singaporean governments said they wanted to help bankroll the bid by Barclays for ABN Amro. Qatar&apos;s Delta (Two) fund put in a \u00a310.6bn bid approach for Sainsbury&apos;s this month. Some countries, such as China and Singapore, have based their economic strategies on exports. As the world&apos;s new industrial heartland, they sell more goods abroad than they import in return. In other words, they run trade surpluses, which stand in contrast to the trade deficits recorded by the UK and US. A second group of countries rich in natural resources - such as Russia and the oil states of the Gulf - have received a windfall from the commodity boom of the past few years. Those nations with ample stocks of crude are also running big trade surpluses. Countries such as China and Russia recycle their surpluses into the global economy. Until recently, they have bought western financial assets, and by buying bonds in massive quantities have forced down long-term interest rates, thereby encouraging still more consumption in the US and Britain by making borrowing cheaper. Now they are seeking to diversify their portfolios by buying up real assets - a strategy which ensures their activities are more visible and controversial. With the City dominating the UK economy, it was hardly surprising that Alistair Darling, below, should say that Britain was open to business from sovereign funds. Other countries are, however, more equivocal. Washington blocked a takeover by the Dubai government of terminal operations at six US ports.

The latest violence comes just two weeks after the president, General Pervez Musharraf, ordered commandos to storm the mosque in central Islamabad, in a raid that left over 100 people dead.  Given Pakistan&apos;s strategic importance it is no wonder David Miliband decided to stop over in the country after visiting Afghanistan on his first overseas trip as foreign secretary. Gen Musharraf cuts an increasingly forlorn figure; his credibility taking a huge knock with the reinstatement of the chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry, four months after he was removed from his post for alleged misconduct. Gen Musharraf saw the judge as a potential obstacle to his plans to run for re-election and tried to get him fired. He only succeeded in transforming the judge into an unlikely pro-democracy hero. It was the first time in Pakistan&apos;s 60-year history that a civilian has challenged a military leader in court and won. Coupled with an emboldened political opposition is an upsurge of violence in the country. More than 285 people have died since the beginning of the month, when the start of the Red Mosque siege in Islamabad triggered a violent backlash from Islamists. Yesterday brought more violence in the North West Frontier province, the tribal belt area bordering Afghanistan, where Taliban militants have been active and where the central government exercises only nominal control. The US has hardly bolstered Mr Musharraf with inflammatory remarks from senior officials holding out the possibility of US air strikes against &quot;known terrorist compounds&quot; in Pakistan&apos;s tribal areas or a large-scale ground offensive across the border from Afghanistan. Who needs enemies, Mr Musharaff may well wonder, with such imperious and tactless backers. For Washington, what quicker way to undermine an important ally in its &quot;war on terror&quot;. Against this background, parliamentary elections scheduled for late in the year look pivotal for Pakistan&apos;s future. Much manoeuvring is already underway. Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister who has lived in exile in Dubai and London since 1996, when she was removed on corruption charges, has been angling for a return to Pakistan. Speculation abounds about a deal whereby she becomes prime minister with Mr Musharraf staying on as president. But it will be hard for the two to work together. Ms Bhutto, who has been making all the right noises to please the US, is highly critical of the way the military, since the days of General Zia-ul-Haq, who was president for 10 years, has used religious parties in an attempt to boost the legitimacy of army rule. She told the Toronto Globe &amp; Mail newspaper this week that instead of signing peace agreements and negotiating with radical groups, she would adopt zero tolerance towards political madrassas, religious schools that embrace terrorist ideologies. Ms Bhutto also plans to work closely with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, who has had prickly relations with Mr Musharraf, accusing Pakistan of failing to do enough to curb the Taliban on Pakistan&apos;s side of the border. Ms Bhutto&apos;s would seem to be America&apos;s preferred candidate for prime minister. But while international attention has focused on the media-friendly Ms Bhutto and her Pakistan People&apos;s Party, or PPP, another former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, has been forging an alliance with the religious parties and most minor parties. He could yet thwart a Bhutto comeback. With so much at stake, the best the US can hope for is that Pakistan will follow the same path as Turkey, where Muslim moderates, led by the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, won a resounding victory.", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "Politics", "Foreign policy", "UK news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "US ally close to the edge", "sentences": ["Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister who has lived in exile in Dubai and London since 1996, when she was removed on corruption charges, has been angling for a return to Pakistan."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/27/pakistan.politics", "publicationDate": "2007-07-27T13:49:13Z"}, {"article": "Cometh the tower ... Burj Dubai under construction in March 2006. It&apos;s a lot bigger now. Photograph: Dan Chung Burj Dubai is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a friend of the earth. The tower, which became the world&apos;s tallest last week (it&apos;s still under construction, and the final height is a secret), is more like an environmental liability. That much is clear from the official website, which makes none of the usual nods to the green lobby, boasting that &quot;at peak cooling times, the tower will require approximately 10,000 tonnes of cooling [water] per hour&quot;. Of course, could a building this size be anything other than an energy-guzzling monster? This thing is the Exxon Valdez of contemporary architecture.  It&apos;s a fitting emblem for Dubai, then, a city of climate-controlled skyscrapers and malls in one of the hottest regions of the world. The combination of oil wealth and tax haven status have turned this place into the churning epicentre of Middle Eastern capitalism, a display of wealth far more extravagant than anything conjured up by Louis XIV.

In the case of Burj Dubai, how it looks and how it feels to use are disqualified as criteria for judging the building. It&apos;s such a travesty on environmental grounds that it can immediately be dismissed as bad architecture.

It&apos;s open season for those who want a chunk of UK plc.&apos; Lyons reckons that the Chinese are the ones to watch: with foreign reserves at around $1.3trn, Beijing has money to burn. Last week, the China Development Bank sent shockwaves round the City when it paid more than \u00a31bn to take a stake in Barclays. Temasek, the Singaporean state-owned fund, also acquired a holding in the UK bank. The transaction is part of a deal that will furnish Barclays with extra cash to buy ABN, the Dutch financial institution that is the target of a bidding war between Barclays and a consortium led by the Royal Bank of Scotland. One analyst says: &apos;It&apos;s an extraordinary turn of events: Communist China helping a Western bank buy a continental competitor. This gives globalisation a new twist.&apos; The amount that the Chinese bank is paying is relatively small, but it throws the spotlight on foreign state-owned institutions and companies that are gobbling up British firms with increasing frequency. An investment fund owned by the government of Qatar is bidding for J Sainsbury in a move that has sparked opposition from trade unions. Last year, Dubai acquired P&amp;O, the UK ports group, while British water and electricity companies have been snapped up by European rivals in a manner that UK utilities firms cannot emulate because continental countries are far more protective of their home markets. So is Asia: India and China impose strict limits on foreign investment. But not Britain, which is the most open market in the world, as illustrated by the large number of Russian, Central Asian and Chinese firms that have listed on the London and Aim stock markets. China&apos;s decision to acquire Western assets raises concerns because the amount of money that the Chinese have at their disposal could have wide-ranging economic consequences. Karen Ward, UK economist at HSBC, says: &apos;There are policy implications because by pumping liquidity into Western markets, the Chinese are doing something that runs counter to the wishes of the Bank of England, which is trying to remove liquidity by raising interest rates. If the Chinese are going to invest heavily in UK companies, it will push up asset prices in much the same way as the influx of foreign money into London has pumped up the property market.&apos; Sensing, perhaps, that a protectionist backlash may not be far away, Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, gave a speech last week in which he praised open markets as a force for good. According to Darling, foreign capital creates wealth and jobs, especially where the money is used to open new factories or expand existing businesses. He said: &apos;I welcome investment in Britain: it is a sign of our success. So I start this job championing free trade.&apos; But Darling is aware of the drawbacks of openness when countries such as China restrict foreign investment. Foreign banks, for instance, are not allowed to own more than 25 per cent of Chinese institutions. Britain&apos;s EU partners have been talking about a European response to so-called &apos;sovereign funds&apos; - state-owned institutions that seek to buy up corporate entities. These include funds operated by rich countries in the Middle East such as Delta Two, the Qatari vehicle that has J Sainsbury in its sights. But Darling has come down decisively against protectionism as a response, and British business organisations agree with him. Miles Templeman of the Institute of Directors, says: &apos;I am so glad he made that speech. You don&apos;t get anywhere by putting up barriers; it is better to engage with countries such as China and quietly persuade them to liberalise their markets. You cannot be half in favour of globalisation, in much the same way as you cannot be half pregnant.&apos; Darling acknowledges, however, that &apos;investment needs to be a two-way process. So just as we welcome investment here, there needs to be a level playing field for British investment overseas. Openness should be a commitment by all. Free trade should be just that.&apos; Earlier, Sir John Gieve, deputy governor of the Bank of England, told a City audience that the rising power of state-owned funds would lead to political tension and calls for protectionism. He may be right, but the Chinese are aware of Western sensitivities and can hardly be accused of taking the world by storm. Analysts say that Beijing has learnt a lot since 2005 when a Chinese oil company, CNOOC, tried to take over US-based Unocal but was thwarted by opposition on Capitol Hill. Now the Chinese appear to be more content with acquiring minority stakes in Western companies - they hold 7 per cent of Barclays and last month bought a 9.9 per cent share of Blackstone, the US private equity giant that floated on Wall Street. The conventional view is that China wants to diversify its reserves out of foreign currencies, principally the dollar, which accounts for 50 per cent of the total, by investing in assets that offer better returns than the 3 to 4 per cent generated by US treasury bills. Professor Laixiang Sun, at London University&apos;s School of Oriental and African Studies, says: &apos;China wants a more balanced portfolio with enhanced returns. It has seen how Temasek has grown rich by acquiring stakes in companies in Asia and elsewhere. Now it wants to do the same.&apos; But Vince Cable, treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, says China is &apos;also buying experience about how capitalism works - in areas such as intellectual property rights, private equity and research and development. It is investing in knowledge and expertise, which it still lacks in many sectors of economic activity.&apos; In the case of Barclays, the China Development Bank will be represented on the bank&apos;s board, giving it a bird&apos;s eye view of how one of Britain&apos;s largest public companies operates. The way that deal was cemented is also instructive: it shows how, in a relatively short period of time, the Chinese have exploited a growing network of international contacts. It was John Studzinski, the former Morgan Stanley banker, now at Blackstone, who acted as a broker. Throughout the negotiations, Studzinski was in touch with Antony Leung, who runs Blackstone&apos;s China business and is in turn a member of the CDC board. For the Chinese, then, the connection with Blackstone proved crucial. The private equity firm was the obvious place to go for advice, given that the Chinese government has been one of its biggest investors after its June flotation. Despite China&apos;s new gently-gently approach to investing abroad, no one should doubt its determination to use its wealth to buy up foreign assets. It is already one of the biggest foreign investors in Africa, where it has acquired mines to secure a steady supply of the commodities needed to oil the wheels of rapid industrialisation at home. But the real issue for Beijing is how to spend the vast sums of money that have been accumulated via the dramatic build-up of trade surpluses, generated by an unparalleled export boom with the West and neighbouring countries in Asia. So China is to set up an investment fund that is expected to have a kitty in excess of $300bn. One analyst says: &apos;That is an incredible amount of money. Even adjusted for inflation, the US Marshall Plan after World War Two was only worth $100bn. I simply cannot believe that a fund of that size won&apos;t move markets.&apos; He adds: &apos;Just think about private equity: stock prices have been inflated by the knowledge that cash-rich private equity firms have been circling publicly listed firms and could strike at any moment. Just knowing the Chinese are out there is bound to affect asset values.&apos; But at what point do the activities of foreign investors ignite domestic political opposition? Cable, who is against Britain or the EU taking protectionist measures, says that our open markets haven&apos;t really been tested. &apos;Yes, we have had European monopolies taking over British utilities, but we have been very tolerant, hoping to lead by example. &apos;Funnily enough, it is the Russians, rather than the Chinese, that could provide a bigger test. If a company such as Gazprom [the Russian gas giant], with its close connections to the Kremlin, sought to acquire British Gas, it could raise problems about security of UK energy supplies, although it&apos;s difficult to see how we could stop it.&apos; For his part, Laixiang Sun prefers to put a positive gloss on the emergence of China: &apos;The more the world can involve China in the global market place, the better,&apos; he says. &apos;The EU was set up, in no small measure, to help prevent another conflict between France and Germany. If China is more closely integrated within the world economy, it reduces the likelihood of war.&apos; Rising in the East The stakes 2005 Chinese computer manufacturers Lenovo buys out IBM&apos;s personal computer division. 2006 China Construction Bank acquires Bank of America&apos;s retail division in Hong Kong and Macau.

July 2007 CDB buys \u00a32.4bn stake in Barclays, with provision of a further \u00a36.5bn if the British firm were to purchase ABN Amro.

With both the English and Irish Derby winners notable by their absence, and only seven horses lining up, the 2007 race did not quite match some of the earlier runnings. There was, nevertheless, a highly impressive winner, the favourite Dylan Thomas, who strode clear in the final furlong to finish four lengths clear of runner-up Youmzain. The King George is, self-evidently, a royal occasion, one of the &apos;must-see&apos; races. For one royal, who has frequently been in the winners&apos; enclosure, yesterday&apos;s race was a disappointment as his horse, Laverock, trailed in fourth, a long, long way behind Dylan Thomas. For much of the last three summers Sheikh Mohammed, or His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, to give him his full title, would have been better off staying at home, where the world&apos;s tallest building, the Burj Dubai, is rising much faster than the stocks of his flagship racing operation. Fifteen years ago the sport&apos;s most famous owner took the first steps towards setting up a racing empire that would rule the world. Sheikh Mohammed, ruler of Dubai and a respected horseman in his own right, created Godolphin, whose famous royal-blue silks have been worn in dozens of top-class races in 11 countries. Money would be no object. The wins duly followed, 133 of them at the highest level, Group One and Grade One. Godolphin won the King George for the first time in 1995, a year after they expanded into a global operation. They won it again in 1997, &apos;98, &apos;99 and 2004, Godolphin&apos;s last really rewarding year on these shores before they slipped into a decline that has gathered momentum. Their top trainer went into the weekend twelfth in the British prize money table; their stud has no active stallion in Europe&apos;s top 10; and their arch rivals, Coolmore, from Ireland, are away and gone in the distance. Just to rub it in, yesterday&apos;s easy winner Dylan Thomas is a Coolmore horse. Their success rate in the three key areas of training horses, breeding horses and buying horses is, to be polite, open to improvement. Sheikh Mohammed is mind-bogglingly wealthy and appears keener on spending his way out of trouble than listening to alternative solutions to Godolphin&apos;s blues. This is a tale of one man&apos;s free-wheeling pursuit of excellence in a sport in which it is easier to lose money than make it. For every \u00a31,000 an owner invests in a racehorse, the average return from prize money is \u00a3250. Many owners will have no return at all. With average training costs at \u00a316,000 a year for every horse, the bills can mount up - which is why the shrewder investors put their money into breeding, where the chances of making a profit are far better. When Galileo, owned by Coolmore, won the English and Irish Derbys and the King George in 2001, he finished his career with \u00a31.6 million in prize money. He can make 10 times as much as that every year at stud, covering 200 mares. Sheikh Mohammed, who this season has paid more than \u00a350m to buy the English Derby winner Authorized, the Kentucky Derby first and second Street Sense and Hard Spun, and the much hyped Japanese colt Admire Moon for his stallion roster, need not be too concerned about prize money. His fortune is estimated at tens of billions of pounds - of which he recently donated \u00a35bn to improve literacy and education in the Arab world - and he is keen to use it to raise the profile of Dubai and to gain status by building the world&apos;s greatest racing empire. Sadly for him, his globetrotting stable have never looked so far off the pace. Coolmore, meanwhile, have galloped off into the sunset leaving Godolphin in a cloud of dust. Until a few years ago, Godolphin were more than a match for Coolmore, started in 1975 by Tim Vigors in partnership with Vincent O&apos;Brien, the great trainer, and the late Robert Sangster, the Vernons pools magnate, and now run by O&apos;Brien&apos;s son-in-law, John Magnier. Not now. Far too often for their own liking, Godolphin have not even bothered turning up for the biggest races. They still have the best strike-rate - winners per runners - of any stable in Britain, but most of those wins have come in minor races. Their figurehead trainer, Saeed bin Suroor, is more than \u00a31m behind his Coolmore counterpart, Aidan O&apos;Brien, in English winnings. And O&apos;Brien&apos;s &apos;day job&apos; is in Ireland, where he also tops the prize money table by a distance. Godolphin&apos;s desperation was no better showcased than in the eagerness of their number-one jockey Frankie Dettori to get the Italian purchase Ramonti home first for his employers in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot last month, even at the cost of a 14-day whip ban for striking the horse 25 times inside the final two furlongs. The relief of stable and rider at recording a first British Group One win in two seasons was tangible. Godolphin fielded 33-1 shot Truly Royal in the 2,000 Guineas (nineteenth of 24) and did not have a runner in the 1,000 Guineas. Their sole entry, Measured Tempo, finished thirteenth of 14 in the Oaks and again, for the second successive year, they had no interest in the Derby. The Irish and French Classics and the Eclipse Stakes all passed by with barely a mention of Godolphin. A rejuvenated and popular Henry Cecil, a one-time trainer for Sheikh Mohammed, has more win prize money than bin Suroor. What has gone wrong? In fairness, a virus contributed to last year&apos;s barren run in Britain but, when their own horses have failed to make the grade, they have done what Chelsea did, and tried to buy their way to success. If Roman Abramovich had splashed out on as many dud players as Godolphin have horses, especially in recent seasons, there would be damning headlines every week of the year. Tony Morris, one of Britain&apos;s foremost experts on breeding, says: &apos;The contrast between Coolmore and Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s outfit is that one man attracts money, the other parts with it. Magnier is the greatest genius this game has ever known. He has exploited every possible way to make money and it has diversified into so many other things now he has made himself into a multimillionaire, perhaps billionaire. &apos;With the Sheikh, it&apos;s all about putting Dubai on the map. He has tried to bring a focus to his country which has worked in some respects, but it is not working as far as the success of his horses is concerned.&apos; The Sheikh, to his detriment, some might say, has stayed stringently loyal to his long-standing servants as long as they knew their place. His perception that Cecil&apos;s second wife was getting too big for her boots in the training of his horses at Warren Place, led him to sever ties in 1995 with a man who was 10 times champion trainer. And when Neil Graham departed as trainer of Godolphin&apos;s juveniles (the two-year-olds, the youngest age at which a thoroughbred can race), earlier this year, he was made to sign a letter of confidentiality, which, in itself, hints at the anxiety running through the camp. It is understood Graham audaciously suggested changes that fell on deaf ears and served only to hasten his exit. The singlemindedness that today is a strong trait of the Sheikh can be traced to an early age. From four, he was tutored in Arabic and Islamic studies and there is much more to this competitive man than his love of horses. He is a keen hunter and falconer, he writes Nabati poetry, a colloquial form of Arabic, and his relentless push to turn Dubai into one of the wonders of the world for tourism and sport has been breathtaking. His poems were first published in newspapers under pseudonyms because he wanted to ensure people thought his writing was good and not just being put in the public gaze because he was a member of the ruling family. Late last year he made an unsuccessful bid to buy Liverpool FC. For a man so driven, the downtown in Godolphin&apos;s fortunes must hurt. In Dubai earlier this year, as Sheikh Mohammed was announcing plans for a new billion-dollar racecourse to replace Nad Al Sheba, his Godolphin team were struggling on supposedly their most successful track. One win from five runners in January, none from 26 in February and two from 23 in March were statistics only compounded by pin-up horse Discreet Cat flopping in the showpiece Dubai World Cup, a result later put down to a throat ailment. Godolphin&apos;s number-two jockey, Kerrin McEvoy, was leading rider at the Dubai Carnival on the back of horses prepared not by Godolphin, but by Ismail Mohammed, who took training honours. The Australian, who has relied on outside rides for his big-race wins this season, concedes Godolphin are lacking ammunition. &apos;But everyone goes through cycles and Godolphin&apos;s no different,&apos; he said. &apos;It&apos;s not as though we&apos;re keeping any good horses back, we&apos;re just a bit thin on the top with Group One horses at the moment. We just haven&apos;t got the horses like we have had in previous years. But we&apos;re doing well in the handicaps and black-type races and we still have one of the best strike-rates. &apos;Hopefully, we&apos;ll have some nice two-year-olds coming through and we will have a good backend to the season.&apos; Simon Crisford, who has been Godolphin&apos;s racing manager since they started, declined to comment when The Observer put to him a series of questions about the performance of the Sheikh&apos;s racehorses and stallions. Godolphin scorn prying eyes, but from an outsider&apos;s point of view it does not look difficult to pinpoint where things have gone wrong. In the early days, when Jeremy Noseda was working alongside Bin Suroor with a team of fewer than 50 horses, there was an edge and magic that has eroded as the numbers have risen into the hundreds. Two years ago Godolphin had more than 300 horses at Newmarket, with 180 of those being two-year-olds, the majority of them vanishing &apos;into a deep blue hole&apos;, as one gallops-watcher put it. Vince Smith, now a trainer, fondly recalls his days as a work rider in 1995, when 12 Group Ones came Godolphin&apos;s way. &apos;They had just 40 horses back then, but they were 40 very good horses,&apos; Smith said. &apos;And they won everything. It was sometimes embarrassing working there because the lads were so experienced and knew so much about the horses. Now it&apos;s a massive operation, which makes it harder to know what you&apos;ve got.&apos; Noseda, who left Godolphin to go solo in 1996, and his successor, American Tom Albertrani, who stayed until 2003, were associated with the most prosperous years of the organisation. At the core of Godolphin&apos;s troubles is their scattergun approach to buying horses in training, and their relatively new breeding operation which, although rapidly expanding, lacks a stallion of real clout among its 53 to rival the masters Coolmore, who are armed with the great Sadler&apos;s Wells, Montjeu, Galileo and Giant&apos;s Causeway. Coolmore, not surprisingly, have six of the top 10 stallions in Europe, including Danehill, who died in 2003 but still tops the list as his progeny come to the racecourse. Darley have only the deceased In The Wings. That might have changed had the Sheikh&apos;s adored colt, Dubai Millennium, a winner of nine of his 10 races, not died of grass sickness in 2001, shortly into his stud career. While Godolphin have had no reservations about keeping their horses in training after their three-year-old careers, Coolmore, with few exceptions, have raced only to fuel their lucrative breeding operation. When George Washington had fertility problems at the start of the year, the racing world was stunned when Coolmore immediately sent Holy Roman Emperor, their leading 2,000 Guineas hope, off to stud as his replacement. But this is cutting-edge business, where the game&apos;s big bucks are made. If the top three Coolmore stallions all served 200 mares a season, their combined earning potential on paper would be more than \u00a350m. &apos;It&apos;s astronomical money,&apos; said Morris, a Racing Post columnist and author of several breeding publications, including Thoroughbred Stallions, who has written on the sport for 44 years. &apos;A lot of people were shocked that Holy Roman Emperor went to stud but you could see the commercial reasons why it was done. &apos;There are a lot of owner-breeders who go to Coolmore because of the class horses, but there are also commercial breeders who know there is a big demand for the stock of Coolmore horses when they come to the sales and that they are a worthwhile investment. &apos;For most, owning racehorses is a hobby - like owning a yacht, a wealthy person&apos;s indulgence. Anyone who thinks they can make a business of it, well, it&apos;s just pie in the sky stuff. But it does work for the odd one or two.&apos; Darley, the breeding arm of Godolphin, own the 4,000-acre Dalham Stud in Newmarket, Kildangan Stud in Co Kildare, Jonabell Farm in Kentucky and other studs in Australia and Japan. The recently purchased Authorized, as a son of Montjeu, will give Godolphin a line into the Coolmore bloodlines. That will be a welcome change after Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s decision two years ago to stop buying yearlings from the Irish breeders, a move Morris believes was &apos;just plain stupid&apos;. Allegedly, the Sheikh took offence at being forced into a bidding frenzy for Jalil, a Storm Cat colt bought by his bloodstock agent John Ferguson for $9.7m (\u00a34.9m) at Keeneland, Kentucky, two years ago, which only recently won a modest race at Ripon. The Sheikh is also said to have taken offence at Coolmore sending a little-known representative to the Dubai World Cup meeting in the spring of 2005, where they had a runner, instead of either Magnier or trainer O&apos;Brien. &apos;The only piece of policy that we have heard from Godolphin in the last few years is that they have stopped buying the progeny of Coolmore stallions, which is about as stupid as one could get really,&apos; Morris said. &apos;It&apos;s like playing with a deck of cards when you know someone else has all the aces. &apos;Unfortunately, Sheikh Mohammed is not going to change his mind, is he? Buying Authorized is obviously a way into that bloodline but it will be five or six years before we know whether that has been a smart move.&apos; Bill Gredley, who runs Middle Park and Stetchworth Studs near Newmarket, agrees the significant growth in stable numbers and the stance on Coolmore have left their mark on Godolphin, but he senses more. &apos;There is something amiss and I just can&apos;t put my finger on it,&apos; he said. &apos;With the numbers they have the law of averages suggest they must have a couple of decent horses - after all, they are not selling platers. If I had their team I could have found one to run in the Eclipse. I know they have some lovely horses but I am puzzled as to why they don&apos;t run them. &apos;Maybe it&apos;s their training methods, they won&apos;t run them if they don&apos;t think they&apos;ve got a chance, I don&apos;t know. They have fallen by the wayside but I can see them getting their act together again.&apos; Morris, however, believes Godolphin&apos;s pursuit of Coolmore is a lost cause. &apos;When the Maktoums first came into the game I assumed they would be a great boon to the British bloodstock industry, but it&apos;s never happened,&apos; he said. &apos;There isn&apos;t anything in the Darley operation on this side of the Atlantic that is very exciting as a stallion. I don&apos;t think there is any prospect of them ever catching up with Coolmore. Their racing and breeding operations are too big, and I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s anybody with the wit to cull them back. While I&apos;m sure the main ethos of Godolphin is to promote Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed still wants to beat Coolmore, but he is not going about it the right way. &apos;Whether he actually has good enough people working for him is another thing - and whether he listens to them is also another matter. I don&apos;t think there are too many people employed by Sheikh Mohammed who would get a job at Coolmore.&apos; Unlike many, Morris does not feel that Godolphin dropping off the map would have dire consequences for the industry - and might even help it. &apos;The Maktoum involvement has been a disincentive for other people to get involved - it has been for 20 years,&apos; he said. &apos;The bloodstock industry would not collapse if there was no Godolphin. It would go through a short period of adjustment, but it would adjust, and I think most people&apos;s view is that many more would be drawn into racing. Fortunately, in the last couple of years we have seen some good results for the smaller operators.&apos; In the autumn of 2005, Godolphin&apos;s judgment was seen at its worst when millions were spent on Opera Cape, Silca&apos;s Sister, Palace Episode and Winged Cupid from outside yards to bolster their Classic aspirations, but to no avail. It has become an all-too-familiar part of their operation. Unlike Coolmore, who had eight runners in this year&apos;s Derby, they have never been renowned for nurturing juveniles into Classic winners and, since 2000, have had only four runners in total in the Middle Park and Dewhurst Stakes, two of the most important races for two-year-olds. Even when David Loder was at his peak as Godolphin&apos;s two-year-old mentor with an astonishing win ratio - he trained 42 winners from 107 runners in 2001 - the attrition rate in training was high and many of the horses did not train on to fulfil their promise the following season. When it comes to buying, few can live with Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s bottomless pockets. Ever since he paid $10.2m for Snaafi Dancer - a colt who, it transpired, could neither race nor breed - at America&apos;s prestigious Keeneland Sales in 1983, he has bankrolled the bloodstock industry to the tune of hundreds of millions. At the same sales last September, his bloodstock agent Ferguson paid just under $60m for 34 yearlings, the top price being $11.7m. In the three preceding years his spending was $36m, $33m, and $21m - a total outlay of $150m in four years for 138 yearlings. That&apos;s just in America. At the Tattersalls Sale in Newmarket last October, Sheikh Mohammed bought 23 yearlings for about \u00a37m. Morris says Godolphin should look no further than the Saudi Prince, Khalid Abdullah, who raced the great Dancing Brave among a host of big-race winners, for inspiration. &apos;He came into the game at roughly the same time [as Sheikh Mohammed] and created the most wonderful, professional outfit,&apos; Morris said. &apos;Within a few years he had himself a breeding operation sufficient for all his needs and he has very rarely bought a yearling in the last 20 years. &apos;He has had phenomenal success with the horses he has bred. It is amazing that Sheikh Mohammed, with all his resources has never been able to get an operation going on that sort of footing.&apos; What is not in question is that if the men in blue want to regain credibility, they need their biggest shake-up in 13 years. Laverock&apos;s performance yesterday was entirely predictable. &apos;To hold others responsible for failure is a way of escaping one&apos;s own responsibility,&apos; the Sheikh once said. While senior Godolphin employees might find that comforting, Godolphin desperately need a plan that does not revolve solely around cheque-book capers.

Photograph: AFP/Getty When Frank Lloyd Wright persuaded Harold Price in 1952 that what he wanted for his HQ was not 25,000 sq ft on three floors but 57,000 sq ft on 19 floors, the consideration that swayed Price and gave us the Price Building in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, was that the three-storey solution was wasteful. As soon as Lloyd Wright showed him how the delivery of all basic services, power, climate control, plumbing, communications, was simpler and more efficient via a central stack, Price, whose business was delivery of oil and gas via pipelines, saw his point. For 25 years, ever since he entered a design of a tower cantilevered on four reinforced concrete piers for the St-Marks-in-the-Bouwerie project in New York, Wright had been longing to build his skyscraper. He saw it as a tree, with the floors hanging off the central core like branches; his version of the logarithmic spiral which underlies plant formation was the geometry of the rotated square that governs every structure within the building, for which Lloyd Wright designed every detail. The windows - or, more properly, glass walls - were tinted gold, shaded with 20in vertical copper louvres and separated by sheets of stamped copper. Now that the oxidised copper is the colour of old Chinese turquoise, the pert upright building glows like a jewel. On each floor are four lozenge-shaped apartments, except in the south-west quadrant which has its own entrance atrium and elevator, serving eight two-storey office complexes. As is traditional in vertical building, the top honcho lived on the top; the 19th floor was Harold Price&apos;s apartment with roof garden. Towers supply the most prestigious accommodation in the world. People who could live anywhere they choose queue up to buy apartments in the towers that are springing up in every great metropolis. An apartment in the 54-storey Trump World Tower in United Nations Plaza in New York will set you back anything from $7m to $15m and rising. A private spa and health club, a 60ft swimming pool, a gourmet restaurant, a wine cellar, everything you might expect in a luxury hotel, is only an elevator ride away, plus utterly spectacular views of Manhattan in what is still one of the most exciting cityscapes anywhere on earth. In Chicago, towers are being added to towers. At least three new towers are scheduled to open in 2009, the Trump International Hotel and Tower on Wabash, the Mandarin Oriental Tower on the edge of Millennium Park, and the fabulously twirling Chicago Spire on Lake Shore Drive. Internationally known architects are falling over themselves to build fantastic towers in Dubai. Accommodation in all of them will be sold off-plan long before the buildings are completed. At 221ft, Wright&apos;s skyscraper is just a baby; Burj Dubai currently stands at 1,650 ft (and is expected to surpass the 2,300ft mark when completed). Other Dubai towers twist and bend; another is veiled in rippling sheets of glass; another hides within a pierced screen that creates cooling breezes. Add the word &quot;block&quot; to the word &quot;tower&quot; and you get squalor. Architecturally, the block is usually a stack of undersized boxes, built cheaply but not economically, poorly finished, connected by dangerous and insalubrious public spaces. The concept is mean and the result is meaner. Because of the utter failure of high-rise accommodation in Britain, anyone who suggests, as I did in a recent BBC TV programme, that we will have to stop building out from our towns and cities and start building up, will be reviled as cruel and unimaginative. What would be cruel and unimaginative would be to build hundreds of thousands of &quot;affordable&quot; houses round thousands of cul-de-sacs barely big enough to accommodate the cars that will be parked there every night and all weekend, with no infrastructure, no schools, no shops, no health care facilties, no sports grounds - and poor drainage. In a rational housing policy, higher density should mean better facilities, because delivery would be so much more efficient. Following Lloyd Wright&apos;s basic concept of the tree/house, we begin with the tap root that anchors the structure to the earth; this can be used for geothermal heating, hugely reducing the building&apos;s carbon footprint as well as the cost of living in it. The height of the building stands in direct relation to the depth of its tap root, at a ratio of about 10:1. The building could be covered with photovoltaic cells that provide more than sufficient power for all the residents&apos; needs, the surplus of which, fed back into the grid, would provide income for essential maintenance. Recycling via chutes leading to collection sites would be a doddle rather than the logistical nightmare it is at present. Ground-floor living is directly responsible for the fact that Britain has the highest rate of burglary in Europe. The tower concept can deliver efficient security via a number of systems, including concierges and private lifts. The downsides - ie that you can&apos;t have a dog or a cat - are upsides for the environment. With joined-up thinking, residents would not need cars, because the complex would be served by buses and cycleways. You could build your tower in a flood zone, without disrupting the local hydrology. Inside the tower, rather than having nothing, you could have everything: gym, beauty parlour, family restaurant, cinema, disco, support for older residents, disabled people and single mums, whatever.

Frankie Dettori, who rides Ramonti in today&apos;s Group One feature, will need no reminding that Archipenko was one of two O&apos;Brien runners who slowed the pace down in the Coral-Eclipse Stakes. Designed to aid George Washington&apos;s cause, the tactics certainly did not improve Dettori&apos;s chance on Authorized at Sandown. Just what team Coolmore has in mind today we are unlikely to find out until the stalls open. But they are no doubt mindful of the fact that Dettori dictated matters from the front when winning the Queen Anne Stakes on Ramonti, who rallied gamely to deny Jeremy by a short head. In the preceding race at Royal Ascot, Excellent Art (3.30) completed a 1-2-3 for O&apos;Brien in the St James&apos;s Palace Stakes. The gaps came for jockey Jamie Spencer that day and Excellent Art readily made up for his unlucky defeat when fourth in the French 2,000 Guineas. Spencer&apos;s exaggerated waiting tactics could spell disaster at Goodwood, where there is often crowding in the closing stages. But with only eight runners, the same as at Ascot last time, Spencer will surely not try to be too clever. O&apos;Brien has landed the Sussex Stakes twice with three-year-olds in the last seven years and both had also won the St James&apos;s Palace. Asiatic Boy, unbeaten in four races on dirt at the Dubai Carnival, has not raced on turf since last year in his native Argentina. He will be a serious threat if he adapts to this vastly different test but 7-2 does not look a big enough price to justify even a speculative wager. Godolphin may come off second best against Coolmore in the Sussex, but the boot should be on the other foot in the Veuve Clicquot Vintage Stakes.

Raffaas, Man Of Vision and Malt Or Mash (4.05) are on the shortlist, with the last-named preferred as the form of his course win in June has worked out well.

Except at Fusion, a boutique B&amp;B in Jumeirah. This patch of Dubai, popular with wealthy expats and locals, is all palatial pads and sprawling mansions. As I walked past a gigantic Hummer parked outside the house and opened the opaque gates to Fusion, I was suddenly a little apprehensive. The villa had been recommended to me merely as a bargain option and glam was not part of the plan.  Tiki torches glowed in the garden, a gaggle of people in what were surely ironic logo T-shirts laughed on the lawn and my initial reaction was one of distress. I wasn&apos;t dressed for this. In a city that&apos;s bustling with all manner of bars, clubs and parties, the hipsters can be hard to find. They&apos;re more likely to be spotted at a private view or a product launch than down the pub. But if I&apos;d known that they tended to congregate at Fusion, I might have made more of an effort with my hair.  House-shares are a way of life here and when South African couple Stacey and Peter van Rijn opened their villa up to paying guests in October, they took the concept of renting out the spare bedroom to its logical conclusion. The villa attracts the city&apos;s small-but-burgeoning cluster of design junkies, media types and fashion groupies, some of whom make it their short-term base in Dubai and stay for a couple of months.  Designed by Stacey, an architect, its high ceilings, white walls and features are straight from the pages of Wallpaper. Initially I was a little nervous that I might mess up the elegantly-draped fabrics or do something dreadful to the decadent chaise longues, but the vibe here is more Ibiza house party than pristine design hotel and, fortunately, a bit of boho with one&apos;s chic is encouraged.  Breakfast happens on an imposing table for 20 in the main area, the scene of dinner parties that go on till late and help-yourself muesli the next morning.  During the cooler months, you can walk to the public beach from the house \u2013 the pool is too small to do more than pose or paddle - although if you hang around the house it&apos;s plausible that you may find yourself doing breakfast smoothies with a copywriter just in from Shanghai or hiding in the air con with a fashion buyer from Paris.  More like a weekend at a trendy friend&apos;s house than a conventional place to stay, a visit to Fusion feels like an invite to Dubai&apos;s backstage party - the only tricky part has been getting on the guest list. Word of mouth has kept the villa full of visiting friends of the city&apos;s creative types.  Fortunately, Fusion 2, a sister property a few streets away from the original, has now joined the scene. Similarly slick, with geometric black leather sofas, an impressive sound system and retro pool table in the public areas, Fusion 2 is every bit as chic as its big brother. There are only eight rooms here, as opposed to 14 in the other villa, but all have flat screen TVs and WiFi, flattering lighting and brilliant beds \u2013 the mattress is perched high on a silver concrete stage in the centre of the room.  There&apos;s still work to be done at Fusion 2 (the pool has yet to be dug and final decor touches await) but such was the demand from regular guests, that the villa opened anyway. And while I now have my own place to call home here, I&apos;ll be checking in from time to time, just for the party invites.

Photograph: AFP/Getty It&apos;s big, brash and it&apos;s all about cash. Is there any stopping Dubai? The emirate may have a couple of newly-arrived boutique hotels on the scene, but these are very much out on a limb. Essentially Dubai is still all about trying to out do everything else on the planet. Vegas, once unrivalled as the world&apos;s most absurd place, needs to up its game if it wants to compete. Appearing in the desert soon: Dubai Mall, the world&apos;s largest shopping mall; the Burj Dubai, the world&apos;s tallest building; and Dubailand, the world&apos;s largest theme park. That&apos;s not forgetting the Palm project, containing man-made islands visible from the moon, and Dubai China Town, set to be the largest outside China, complete with its own Great Wall.  With oil supplies running low, Dubai has decided tourism is the way forward and it&apos;s clearly not doing things by halves. When oil revenues fell to only 3% of the national GDP in 2006, tourism stepped up to rake in 30%. In that year alone hotel and holiday apartments recorded 6.5 million guests, generating revenues in excess of \u00a31.52 billion.  So who are all these rooms actually appealing to? Certainly not all of us. As comedian Rory Bremner once said, if you intend to look for culture in Dubai &quot;you might as well go to Tibet in search of nightlife&quot;.  Brits are still one of the emirate&apos;s largest markets - the winter sun being the biggest draw, along with the manageable time difference (just four hours). It also has a prime geographical location, as a gateway between east and west, and has been repeatedly voted &apos;safest city in the world&apos; by Interpol. Plus, if you like shopping, you can find everything from cheap gold at the souks to a standard Billy bookcase from Ikea. There&apos;s even that well-known Arab institution that we know as Topshop.  Professor Rodney Wilson, an economist from Durham University&apos;s Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies department is optimistic about Dubai&apos;s future. &quot;There will be a slow down,&quot; he says, &quot;but the issue is timing. Dubai was largely unaffected by the dramatic crash in Gulf stock markets in 2006 and the real estate sector remains robust despite predictions of oversupply.&quot;  Emirates Airlines&apos; ever-expanding routes (daily non-stop flights from Newcastle upon Tyne start in September) are also working to boost hotel occupancy. And, even if fickle Brits tire of it, it is gaining legions of additional fans from Russia, Central Asia and India, whose growing middle classes are prime targets for shopping breaks. Professor Wilson cites a conflict between Iran and the US being the only threat on the horizon. &quot;Assuming this does not happen, the more natural, yet inevitable, business slowdown may not happen until 2012 or beyond.&quot; One thing is for certain, however: Dubai doesn&apos;t have its eye on the growing green travel market. Along with plans to air-condition the beaches, 2008 will see the opening of the world&apos;s largest airport - Dubai World Central International Airport, which will have a capacity of 120 million passengers a year.

So when the government confirmed last month its pledge to give every child the chance to learn how to cook, teachers at many schools were left wondering how exactly they would manage this without the kitchens or equipment to teach in. The scarcity of home economics resources are such that many pupils have been already been learning to cook in classes provided by universities and colleges. For the secondary school pupils who take part one such course, run by Thames Valley University, learning to cook can be a transformative experience. For 19-year-old undergraduate Lauren Sherbourne, who helps to teach the children, TVU&apos;s junior chefs&apos; academy unearthed a passion for cooking she was unaware of. &quot;I wanted to be an actress but I found I had so much more love of cooking. I loved the course. The staff were so friendly and you might do occasional cooking with your parents at home but here you get to do everything yourself,&quot; she said. &quot;You get to meet new people and friends and there&apos;s so much contact with the industry. It&apos;s so much fun. It&apos;s something to do with your Saturday morning rather than sitting in front of the TV.&quot; The culmination of the ten-week course sees pupils cooking a three-course meal in front of and for their parents. &quot;You really feel like you&apos;ve accomplished something,&quot; Lauren explained. &quot;You learn so much and your parents are so surprised at what you can produce.&quot; Lauren went from finding the course inspiring to helping teach it. After leaving school to do a Btec in hospitality management - the equivalent of three A-levels - she is now taking a degree in culinary arts management at TVU and helps teach children on the courses how to run a restaurant. She has just completed the first year of her degree, which has involved work experience in Coutts Bank&apos;s restaurant, chalets in Rome and Milan, a chateau in France and the Dubai Air Show. &quot;I wasn&apos;t that confident to begin with but now I can go into a restaurant full of people and go from table to table asking about how they find the food,&quot; she said. And the confidence Lauren built up in doing the course also helped her schoolwork. &quot;I found out that if I tried harder it showed. I was more confident in myself and knew that if I gave things a try and worked my hardest it would make a difference. &quot;If it wasn&apos;t for junior chefs&apos; academy I definitely wouldn&apos;t be here now. I&apos;d probably be in a Saturday job.&quot; Pupils on the latest TVU course certainly seem to have got more out of the experience than cooking skills alone. While the aim is partly to encourage them to consider going on to study at TVU, the classes boost children&apos;s confidence, motivation and even grades in other subjects. Ella Sweales is a 15-year-old from Uxbridge high, Hillingdon. &quot;I found it really good because my school doesn&apos;t do food technology. It&apos;s a really good opportunity and I&apos;ve learned a lot from it,&quot; she said. &quot;Going into a kitchen and seeing how things really are is totally different from at home. It&apos;s made me want to cook a lot more. We&apos;ve covered food hygiene and we get a nationally recognised qualification, which is good because it gives you a head start if you do want to go into hospitality. &quot;There are a couple of hours of theory each week and we&apos;ve learned a lot about how to cook food and the temperatures to kill bacteria.&quot; Ella was one of 15 pupils chosen from her school to do the course, but she says it should be an option for everyone. &quot;That would be really good. Lots of other people wanted to do the course,&quot; she said. Bradley Davis, a 15-year-old at Harlington community school, was a culinary novice but he says the course made him realise cooking &quot;wasn&apos;t as simple as going to a restaurant&quot; and he is now considering catering as a potential career. &quot;I wanted to learn how it&apos;s done and how hard it is and how long things take to cook. I didn&apos;t know some of this stuff - what you had to do to make things taste better and that you had to put chicken in for a certain amount of time. &quot;I learned to be confident and now I&apos;ll try different types of food. My mum won&apos;t always have to make it any more - I will,&quot; he said. Richard Broad, head of design and technology and subject leader for food at Harlington community school, has seen the improvements in children&apos;s performance in all aspects of their schoolwork. &quot;It brings them out of the classroom and gets them to work with professionals and their outlook changes. It extends what I tell them at school into the workplace and makes it more real for them, which makes them more positive about schoolwork in general,&quot; he said. &quot;The majority of students have had their minds changed about hospitality and catering. It used to be a something you would go into if you didn&apos;t have a lot of qualifications. But lots of them start full courses at TVU that wouldn&apos;t have necessarily gone to university or thought about catering as a career if it wasn&apos;t for these courses.&quot; Food lost its focus for a while, says Broad, but everyone needs to eat and children should be able to provide for themselves when they leave home. &quot;There needs to be more finance to support the curriculum as well but I understand why the government is coming from. It&apos;s a good idea they learn to look after themselves.&quot; David Foskett, head of TVU&apos;s hospitality school, helped found the scheme over a decade ago after he approached celebrity chef Brian Turner to back a project for secondary schools. He agreed and still hands out certificates at the end of the course. And the course has been replicated in 15 other colleges throughout the country. &quot;Lots of kids don&apos;t appreciate the link between diet and health,&quot; Prof Foskett explained. &quot;We&apos;ve missed out on a whole generation of parents that don&apos;t understand nutrition. We&apos;ve got to develop that food culture. &quot;What Jamie Oliver did in three weeks, we have been doing for 10 years. What he didn&apos;t do was highlight the strategy and that should be education. We&apos;ve gone from &apos;eat more&apos; to &apos;eat less&apos; since World War Two and we&apos;re an unhealthy and unfit nation. The government&apos;s moves to reintroduce cooking as an important part of the curriculum were welcome, Prof Foskett says, but it has to &quot;put money where its mouth is&quot;. &quot;Primary school equipment was sold off so a lot of schools don&apos;t have a cookery or home economics area. Civil servants come up with this paper but don&apos;t look at the costs.

Even Godolphin, through manager Simon Crisford, admitted at Goodwood that the last two years had been disappointing.

TEDDY&apos;S BOY WONDER SNAPPED UP  Word from Ireland suggests that Myboycharlie, a seven-length winner of The Curragh&apos;s Group Three Anglesey Stakes last month, is likely to be racing in new colours on his next start. Tommy Stack&apos;s charge, who relished the heavy ground on his latest outing, ran in the silks of a syndicate and is named after the son of part-owner Teddy Sheringham (right), the former England striker. However, Myboycharlie is likely to step up to Group One company on his next outing for one of Ireland&apos;s biggest owners. It is believed that the Danetime colt, who looks set to remain with Stack, has changed hands for a sum comfortably above the 54,000 guineas he cost as a yearling. BOOKIES&apos; PR HITS THE RAILS  Rising insurance premiums have been in the news and it is a subject that the PR man for one of the country&apos;s biggest bookmakers knows all about. The bookies&apos; rep sadly wrote his car off a few weeks ago when driving into a railway bridge near Salisbury, causing the track to be closed for a number of days. But the cost of his car was not the biggest concern to his insurance company, who were presented with a bill for \u00a32.8 million as a result of lost train services as well as repairs to the bridge. The unfortunate driver is, for some reason, finding it hard to find anybody willing to insure his new car. CRISFORD TO FLY OWN COLOURS Could Godolphin&apos;s racing manager Simon Crisford be about to become a leading owner himself? Crisford and his wife Karen have registered as owners with Weatherbys under the name of Moulton Stud. Their horses will race in colours of white with a pink hoop, which were previously registered to Godolphin. NEW FOOT AND MOUTH THREAT The outbreak of foot and mouth at Wanborough in Surrey has raised the spectre of a ban on racing similar to one that occurred in 2001 when the sport was closed down for several weeks and the Cheltenham Festival was lost. No racecourses are within the 10km surveillance zone that Defra has imposed around the infected premises. The nearest tracks are Sandown Park and Ascot, around 25km away. TOTE AD FEATURES RIVAL  A new Tote poster promoting pool betting at Glorious Goodwood raised an eyebrow or two during the week. An exultant punter, pictured clenching his fists in financial celebration, is none other than Mike Butlin, a manager who works for rival bookmaker Blue Square. MOORE&apos;S NOT YELLOW  A novel idea to promote the leading jockey prize at Festival meetings was snuffed out at Goodwood. Sponsors Turftrax announced that, in similar fashion to the yellow jersey worn by the leader of the Tour de France, the rider heading the week&apos;s standings, would wear a yellow armband. Sadly for Turftrax, the idea was given short shrift by Ryan Moore, who led from an early stage but refused to wear the armband. WHAT&apos;S IN A NAME? Cigalas was a most eyecatching seventh on his debut for Barry Hills at Goodwood on Tuesday.

There were even those who poured scorn on the suggestions that there was any reason to worry about the race at all. They were wrong, of course. Dylan Thomas&apos;s efficient victory did not prove the King George was in rude good health. It proved he was. It was not a reason to forget that the race is failing in its raison d&apos;etre, which is to test the three year olds against their elders. It did not nullify the disturbing fact that, if you discount Montjeu&apos;s exercise gallop in the 2000 Prix Foy, no King George winner this millennium has won again in 23 attempts. The status of races is not absolute or immutable. We tend to forget that. The English Classics are no longer the greatest races in the world. In fact they have been relegated almost to the status of trials. Of course, they remain among the most significant in the calendar, but not supremely important as they once were. Federico Tesio&apos;s famous assertion, uttered just after WWII, that the whole point of racing can be pared down to one piece of wood (&quot;the winning post at Epsom&quot;) and one question (&quot;which colt will pass it first in the Derby&quot;) looks very strange today, particularly as the names of such as Kris Kin, North Light and Motivator trip lightly off our tongues. This weekend, we have an American reminder of how the status of races changes. When the Arlington Million was first run 25 years ago, the concept of a $1m race dropped jaws. Now the calendar is full of races worth far more, many of them in countries whose racing we took no notice of, or didn&apos;t even exist, back in the days when the Million provided the model for the Breeders&apos; Cup. Few European fans will ever have heard of Japan&apos;s Arima Kinen, for example, or bothered much about the Sheema Classic in Dubai. Fewer still will know that the former is worth more than our two Guineas and Oaks combined; the latter more than the King George, the Coronation Cup and The Eclipse rolled into one. Except, of course, that they&apos;re not, or at least not for the time being. The value of races cannot be measured in prizemoney alone. Their true value has to include the added value victory conveys upon their winners. In this respect, our races still have an importance way out of proportion to the size of the winner&apos;s cheque. &quot;The way winning a Group One in this country increases a horse&apos;s value is just mind-boggling&quot; said South African Mike De Kock when explaining his decision to run Asiatic Boy in last week&apos;s Sussex Stakes for a relatively piffling \u00a3170,000 first prize, and then go on to attempt the admittedly much more valuable Juddmonte International, which in cash as well as real terms now overshadows the Arlington showpiece. In a way, our great races defy gravity. We can&apos;t afford the prizemoney offered by the sheikhs or by countries with tote monopolies because, for better or for worse (worse actually), we&apos;ve chosen to legalise bookmaking instead. So we&apos;re left in a death-defying balancing act, clutching the pole of international perception, because prizemoney does to some extent decide which horses are going to be attracted. The quality of horse attracted does eventually decide the status of the race, and the process of change can occur a bit more quickly than the movement of tectonic plates. Complacency is what we need to worry about. What the King George needs is a new sponsor and a concerted plan to re-attract the star three-year-olds. It wouldn&apos;t hurt if its winners started winning other races: the Arc, in particular. What the Million needs is just a few more million bucks.

It is an Alice in Wonderland world - except there are no white rabbits disappearing down holes, let alone being pulled from hats. In Washington, or at least in the White House, the official illusion, stoutly maintained, is that things are moving (if not surging) forward, that a process of achieving stability and benchmarks is in place, and that a military progress report - nothing more dramatic or cathartic - will be delivered to Congress next month. A similar hall-of-mirrors stance has been adopted by Britain&apos;s Gordon Brown government, not so different after all from its Blairite predecessors. Britain is, in fact, slowly edging towards the exit, come what may. But officially, the talk is of a calm, orderly and complete handover of southern provinces, including Basra, to Iraqi control some time this autumn. In both cases - the US and Britain - the unvarnished truth, vaguely perceived through mists of doublespeak, is somewhat less comfortable. US commander General David Petraeus, guardian of the Baghdad security plan, was asked to do the impossible - and no surprise (or disgrace), has found it impossible to do. Nineteen coalition troops have died in the first week of August, a sign of strengthening insurgent opposition. Showcase city Tal Afar, described as a success story for US forces, was blown up again on Monday; 28 people, including 19 children, were killed. Too often, improved security lasts as long as it takes for the Humvee to disappear round the corner. Back home, in Congress, Democrats and a growing number of ever more panicky Republicans, will return to Washington from their home states in September with a clear message from constituents ringing in their ears: time to quit. Petraeus&apos;s report is not a phase or a stage; it&apos;s a trigger, and the gun is pointed at George Bush&apos;s head. In Britain, too, when illusions and press releases are stripped away, what remains is a military convinced, from top to bottom, that it is no longer doing anything useful in Basra and the south - and might as well let the Iraqis get on with it. The army and the politicians know Afghanistan is, and always was, the more crucial post-9/11 challenge. They want to concentrate effort there. The public are mostly just fed up with being treated like fools. One sobering consideration underlies collapsing British illusions: London does not want the blame when the &quot;who lost Iraq?&quot; question is posed. It will tread slowly towards the Iraq door, if only to avoid being fingered when the post mortem begins in the US. When it hits full swing, the hunt for scapegoats for the Iraq war will be ruthless and fierce. In Baghdad, the illusionary, or delusionary, state of the political game grows ever more miasmic. Iraq&apos;s national unity government, as of yesterday, contains no Sunni parties - a debilitating gap that leaves Nouri al-Maliki&apos;s administration neither united, nor national. Iraq&apos;s parliament, the much-trumpeted achievement of George Bush&apos;s &quot;forward march of freedom&quot;, has mostly kept marching right out of Baghdad this summer, to Amman, Cairo, Dubai or London - a month-long holiday break that was the only thing on which the MPs could actually agree. More pressing matters - local elections, oil-sharing, reconciliation, constitutional reform - are on hold. Nor is there any credible prospect of progress when the MPs, sun-tanned and rested, return next month. Mr Maliki went to Turkey today for a state visit designed, in part, to persuade Ankara not to invade his country. His next stop, on Wednesday, is Tehran. Yet all the red carpets and honour guards in the world cannot wholly conceal the biggest illusion of all: Mr Maliki has no state to represent. Iraq was a British colonial invention and is now an American imperial idea - an aspiration unlikely to be fulfilled. Iraq existed, unsteadily, warts and all, under Saddam Hussein. But now it is disintegrating before our eyes. It may reconstitute itself in time. But the old construct is dead, destroyed by shock and awe and four years of mind-boggling Bushian incompetence.

Kevin Darley, who replaces Ryan on the British team, has been desperate to get back in,&quot; added Haggis. &quot;Jamie has an agreement to ride for James Fanshawe when he can, so he has to go to Newmarket.&quot; Moore, who was leading jockey at last year&apos;s Shergar Cup, is required by Sir Michael Stoute on Saturday. &quot;I was keen to ride at Ascot, but I&apos;m needed at Newmarket,&quot; said Moore yesterday. &quot;There&apos;s a Group race and I have some nice rides. &quot;Last year worked out fine, but there will always be clashes at this time of the year,&quot; added Moore. &quot;I&apos;m not sure there should be teams of riders anyway, we should be riding as individuals.&quot; It is the team aspect that Ascot is trying to sell, however, and they have hit on a winner by persuading top Australian rider Darren Beadman to join the party. Beadman, 42, will ride alongside fellow Aussie Hugh Bowman and Japan&apos;s Yutaka Take in the Rest of the World line-up. &quot;It will be a great experience for me to get over and ride there,&quot; Beadman told the Sydney Morning Herald before setting off for Ascot. &quot;I&apos;m really looking forward to it, it will be something different for me.&quot; Beadman&apos;s belated riding debut in Europe is something Bowman is looking forward to. &quot;He&apos;s a superstar at home,&quot; says the jockey who has ridden 31 winners in Britain since being attached to the Mick Channon stable this season. &quot;Darren&apos;s won everything in Australia, except the Caulfield Cup I believe. For me it&apos;s an honour to be invited to captain our team in the Shergar Cup.&quot; Beadman formed a strong alliance in the 90s with another Australian racing legend, the trainer Bart Cummings, and together they won two Melbourne Cups. But towards the end of 1997, Beadman suddenly quit the saddle to become a Baptist preacher, having converted to Christianity when his daughter was born deaf. Three years later, Beadman returned to race-riding and he has continued to churn out the winners. Last year he won the New South Wales Premiership title for the seventh time with a record 152 wins, and a month ago he passed that tally to set up an unassailable lead in the current championship. &quot;He&apos;s a brilliant jockey. He can hold his own with anyone in the world,&quot; says Johnny Murtagh, who would be making his fifth appearance in the Shergar Cup but for a commitment to ride in the Arlington Million on Saturday. Formerly contested by two teams of six riders, the Cup format has changed to four teams of three riders this year. &quot;I think that will make it better,&quot; says Murtagh. &quot;There will be a good bit of banter.

Photograph: Cambridge Jones/Getty Images News that Bobby Davro is to join the cast of EastEnders as a loveable rogue (is there any other kind?) should not be viewed with too much disdain. Granted, his heyday was in the mid-1980s, when wowed audiences with his impressions of the likes of Alex Higgins and Jonathan King, but he has some pedigree for joining BBC1&apos;s soap. He was, after all, in three episodes of Footballers&apos; Wives: Extra Time. While you wonder what he&apos;s been doing these last 20-odd years (filling his pockets with bread rolls at Variety Club lunches on which to later gnaw in his gloomy bedsit while dreaming of sunnier days? Or splitting his time gigging in Dubai and playing golf in Surrey?), consider the footsteps in which Bobby follows. He is not the first slightly irritating, jowly comedian-cum-entertainer to head soapward when the end of the pier began to look too precarious. EastEnders has been lacking a loveable rogue since Shane Richie&apos;s Alfie Moon departed while Coronation Street resuscitated Bradley Walsh&apos;s career to such a surprising extent, he imagined he could leave and get his own successful chat show. (Wrong!) Lest we forget, before he was a Walford stalwart, the lately late Mike Reid was a proper old-school stand-up. Barbara Windsor is, perhaps, the epitome of the magic of soap in rejuvenating one&apos;s career. Soaps, and continuing drama, have always provided fresh starts for those pursuing new directions. Such folks have a recognition factor with the audience and, initially at least, are cheap and grateful for the work. Emmerdale, for example, is home to Patrick Mower (Callan) and Linda Thorson (The Avengers) and will soon host &apos;Allo &apos;Allo&apos;s Yvette Carte-Blanche, actress Vicki Michelle. The Bill&apos;s DI Samantha Nixon is played by Lisa Maxwell, who starred with Abbott in his show and was often referred to, for her sins, as the female Les Dennis. Meanwhile, rarely a week goes by without Russ Abbott appearing in Casualty and the only reason Dustin Gee hasn&apos;t been seen in Holby City is that he&apos;s already dead. Not that that seems to stop some of its guest stars. Indeed, it can only be a matter of time until the Krankies pop up in Emmerdale as a couple with a secret past, most likely involving swinging.

For example in strip No1: &quot;The four-minute warning sounds. Gordon Brown appears on all television outlets to announce that Britain is under nuclear attack. You are the Jeff! Do you: a) Close your eyes and hope that when you open them again it will all have been a bad dream. b) Run up and down screaming and crying. c) Make passionate love to the person sitting next to you. d) Shuffle some papers, allow the flicker of a smile to play about your lips and then begin nonchalantly telling people how many times Shrewsbury have drawn away from home this season. That&apos;s what I was going to do. Unfortunately the prevailing opinion around my office was that this was &quot;stretching an idea based on a weak pun too far even for a man of your experience&quot;. Disappointing, I know. But I have found that it always pays to listen to the voices in your head. So, instead of &quot;You Are The Jeff!&quot; I will focus on Rhain Davis. While much of Britain was hyperventilating over the YouTube clips of this nine-year-old Manchester United star, some of us were thinking of Mardy Fish. Back in the 80s Fish was hailed as the world&apos;s best two-year-old tennis player after film of him hitting a ball over the net from the baseline was aired on a Minneapolis TV station. Mardy Fish is still hitting tennis balls, of course. These days he hovers around 30th place in the ATP rankings and, aside from having the oddest name in top class sport since swimmer Misty Hyman hung up her goggles (I&apos;m discounting current Slovenian basketball ace Gregor Fucka on grounds of taste), is probably best known in this country because at some point in the Wimbledon build-up a pundit is contractually obliged to state that &quot;Mardy Fish has the game which on his day means he might, just might, unsettle Roger Federer&quot;. By bringing up Fish I&apos;m not trying to rain on Rhain&apos;s parade. However, it needs to be pointed out that being a child prodigy is a short career - one that can be ended at any moment by injury, loss of confidence or pubic hair. Naturally this has not deterred football clubs from following United&apos;s lead in a quest for tiny talent and a lot of free publicity which is bound to increase brand recognition in the lucrative Far East market (as they used to say in Roy of the Rovers). On Monday, for example, Chelsea announced they were signing 26-month-old Gillingham wunderkind, Toby Weams. Described as &quot;the Maradona of the Medway&quot; by his gran, Weams was spotted by Blues&apos; scouts in a local supermarket. &quot;He went down holding his head after an innocuous challenge from his mum,&quot; recalled one passer-by who saw the youngster&apos;s breathtaking soccer skills first hand. &quot;Then he writhed about in agony so convincingly that despite her protesting &apos;I just told him to put the Kinder Egg back on the shelf where he got it, honest&apos;, staff called police and social services.&quot; Another witness commented: &quot;He is only a kid, but I have to say Weamsie&apos;s obnoxious histrionics put me in mind of Pippo Inzaghi in his melodramatic pomp.&quot; &quot;We have seen the CCTV footage of this and other incidents,&quot; said Jose Mourinho, excitement raising an attractive glow on his stubbly cheeks, &quot;and I believe Wezzer has it all: the dives, the tantrums and the ability to work himself into a red-faced fury on the slightest pretext. For me this is all the attributes needed to succeed at the highest level, though obviously he is not yet as strong, quick or childish as an adult footballer.&quot; Already those smooth operators Jamie Redknapp and Tim Sherwood have moved to cash in on the trend for tweenies, launching a pre-school edition of their splendid magazine for professional footballers, Icon. Features in the first issue include DJ Spoony test driving the new H2 Hummer pedal car; Les Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs tasting some of the world&apos;s most expensive fizz (including the legendary 1963 Louis Roederer Cristal Irn Bru Premier Cru), Steve McManaman taking a saunter around the latest seven-star Dubai tree-house and Louise Redknapp&apos;s make-of the-month slot, which tells pro kidballers how to construct a fabulously blinging &quot;manbag&quot; using ordinary household items (a cornflake box, PVA glue, a roll of Louis Vuitton sticky-backed plastic and a handful of emeralds and pearls). Not everyone is pleased.

He is joined by Declan McDonogh and Kevin Manning, and it is the latter who may go away with the &quot;Silver Saddle&quot; as rider with most points. An 8-1 shot with Totesport to be top scorer, Manning has excellent prospects of picking up 30 points with victories on Genki and Golden Quest. Four teams of three jockeys contest the Shergar Cup - Ireland, Britain, Europe and the Rest of the World. Each jockey has five rides, with 15 points awarded for a win, 10 for second, seven for third, five for fourth and three for fifth place. With the exception of the Shergar Cup Challenge, which has attracted just 10 runners, reserves can be substituted up to 45 minutes before race time. Fortune can soon make his presence felt on Our Faye (1.45). All the Shergar Cup races are early-closing events, which means that Our Faye, although carrying a penalty, is 3lb better in today than in future handicaps. She is a much-improved filly this season and was particularly impressive when partnered by Fortune to the second of her three wins at Goodwood last month. They have all come over seven furlongs, but she should have the pace to cope with this furlong shorter trip. Dark Missile, winner of this race last year, looks Hayley Turner&apos;s best chance of success. She improved to win the Wokingham Handicap at the Royal meeting and it can pay to overlook her run on unsuitably soft ground at York next time. If all goes to plan, though, the Irish team will have put the competition to bed before the last race. Manning has a major chance in the Shergar Cup Sprint on Genki (2.20), whose trainer Roger Charlton won this with Move It four years ago. Genki was returning from a two-month absence when runner-up at Pontefract recently. A bit race-rusty there, he can regain the winning thread after showing improved form to beat Lipocco at Newmarket. Some dodgy customers, of the equine variety that is, contest the stayers&apos; race. Top Australian rider Darren Beadman will need to call on all his expertise to coax the best out of Odiham, who is a hard ride. Manning could be in pole position here again with the mount on Golden Quest (2.55). Hit by injury after winning at Glorious Goodwood two years ago, Mark Johnston&apos;s gelding may not be the force of old but he has dropped 10lb in the ratings since the start of the season and there was plenty of encouragement in his run behind Enjoy The Moment here last time. Declan McDonogh can keep the ball rolling for Ireland when he teams up with Kerriemuir Lass (3.30). Things didn&apos;t go right for Michael Jarvis&apos;s filly when she reverted to 10 furlongs at Newmarket last time, but she had looked to be progressing and this trip should be right up her street. Impressive Goodwood winner Coasting (1.10), the mount of Andreas Suborics for the Europe team, stands out in the opening race with just a 6lb penalty. Beadman&apos;s best chance of leaving a lasting impression on British racegoers may come in the finale, where the prolific Australian rider partners Pentecost (4.05). The chestnut certainly knows his way round here, having won this race in 2003 and 2004, and he looks to be running into form at the right time again.", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "title": "Horse racing: Irish team have whip hand in Shergar Cup", "sentences": ["Jimmy Fortune, who was top rider at Royal Ascot in June, can lead the three-man Irish team to victory in today&apos;s Dubai Duty Free Shergar Cup at the Berkshire course."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/aug/11/horseracing.sport", "publicationDate": "2007-08-10T23:44:06Z"}, {"article": "As the Summer of Love faded into winter, Jimi Hendrix released Axis Bold as Love in December 1967. One of the tracks on this treasured album, which ranges from the funky and ethereal to the moving and melancholic, is the soulful and sad &quot;Castles made of sand&quot;. Legend has it that Hendrix was inspired to write this meditative song by the beautiful Moorish forts in the sleepy and picturesque Moroccan port town of Essaouira which he, and before him Orson Welles, helped transform into a magnet for the hip and happening. Led Zeppelin were also drawn to Arab sounds and culture. And the infatuation was mutual. Even mainstream Arab musicians started to experiment with western guitar riffs and synthesised sounds. In the 1960s and 1970s, millions of young Arab men and women followed the currents of western fashion: the then rebellious Beatle&apos;s mop-tops (which earned them the Arabic epithet khanfis &quot;beetles&quot; from their bewildered elders), miniskirts, sleeveless dresses, long hippy hair, tight flairs, even tighter shirts with wings for collars. But why is it that now, in the 21st century, those early shoots seem to have failed to bloom? Part of the problem is that, as Hendrix would put it: &quot;castles made of sand fall in the sea, eventually&quot;. The sexual liberation of Arab youth has been held back mainly by the pincer movement of economics, family, religion and a post-colonial identity crisis. Lacking the affluence and democratic space of their western counterparts - and the discredited &quot;old world&quot; that was destroyed in the second world war - their rebellion against &quot;the system&quot; was often half-hearted. Contrary to popular belief, perhaps the most feared institution in the Arab world is not the state, but the family. Although the most progressive end of the spectrum is open-minded and gives the young the room to be what they want, millions of Arabs live in both terror and respect of their family. At university in Cairo, the liberal circles I socialised with went to discos, parties, rock concerts and bars, and many had an open-minded attitude to sex and drugs. But most of them hid it from their parents - and their families pretended not to know what they were up to - leading to a dual existence. The side effect is that, rather than taking pride in their permissive lifestyle, many young Arabs feel an underlying sense of shame; that what they do is ultimately wrong. It also encourages social hypocrisy and dishonesty - &quot;do what you want but don&apos;t openly question the system&quot; is the general attitude. And that is also why rebellious youth too often grow up into a conventional adulthood, perpetuating the same silly values and contradictions. Personally, I - and some close friends - have tried to &quot;live&quot; our liberal values. For instance, when I wanted to live with my girlfriend in Cairo, I refused to engage in the sham that others agree to and pretend to be married. And even in liberal Lebanon old attitudes seem to die hard. In Hekeh Niswan (Women&apos;s Talk) - the Lebanese version of The Vagina Monologues, one of the characters complains that: &quot;Men here look at everything that&apos;s female, no matter what she looks like or what she&apos;s wearing. They all want to stop for a woman waiting for the bus or the taxi to see if maybe she&apos;ll ride with them. Sometimes I feel like I&apos;m all just breasts and a ...&quot; A bewildered Arab female blogger asks: &quot;If men are so weak in the sexual area and so easily swayed by the sight of an ankle or a bit of hair or the view of some diffused body contour ... would it not be simpler and more Islamic for the men to stay at home and cover their eyes and faces?&quot; The souring of the Arab secular experiment did not help matters. Despite massive strides towards personal liberation in the 1950s and 1960s, Arab secular regimes were tough on dissent and clamped down on the opposition. After the disastrous 1967 defeat, the Islamist counterculture came out from the wings and, with the confidence that comes with having God on their side, began to push the secularists more and more underground. In Egypt, the economic excesses, inequality and corruption of the 1970s, gave the Islamic current even more support. But the progressives never went away - they just became more sidelined and cowed. However, a few brave voices kept the flame going, such as the filmmakers Muhammad Khan and Yousry Nasrallah in Egypt, Moufida Tlatli in Tunisia and Ousama Muhammad in Syria, to mention a few. And sex has increasingly become a political weapon. While the relationship between the west and the Arab world in the post-colonial era has long been an uncomfortable one, in recent years the quest for Arab pride has moved from emulation of the west to opposition of it. And one major battlefield is sexuality. This politicising of sex (or the absence of it) has long struck me as weird. For some reason, conservatives have singled out sexual permissiveness as one of the most devastating weapons of mass destruction. This &quot;decadence&quot; has been blamed for everything from military defeat to poverty and scientific backwardness. Only this week, Jordanian Islamists were up in arms at the government&apos;s decision finally to ratify the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. &quot;This is a US-Zionist effort ... to strip the nation of its &apos;aqidah&apos; (creed/faith) and culture, and to destroy the Muslim family,&quot; railed Zayd el-Kelani, who heads the Islamic Labour Front, according to the daily al-Quds al-Araby. I hate to burst el-Kelani&apos;s righteous bubble, but the US itself almost did not ratify the treaty because of opposition by the Christian right who feared that the convention would &quot;legalise prostitution and open the door for the homosexual agenda&quot;. &quot;The key, perhaps, to our social liberation is liberation from historical circumstances first. The post-colonial scapegoat is timeless in Arab society,&quot; one Lebanese student wrote for a university paper. Some people see the forces of sexual tolerance regrouping in the form of a number of taboo-breaking books and films, such as the Yacoubian Building in Egypt, as well as others in Tunisia, Morocco and Lebanon. Even ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia has not been spared. &quot;There has been a recent spate of Saudi novels discussing sexual issues, which is understandable given the context of gender segregation and tight social controls in an ultra-conservative society like that of Saudi Arabia,&quot; Andrew Hammond, author of Popular Culture in the Arab World, told me. Opinion is divided over whether Lebanon&apos;s export of scantily clad pop divas that dominate Arab satellite TV, such as Haifa, and more conservative Egypt&apos;s own &apos;Ruby revolution&apos;, is a sign of changing sexual attitudes among the young or whether it is a form of visual steam control. &quot;The pattern in general is of creating &apos;bubbles&apos; of sexual liberation or freedom, such as Dubai, Egypt&apos;s Sharm el-Sheikh, Tunisia&apos;s Hammamat, Lebanon,&quot; Hammond notes. &quot;I think the lines are now drawn. Islamists have pushed back the tide as much as they can. It will be perhaps years before one side recedes or pushes further the boundaries.&quot; But where emulation of the west failed to bring about sexual liberation, a more Islamic path shows promise of perhaps reaching the same outcome eventually. Islam has traditionally been open to the recreational aspects of sex and a quiet, sexual revolution in Islamic garb may be occurring, fuelled partly by economic necessity. Egypt has been hit by a tidal wave of &quot;urfi&quot; or informal marriages, often entered into between boyfriends and girlfriends to give their sexual relationships a sheen of legitimacy. There has also been the gradual emergence or re-emergence of temporary marriages. The Shia&apos;a have mut&apos;a, a time-limited marriage contract, and zawaj al-misyar (&apos;marriage in transit&apos;) is emerging in some Sunni countries, including Saudi Arabia. Sexual liberation has failed to make it through the front door but it could still find a back way in.

To address the problem, artists are being offered a unique way to save for their retirement - instead of stumping up cash payments each month, members hand over a less humdrum commodity: their art. Members of the Artist Pension Trust (APT) give up 20 artworks over a 20-year period, each of which is held in storage until the trust identifies the most profitable time to sell them. Following a sale, 40 per cent of the proceeds goes back to the artist - minus any local income tax - with 32 per cent going to a &apos;pool&apos; of 249 other APT members. The other 28 per cent goes to the company for storage costs and, of course, to provide its profit. The Artist Pension Trust is neither a pension nor an investment trust, but it offers young and mid-career artists access to a retirement fund, to which - because of erratic earnings - they might otherwise find it difficult to contribute. One of the advantages of the scheme is that - because members receive a share of the sale of others&apos; work - it can partially protect artists should the value of their own work plummet. APT boss Bijan Khezri says artists participate for many reasons. &apos;One is that they say &quot;You know what, I got completely screwed - I never put any of my artworks aside&quot;.&apos; Other reasons for joining include gaining access to an art investment portfolio and gaining publicity through dedicated APT art shows. The disadvantages are that it is entirely pinned to the contemporary art market and that - because it is not regulated by the Financial Services Authority or any other body - there is little protection should APT go bankrupt. Artists do not benefit from any of the tax breaks associated with pensions either. Independent financial advisers urge caution before joining the scheme. &apos;I don&apos;t think it should replace good old diversified retirement planning, not necessarily just using pensions, but using investments that will allow flexibility,&apos; says Anna Bowes, investments manager at AWD Chase de Vere. Justin Modray of Bestinvest reckons there is little incentive to join the scheme because one &apos;may end up subsidising other less successful artists in the trust&apos;. Nevertheless, APT has 700 members in seven global hubs, including London, New York and Berlin, each with a regional focus. An operation in Dubai - something of an upstart in the art world - will launch in September or October. Each global hub will aim to attract 250 artists before closing to new members. New York currently has 170 and should close in early 2009; 100 artists have signed up to the British group. No artworks have been sold to date: the trust waits until each hub closes and says that, after that, it may be another 20 years before a particular work is sold. Members of the London group include Nathan Coley and Mike Nelson, two of the four artists shortlisted for this year&apos;s Turner Prize. The company has about 1,500 works of art in storage which, claims Khezri, represents the world&apos;s largest and fastest-growing collection of young emerging art. &apos;We&apos;re collecting, on average, two to three artworks a day,&apos; he says. And it doesn&apos;t end there - the company intends to start offering artists loans that would be secured by a pool of artists&apos; work. &apos;We have received a number of offers from banks for the financing and the structuring of the business [to offer loans],&apos; says Khezri. &apos;The secured lending business in the art world - using contemporary art as a security - is going to be one of the most dramatically growing banking markets.&apos;", "tags": ["Money"], "title": "'Penniless' artists pool work to pay for their pensions", "sentences": ["An operation in Dubai - something of an upstart in the art world - will launch in September or October."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/aug/12/4", "publicationDate": "2007-08-12T22:35:45Z"}, {"article": "How much do you love your football team? If you are not &apos;lucky&apos; enough to support Manchester United or Chelsea, what would you sacrifice to have a fraction of their success? It is this Faustian dilemma that may have been preoccupying the long-suffering fans of Manchester City since their club was sold to Thaksin Shinawatra, the deposed Prime Minister of Thailand, for \u00a381.6m in early July. Thaksin, who has been compared in his homeland with Hitler, Pol Pot and Aids, has received a wary but convivial reception in the blue half of Manchester. As City began the season against West Ham yesterday with a 2-0 win and with Sven-Goran Eriksson in charge of a scarcely recognisable team of new Spanish, Italian and Brazilian players, there was even guarded talk among the fans of a first trophy for the club in 32 years. Mohamed al Fayed bought Fulham in 1997, but the foreign ownership of Premier League clubs really kicked off when Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea for \u00a3150m in June 2003. Now nine out of 20 clubs in the division are foreign-owned and it is likely that more (perhaps Arsenal or Everton) will be sold during the next year. In some respects, Thaksin, who was overthrown by the Council for National Security (CNS) military junta in a bloodless coup last September, is a natural addition to these ranks. A charismatic individual and natural self-publicist, he is sure to enjoy the prestige of club ownership, a must-have for any self-respecting itinerant billionaire these days. Even with assets of almost \u00a31bn frozen in Thailand, he is said to enjoy a flamboyant lifestyle in England, where he now lives in exile with his wife and three grown-up children. His main residence is a five-bedroom, \u00a34.5m mansion in Weybridge, Surrey, and he also has a serviced apartment in central London, where he answers to &apos;Your Excellency&apos;. He eats at ritzy restaurants such as Royal China and Patara and maintains a &apos;not too short&apos; hairstyle at Toni &amp; Guy. One of his favourite activities is karaoke, which he does with Sarunrat Visutthithada, better known as Lydia, so-called queen of Thai R&amp;B. In other ways, the emergence of Thaksin is an astonishing and, some would say, landmark development. Human-rights organisations are incredulous that he has passed the Premier League&apos;s fit and proper persons test (although the Premier League points out that he has not been convicted of anything) - Thaksin is due in court next week in Bangkok to answer charges of abusing his position to boost his family&apos;s financial interests. To many, the way he has been embraced is evidence that England&apos;s national game has sold its soul. &apos;The Football Association&apos;s failure to investigate properly the background of the foreign nationals buying top clubs or their growing influence on the sport heralds the end of the Premier League as an English institution,&apos; wrote Tom Bower in the August issue of The Observer Sport Monthly However, while there has been some criticism of Thaksin in the press, notably from Manchester City fans such as Simon Hattenstone in the Guardian and Bill Borrows in the September issue of Esquire, there has been nothing approaching the outpouring of anguish and violence that accompanied the sale of Manchester United to Malcolm Glazer in 2005. Borrows may not be renewing his season ticket after more than three decades of loyal support, but the reality is that the majority of the club&apos;s supporters are more sanguine, even adopting a cute nickname for their new owner, &apos;Frank&apos; Shinawatra (it&apos;s pronounced &apos;Chin-a-wat&apos;, but never mind). If the comments on the Manchester Evening News message board are representative, 90 per cent of fans are behind Thaksin and most are more concerned about goalkeeping cover for the new season than the government-endorsed &apos;war on drugs&apos; that saw in excess of 2,275 people killed in Thailand during a three-month period in 2003. &apos;Life being a City fan does not get better than this,&apos; says Stretfordblue; &apos;So far, it&apos;s all a bit of a fairytale,&apos; says another post. A rare dissenting voice comes from someone who signs off as Erik Young, UN Human Rights Ambassador: &apos;Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s other name is not Frank Sinatra, it is Satan. In fact, Shinawatra was born on 26 July. That was the same day Satan disappeared from Hell. Nostradamus predicted he would appear somewhere around southern China.&apos; In the current climate, though, such criticism receives short shrift. &apos;Billy no mates, do one,&apos; replies the next post. There is something idiosyncratic, almost wilful, about the supporters of Manchester City. The old joke is that City fans come from Manchester and United fans are from Dubai, but it goes deeper than that. &apos;City supporters are perversely loyal,&apos; says Bill Borrows. &apos;One year, after we&apos;d been relegated, the average attendance actually increased. The further we got away from the dishonesty at the top, the more fans were attracted back to the purity of the beautiful game.&apos; Many supporters see themselves as the absolute counterpoint to one of the most successful clubs in the world, just across the city. When Nick Leeson went to prison for losing \u00a3827m, he wore a Manchester City shirt. As he said at the time: &apos;To declare oneself a Blue seemed rather to take the edge off [the crime].&apos; It is not hard to see what attracted Thaksin, a serial entrepreneur before entering politics in the mid-Nineties, to English football. The Premier League is an astute and lucrative investment - as a guideline, Abramovich&apos;s original stake in Chelsea is now worth more than \u00a3500m - and after unsuccessful negotiations for Fulham and Liverpool, the 58-year-old Thai turned his attention to City. The club has the 17th highest income in world football, according to accountancy firm Deloitte, but - all their fans agree - was in a wretched position, stagnant with chronic debt, when he stepped in. A further incentive for Thaksin would have been the profile that his new post would give him. Although the former Prime Minister has announced his retirement from politics, he never says it with much conviction. The CNS claims he is desperate to stay in the spotlight in Thailand, where many worship English football like a second religion. While it is difficult to ascertain Thaksin&apos;s affection for football (officially his game is golf - he is the president of the Thailand PGA), it&apos;s easy to imagine him soaking up the adoration he will receive at the City of Manchester Stadium when United visit next Sunday. He has set out a three-year plan for his new club: a top-10 finish this season, qualification for Europe in the second year and silverware by 2010. It seems reasonable, even sensible, coming from a man whose personal motto is: better to die than live like a loser. &apos;To those people who say that I will not be here for a long time,&apos; Thaksin counters, &apos;I say that I have been joking to my friends that we have a 250-year contract for the stadium and no one should bother negotiating an extension because I will do it in my next life.&apos; Manchester City fans may be reassured by Thaksin&apos;s long-term commitment, but for many others, his involvement fatally compromises the sport and pushes the Premier League ever closer to implosion - the decline of Leeds United magnified on an unprecedented scale. However, there are several inconsistencies with this interpretation, not least Thaksin&apos;s role within it. The fact is that Thaksin&apos;s tenure as Prime Minister of Thailand was one of the most prosperous in the country&apos;s history and he still casts a long shadow over a nation where democracy is yet to be restored. More than 200,000 citizens attend pro-Thaksin rallies and if elections were held today, he would be a strong favourite, courtesy of loyal support from farmers in the north. Despite his absence from the country, the CNS has been unable to entirely tarnish the former leader&apos;s reputation and Tuesday&apos;s court case is primarily procedural, like trying Al Capone for income-tax evasion, you might say. Even the claims from human-rights organisations regarding his violent treatment of drug traffickers have not been officially sanctioned. Thaksin may be controversial, but he is certainly not the only dubious individual running a Premier League club. And, as for football in England, it will continue being in crisis - that is, stratospherically profitable, envied around the globe and featuring many of the world&apos;s finest players in state-of-the-art stadiums. The reality is that the majority of football fans are desperate for the club they love to be bought by an international tycoon with millions to spend on flashy players and facilities. They don&apos;t particularly care where that money comes from and, in a sense, why should they? Everyone else is doing it and, besides, regulation should be the jurisdiction of the FA and the government (a responsibility that both seem keen to duck at the moment). If City win the Manchester derby next weekend, you will certainly hear little criticism of &apos;Frank&apos; from the fans. You can almost hear the singing now: &apos;Regrets? I&apos;ve had a few ...&apos;  The Thaksin lowdown Born 26 July 1949 in Chiang Mai, Thailand, to a wealthy family. After leaving school, Thaksin joined the police before resuming studies in the US.

Which of the two is right? It is always possible that Bonham Carter was merely putting on a show of calm - though in that case he is even better at acting than his sister Helena - and he does have a vested interest in talking down the panic. Even so, my bet is that his steely-nerved response will turn out to be the correct one. That is not to say that the volatility is trivial or that it will be over soon. We can expect it to continue for several months and that the casualties will mount up on top of those that have already come to light, including the closure of three hedge funds by BNP Paribas, one of the triggers for last week&apos;s crisis. There will be more unpleasant news from banks and hedge fund managers, whose shares were marked down severely, as they work out their losses. Private equity deals are being put on ice and corporate takeover bids are likely to be in jeopardy, not least the battle between Barclays and a trio of banks led by Royal Bank of Scotland to buy Netherlands institution ABN Amro. Barclays, whose share price dropped more than 6 per cent on Friday, denies it is planning to walk away from the deal, and hopes to receive approval for its approach from Dutch regulators this week. But its chances of success are looking slimmer and its executives are well aware that market conditions would provide a perfect fig leaf for their pride were they to ditch the bid. Sir Fred Goodwin at RBS was also putting on a brave face at his shareholder meeting, but his partner, Fortis, which has to raise a mammoth \u20ac13bn in a rights issue, is clearly a weak link. The Qatari bid for J Sainsbury is another that could be undermined by rising debt costs. In neither case, however, would that necessarily be a bad thing. For Barclays, which has made huge concessions to try to bag ABN Amro, failure might turn out to be a merciful release and the Qatari offer for Sainsbury had too many unknowns even before the current crisis of confidence.

The impact will be felt on direct share holdings and unit and investment trusts; there may also be knock-on effects in the UK housing market as banks tighten credit conditions, making it more expensive to borrow. Despite the frightening behaviour of the bond and stock markets, the world economy is in reasonably good shape and so far the financial problems in the US have not turned into a full blown social and political crisis. Most companies have not over-borrowed and can be comforted by strong balance sheets. It could turn into a real economy crisis if a big bank were to go under but the sector has turned in strong profits and there is little sign of that happening at this point. Private investors would be well advised to sit on the sidelines for a while. Historically, however, it has made sense to buy assets when the balance of emotion tips from greed to fear and veterans such as the Sage of Omaha, Warren Buffett, are doing precisely that. Trading places won&apos;t solve statistics riddle It&apos;s fan charts at dawn. Mervyn King, the Bank of England governor, is concerned that the quality of economic figures might suffer because of Treasury plans to relocate the Office for National Statistics from London to Newport in Wales. Moving civil servants out of London to save cash is a worthy aim, but most of the boffins in the ONS are reluctant to leave the capital. They could easily get jobs in the City, rather than decamp to Wales; the National Statistician, Karen Dunnell, reckons only about 15 per cent of her staff will move. With his latest inflation report, King made the unprecedented move of presenting the Bank&apos;s own estimates of economic growth as well as the official figures, which looked like a pointed suggestion he has little faith in the ONS version. King is right to be worried about the integrity of our national statistics. Accurate and unbiased numbers are vital for steering the economy, for public trust and as a check on politicians. It may look cheaper to run the ONS from Newport, but if it compromises the quality of key statistics, then the move does not add up. Furse&apos;s Italian campaign defeats critics Clara Furse&apos;s shopping trip to Milan has proved a great success. Her purchase of the Italian stock exchange creates a \u00a34bn group and will push the London Stock Exchange, which she heads, into the FTSE 100 index of leading shares. The deal brings big opportunities as the Italian stock market is under-developed in comparison with its European counterparts. Despite Italy being a very entrepreneurial nation, the market value of companies listed on the Borsa Italiana is equivalent to 55 per cent of GDP, compared with a European average of 106 per cent and 160 per cent in the UK. It means there is plenty of scope for share floats as the equity culture gains traction. It is also one in the eye for Bob Greifeld, chief executive of US market Nasdaq. He is sitting on a 30 per cent stake in the LSE, the legacy of a failed bid this year. He only grudgingly gave his support to the Italian merger - which will dilute his holding to 22 per cent. To make matters worse, his attempt to take over the OMX Nordic stock exchange is under threat from a rival bid due this week from Bourse Dubai. While Greifeld&apos;s grip on his job looks less than vice-like, Furse has silenced her critics. Those who argued the LSE&apos;s share price would collapse were wrong; it is well above Nasdaq&apos;s \u00a312.43-a-share offer, despite the turmoil. Far from being in a strategic cul-de-sac, as Greifeld claimed, Furse may turn her attention to a deal with the Spanish, Swiss or Greek exchanges. When many UK firms are succumbing to the advances of foreign predators, she has seen off a string of overseas bidders. Although she would hate to be seen as a &apos;woman boss&apos; her performance is also proof positive that female execs can do as well, if not better, than the men.", "tags": ["Business"], "title": "Ruth Sunderland: Investors need steel nerves or brass necks", "sentences": ["To make matters worse, his attempt to take over the OMX Nordic stock exchange is under threat from a rival bid due this week from Bourse Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/12/1", "publicationDate": "2007-08-12T22:38:42Z"}, {"article": "The Dubai stock exchange is expected to table a formal takeover bid this week for the Nordic exchange OMX.

Failure of the Scandinavian deal would be a double blow for Greifeld, who saw an attempt to take over the London Stock Exchange collapse earlier this year.

On one side, greens and bunkers. On the other, big new buildings coated in glass and occupied by IBM, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs. &quot;I always take my foreign clients here,&quot; Pai said, &quot;and ask them to tell me which famous author stood almost in the same position.&quot; Many people have no difficulty. The answer is Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist and author of The World is Flat, and this is the setting of his book&apos;s first sentence, when Friedman is about to swing from the first tee and his partner tells him: &quot;Aim at either Microsoft or IBM.&quot; As a first sentence it hardly ranks with &quot;The past is a foreign country ...&quot;, but Friedman&apos;s book, the world&apos;s most popular gospel of globalisation, has sold 3m copies. It takes its several heroes from the IT business; one of them is Nandan Nilekani, co-chairman of the Indian software company Infosys, who gets the credit for inspiring the title by insisting to Friedman in 2004: &quot;Tom, the playing field is being levelled.&quot; But you might say that its real hero is Bangalore, or Bangalore as Friedman sees it: the leading example of how a city populated by clever, ambitious, English-speaking technicians in what is still known as the developing world can use the tools of the new information age to abolish geography - to undercut European and American costs so much, with no (or better) effect on quality, that it destroys the historic advantages of adjacency, when the counting house was best placed next to the warehouse and the warehouse next to the factory. The 600 pages of Friedman&apos;s book radiate a gung-ho optimism, and perhaps for that reason it is more widely read in India, a country that for most of the 20th century suffered the pessimistic prognoses of the outside world, than in Britain. To look for a British equivalent you might have to go back to Samuel Smiles and his Victorian testaments to hard work and self-help and his glorification of the great engineers. As I went around Bangalore this month I often thought of Smiles and the first industrial revolution - of its ruthlessness and chaos, its model factories and choked sewers, its slums and philanthropists, yet running through its new kind of people, freshly urbanised and adapting to the factory clock, the thread of a belief that they were at the centre of a new kind of world. Arun Pai, my guide that morning, is an example of this new kind of person, or new at least in India. Inspired by the walking tours of London, he created a small company, bangalorewalks.com, and every Sunday he leads groups of people through the history of the city as manifested in its monuments, churches, parks and barracks. At this, he is quite brilliant; from plain and obscure objects he can draw stories that take you to Napoleon and the conquest of Everest. To listen to him, Bangalore has been affecting the course of global history ever since Lord Cornwallis took it from Tipu Sultan in 1791. But walking tours aren&apos;t how Pai makes his real money. That comes when a software company, usually American, asks him to introduce one of its newly arrived executives to India: the bewildering totality of it. Pai has a one-day course. He takes them in his car to the famous Friedman site, to the ancient Hindu temple behind the new Marks &amp; Spencer&apos;s, to the new suburbs and shopping malls. He may recall a few recent cultural references, such as the American passive verb, to be &quot;Bangalored&quot;, meaning to lose one&apos;s job to cheaper competition overseas. He can do Hinduism in five minutes. Most of the questions are about cows, but beggars and caste are also popular topics. He has persuasive answers for the innocent from Kansas, and to demonstrate and sharpen his skills he asked me to ask him any question at all about noticeable aspects of India. I asked why it was that Indian advertising never depicted any human being with a skin shade darker than olive, when so many of the population, especially in the south, were by no means so light. Pai said that it was just a local edition of a universal fact: the enduring appeal of whiteness. But he agreed that this answer might not satisfy an American executive who happened to be black, or indeed anyone from a society that has adjusted to multiculturalism in way that India, for all its divisions of religion, language and caste, has not. Later that Sunday morning, Pai took a group of us along the city&apos;s main thoroughfare, MG (Mahatma Gandhi) Road, in search of bungalows. The Victorian bungalow and its shady garden were once the trademarks of Bangalore - &quot;India&apos;s garden city&quot;. Only a few survive. Land is too valuable and its price increases every week. &quot;Take pictures, take pictures,&quot; Pai said when we stood in front of one. &quot;It may not be here when you next come.&quot; In 10 years, people say (and perhaps hope), the city will look like Dubai or Singapore. Some of it already does. Go back 60 years. Does the story of Bangalore&apos;s rise symbolise the larger history of independent India? Yes and no. In 1947, Bangalore contained about 500,000 people and has about six million now; the fifth largest city in India. In the same period, India&apos;s population, now 1.12 billion, has multiplied by a factor of three rather than Bangalore&apos;s 12, but urban growth rates that are much higher than the national average aren&apos;t unusual. When I first came to Bangalore in 1976, I didn&apos;t feel I&apos;d left India behind. The same restrictions on consumption, the same brakes to aspiration, applied as much here as anywhere else in the country. Under the regime of Indira Gandhi (and of her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, before her), the Indian middle class grew to a kind of noble austerity in the cause of national self-reliance. On the other hand, even then, Bangalore was clearly exceptional. It was tidier, neater, greener, English was more readily spoken, a striking number of church towers poked above the trees in a country where, outside the far south, Christianity had made very little impact. Above all, there was (and is) the climate. Bangalore is 3,000ft above sea level, protected by its height from the enervating heat; the British called it a &quot;no-fan station&quot;. When I asked Nandan Nilekani of Infosys how he explained the IT industry&apos;s attraction to Bangalore he made all these points - &quot;It&apos;s the most middle-class, Anglicised, cosmopolitan city in India, with a better quality of life&quot; - and added another: that a scientific and technical tradition already existed in the city, thanks to the aircraft and electrical instruments businesses that the government of India located there in the 1950s and 60s, militarily strategic factories that were as far away as possible from the borders of Pakistan and China, India&apos;s potential enemies. During the 1980s, even before economic liberalisation, it became known as the fastest-growing city in Asia. It is also, as the historian Ramachandra Guha says, a mongrel kind of town: the only place in India where you can watch films in six Indian languages. Partly, this is British doing. After Cornwallis dethroned Tipu Sultan and restored the kingdom of Mysore to its former Hindu rulers, the British built an army cantonment on the high ground outside the gates of Bengaluru, which in the local language, Kannada, was the name of the town they had captured. The cantonment grew in size to become a &quot;civil and military station&quot; which drew thousands of Tamil craftsmen, tradesmen and servants, as well as Persian horse traders and British civil servants and brewers. A large Anglo-Indian population became established. Missionaries opened schools, a great park was laid out, exotic trees imported, courts and administrative offices built. The lingua franca of this new town, Bangalore, was English; just down the road in the narrow lanes of Bengaluru they continued to speak in Kannada. The two towns became one municipality in 1949, but the differences between them persist. In Bangalore, I met men in their early middle-age, raised in the old city, who said that until their late teens they had never travelled the mile to the cantonment; and who had been warned by their parents that, when they did, they had better avoid the temptations of bars and hotels. Bangalore became the capital of the new state of Mysore (since 1973, Karnataka) when the Indian state boundaries were redrawn in 1956. The official language of Karnataka is Kannada. But thanks to the successive flows of migrants from other Indian states, only about 30% of Bangalore&apos;s inhabitants claim it as their first language. That means the city has no dominant majority, a welcoming absence as far as new migrants and businesses are concerned but a fretful one for the native Kannada speaker, who, if he lacks English, may feel excluded from the new consumer culture of his own capital city. Consequently, in what some Bangaloreans consider a political sop to the natives, Bangalore will be renamed Bengaluru within the next year or two. When it appears in airline timetables and on departure boards, a stranger might imagine that the new, more Indian name reflects a new, more Indian reality on the ground. But the opposite will be the case. A good way to understand what has happened to Bangalore is to look at a street map. In the old city, the Kannada names, many centuries old, come from castes and occupations and bazaars. In the cantonment, the source of the names is obvious enough: Brigade Road, Infantry Road, Church Street. Then, to judge from the parentheses, a burst of patriotic renaming took place - Sir Mirza Ismail Nagar (Richmond Town), Field Marshall Cariappa Road (Residency Road) - though to no effect on how people think and speak of these places. In the suburban spread of the 1960s and 70s, the streets renounce any claim to history or romance, as though Stalin was in charge of the naming department. In Indiranagar, named after Indira Gandhi, the main street is One Hundred Feet Road: that is its width. Many streets are simply numbered, as are localities: a visitor can spend many hours in an auto-rickshaw looking for 597, 15th Cross Road, JPNagar Phase Two. But now that anonymity, these plain square houses in their numbered streets, no longer satisfies new money. The names and architecture of the most recent settlements, high-rises and gated communities could be described as postmodern or pre-post-colonial: Buckingham Court, Windsor Residency, Palm Meadows, 10 Downing Street. Some quite small houses have castellated battlements. The word &quot;Residency&quot;, the title the British gave to the homes of senior imperial administrators, is very popular. &quot;People here speak of &apos;get-up&apos;,&quot; an architect told me as we had dinner in a hotel. &quot;They say to each other, &apos;What kind of get-up is your new house going to have? Mediterranean? English Castle?&apos; They think they can do anything - anything! - and they want to shove it in your face.&quot; In the hotel bar, young Bangalorean men were braying and drinking - the sound carried across the hotel gardens. They weren&apos;t poor; this was an expensive hotel. A phrase that the former Sunday Telegraph editor Peregrine Worsthorne coined in the red-braces 1980s came to me: bourgeois triumphalism. I came to Bangalore a few times in the 1980s and stayed in the homes of my then father-in-law, first in Indiranagar and then in the old Anglo-Indian colony of Whitefield. The sights and sounds I associate with these places were, and in most places still are, common to all India. You would go to sleep to the sound of the chowkidar, the night watchman, tapping his stick and blowing his pea whistle. In the morning there would be the cawing of crows and the cries of an early street pedlar, selling vegetables from a stall on wheels. Sometimes an occasional car would honk. The Whitefield house is now a restaurant, the Eurochine, and in Indiranagar they are tearing down 30-year-old houses all the way down the Hundred Feet Road to make way for the stores of the global brands: Benetton, Nike, Levis. Cars queue impatiently down every street and turning. It does no good to be wistful. A bright young science graduate can expect a starting salary of at least 270,000 rupees (about \u00a33,400) a year as a software engineer, and within a year or two will be earning far more than the professor who taught him. Between 200,000 and 300,000 people work in Bangalore&apos;s IT industry and not all of them will be so prosperous; call-centres, now referred to dismissively as IT&apos;s &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot;, pay far less. The great majority, however, will earn far more than their parents. Rent and property are expensive - at the top end, a Bangalore flat can cost \u00a31m - but credit is cheap. This new middle class has cars and takes holidays abroad (eight days in Singapore for \u00a3150). The very rich have servants and a manager to manage them. A servant - a driver, a cook - can double his salary by learning English. If the new recruit joins Infosys, which has become India&apos;s most applauded company, he or she will travel each day to a &quot;campus&quot; at Electronic City, which has a putting green, an orchard, a swimming pool, free bikes to get around, and a canteen that serves 14 different cuisines (one of them Jain, which omits garlic and onions). In recent years, more foreign chief executives and heads of state have visited this campus than the Taj Mahal, or so it is said, and &quot;the Infosys tour&quot; has become a cliche of books and TV documentaries. And of course, after getting out of your golf buggy and ascending one of the taller buildings, you can look out through the plate glass and see the slums beyond the fence, where a small boy is defecating next to a stray dog and the ditch runs black. India: land of contrasts. But supposing this replica of Silicon Valley were to disappear? The slum, the stray dog, the black ditch, the defecating child - all these would still be there. Philanthropy is popular. Infosys has a foundation devoted to good works. Quite separately, Nandan Nilekani&apos;s wife, Rohini, estimates she has spent about $40m (\u00a320m) of their money on children&apos;s educational and water projects, mainly in village India, over the past few years. This is a lot. Then again, her husband is one of Infosys&apos;s seven founders. When the company went public in 1993, 100 shares cost 9,500 rupees. The same shares today would be worth 24,440,000 rupees, 3,000 times their flotation value. (Many more people have benefited than the founders; stock options were once given to all employees, who now number about 80,000.) &quot;It&apos;s just no use being an island of prosperity in this country, it isn&apos;t going to work,&quot; Rohini Nilekani said when I went to see her in her charity&apos;s office, and in that statement hover two large black clouds. The first is inadequate, sometimes collapsing, infrastructure: roads, railways, sewers, drinking water, schools, electricity. The second is the growing divide between urban and rural India. Despite increasing urbanisation, about 70% of the population still live in agricultural villages. The reverse side of the economic liberalisation that made India&apos;s software industry possible is the crisis of Indian agriculture. Poor crop prices, exhausted soil, expensive fertiliser, falling water tables, and land that needs to sustain too many livelihoods: so far this year 1,000 Karnataka farmers are said to have killed themselves. And yet the odd thing, the thing that a more curious American executive might ask their guide, Arun Pai, is: given that the price (80 rupees, about \u00a31) of a six-minute local call from my grand hotel surpasses the daily wage of the sugar-cane cutter in a field a few miles away, how come there is so little anger and unrest in Bangalore? The best answer to this question came from another software entrepreneur, Subroto Bagchi, who runs MindTree Consulting (its clients include Avis and Royal Mail). I went to see him at his house. He offered tea and when I said yes, went away to make it and brought it on a tray himself - striking behaviour; never before, in 30 years&apos; experience of India, have I ever seen any Indian man of above average wealth do anything so humbly domestic. Bagchi, like many other Indian IT success stories, likes to stress his middle-class origins, a term that has a more egalitarian implication in India than in Britain. Indian businesses in the past tended to be run by caste-based dynasties, with money and trading (as well as political) know-how inherited by succeeding generations. Bagchi&apos;s father, on the other hand, worked as a government officer in a remote, un-electrified district of Orissa State; Nilekani&apos;s father managed a textile mill; village postmen, teachers and railway ticket-collectors appear proudly in the biographies of others. According to Bagchi, it demonstrates the truth of the saying that the Indian IT business succeeded &quot;not because who we knew but because what we knew&quot; and having to compete in a global market without political protection. I asked about the prospects of discontent, given the disparities of wealth in Bangalore. Bagchi said: &quot;Tell me, where is the angst, where is the senseless killing? They&apos;re not even restless. They&apos;re not just content, they&apos;re quite grateful. Most people, labourers, maidservants, are making a better living. It doesn&apos;t occur to my driver that he has every right to be as well-dressed as I am. Just doesn&apos;t occur to him. You have to understand, we don&apos;t have a sense of urgency, our civilisation is 3,600 years old. For most Indians, it&apos;s been an upgrade from coach to business class. They&apos;re grateful to be where they are&quot;. \u00b7 Ian Jack began writing about India as a foreign correspondent in 1977 and lived for a time in Delhi and Calcutta.

Inside, the paper gleefully related the story of Sunderland manager Roy Keane who, angered by players refusing to sign for his club &quot;because their wife wants to go shopping in London&quot;, delivered a scathing tirade about footballers &quot;being dictated to by their girlfriends&quot;. Let&apos;s leave aside for a moment the irony of Keane&apos;s savaging of the glitz of modern football landing him on page nine of the Guardian, next to a picture of Cheryl Cole from Girls Aloud. Here&apos;s a story that seems to have everything: Wags, shopping, pop stars, glamour, money - and football managers. The profile of the once humble gaffer has sky-rocketed in recent times. Football managers now bestride not just the front and back pages, but pretty much everywhere else in between. Jose Mourinho wears Armani and drives a Mercedes. Sven Goran Eriksson is still single but has been romantically linked with a Swedish PR executive and a well-known Romanian cabaret singer. Sixty-five-year-old Sir Alex Ferguson had to be protected from excitable teenage girls on a tour of the far east last month. Even Rafael Ben\u00edtez, with his PowerPoint presentations and sensible suits, made the news over the summer with his decision to grow a small goatee beard. The Premiership season roared into life this week like a Bentley Continental GT. And, as has increasingly been the case, the middle-aged men on the touchline have already been attracting more attention than the players on the pitch. Making a living as a football manager has traditionally demanded little more than the ability to shout convincingly, a certain dogged charisma, and ownership of an overcoat. In hindsight, however, it seems only natural that the forces at work in the Premiership - the stardust, the money-glaze, the 24-hour public relations - should have worked their terrible voodoo on the dugout. Premiership management has now become something of a fast-track to membership of the celebrity mainstream. The reclusive Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was recently &quot;spotted&quot; by the Daily Mirror&apos;s 3am gossip girls getting on a plane to Switzerland. Mourinho has both an official and unofficial 2007 photo-calendar (both sold out). Football management is hip. It gets you noticed. How did this happen? And is it likely to stop soon? Certainly the change has been dramatic. The former Liverpool manager Bob Paisley is still the most successful in English history. Despite this, right up to his retirement in 1983, Paisley retained both the mannerisms and dress sense of a man who had just popped out to the shop for a newspaper and needed to get home sharpish to catch the snooker. Mark Lawrenson, now a Match of the Day pundit, has described their first meeting after Lawrenson signed for Liverpool in 1981: &quot;When I got in the car I saw Bob was wearing slippers and a cardigan. They&apos;d just won the European cup and there&apos;s this fellow, who everyone in football thought was an absolute god, driving me to the ground in his slippers and cardigan.&quot; Paisley wasn&apos;t just unglamorous; he had a sort of anti-glamour. Originally the team physiotherapist, for a while he appeared on the edge of Liverpool team photos dressed in a long white coat - not really something you would ever catch Jose doing. It&apos;s hard to imagine the likes of Paisley mixing it on the touchline with the current breed of gesticulating showmen. For a start, you wouldn&apos;t have been able to see him. The past few years have seen an ascent-of-man-style rise among football managers. The tartan blanket and nice sit-down have been cast aside in favour of a strutting, telegenic presence stalking the fringes of the action. Standing up was once considered a solecism. At the end of the 1966 World Cup final the England trainer Harold Shepherdson leaped up to celebrate the finest moment in his nation&apos;s footballing history, only to be told, &quot;Sit down and behave yourself, man,&quot; by his - seated - manager, Alf Ramsey. Management has since become a kind of performance. Miked up and with his windmilling arms and peeled-eyeball displays of emotion, the modern gaffer is a magnetic figure. Like most new things in football, this is mainly to do with money. Prior to the Bosman ruling in 1995 (which allowed professional football players in the European Union to move freely to another club at the end of their contract), clubs had an unusually draconian relationship with their players, in effect being able to deny them the right to work elsewhere, even after the contract between them had expired. Post-Bosman, the hyperinflation in wages, plus the freedom to come and go without restraint, led to a rise in something called &quot;player power&quot;. This, it was widely agreed, was a bad thing. English football has always been run along deeply hierarchical lines. In moments of unrest managers are usually described, darkly, as &quot;losing&quot; the dressing room, bringing to mind a barrack-room mutiny or gulag insurgency. The new breed of footballer seems unbowed by the traditional bonds of authority. The problem of how to command the requisite respect when wearing slippers and a flat cap presented a fresh kind of challenge. Some managers responded by trying to make friends with their players. A new atmosphere of chumminess prevailed, most notably in the trophy-less false dawn of Kevin Keegan&apos;s Newcastle. Others set out to command by being the toughest kid in the playground. Footballers have always had a weakness for this kind of thing. Keane himself wrote in his autobiography about his manager Brian Clough&apos;s reaction to a mistake he had made: &quot;When I walked into the dressing room after the game, Clough punched me straight in the face. &apos;Don&apos;t pass the ball back to the goalkeeper,&apos; he screamed as I lay on the floor, him standing over me.&quot; Unfortunately, punching people will only get you so far. Faced with a wildly over-remunerated generation of players, our most recent batch of managers have attempted to outflash, or at least outmanoeuvre, their pampered stars. Mourinho remains the most striking example. The first real superstar manager, he looks and dresses like one of his players&apos; more intelligent, better-looking older brothers. He drives a cooler car, he dresses just as expensively, he&apos;s probably a little bit more famous. This is the nature of the job now. Mourinho has claimed he keeps such a high profile to deflect attention, and therefore pressure, from his players. This might be right; but he also likes it. Hence the style magazine interviews, the theatrical appearances at the side of the pitch, the headline-grabbing public pronouncements. Eriksson has also been influential here. As England manager, his was a style-setting administration. For all the creepy and embarrassing detail attached to revelations about his sex life, Eriksson was always very popular with the players. They admired his fame. They liked his fancy suits. They chased the same women. Eriksson may not actually have been a player, but he was the next best thing: a playa. Like pretty much everyone else their age, footballers are in awe of celebrity and a manager without a certain foxiness in the public eye just isn&apos;t going to cut it. This is, even with hindsight, all very unexpected. For the first 40 years or so of professional football there was no real concrete idea of what a manager actually did. Teams were picked by an ad-hoc committee of board members and the secretary-manager, a vaguely clerical figure with a distinctly below-stairs status. Herbert Chapman is credited with pioneering the modern notion of a manager as the dominant personality within a football club, first at Huddersfield and then at Arsenal in the 1920s and 1930s. An avuncular, silk-hatted figure, Chapman also pretty much invented the idea of tactics, floodlights and marketing and public relations, having successfully lobbied to have Gillespie Road tube station renamed Arsenal in 1932.  Change came slowly, however. In 1953, England suffered the most devastating defeat in their international history, the 6-3 Wembley thrashing by Hungary&apos;s Marvellous Magyars. The following day not a single mention was made in any of the shell-shocked newspaper reports of the team manager, Walter Winterbottom, a man who should by rights have found his head morphed into a paprika potato salad on at least one back page. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly was the first to make an impression as a &quot;personality&quot; outside of the narrow confines of football. Shankly&apos;s success in the 60s and early 70s was soundtracked by his own apparently endless repertoire of quips and wisecracks, as the hitherto rather stilted and secretive world of football management acquired a public voice for the first time. A dapper, sharp-suited Scot, Shankly took his inspiration from American entertainers. His delivery was a cross between James Cagney and Groucho Marx, and he borrowed his defining epigram - the one about football not being a matter of life and death, but actually something much more important than that - from the gridiron coach, Vince Lombardi. The 1970s saw the advent of the outspoken, charismatic showman football manager, a breed whose lasting influence in popular culture far outweighs its actual numbers. Malcolm &quot;Big Mal&quot; Allison had the look: the champagne and cigars, the medallion, the Chicago gangster fedora hat. He had the talk: &quot;We will take football to the moon,&quot; he told reporters prior to defeat in the first round of the European Cup. He had the eccentricities: City players would run laps of the training pitch while the manager shouted &quot;How do you feel?&quot;, to which they were instructed to reply &quot;Sharp!&quot; Allison&apos;s crossover appeal was cemented as a member of ITV&apos;s groundbreaking 1970s World Cup panel, the first time anything similar involving football people had been attempted. Under Jimmy Hill, the channel assembled a now legendary line-up of outspoken, kipper-tied and occasionally woozy controversialists. Also behind the cardboard desk was Brian Clough, the Derby County and Nottingham Forest manager who, for a while in the late 1970s - the Mike Yarwood years - became one of the most imitated men in Britain. In an era before blanket television coverage of football, Clough somehow managed to infiltrate the national consciousness to a degree never achieved before and rarely since. No school playground was complete without someone attempting a high-pitched rendition of one of his slightly camp catchphrases (&quot;Get a haircut, young man!&quot;), tribute to Clough&apos;s extrovert personality, and perhaps more so, to the vaguely inexplicable popularity of Yarwood&apos;s Saturday evening show. Between them, Allison and Clough created a fairly narrow set of conventions for the extrovert, media-friendly football manager, a torch carried almost single-handedly through the bleak years of the 1980s by the terrible Ron &quot;Big Ron&quot; Atkinson. Reputed to conduct contract negotiations with players at Manchester United while lying beneath his office sunbed wearing goggles and a tiny pair of trunks, for a while Atkinson appeared to be single-handedly perverting the template of the &quot;personality&quot; football manager. The notion of the boorish, perma-tanned, sheepskin-wearing loudmouth had established itself in the national consciousness, something it would take the Premierhip, with its sharp tailoring, media-handlers and handsome foreign gentlemen - fluent in six languages - to junk once and for all. In fact, the European influence has been a powerful factor in the rise of the celebrity manager. Wenger started the process at Arsenal. Mired in its barrack-room notions of hierarchy, riven by a class-based status quo, football had never been comfortable with the idea of people getting above themselves. There was a time and a place for clever talk, and it certainly wasn&apos;t in the dressing room. For some reason, however, the same rules didn&apos;t seem to apply if you spoke in a foreign accent. The years following Wenger&apos;s arrival at Arsenal brought a flowering of progressive thought, sports science and dressing slightly better, an undercurrent that has eventually swelled into a late-blooming, football-management renaissance. There may also be sense of the tail wagging the dog. If it is true that you can change something just by observing it, it is hardly surprising that when you point 12 TV cameras, a dedicated cable channel, a travelling army of photographers - not to mention an entire global media machine - at someone, they start to act a little differently. Perhaps it is hardly surprising that a new set of behavioural conventions has emerged, of visual tics that tell us a manager is doing his very public job, literally &quot;managing&quot; before our very eyes: wrestling the fourth official, looking pensive and solitary on the touchline, firing off one-liners at a press conference, telling GQ about his favourite restaurant. Football management is, after all, a precarious profession. One way to guarantee your future employment is to work on your profile, to feed the fire of your celebrity, to embrace the front-page splash and high-profile feud. You never know, even Keane&apos;s wife might have her eye on a new home in Dubai or a nuclear shopping spree in Bond Street. If so, she&apos;ll probably be delighted right now.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "title": "Hey, look at us!

All over the US, sports columnists are climbing out of their pits of indifference and on to their high horses to declare - what was all the fuss about? Genuine fans, the ones who misguidedly believe Major League Soccer is worth the price of admission, aren&apos;t happy either, and have taken time out of their therapy sessions to cobble together banners bearing witty slogans such as &quot;Bench It Like Beckham&quot; and &quot;Welcome to America David, where people like you get paid to do nothing&quot;. We shouldn&apos;t mock, not least because these poor people do appear to be getting a raw deal when it comes to what I guess the marketing people would call the &quot;Beckham experience&quot;. Thus far there has been no Beckham experience at all for the fans, unless you count a couple of substitute appearances by a hobbling figure purporting to be the saviour of the game. In fact the only people who have had any benefit from the Beckham experience are clubs like the New England Revolution, who made their home match against the LA Galaxy last weekend part of a &quot;Beckham package&quot;. Fans had to buy tickets for three games if they wanted to see the Englishman play. Except they didn&apos;t, although they didn&apos;t know that because Beckham&apos;s absence from the team sheets was kept a secret until just before kick-off: or, to put it another way, until just after everybody had loaded up on $5 (\u00a32.50) jumbo hot dogs and buckets of cola. Did I say raw deal? Make that complete rip-off. The wonder is not that there has been a Beckham backlash in the States but that it hasn&apos;t been more vehement. I don&apos;t doubt there are numerous football clubs in Britain who would treat their supporters similarly if they felt they could get away with it. Some already do. But I also have faith that most supporters in Britain wouldn&apos;t accept such a miserable fate without letting their feelings be known forcibly - a faith that was reinforced by the reaction of the Tottenham fans who booed their team off the pitch at half-time during Monday night&apos;s Premier League match against Everton. Admittedly, the booing didn&apos;t help their team avoid defeat, but it didn&apos;t cause the defeat either, and at least it reminded the players, the manager and the board at Spurs of where the ultimate judgment on their effort lies. The fans&apos; disquiet at White Hart Lane had its boardroom expression at Carlisle United, where the club decided to fire their manager, Neil McDonald, after only one game of the new season - a decision described by the League Managers Association as &quot;deplorable&quot;. There are obvious ironies to be observed in the LMA&apos;s outrage at the treatment of one its members, not least because many managers feel absolutely no compunction in treating players under their charge with even less sensitivity and respect than that McDonald received. But we&apos;ll leave that to one side for now. Carlisle&apos;s behaviour in this instance was indeed deplorable; an over-reaction. Likewise, there is a case to be made that anyone who boos his or her team off the pitch at half-time in the first home league match of the season seriously needs to find a little perspective. Tottenham have 36 Premier League matches left to play this season and Martin Jol, a smart and tactically astute manager, will find a way to stitch together the talent he had last season with the talent that cost the club \u00a340m over the summer. No doubt he will do exactly that, although the fans&apos; anger on Tuesday night has let him know he better get down to business, pronto. Sure, the booing at White Hart Lane was an over-reaction but in football over-reaction is good. It keeps people on their toes. It stops them getting complacent. It makes them think twice before they take advantage. The alternatives to over-reaction are waving silly banners or, even worse, doing nothing, because then the only certain outcome is the one that awaits the Beckham experience in the United States; football will eventually be smothered by corporate cynicism and public apathy. Keane&apos;s Wag attack carries whiff of old-school sexism As the star graduate from Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s finishing school for future managers, Roy Keane no doubt had a brilliantly Machiavellian motive for his rant against those misguided footballers who refuse to sign for him at Sunderland. Otherwise, why make such an idiot of himself in public? &quot;If someone doesn&apos;t want to come to Sunderland all well and good but, if they don&apos;t want to come because their wife wants to go shopping in London, then that is a sad state of affairs. I could name three of four big players now and clearly their wives are running their lives. They have started doing photograph shoots.&quot; This, frankly, is biblical stuff, as depressingly familiar as the one about Adam being tempted from the path of goodness by that evil bitch, Eve. For forbidden fruit, substitute Dolce and Gabbana. Keane should have saved his nonsense for the day he takes over as the top man at Taliban Rovers. Mind you, since he has already stretched credulity beyond its breaking point on what is a genuinely intriguing subject, how about this for an alternative explanation: maybe the players who refused to sign for Sunderland over the summer did so because they are devotees of Julia Kristeva&apos;s work and perhaps identified Keane as a misogynistic pig. Odds remain long on catching betting miscreants One thing uniting the official investigations into the various betting scandals that have dogged sport in recent times is that they never catch the villains. The FA&apos;s &quot;inquiry&quot; into betting surrounding Harry Rednapp&apos;s appointment as manager of Portsmouth was one such instance. For those who did not notice, it was quietly closed a few months ago after concluding there was &quot;no firm evidence&quot; of wrongdoing, although an FA spokesman said yesterday it would be reopened should any new evidence come to light. My breath remains unheld. Likewise it would require an optimistic spirit to imagine the ATP&apos;s investigation into the betting &quot;scandal&quot; surrounding a recent tennis tournament in Poland will be any more conclusive, although anyone with an interest in that case might want to take a look at the latest issue of the Spectator magazine. There, the High Life columnist Taki claims the man behind the tennis scam is an &quot;extremely rich Brit&quot; who owns a &quot;very large and ugly yacht&quot; - not exactly conclusive, admittedly, but enough to conclude that it is a sad day when an ageing Greek playboy is ahead of the authorities when it comes to shedding some light into the dark corners of professional sport. Tiger plots a course to breaking the billion barrier Tiger Woods announced yesterday he is to design a new golf course in North Carolina.

Nawaz Sharif likened Gen Musharraf - whose position is now believed to be at its weakest since he seized power in 1999 - to a &quot;sinking ship&quot; and told Ms Bhutto that any alliance would damage her credibility. Gen Musharraf met Ms Bhutto, his chief rival, in Abu Dhabi last month. The talks came amid claims the US was secretly pushing for a deal between the two to bolster the president, who is a key Washington ally in the &quot;war on terror&quot;. &quot;Musharraf is a drowning man at this stage - he has no options left,&quot; Mr Sharif said. &quot;I hate to say this, but I think he is like a sinking ship. &quot;Anybody who cuts a deal with Musharraf at this stage would damage his own credibility and I don&apos;t want to damage my credibility,&quot; he said in Dubai, where he is in exile. Gen Musharraf, who remains chief of the army, has been badly damaged by his failed attempt to fire Pakistan&apos;s chief justice. Many Pakistanis see him as being too pro-US, and Islamist extremists have launched repeated attacks on the security forces. An alliance with Ms Bhutto&apos;s Pakistan People&apos;s party - generally regarded as the country&apos;s leading party - would broaden his support and help him win subsequent presidential elections. For her part, Ms Bhutto would probably need Gen Musharraf&apos;s support to overturn a law prohibiting former prime ministers from returning to that office. Since Gen Musharraf&apos;s rise to power, Mr Sharif and Ms Bhutto, who have both been living in exile, have formed an alliance of their own. The former prime ministers, who both held power in the 80s and 90s, joined forces in the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy to press for the end of military rule.  However, the alliance has appeared to wither since Ms Bhutto established contacts with the government. Mr Sharif called on her to stop talking to the government and return to opposition.  &quot;She must come back and join the struggle for restoration of democracy, join the struggle for pushing the army back into the barracks and join the struggle for banning the entry of generals into politics, because this has done great harm,&quot; he said. Mr Sharif has vowed to return from exile for the forthcoming parliamentary elections, and has petitioned the supreme court to lift restrictions on his return.  Ms Bhutto went into self-imposed exile following allegations of corruption when she was prime minister in the mid-90s.

Iraqi officials, including oil minister Hussein Shahristani, will attend the gatherings in Dubai in September to meet international oil executives. All the big players will be there, including BP, Shell, Exxon and Chevron, as well as minnows such as Addax Petroleum, some of which have operations in Iraq. David Horgan, managing director of Petrel Resources, an Irish explorer with a presence in Iraq since 1999, said: &apos;All the oil companies have been salivating at the prospect of Iraq for years. There is a good chance of very large discoveries. Nowhere else in the world offers that.&apos; Horgan said that once the oil law was passed, oil executives would rush to sign exploration and production deals, despite Iraq&apos;s security situation. Under severe US pressure, the Iraqi administration is now expected to push through the oil law before the end of September. The majors have stayed away from Iraq, which has the world&apos;s third largest oil reserves, because there was no legal framework for investing in its energy sector. Unusually for the Middle East, the oil law will provide generous rates of return and production sharing agreements that allow companies that have had to write down their reserves, such as Shell, to book massive new reserves. Muhammad-Ali Zainy, from the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London, said: &apos;Why do international oil companies rush in to divide the loot at a time when Iraq is submerged in blood?

The Gulf emirate now boasts the world&apos;s tallest building, and, given its \u00a32bn cash takeover bid for Nordic stock exchange operator OMX, seems to have similarly lofty ambitions as a global finance hub. Last year it emerged that the Dubai International Financial Exchange (DIFX) had built up a 3.5 per cent stake in Euronext, the exchanges operator now owned by the New York Stock Exchange. And Dubai has repeatedly been linked to a possible stake in the London Stock Exchange. But a takeover of OMX could prove the cannier move. Borse Dubai is a newly formed holding company, barely two weeks old, for the government&apos;s stakes in the Dubai Financial Market (DFM), which lists local shares, and the internationally-orientated DIFX. Combined with the OMX, which Dubai can afford to buy outright, it would be the fifth largest exchange group in the world. On Friday it offered a 13.7 per cent premium on rival Nasdaq&apos;s bid for OMX. As a part-share deal the existing Nasdaq offer is seen as vulnerable to the recent market turmoil, compared with Dubai&apos;s all-cash bid. Sources say Nasdaq&apos;s CEO, Bob Greifeld, plans to go to Sweden next week to discuss altering the structure of the bid to make it less dependent on the Nasdaq share price. In terms of the value of OMX, however, the recent market troubles are unlikely to deter either buyer. If Borse Dubai&apos;s bid for OMX is accepted it would be the latest in a series of bold foreign acquisitions that prove the emirate should not be ignored. Dubai&apos;s economic growth rides high above its Gulf neighbours, including Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Last February Dubai&apos;s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, announced ambitious plans to maintain double-digit growth and achieve a GDP of $108bn by 2015. &apos;Dubai has succeeded in diversifying its sources of income and reducing its dependence on oil: today, oil&apos;s contribution to GNP is a mere 3 per cent,&apos; he said. From its stakes in EADS and the Tussauds group to the purchase of P&amp;O, Dubai cuts a flamboyant dash as an international investor. But while it has its &apos;trophy&apos; investments, including the \u00a350m QE2, it appears to be rational in its approach. In January, the government-owned Dubai International Capital (DIC) pulled out of a bid for Liverpool FC, despite its CEO&apos;s devotion to the club; it would not overpay. The emirate knows that OMX, which owns seven exchanges, would give it access to a wider range of international markets. A combined Dubai-OMX entity would act as a gateway to the markets of Europe, north Africa, the Middle East and the rest of Asia. Dubai already has strong trade links with China. But its involvement with OMX is already proving to be a bumpy ride. Just two days after Borse Dubai was incorporated, the company said it had bought a 4.9 per cent stake in OMX, as well as entering into option agreements with various hedge funds over another 22.5 per cent. But the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority has questioned how Dubai could have amassed such a stake in the company, and demanded details of the contacts between Borse Dubai, HSBC (its financial adviser), and the hedge funds. OMX&apos;s head, Magnus Bocker, has also criticised the possible lack of transparency and regulation in a market owned by a single shareholder, which could undermine the credibility of the Nordic group. Dubai intends to de-list the OMX if its bid is successful. Borse Dubai has until tomorrow morning to answer the Swedish FSA, and observers believe its ruling will come on Tuesday. If the Swedish FSA says Borse Dubai is not &apos;fit and proper&apos; to run a market, it would be another setback for the emirate&apos;s acquisitions programme. The most high-profile case was that of P&amp;O, which Dubai&apos;s state-owned DP World bought for $6.85bn in 2006. It was forced to sell off the firm&apos;s US ports because of concerns over the security implications of a Gulf nation controlling such assets. And a recent deal by the state-owned Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, which bid $1.8bn for Auckland airport, has been threatened by shareholders, who last week said they had blocked the deal. But for an emirate heading along the fast lane to economic maturity, nothing seems to get in the way for long.

The New York exchange has hired JP Morgan and UBS to help it review its options for a sale of the stake. Nasdaq today stated its belief that its share price is too low because investors do not recognise the value of the LSE stake.  LSE shares rose on the news. By lunchtime they had gained 24p to \u00a312.94, a gain of 1.9%. This values the Nasdaq&apos;s stake at around \u00a3815m. Analysts said the share price rise indicated that investors believe the LSE could be a takeover target again. Under takeover rules, any company that bought 30% or more of the LSE would have to launch a formal bid. Nasdaq said it would use $1bn (\u00a3502m) of the proceeds from any sale to pay off debts, and the remainder to buy back shares. It estimates that selling the stake would increase its earnings per share for 2008 by between $0.30 and $0.35. Nasdaq, the second-largest US exchange, is the LSE&apos;s largest single shareholder. It was thought that Nasdaq might come back with a renewed bid for the LSE early next year. The LSE has recently agreed to buy the Milan exchange Borsa Italian in a \u00a31.6bn deal. This would dilute Nasdaq&apos;s stake in the LSE to 22%. The news came as another bid battle involving Nasdaq - for Sweden&apos;s OMX exchange operator - heats up. Borse Dubai has made a near \u00a32bn cash offer, topping Nasdaq&apos;s agreed \u00a31.86bn offer for OMX, which owns seven exchanges, including Helsinki, Copenhagen and Stockholm. This morning it was reported that OMX&apos;s chairman Urban Backstrom called Borse Dubai&apos;s all-cash offer &quot;hostile&quot; and said it was no more attractive than Nasdaq&apos;s share-and-cash bid. Mr Backstrom said the synergies proposed by Nasdaq were higher than from Borse Dubai, though OMX has yet to decide which bid to back. He was also uneasy about the Nordic exchange operator being owned by the Dubai government. It is thought that Nasdaq chief executive Bob Greifeld plans to travel to Sweden this week to meet OMX management and shareholders. Investor AB, which holds a 10.7% stake in OMX, said it was &quot;not obvious&quot; that Borse Dubai&apos;s bid was more attractive than the Nasdaq offer, given the &quot;industrial logic&quot; of a transatlantic tie-up. Borse Dubai said last week that if all its share options were exercised it would control 28.4% of OMX. Matt Snowling, analyst at FBR, said today that Nasdaq could be a takeover target itself if it fails to win control of OMX.", "tags": ["Business"], "title": "Nasdaq may sell LSE stake", "sentences": ["Borse Dubai has made a near \u00a32bn cash offer, topping Nasdaq&apos;s agreed \u00a31.86bn offer for OMX, which owns seven exchanges, including Helsinki, Copenhagen and Stockholm.", "This morning it was reported that OMX&apos;s chairman Urban Backstrom called Borse Dubai&apos;s all-cash offer &quot;hostile&quot; and said it was no more attractive than Nasdaq&apos;s share-and-cash bid.", "Mr Backstrom said the synergies proposed by Nasdaq were higher than from Borse Dubai, though OMX has yet to decide which bid to back.", "He was also uneasy about the Nordic exchange operator being owned by the Dubai government.", "Investor AB, which holds a 10.7% stake in OMX, said it was &quot;not obvious&quot; that Borse Dubai&apos;s bid was more attractive than the Nasdaq offer, given the &quot;industrial logic&quot; of a transatlantic tie-up.", "Borse Dubai said last week that if all its share options were exercised it would control 28.4% of OMX."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/20/3", "publicationDate": "2007-08-20T12:10:24Z"}, {"article": "Lolling on a ragged carpet in his cupboard-sized shop in the heart of old Peshawar, Wahhab the money-changer beckoned customers with a sly smile. &quot;Best rate,&quot; he said, fingering a fat wad of banknotes over a low glass counter. The portly man also offered another, more discreet, service: black market money transfers, any amount, to anywhere, in almost no time. Whipping out a calculator and a mobile phone, he explained how it worked. &quot;You give me the money; I call my contact in London,&quot; he said. &quot;Then in one hour your friend can go and collect the money - guaranteed.&quot; Quick, cheap and paperless, the age-old hawala money transfer is thriving in Pakistan. Millions of emigrants use it to remit their wages to families back home. But hawala is also favoured by drug smugglers, corrupt officials, and the financiers of militant Islam. Foreign money is fuelling the tide of Islamist violence washing across northern Pakistan, according to diplomats, analysts and money laundering experts. Pakistan&apos;s notoriously lax financial system helps them to move the money into the country. Donors in petrodollar-rich Gulf countries, the US and Europe send donations - anything from a few thousand dollars to several million, said Seth Jones of the Washington-based Rand Corporation. &quot;Without significant funding from abroad, especially the Gulf states, we would be nowhere near the current level of Islamist militancy,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re talking about tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars.&quot; President Pervez Musharraf is coming under fresh pressure to crack down on the flow. Last month&apos;s Red Mosque siege in Islamabad raised questions about how a madrasa with no apparent source of income could afford to feed up to 6,000 students - and still have money to build a small arsenal of weapons. Karachi is reputedly a hub of Taliban and Islamist financing. Last month Mariane Pearl, widow of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, who was murdered in Karachi in 2002, launched a court action against a bank she alleges helped her husband&apos;s killers. On August 2 the US undersecretary of state, Nicholas Burns, called for new laws. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of financing, money that gets laundered through banks that support these terrorist groups. We&apos;ve asked the Pakistani government to take stronger measures,&quot; he said. But halting the flow of militant money is a complex - some say impossible - task. In Pakistan law enforcement is weak and militant money is often disguised as a religious donation - thrusting investigators into a sensitive area at the heart of Islam. The government has already outlawed hawala, the system that Osama bin Laden used to transfer funds between Pakistan and Dubai, according to the 9/11 Commission. But police are powerless to stop it in the tribal belt, where the Taliban is strongest, and have shown little enthusiasm for crackdowns in major cities such as Peshawar. Many militant donations are disguised as zakat, the annual Muslim charity tax, and channelled through a shadowy nexus of radical mosques, madaris (madrasas) and charities. In Pakistan zakat - one of the five pillars of Islam - is levied by the state. But in oil-rich Gulf States Muslims also send zakat abroad - an estimated \u00a350m a year from Saudi Arabia. That money has helped fund an explosion of mosques and madaris in Pakistan; some also ends up in the coffers of militant groups. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of people in the Gulf, particularly the rich merchant class, who feel a religious obligation to fund charities. They don&apos;t think too hard about where it goes,&quot; said Robert Baer, an ex-CIA agent and Middle East expert. The Saudi money is most visible in North West Frontier Province. In Peshawar the number of madaris has increased from 13 in 1980 to more than 150 today, according to one study. One of the most recent is Jamia Asaria, a sprawling complex amid the green maize fields on the city outskirts. Built last year, the \u00a3500,000 Jamia Asaria is among the best madaris in Pakistan. Its multi-storey classrooms, dormitories, medical centre and bright, bejewelled mosque can cater for 1,200 students. Yet annual fees are just \u00a316 - one-tenth of the real cost - thanks to the generosity of donors in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar. &quot;We are very grateful to them,&quot; said administrator Majid Khan. Jamia Asaria follows the Ahle Hadith school of Islamic thought - sexes are strictly segregated, and it has links to schools in Saudi Arabia. Mr Khan stressed it had no links with militancy - but admitted there had been offers. One time the charity Jamaat ud Dawa, which the US branded a &quot;terrorist entity&quot; last year, offered a fleet of free vehicles, he said. Another time &quot;some wealthy Saudis said that if we became involved in political activities, they would fund it&quot;. In both instances the school refused. &quot;We told them this is an educational institution and we want it to remain like that,&quot; he said. Four years ago, under US pressure, the Saudi government started regulating zakat donations and charities. But the laws controversially exempted groups such as the International Islamic Relief Organisation (IIRO), a charity founded by Osama bin Laden&apos;s brother-in-law, which still has a large office in Pakistan. At its Islamabad HQ director Muhammad Javed said IIRO gave relief to victims of the Kashmir earthquake and Baluchistan floods, and ran two orphanages. He insisted all operations were &quot;entirely transparent&quot; but referred further queries to the Saudi embassy. Militant funding also comes from donors in the UK, said Tahseen Ullah Khan of the National Research and Development Foundation, a Peshawar-based NGO that promotes madrasa reform. &quot;If I go to the UK as a cleric and tell people that Islam is under attack, I can come back with lot of funding.&quot; The holy month of Ramadan, which starts in mid September this year, is the main fundraising season. &quot;Muslims abroad need to be educated. They think their money is going for Allah. But they should check if their money is going to a poor student or to buy guns,&quot; he said. Western diplomats are getting impatient with Gen Musharraf&apos;s promises of tighter regulation. An anti-money laundering law first pledged seven years ago is still languishing in parliament. Diplomats suspect that powerful vested interests, possibly linked to official corruption or drug smuggling, are stalling the law. &quot;This needs commitment at the highest level but it doesn&apos;t seem to be there,&quot; said one. The government bristles at suggestions it is not doing enough. &quot;We are making concerted efforts but we will do it in our own national interest,&quot; admonished foreign minister Khurshid Kasuri. The State Bank of Pakistan recently set up a financial monitoring team. Some experts say that laws and regulations alone will never be enough. Militants are adapting, pushing their money through increasingly obscure - or mainstream - channels. Abu Zubeida, an al-Qaida operative arrested in Pakistan in 2002, used to withdraw his funds from accounts in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait through ATM machines. Mr Baer, the former CIA agent, said it was &quot;plain nutty&quot; to try and regulate something like zakat. &quot;Some people use the money for Qur&apos;ans, others for peroxide bombs. It&apos;s just impossible to make it accountable,&quot; he said.", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Faith, charity and the money trail  to Pakistan's Islamist militants", "sentences": ["The government has already outlawed hawala, the system that Osama bin Laden used to transfer funds between Pakistan and Dubai, according to the 9/11 Commission."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/21/pakistan.declanwalsh", "publicationDate": "2007-08-21T01:08:44Z"}, {"article": "The takeover stand-off between some of the world&apos;s leading stock exchanges took another twist yesterday when US firm Nasdaq took the unusual step of announcing it wanted to sell a \u00a3798m stake in the London Stock Exchange. The American group has twice tried to win control of the LSE in recent years but failed both times. Many investors had expected its redoubtable chief executive, Bob Greifeld, to return with yet another approach. Shares in the London exchange closed up 31p at \u00a313.01 as investors anticipated the emergence of another predator on its share register. Nasdaq holds 31%, though this will be diluted to between 22% and 25% by the LSE&apos;s imminent merger with Borsa Italiana. Speaking after the London markets closed, Mr Greifeld said he had &quot;a strong degree of certainty that there will be bidders surfacing to get this asset&quot;. He said there had already been expressions of interest and informal discussions with &quot;one or two potential buyers&quot;. &quot;We believe there are buyers out there and we believe a premium [to last night&apos;s LSE closing share price] is justified ... a large one is justified.&quot; Even without a premium, Nasdaq will make a healthy return on its investment, benefiting from share price rises and a weakening dollar. Nevertheless, a sale will seal a bitter defeat for Mr Greifeld in his struggle to win control of the LSE. He signalled Nasdaq&apos;s expansion ambitions were now firmly fixed instead on Nordic exchange group OMX, where it is locked in a bid battle against Borse Dubai. Nasdaq has long harboured ambitions to gain a foothold in Europe. Its US rival, the New York Stock Exchange, sealed a merger in April with Euronext, the Belgian-Dutch-French exchange. Nasdaq appeared to be close to clinching a deal with OMX after the Swedish-listed firm recommended its cash and shares offer in May. But the marriage plans were thrown into disarray last Friday when Borse Dubai, run by a former OMX chief executive, Per Larsson, announced a rival offer at a higher price - Kr230 (\u00a316.80) a share against Nasdaq&apos;s bid valued originally at Kr208. Mr Greifeld responded with a fierce defence of his offer. &quot;We remain convinced that our offer to merge with OMX is in the best short- and long-term interests of all OMX shareholders,&quot; he said. In a damning assessment of Borse Dubai, he noted it was state-owned and &quot;only had 51 listed companies, dominated by one issuer&quot;. Hinting that Nasdaq could raise its offer, Mr Greifeld spoke last night from Sweden, where he was meeting OMX shareholders. He said he hoped to announce a sale of the LSE stake within a month, with the proceeds going both to pay down debt and towards a share buyback programme - both moves would lay the ground for improving the OMX offer. The value of Nasdaq&apos;s bid for OMX rose marginally yesterday as its shares gained about 2% in morning trading in New York. The offer was still short of the Kr208 a share at which it was valued in May, when it was recommended by the OMX board. Mr Greifeld has been under pressure from his own investors to make progress with the LSE or sell out. Yesterday he said the stake was undervalued by Nasdaq investors and, after stripping it out from core operations, Nasdaq shares were trading at &quot;a ridiculous level&quot;. &quot;We think that the European competitive landscape will change, and change quite dramatically. &quot;It is our opinion that the changed landscape will not be reflected in the market capitalisations of the main European players for quite some time.&quot; Asked why he had switched his attention from the LSE to OMX, Mr Greifeld said, among other factors, &quot;we do not see the OMX transaction business being as threatened in the medium term by Project Turquoise.&quot; - Project Turquoise is a start-up equity trading platform, backed by seven investment banks, which is planned to start operating later this year.", "tags": ["Business"], "title": "Nasdaq to sell its stake in London Stock Exchange", "sentences": ["He signalled Nasdaq&apos;s expansion ambitions were now firmly fixed instead on Nordic exchange group OMX, where it is locked in a bid battle against Borse Dubai.", "But the marriage plans were thrown into disarray last Friday when Borse Dubai, run by a former OMX chief executive, Per Larsson, announced a rival offer at a higher price - Kr230 (\u00a316.80) a share against Nasdaq&apos;s bid valued originally at Kr208.", "In a damning assessment of Borse Dubai, he noted it was state-owned and &quot;only had 51 listed companies, dominated by one issuer&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/21/5", "publicationDate": "2007-08-21T22:44:33Z"}, {"article": "There was a funny line in Nasdaq&apos;s announcement of the plan to sell its 31% stake in the London Stock Exchange. It was the complaint that the value of the LSE holding was not being adequately reflected in Nasdaq&apos;s own share price. Whose fault is that? Since the failure of its bid, Nasdaq has consistently tried to talk down the LSE&apos;s share price in the hope of coming back for another bite. It also claimed its holding would act as a blocking stake, an idea that was exploded when the LSE managed to force through the purchase of Borsa Italiana in the face of Nasdaq&apos;s opposition. If Nasdaq shareholders couldn&apos;t see the wood for the trees, that is not surprising. The outbreak of honest thinking at Nasdaq comes from the realisation that a fresh humiliation could be on the cards. Nasdaq&apos;s plan B - its bid for OMX, the Swedish-based exchange - is suddenly threatened by the appearance of a rival cash bidder from Dubai. Nasdaq&apos;s offer, which is half in shares, suddenly looks second best, and the US exchange desperately needs to inject some adrenaline into its own paper. That means selling the LSE shares and performing an inelegant U-turn: instead of talking down the value of the LSE, Nasdaq will now talk it up. It seems to be an easier task. LSE&apos;s shares rose in price yesterday, which ought not to happen when so many could be dumped on the market at once. Investors&apos; calculation was that Nasdaq would only announce a sale if it could be sure of finding buyers. The analysis was spot-on: later in the day Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq&apos;s chief executive, said he was confident of getting a premium to the market price. Does he have an alternative bidder lined up? It is possible, but both the likely trade buyers are currently busy. NYSE-Euronext is still bedding down its own merger. Deutsche B\u00f6rse has just made a $2.8bn acquisition in the US. It is more likely that Clara Furse, the LSE chief executive who clearly enjoys the independent life, could get something very pleasant for a change: a broad spread of supportive shareholders. There should be demand from Italy, where 58 banks happily accepted the LSE&apos;s offer for Borsa Italiana; some might wish to increase their interest. Then there are so-called sovereign funds - state-backed investment vehicles. They have always been keen buyers of financial assets, and Dubai&apos;s interest in OMX is the latest example. A stake in the LSE, which still carries the lure of a &quot;trophy asset&quot;, may have added appeal. For the ambitious Greifeld, the future looks harder. He is now in the last chance saloon. If he fails to land OMX, his credibility as a buyer will be lost and Nasdaq will be prey not predator. The obvious bidder would be the LSE itself - but only after a decent interval and only after Greifeld&apos;s departure. It would be an outrageous plot-line, but it is possible. The rising yen It was the first &quot;normal&quot; day of trading on stock markets for what seems like weeks, but don&apos;t read anything significant into yesterday&apos;s apparent calm. Beneath the surface, the same anxieties could be seen. Northern Rock, last week&apos;s favourite stock to sell, enjoyed a bounce of 5% in the morning, but the gains virtually disappeared in the afternoon. Barclays, another that divides opinion, crept above 650p at the open, was 625p at lunchtime and finished roughly in the middle. These mini-dramas, though, look like diversions from the important action in the currency markets. All eyes are on the Japanese yen, which has risen by almost 20% against the Australian and New Zealand dollars in less than a month. We know the theory behind what&apos;s happening. It is the unwinding of the &quot;yen carry&quot; trade by which investors borrowed in Japan, where interest rates are low, and invested elsewhere in higher-yielding assets. It was a good strategy for as long as the yen fell or stood still. Now the yen is rising and we await news of the victims. In the past, it was possible to believe assurances that the main players in the carry trade were Japanese retail investors trying to boost their savings. Not any more. The speed of the yen&apos;s rise suggests financial institutions, especially hedge funds and the trading desks of big investment banks, are heavily exposed and have been removing their bets. The yen also achieved the appearance of stability yesterday, even falling slightly against the US dollar, but those investors still sitting on carry trades will be nervous. At some point, they must decide whether to be in or out of that game. If the answer is &quot;out&quot;, more volatility will follow. nils.pratley@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Business"], "title": "Nils Pratley: Bob and the last chance saloon", "sentences": ["Nasdaq&apos;s plan B - its bid for OMX, the Swedish-based exchange - is suddenly threatened by the appearance of a rival cash bidder from Dubai.", "They have always been keen buyers of financial assets, and Dubai&apos;s interest in OMX is the latest example."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/21/viewpointcolumn", "publicationDate": "2007-08-21T22:44:33Z"}, {"article": "The state-controlled investment vehicle of Dubai is betting on the glitzy fortunes of Las Vegas by pumping $5bn (\u00a32.5bn) into a partnership to develop casinos with MGM Mirage - in spite of the fact that the emirate officially forbids gambling.

Architects involved in the project include Lord Foster. Although an Islamic nation, Dubai is renowned for its liberal policies. But while alcohol is tolerated, gambling is strictly forbidden for the emirate&apos;s 1.4 million residents. Dubai World&apos;s chairman, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, brushed aside questions about the apparent conflict of attitudes by pointing out that the company had long owned a small stake in Kerzner International - the owner of the Bahamas&apos; Paradise Island casino. &quot;Through our Kerzner investment we&apos;re already into gambling, so this shouldn&apos;t come as a surprise,&quot; he told the newswire service Bloomberg. The scale of the Las Vegas deal, however, eclipsed Dubai World&apos;s previous gaming involvement and Sultan bin Sulayem suggested the firm would like to increase its stake in MGM to 20% once it receives approval from gaming regulators. Dubai World&apos;s activities in its home nation include building two luxurious off-shore residential projects - the World and the Palm. The company&apos;s recent overseas ventures include buying the QE2, the W Hotel in New York&apos;s Union Square and the department store group Barneys. Two years ago, Dubai World&apos;s ports offshoot, DP World, snapped up P&amp;O for \u00a33.9bn but was forced to offload P&amp;O&apos;s six US ports following a campaign by opponents including Hillary Clinton, who claimed that Arab ownership of American ports was a national security risk.

He could still be on a handy mark. Sense can bring some Joy Sense Of Joy (2.35), so impressive on her debut at Newmarket, will be hard to beat in Goodwood&apos;s Prestige Stakes. A strong pace will be essential for John Gosden&apos;s filly, who is regarded as more of an Oaks than a 1,000 Guineas prospect - and she faces stiff competition from Mistress Greeley, who is also considered a classy juvenile. With the ground drying out, Rayhani (2.05) is reckoned well worth another chance after failing to stay in the Goodwood Cup. Titan Triumph (4.15) has certainly been expensive to follow lately, but the fitting of a tongue strap can see the losses recovered. We understand there is a fair degree of confidence behind Irish challenger Finicius (3.10) in the Celebration Mile, while Sir Michael Stoute&apos;s Echelon has looked in particularly fine shape in recent gallops. Trenchtown (5.05), a promising sixth first time out at Sandown, should step up on that performance over a mile at Goodwood tomorrow. The Roger Charlton team were delighted with the debut running of Melodramatic when fourth to Sharp Nephew at Newbury last week, and this highly regarded filly is being aimed at the Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh tomorrow week. Brian Meehan&apos;s First Trim, a late withdrawal from the opener at Newmarket today, is one to note. Sharp Nephew and Fast Company are outstanding juveniles at Manton. Interestingly, rated third-best is Fool&apos;s Wildcat, who was third at Newbury last week on his second run. He could pop up at a good price in a decent race before long. Flying Goose (2.20) is fancied at Newmarket while Imperial Star (6.15), who looked sharp in a fast-paced, solo spin at home earlier this week, should go well at Windsor, where Queen&apos;s Best (6.45) also gets a favourable mention. Coral Shores (2.35), whose lack of experience found her out first time, will be much sharper at Warwick on Monday. Her trainer, Peter Chapple-Hyam, can also go close with Shallal (3.35) at Ripon, while at Newcastle Alan Swinbank&apos;s Merchant Of Dubai (3.20) is reckoned the one to be on for the Blaydon Nursery.

If the plan is successful, it could cause an uproar in London where LSE management under chief executive Clara Furse and chairman Chris Gibson-Smith have fought off four takeover bids in the past three years, including one from Deutsche Borse. Furse has recently engineered a deal to take over Borsa Italiana and has been feted for keeping London out of foreign hands, while boosting the LSE&apos;s share price to as high as 1,400p. &apos;If the Germans end up with a stake of that size in London, everyone would assume that it would pave the way for a German takeover at some point,&apos; says an analyst. &apos;If they bought the entire holding, they would be obliged under Takeover Panel rules to make an immediate bid for the whole of the LSE.&apos; But it seems doubtful that Deutsche would buy the whole stake as its shareholders, many of them US hedge funds, have made it clear that a merger with London would not be in the interests of investors.

The Nordic stock exchange is the subject of rival bids: one from Nasdaq of the US, whose chief executive Bob Greifeld is seeking a consolation prize after the failure of its aggressive bid for the London Stock Exchange, and the other from Borse Dubai, which is viewed with circumspection by the Swedish regulators. Both offers raise concerns for the Swedes. They will be worried, as London was, that a Nasdaq takeover might usher in onerous US regulation that will hamper the local market. Greifeld did not win any popularity contests in the City, and may not charm the Swedes either unless he has tempered his tactlessness and his tactics. He alienated the LSE&apos;s boss Clara Furse by, among other things, criticising the Aim market, and he mishandled his approach by laying down a final offer that proved too low. Borse Dubai raises issues of its own. It is embroiled in controversy over how it amassed a 25 per cent stake in a dawn raid on 9 August. The Swedish authorities have ruled that it broke the law by not disclosing that the stake-building was a takeover bid, and the Stockholm government is pondering whether it can sell its 6.6 per cent chunk to a law-breaker. In financial terms, Nasdaq, which has offered \u20ac2.7bn in cash and shares, is at a disadvantage against deep-pocketed Dubai&apos;s \u20ac3bn bid. Greifeld&apos;s strongest card is that Nasdaq is a fully-fledged exponent of Western capitalism, whereas Borse Dubai is controlled by the state and ultimately by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum. The Americans have been unfriendly in their attitude to Dubai&apos;s investing ambitions; when the Gulf state took over P&amp;O, politicians forced it to sell its US ports. Nasdaq does not want to appear xenophobic, talking in internal documents about being careful not to be seen as &apos;playing the Arab card&apos;. Sheikh Mohammed is a moderniser, keen to establish Dubai as a financial centre of international standing, but the road has been rocky. Three years ago, for example, there was a huge storm when former UK regulators Ian Hay Davison and Phillip Thorpe were summarily sacked as heads of the fledgling Dubai watchdog after they drew attention to perceived conflicts of interest over land deals. More broadly, there are concerns about the investment activities of foreign states, and Dubai has some way to go to demonstrate it is playing by Western rules. The power struggle among international stock exchanges matters here because our own LSE is one of the most tempting prizes in the great game. Furse has defended her turf against approaches from the Germans, the Australians and Paris-based Euronext as well as Nasdaq. There is speculation that Dubai&apos;s next target will be the LSE; it is not yet ready to make a play for such a large and prestigious exchange, but give it time. The drama playing out in Stockholm now could come to London next. Clouds still linger over the home front A semblance of calm has been restored to stock markets, but it wouldn&apos;t take much to send traders into another tailspin. At least the UK entered the storm in good shape, with growth at 0.8 per cent in the second quarter, or 3 per cent year-on-year. Manufacturers&apos; order books are at their fattest in 12 years, according to the CBI, and Rio Tinto&apos;s coup in raising a record \u00a320bn for its takeover of Alcan showed that the credit crunch is not standing in the way of a proper deal. But the trouble started in the real economy - in the US housing market - and those borrowers are still in trouble, with some fearing the worst property slump since the Great Depression. We are not in the same territory, though the housing market is likely to be hit by a tightening of credit conditions. Repossessions are already at an eight-year high, with 14,000 homes being taken back this year and 125,000 borrowers in arrears. The credit crunch means the Bank of England is less likely to hike rates, but sub-prime rates here, around 8 per cent of the market, are rising. An alarming fact highlighted by accountants Grant Thornton is that personal debt in the UK is now higher than the entire output of the economy (see graph). The country would technically be bankrupt were it not that most of it is secured against housing and can be repaid over time. At least, one hopes so. Barclays&apos; silence on emergency loan is anything but golden Barclays remains tight-lipped on the reasons it tapped the Bank of England last week for an emergency loan of \u00a3314m and the story behind the resignation of Edward Cahill, a senior credit expert. There might well be a perfectly innocent and understandable reason for the loan. The big banks routinely use the Old Lady to cover short-term shortfalls; normally no one notices. Barclays, however, was the first to take advantage since the credit crunch, so its move has attracted attention. Sources say there is no question of any kind of liquidity problems; \u00a3314m is chump change to the big banks. So it is strange that, rather than supply a sensible explanation that would have put the minds of shareholders and customers at ease, Barclays embroiled itself in an unseemly spat with HSBC, which it had approached for a loan that was not processed in time to avoid having to call on the emergency facility. Cahill&apos;s resignation, after he returned from a holiday, comes as a number of vehicles set up by Barclays Capital have run into trouble, but again, the bank declines to discuss the matter. Its silence has the unfortunate effect of leaving question marks hanging in the air - hardly helpful to its own cause as it soldiers on with a contested bid for Dutch operator ABN Amro.

For the 26-year Englishman, who led the PGA Championship after three rounds on his home course of Wentworth back in May only to plummet to 39th place after an embarrassing last-day 84, it was a case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu with a vengeance as he squandered a four-stroke lead.

To his credit he hit a glorious drive and second to nine feet, then downed the putt for a 67, a 12-under-par 268 and a one-stroke win from Luiten, 21 and already a double winner on the Challenge Tour.

Not glossy shots of some earth-shattering new building he has created but small snaps of street life in the age-old courtyards of Beijing. Known as &quot;hutongs&quot;, these are tight webs of hotchpotch homes and alleys gathered around wells. &quot;Most of them will soon be gone,&quot; says the architect, speaking in the Rotterdam headquarters of his company, Oma.&quot;The Olympics next year will find them old-fashioned and unsightly. Those who live there are being given new high-rise flats. These are well-equipped and clean, but people, I think, miss their old life down below in the courtyards.&quot; Yes, down below - with the fruit-sellers, public kitchens, urban bustle and banter, the travelling conjurors and steaming public laundries. All going to make way for the brave new Olympian world. In their place, right in the changing heart of Beijing, no fewer than 300 air-conditioned office blocks and hotels are set to rise. The most dramatic of these hutong-gobblers will be the sensational new headquarters for China Central Television (CCTV), due in time for the Olympics next August, and a world away from the antique courtyards. Its architect? Rem Koolhaas. This is exactly the kind of paradox this highly intelligent and self-questioning architect revels in. In public, he is the master of sock-it-to-me design; in private, he looks with affection at the people and places in his photographs, at an old way of oriental life likely to vanish. And even as the heroic structure of the CCTV building, designed with visionary Arup engineer Cecil Balmond, climbs up noisily into the smog of Beijing, Koolhaas is working quietly on the discreet new headquarters for the banking arm of the Rothschild empire in the City of London. This will be the Dutchman&apos;s first major building in Britain. If you didn&apos;t know better, you would be hard-pressed to guess that it was from the same hand and eye as CCTV. The CCTV tower is nothing if not ambitious. Some 230 metres high, designed in the shape of a 3D Chinese character, its steel structure forms a continuous spatial loop climbing up and around the volume of the building. Inside this complex structural web, there will be a &quot;media village&quot; (more like a city actually), complete with places to eat and play, and a sensational public viewing gallery. It is a rollercoaster of radical ideas. And yet, for all this free-thinking design, the one thing CCTV lacks is freedom of expression. Daring new architecture, yes. Radical internal planning, sure. Sixteen channels broadcast by whizzy new digital technology, check. Yet, for all this, CCTV remains a sub-ministry of the government of the People&apos;s Republic of China, its news programmes controlled by the Propaganda Department. Koolhaas may have designed some of the most challenging, controversial and critically acclaimed ultramodern buildings of the past decade - Seattle public library, Casa da Musica in Porto, the Dutch embassy in Berlin - yet I can&apos;t help thinking that, for all the excitement of working with CCTV, his heart belongs to a world closer to Beijing&apos;s hutongs, something altogether more exotic. Koolhaas, born in Rotterdam in 1944, spent four years of his childhood in Jakarta. &quot;The country was newly independent,&quot; he says. &quot;I lived as if I was an Indonesian.&quot; He loves Indonesia as the British often adore India. His father, Anton, was a distinguished Dutch journalist, novelist and scriptwriter, who became a friend of Sukarno, Indonesia&apos;s first president, a one-time architecture and civil engineering student. Somewhere in the young Koolhaas&apos;s mind, I can&apos;t help thinking, a taste of the exotic was already mixing with a love of writing and of buildings and places that would lead him to work first as journalist, with the Haagse Post, and then as a scriptwriter in the Netherlands and Hollywood, before turning to architecture in 1968. That&apos;s quite a CV for any man, let alone one who had just turned 24. In 1956, Koolhaas returned to Holland and eventually to his home city, Rotterdam. Anyone born in Rotterdam during and after the second world war might have thought of becoming an architect. From May 14 1940, the old city all but ceased to exist, after being targeted by 90 German bombers. Reports of how many people died varies, but 24,978 homes were lost, along with 24 churches, 2,320 shops, 775 warehouses and 62 schools. Some 80,000 people lost their homes. The Dutch government surrendered to the Germans that day, after just five days at war. &quot;Have you always been designing Rotterdam?&quot; I ask, thinking how, as a young man, he might well have dreamed of rebuilding his native city, and how it must be hard to ever get the blitzed city out of his mind. He sits up. &quot;You mean because I was first brought up in a city that, in a way, didn&apos;t exist?&quot; Yes, so it had to be reinvented. And, if you look at Rotterdam today, the postwar city is dotted about with the kind of buildings you might find in China and the Middle East today. Koolhaas turns his pen over and over: &quot;I know what you mean. We do design a lot of buildings in cities in something like the condition of 1940s Rotterdam: Beijing, where they&apos;re pulling down much of the old city to go modern; Dubai, a brand new city growing rapidly like a teenager from the naked desert where there were virtually no buildings before; Abu Dhabi ...&quot; He changes tack: &quot;But, with buildings like Seattle and Porto and the embassy in Berlin, no, these belong to settled cities and draw their inspiration from what&apos;s around them as much as what&apos;s been planned to go inside them. The Casa da Musica [in Porto] is often described as being like a meteor that has collided with the city, but that&apos;s not what we intended; we designed it as a real part of the existing city, a challenging and a provocative player.&quot; When Koolhaas says &quot;we&quot;, he means his 230-strong Oma practice. This stands for the Office for Metropolitan Architecture, founded in London in 1975, though the taxi driver who drops me at the bland Rotterdam office block where Oma has its headquarters, says that Oma means grandma in Dutch. This is also the home of Amo, Oma&apos;s research arm. Koolhaas has published fascinating and sometimes contrary reports and books on countless urban subjects since his first, very successful book, Delirious New York, in 1978. At Harvard, where he is a professor, his post-graduate students work up huge reports on Koolhaas&apos;s pet subjects, such as the way in which China&apos;s Pearl river delta, stretching from Hong Kong to Macau via Guangzhou, was becoming one continuous built-up area - and, more by default than design, effectively the biggest city in the world. Another report looked at how shopping is fuelling urban growth, and changing development and design. So impressed was fashion designer Miuccia Prada with the findings - she has a PhD in political science - that she commissioned Koolhaas to design stores for her fashion empire in the US. The latest Harvard study focuses on Lagos, a city that, typically, intrigues Koolhaas because it is at once venerable and modern, messy and lyrical, rich and poor, energetic and corrupt, but above all alive in a way that his native Rotterdam, a ghost city in August, clearly isn&apos;t. &quot;I like Rotterdam,&quot; he says. &quot;We work here in a cheap office, out of the way with no distractions. We think for ourselves. We are in some ways outside the architectural loop. We do not follow fashion.&quot; And yet Koolhaas is loved by the fashionable. He is one of those architects who receives star treatment in design magazines. Every month, Oma receives more than 1,000 applications from graduates all over the world hoping to work there. Koolhaas has received pretty much every award going. He roosts at the top of the architectural tree with the likes of Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Daniel Libeskind and Toyo Ito. When he says he hates &quot;celebrity&quot; culture, he almost means it. Koolhaas, though, is nothing if not contradictory. A man who thrives on free thinking, he works happily for absolutist governments. An architect who claims to distrust fashions in design, he is responsible for some of the most eyecatching of all new buildings, the Casa da Musica and CCTV chief among them. He is also in the process of designing &quot;anti-icons&quot;, buildings that are almost willfully bland or simplistic, in Dubai. He seems to find the growth of Dubai absurd, yet is very much involved there, with the design of ambitious office buildings (one designed to revolve), apartment blocks and convention centres. Some of Oma&apos;s Dubai designs, such as the proposed Ras-al-Khaimah convention and exhibition centre, look as if they&apos;ve been culled from the pages of sci-fi comics; others seem like slab-sided 1960s office towers. Koolhaas does indeed live at least two lives at once. A tall, wafer-thin man crackling with a quiet energy - he swims, he says, whenever and wherever he can - he has two homes with two women in two separate cities. In Rotterdam, he shares his life with his partner Petra Blaisse, an interior and garden designer; and, in London, he stays with his wife, the artist Madelon Vriesendorp, with whom he has a son and a daughter, both in their 20s. Just as Koolhaas can love the hutongs of Beijing and design the CCTV tower, it seems he can live a complex personal life. In any case, he says, London is the one city where he can happily do nothing. Because he has been willing to take risks, and because he is unlike most architects (who are, on the whole, a more contained and singularly directed species), Koolhaas has had his professional ups and downs. When Oma&apos;s first major building project, a centre for art and media technology in Germany, fell through, Koolhaas worked on his eye-popping book S, M, L, XL, with graphic designer Bruce Mau. Published in 1995, this outlines Koolhaas&apos;s belief that the sheer bigness of cities and their buildings today means that the old classical and Modern Movement rules of design, proportion and planning are largely meaningless. Meanwhile, commissions for projects in exactly such cities poured in. &quot;The market economy thrives on spectacle and novelty,&quot; says Koolhaas. &quot;Its buildings are ever more dramatic. It offers the promise of total freedom, but in architecture this quickly leads to the danger of grotesqueness. It is hard to do serious, disciplined buildings in such a condition. The media, of course, encourages this teenage architecture; it gives most attention to extreme capitalist buildings, to this ever- growing accumulation of architectural extravagance, to fanciful museums full of shops. We calculated that between 1995 and 2005, Oma was asked to propose designs for 34 soccer fields of new museums, all a product of market growth rather than culture. Perhaps there is still a residual nostalgia for refinement, but the pressure is on the other way.&quot; Only too aware of the absurdities of the bigness of today&apos;s cities and their architecture, he nevertheless designs big &quot;iconic&quot; buildings himself, while decrying the practice and researching and designing smaller alternatives. Small wonder that, when I enquire what he plans to do next, he says: &quot;Write more.&quot; Asked recently to remodel the Hermitage galleries in St Petersburg, Koolhaas suggested doing as little as possible, keeping modern architectural intervention to a minimum. Rem Koolhaas is one of the world&apos;s most intriguing architects. He is also an acute observer of politics, economics, cities and the way buildings work. How he manages to balance the two is something of a wonder. Here is an architect who could happily sit down one day with God to design refined and purposeful public buildings knitted into the fabric of old cities, and the next with the devil to design the wayward architecture demanded by ultra-capitalism.", "tags": ["Architecture", "China arts 2008", "Art and design", "Culture", "Rem Koolhaas", "Cities"], "title": "Jonathan Glancey meets architect Rem Koolhaas", "sentences": ["We do design a lot of buildings in cities in something like the condition of 1940s Rotterdam: Beijing, where they&apos;re pulling down much of the old city to go modern; Dubai, a brand new city growing rapidly like a teenager from the naked desert where there were virtually no buildings before; Abu Dhabi ...&quot; He changes tack: &quot;But, with buildings like Seattle and Porto and the embassy in Berlin, no, these belong to settled cities and draw their inspiration from what&apos;s around them as much as what&apos;s been planned to go inside them.", "He is also in the process of designing &quot;anti-icons&quot;, buildings that are almost willfully bland or simplistic, in Dubai.", "He seems to find the growth of Dubai absurd, yet is very much involved there, with the design of ambitious office buildings (one designed to revolve), apartment blocks and convention centres.", "Some of Oma&apos;s Dubai designs, such as the proposed Ras-al-Khaimah convention and exhibition centre, look as if they&apos;ve been culled from the pages of sci-fi comics; others seem like slab-sided 1960s office towers."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/aug/27/architecture.chinaarts2008", "publicationDate": "2007-08-27T10:55:58Z"}, {"article": "There may or may not be a tactical reason why the tennis player Maria Sharapova will be wearing a dress studded with 600 Swarovski crystals when she competes in the US Open this week (perhaps the sun bouncing off them will blind her opponent), but it underlines the ubiquity of this once exclusive brand.

But who will come out on top? And can he or she bring stability? The general Nobody needs a deal as urgently as President Pervez Musharraf. Since his botched attempt to fire the chief justice on March 9 - a miscalculation that galvanised the civilian opposition and sparked massive street protests - his power has ebbed dramatically. The slide was accelerated by an attempt to gag the media and a bloody shooting spree by his supporters in Karachi. Now he is isolated, unpopular and running short of options. But like so many military rulers, he considers himself indispensable and is determined to stay on. Gen Musharraf wants to be re-elected president for another five years in elections to be held by October 15. In theory he could pull it off - his party has the necessary parliamentary majority - but the public mood is ugly. Riots, court challenges or worse are possible. He needs to woo Benazir Bhutto, but her price is high. In addition to removing his uniform, Ms Bhutto wants him to dilute the powers of the presidency. If he agrees, they will divide up power. But whether the general can stomach this downgrade remains to be seen. The lady in waiting It has been a long and lonely exile for Benazir Bhutto, who left Pakistan amid corruption claims in 1999. Her husband, Asif Zardari, was jailed for eight years while she shuttled between London and Dubai, bringing up her children and running her party from a distance. Returning home would have meant prison. Circumstances have swung in her favour. The military is discredited and the time is ripe for the return of a popular civilian leader. But in yoking her carriage to Gen Musharraf, Ms Bhutto is taking a huge risk. Idealists seeking a return to civilian rule are in revolt; her own supporters are uneasy. If a deal is reached, there is no telling whether the political poison surrounding Gen Musharraf will dissipate. A strong opposition could make life difficult for both of them, exploiting a number of weaknesses. Ms Bhutto risks going down with a sinking ship. But, she argues, she has little choice as her party has been in the wilderness for 11 years and cannot afford another five. She says that a deal can bring a &quot;democratic transition&quot; and that the military will remain powerful, no matter what comes to pass. Better to deal with the devil you know, she argues.

According to a survey by a US-based company called Lodging Econometrics, the capital has more than 13,000 rooms&apos; worth of new hotel accommodation in the pipeline - five times as much as the second-placed city, Moscow. And that was before the 2012 Olympics announcement. For an even scarier statistic, the Mayor&apos;s London Plan predicts the capital will need 50,000 extra hotel rooms in the next 20 years. These figures defy belief and, looking at most recent new hotels, conjure up images of a new circle of hell. When was the last time you saw a purpose-built hotel that really contributed something to the built environment? As a building type, hotels have somehow exempted themselves from the ordinary rules of architecture. Of course there are some fine exceptions, but for every Savoy or Metropolitan there are a dozen Travelodges, Premier Travel Inns, Ibises, Holiday Inns and other chain hotels spreading a virus of architectural banality across the nation. Typically, the chain hotel is either a scaled-up domestic house with garish colour added, or a monotonous mid-rise stack of identical boxes of rooms. If that sounds like an exaggeration, go to the Travelodge website and click at random on any one of their 322 hotels in Britain. To test my own theory I&apos;ve just blindly picked Grantham South Witham and Macclesfield Adlington, and as far as I can tell, they are exactly the same design: a sort of two-storey, pitched-roof stretch-Barratt home. For a more urban example, check out the hulking, Soviet-stye Tower Hotel hogging the river front next to Tower Bridge - a regular fixture on public &quot;most-hated&quot; surveys. Part of the problem could be that the people who have to walk and drive past these hotels every day are not the people being courted. Hotels are designed for the comfort of strangers, and as a result they can become strangers themselves - awkward, inward-looking alien buildings that soak up the view but don&apos;t speak the language. If there&apos;s any expense to spend on the design, it is likely to be concentrated on the interiors, in order to create photogenic rooms and restaurants for the brochures and websites. That&apos;s not to say there aren&apos;t some thrilling, spectacular hotel interiors around, but in many cases hotels are five-star on the inside and one-star on the outside. &quot;Hotel building is a very strange world,&quot; agrees John Whiles, of architects Jestico and Whiles. &quot;We&apos;ve been working on hotels for some time, both as architects and interior designers, and a lot of hotel companies separate the two. Usually you design a building from the outside, from an operational point of view, and then the hotel operators come along and work on the interior with their brand standard books, ensuring that all their properties, whether they&apos;re in Hawaii or the UK, have the same door handles in the same place, and all the rooms use the same colour of paint, and so on, which can be a disappointing experience for both the architects and the interior designers.&quot; When architects are given the opportunity to design the inside and the outside, the results are much more satisfying, says Whiles, such as the recently opened Tower Bridge Hilton. Judging by some of the crimes against architecture the Hilton chain has committed across the globe, they&apos;d be better off putting celebrity heiress Paris in charge of design, but to their credit, the chain has attempted to do something better here. It is certainly more considered than the norm in its detailing and materials. Mediating between the Norman Foster-designed office complex around it and the Tooley Street conservation area, it is a mix of glass, ribbed terracotta stone and copper panelling, with louvred screens and touches of colour to diffuse its mass. What&apos;s most striking is the way the building avoids the usual split personality by bringing the same materials to the public areas inside the hotel. There are other encouraging signs. This week an exhibition opens at New London Architecture called Away from Home, which showcases recent developments in hotel design. The good news is that many of the schemes are conversions and refurbishments. Few Londoners will be disappointed to see George Gilbert Scott&apos;s neo-gothic masterpiece above St Pancras Station reopen as a hotel. And there are many examples of conversions of run-down office buildings and town houses into boutique hotels, such as the Zetter in Clerkenwell - converted from the Zetter Pools building - or the chic Moran Hotel in Chiswick, a former 1960s office block. Perversely, Soho&apos;s dilapidated Art Deco gem, the Regent&apos;s Palace Hotel, is being converted into an office block. Most of the current activity, however, is at the lowest end of the price scale. The rise of low-cost flights has triggered a corresponding rise in low-cost, low-space &quot;microtels&quot; - the same companies are even providing both, in the case of easyJet and easyHotel. The outlook is not as depressing as it sounds. Most of them are revamping existing buildings, so in design terms, they are not so much pushing the envelope as squeezing as many rooms as possible into it. Even Travelodge looks to be upping its game, with a couple of new designs that are at least distinguishable from one another. A notable mention is the new Sleeperz chain, which is developing a series of &quot;luxury budget&quot; hotels across Britain. Sleeperz&apos; strategy has been to work with Network Rail on developing difficult sites close to mainline railway termini in major cities such as Manchester, Newcastle and London, with the help of architect Peter Clash. &quot;The hotels, by their very nature have a distinctive quality, because often they&apos;re dealing with awkward geometries,&quot; says Clash. &quot;Because they&apos;re in city centres we often have to develop a relationship with the planners. So even though they are similar in their organisation and rooms, their exteriors are always developed in a different way.&quot; The forthcoming nine-storey Manchester Sleeperz, for example, sits on a tiny triangular piece of land across the road from Manchester Piccadilly station. To the street it presents a transparent, coloured glass fa\u00e7ade, while to the rear it displays more of a railway aesthetic - muted colours and hard-wearing materials. Another project in the pipeline close to London&apos;s Waterloo station responds to the scale and activity of the street, relating its ground level to the market outside and varying its elevations in accordance with surrounding railway viaducts and undercrofts. &quot;They&apos;re very difficult to design technically, getting in the stairs and lifts and so on, but it&apos;s great for us because it creates the possibility of turning what could be a standard product into a differentiated one. And, I think, the client is gradually using this as a selling point. It&apos;s reinventing the station hotel, but very particular to each city.&quot; Predictably, it is much easier to find inspiring hotel architecture at the super-luxury end of the spectrum, although much of it is within mixed-use developments. Two of London&apos;s most high-profile skyscrapers under construction, Renzo Piano&apos;s 70-storey &quot;Shard&quot; in London Bridge, and Ian Simpson&apos;s 52-storey Beetham Tower on Blackfriars Road, will contain five-star hotels as part of their mix. Simpson has already designed similar projects, most notably his spectacular, 48-storey tower in Manchester, 301 Deansgate. Locals either love it or hate Simpson&apos;s slender, lopsided monolith, but it does at least articulate the split between the apartments at the top and the Hilton hotel on the bottom 23 floors. Other high profile architects are at work in the luxury hotel sector, but mostly in other countries. Go somewhere like Switzerland (ideally with a bank account to match), and you&apos;re spoilt for choice between Peter Zumthor&apos;s monumental Therme Vals spa hotel, or Mario Botta&apos;s ludicrously luxurious Schuggen Grand, or Norman Foster&apos;s forthcoming extension to the Dolder Grand, to name but a few. Foster is also at work on a new hotel in Aldwych, to be fair, in addition to luxury destinations in Denmark and Las Vegas. You&apos;ll find Richard Rogers in Spain and David Chipperfield in Hamburg, not to mention what&apos;s probably the most famous and most expensive hotel on the planet, Dubai&apos;s Burj Al Arab, designed by British firm Atkins. But for us average-income city dwellers the overall outlook for hotel design is still not rosy. This exhibition is full of encouraging signs, but they should probably be taken as good examples, rather than a representative sample. Given the projected scale of hotel growth, and the way the industry has become dominated by global operators, there will be many projects destined to appear in surveys of most-hated buildings rather than exhibitions of good architecture. And whatever good intentions are on show, these London projects are unlikely to filter out to Grantham South Witham or Macclesfield Adlington for some time. \u00b7 Away from Home runs at New London Architecture (26 Store St, London WC1E) from Thursday.

Nasdaq built up its stake to become the LSE&apos;s largest shareholder in an attempt to win control, but failed twice. The Qataris, the Singaporean investment group Temasek, the Australian Stock Exchange, Deutsche Borse and a group of Italian investment funds are all said to be interested in Nasdaq&apos;s stake.

It is up to Nasdaq to decide whether to sell a 29.9% holding - anything more would trigger a takeover bid - and sell the rest separately, or place the shares in the market and sell them in smaller chunks. Mr Greifeld has to balance pressure from his investors to get a good price - which only a large chunk with a strategic value would achieve - with his reluctance to sell a big holding to a competitor.

In stark contrast, those with teams floundering at the foot of the table tend to see a fortnight without fixtures as two weeks in which to save their jobs. This month the disparity is highlighted by &quot;Big Sam&quot; and &quot;Little Sam&quot;. While Sam Allardyce could well opt to mark a bright beginning to the campaign at Newcastle United by disappearing somewhere hot for a few days, his successor as manager of Bolton Wanderers will not be straying far from home. &quot;I won&apos;t be getting a break,&quot; admitted Lee, whose side are second bottom of the Premier League. &quot;Although it&apos;s frustrating that a lot of players will be away with their countries we&apos;ve got a lot of things to work on over the next two weeks.&quot; Having transformed Bolton&apos;s playing style, Lee is presiding over something of a velvet revolution and will be using Jamil Qureshi, the club&apos;s recently recruited psychologist, who boasts expertise in hypnosis, to reinforce his message during the coming days. Peter Reid, a former Bolton player and Manchester City, Sunderland and Leeds manager, believes managers are often best advised to adopt a laid-back approach while international football assumes centre stage. &quot;Certainly for the September break players should be extremely fit following pre-season and probably could do with a rest - physically and mentally,&quot; said Reid. &quot;It&apos;s tempting for managers to try out all sorts of things but maybe it&apos;s best to just take the pressure off by letting them chill for a few days or doing fun stuff like playing head tennis.&quot; Sunderland&apos;s Roy Keane and Derby&apos;s Billy Davies have welcomed this respite from league action as an ideal opportunity to choreograph set pieces, arrange defensive walls and bed new signings into their currently stuttering sides, but Neil Warnock, the former Sheffield United manager, is inclined to agree with Reid. &quot;To be honest I don&apos;t think you can do much to turn things round during international breaks,&quot; he said. &quot;And certainly not if you&apos;ve got five, six or more key players away on international duty. There are a lot of training exercises you can&apos;t do properly; you can&apos;t have a proper full-sided game. As far as I was concerned the only really good thing about international breaks was that I got to go to New York last October and see Barbra Streisand in concert.&quot; Significantly, Warnock noted that players who had been temporarily removed from Sheffield United&apos;s relegation and promotion struggles by international call-ups often seemed to benefit from the break. &quot;They often performed better when they returned. The change did them good; going away with their countries usually relaxed them,&quot; he said. &quot;Unless you&apos;re playing for England, the pressure is frequently far less intense with international teams than the Premier League where everyone is under incredible stress.&quot; Other managers opt to &quot;chill&quot; those missing out on call-ups during team-bonding trips. During his periods in charge of Blackburn and Newcastle, Graeme Souness was particularly fond of spiriting players to Dubai - with mixed results. Memorably, Newcastle&apos;s squad had barely shaken out the sand of Jumeirah beach from between their toes before Lee Bowyer (who had been bonding) and Kieron Dyer (newly back from England duty) traded blows during a springtime game against Aston Villa. &quot;Using the winter international breaks to take players somewhere hot can work, though,&quot; said Warnock. &quot;While it&apos;s far too early for that in September, I do think it&apos;s often good for managers to get away on their own with their families during gaps in the season. It can help them see the bigger picture.&quot; Everton players still on Merseyside will have a brutal reminder of a world beyond football on Thursday when they are all scheduled to attend the funeral of Rhys Jones, the 11-year-old Blues fan shot dead in nearby Croxteth. Commendably, at other clubs, first-teamers will be actively involved in using this week&apos;s additional time off to try to prevent similar tragedies. As part of the Premier League&apos;s Creating Chances community initiative, Tottenham&apos;s Aaron Lennon is due at a local housing estate tomorrow night when, under the auspices of the Kickz project, he will coach youngsters potentially at risk of indulging in crime.

Rumour has it that overseas governments, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, are courting UK vice-chancellors with the hope that they will set up campuses in their countries. China and India may be expanding at a mind-boggling rate, but going to university is still the preserve of relatively few. Politicians there are keen to change that. And Britain is enthusiastic to tap into the spoils: tens of thousands of students, many of whom are well-educated and who respect the British university brand. Besides, the thinking goes, how long can the one-way flow in students from China to the UK last? It is already losing pace as China opens its own universities. Glasgow Caledonian University opened a campus for engineering students in Oman in 1996. Nottingham University opened one in Malaysia in September 2000. It set up another in Ningbo, China, in February 2006. Heriot Watt University opened a Dubai campus in 2005. Others have followed suit. Liverpool University chose a different route. Rather than create a campus in China, it started a new institution with Xi&apos;an Jiaotong University. The new university opened last September. Many universities have opted for collaborations, partnerships, exchange programmes and other links, but have stopped short of creating campuses or new institutions abroad. They worry that it will be tricky to keep up the standard of their degrees. They say the unique feel to their university is impossible to export. Ahead of a conference tomorrow that looks into the issue, run by the Agora thinktank, we asked two vice-chancellors to take opposing sides of the debate. The supporter: Sir Colin Campbell International collaboration brings enormous benefit to scholars and societies worldwide. Shared discovery and innovation enhances diplomatic ties, and reinforces relations. British universities are second only to the US in terms of the quality, output and attractiveness of our intellectual capital and physical resources. This was recognised recently by Universities UK, which welcomed the fact that education is one of the UK economy&apos;s greatest success stories. Economic value is important, but there is, for us, an even more crucial motivation. It is the creation of opportunity for talented people - whatever their nationality, culture or social status. The British higher education system is a phenomenal asset, and needs to adapt its position in order to maintain its lead. The education select committee identified two-way partnership as an important way forward. The University of Nottingham devised an &quot;internationalisation&quot;, rather than a &quot;globalisation&quot; strategy, to emphasise reciprocity, not a soft form of colonialism. Setting up abroad required an invitation to play a role in the remarkable modernisation and development of China and Malaysia. We do not wish merely to import international students. This September, Nottingham will have more than 36,500 students. Some 10,000 of these are international, based across all campuses, with nearly 150 nations represented in the UK, 40 in Malaysia, and 30 in China. Developing nations trust those universities that make an in-country commitment. For us, there is wisdom in reaching beyond borders, and clear sense in engaging seriously with another culture from within. This is especially true where levels of understanding - of a fast-changing China, and the Muslim world - need swift and significant improvement. Franchise arrangements are too great a risk to reputation. That is why we have taken the heavy-duty approach: degrees awarded by Nottingham, whether in the UK, Malaysia or China, are exactly the same. Exams, marking and quality assurance are consistent. It also matters to academics that, at the Malaysia campus, we are building a biotechnology research centre with our partners and winning research grants; and that at the China campus a state-of-the-art centre for sustainable energy technologies is under construction, funded from within China. We know that where our campuses bring new opportunities, our researchers will be eager to pursue secondments, and we will be strongly placed to attract staff on the international market. As well as allowing access to a more affordable British education for many international students, we know that we are building partnerships between governments, companies and cultures. We have confidence in the financial sustainability of our overseas campuses, bolstered by the huge political support and investment within each country. We are a not-for-profit organisation and, as such, the returns from all our campuses are reinvested to enhance opportunities for staff and students across the globe.  \u00b7 Sir Colin Campbell is vice-chancellor of the University of Nottingham The detractor: Dr Brian Lang I think the style of learning and teaching in a university is a matter for the university, and at St Andrews our style is very much that the learning and teaching experience is face to face. Our students and staff value highly the community here. The learning experience is a social experience. Our students work in a small historic town, which we damage at our peril. We can&apos;t expand physically in a way that would damage our urban setting. We can&apos;t expand our teaching to create smaller classes, either. So we have to be creative in the way we grow. Some universities have taken the approach of building a campus in another country. We have not chosen that path. With a campus abroad, there can be problems of ensuring that the quality of degrees is maintained and that standards are kept as high as they are in the home institution. I think universities are increasingly asked to have a campus abroad by overseas governments because it is an efficient way of improving higher education. It is very good for a university&apos;s reputation to have a campus abroad when it is done properly. The important thing is to export high standards and to ensure quality. Our approach has been to work with other universities rather than have a campus abroad. For instance, we have a joint teaching English degree with the Beijing Foreign Language Institute. We chose that way of collaborating because the language learning and teaching experience, we believe, needs to be embedded in the culture of teaching and the learning experience. Another aspect to having a campus abroad is that the logistics of having local staff and the financial arrangements can be complex. They have to be watched like a hawk. St Andrews is also developing a joint PhD programme with three South African universities. Postgraduate education is very expensive there and there&apos;s a tendency for postgrads to come to university in the US and Europe and then stay after they graduate. Our PhD programme is designed to build PhD capacity in Africa and to encourage the new PhD students to remain in South Africa. There is no need to go to the expense of having a campus abroad, such as having local staff, paying rent and the travel costs of going back and forth. A campus abroad would be expensive. We would rather spend money on people than the cost of buildings. We are also growing our distance-learning programmes. We are doing a taught masters in divinity through distance learning, for example. Our approach here has been a very careful and incremental one. We can make our experts more widely available and reach more students than if we had a campus abroad. We wouldn&apos;t hope to export an exact replica of St Andrews overseas because it would be difficult to export our 15th-century cathedral or our ancient medieval streets or our pubs. And those are part of the feeling and the experience of St Andrews. We have to expand in a smart way. \u00b7 Dr Brian Lang is principal and vice- chancellor of St Andrews University", "tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "UK news"], "title": "The long arm of the British university", "sentences": ["Heriot Watt University opened a Dubai campus in 2005."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/sep/04/highereducation.internationaleducationnews", "publicationDate": "2007-09-04T22:38:38Z"}, {"article": "Jason White traces his finger along the scarred knee that kept him out of international rugby for nine months. &quot;Obviously there has been a bit of muscle wastage in the leg,&quot; he says, gazing down on a thigh so colossal it might give a lumberjack pause for thought. &quot;But hopefully that will come back to normal in due time.&quot; Professional rugby players, of course, measure themselves by different physical standards to mere mortals&apos;, so it will be of little consolation to Scotland&apos;s 6ft 5in, 19-stone flanker that his supposedly &quot;wasted&quot; leg muscles have neither diminished his stage presence nor tempered the mood of his Scotland team-mates, who are as one in expressing their delight in having their talismanic captain back on the field in time for their Rugby World Cup opener against Portugal on Sunday. &quot;He&apos;s a world-class player - Scottish player of the year, English player of the year [with Sale Sharks] and the Scottish internationalist of the year - and it makes you feel good about yourself and about the team to know he&apos;s there, leading from the front,&quot; says the squad&apos;s young hooker, Ross Ford. Chris Paterson, who has played alongside White at every level of international rugby from schoolboy onwards, performed admirably as a stand-in captain during last season&apos;s Six Nations but is more than happy to see White return to the ranks. &quot;In all the years I&apos;ve been playing with Jason I have never seen him have a bad game or lose his focus. As a captain he never falls into the trap of talking for the sake of talking and backs up whatever he is saying by his actions. He is a world-class player, someone you take pleasure in playing for. It is great to have him back and already playing so well.&quot; White has a welter of hard training and two warm-up internationals under his belt, against Ireland and South Africa, but since rupturing a knee ligament against Romania last November at Murrayfield his mind has never wavered from its principal target of contributing to the Scottish cause in France.  His efforts in both warm-ups were eye-catching, not least because he did not look out of place despite having been away for so long. &quot;Mentally I felt fine because of the way Frank [Hadden, Scotland&apos;s coach] had done the training. We had a lot of 15 on 15, some contact, some non-contact, and we also had a 10s tournament in St Andrews. That gave me a chance to get over any mental barriers with respect to my injury,&quot; he says, although he is quick to point out that he still has some way to go to achieve the standards set before his lay-off. &quot;Playing in the warm-ups my main effort was to try and get my brain to work quickly enough for international rugby, to make good decisions. I thought I did OK. I made the tackles and took the ball up. I suppose you could argue that no one ever plays the perfect game of rugby, but I&apos;m not kidding myself - I am not the player I was before. How long will it take to get me up to full speed? I don&apos;t really know - maybe three or four games.&quot; Scotland will hope their captain can produce his best rugby even earlier than that. Yet if he falls short of his own standards it is safe to assume no one in a dark-blue shirt will give him a hard time. It would be disappointing, naturally, but the 29-year-old flanker had plenty of time during his recuperation to contemplate even more unpalatable scenarios. &quot;There was never any doubt that I would get back in time for the World Cup, at least not in my mind, but nevertheless the injury did make me think about things,&quot; he reflects. &quot;What if I wasn&apos;t able to get back? What would I do with the rest of my life? Don&apos;t get me wrong, I have always valued playing for Scotland, but now that it was taken away from me for such a long time I am going to value it even more.&quot; Much of the Aberdonian&apos;s lay-off was spent undertaking an intensive regime that took him from Oswestry, where his knee was operated on, to the United States, where he received guidance from knee specialists, to Dubai, where he watched this year&apos;s Calcutta Cup defeat in the company of England&apos;s Andy Sheridan. He also fitted in a few days&apos; work experience, courtesy of the rugby players&apos; association, most memorably with a hair products company. &quot;Don&apos;t snigger,&quot; he says when it is suggested he doesn&apos;t seem the hair-care type. &quot;Everybody gets their hair cut, don&apos;t they? You would be surprised if you knew how big the hair-products industry is.&quot; For the moment, there is Pool C of the 2007 Rugby World Cup and the disparate challenges offered by Portugal, Romania, Italy and New Zealand. The first two matches should present little difficulty for White and his colleagues, and most judges have dismissed Scotland&apos;s chances of getting a result against New Zealand at Murrayfield. That leaves the match against Italy as the pivotal one. Yet if Scotland&apos;s captain does not demur from this straightforward assessment, he is more reluctant to indulge in broader predictions. Scottish fans may be in search of solace after recent upheavals that have reduced their professional game to something resembling a joke but they will not get much of it from White, who prefers realism to rabble-rousing. &quot;I think the easiest thing to do would be to set a goal saying you are going to win the World Cup, but that is probably only for the big nations: New Zealand, South Africa, Australia and - they would say this because they are usually quite sure of themselves - England,&quot; he says. &quot;But for Scotland I think we have to face facts, given our player numbers.

That company burst a wider bubble around speculative stocks when it produced water rather than oil from a much-hyped well in the Mediterranean. Max Petroleum is searching for oil and gas in Kazakhstan and had reached a stock market value of \u00a3670m this summer despite producing a tiny amount of oil - 1,800 barrels a day. &quot;Obviously there&apos;s some uncertainty around the company following today&apos;s announcement, and it was felt that trading should be suspended until it is resolved,&quot; Michael Young, the company&apos;s chief financial officer, said.

In front of the House committee on government reform, he pleaded with politicians to relax the visa restrictions that were causing havoc for international artists hoping to perform in the US. It&apos;s rare for a classical musician to have the ear of political leaders, a position rock stars such as Bono and Bob Geldof seem to have monopolised in the media. But Yo-Yo Ma has that status, in real and fictional life (he performed for the president in an episode of The West Wing). &quot;While very few Americans have the opportunity to travel to rural India, and even fewer to rural Kyrgyzstan,&quot; Ma testified, &quot;the arts allow everyone to catch a glimpse into these other worlds through their music, their dance and their art. Encouraging artists and institutions to foster these artistic exchanges - bringing foreign musicians to this country and sending our performers to visit them - is crucial.&quot; It&apos;s not suprising Ma takes a global perspective. He was born in Paris to Chinese parents in 1955, and moved to New York aged seven. &quot;My biggest goal in life, even as a child, was the wish to understand,&quot; explains a youthful and fresh-faced Ma when we meet on a wet Sunday in Manchester. &quot;When we moved to America, everything was so confusing to me. The world was hard to understand because we had moved countries and languages. But it was also impossible for me to make choices between cultures. Why, as an eight-year-old boy, should I give up lovely croissants and go for white bread just because I lived in the US now, not Paris?&quot; It&apos;s exactly that cross-cultural awareness that has fuelled the Silk Road project, of which Ma is founder and artistic director. It&apos;s an artistic exploration of the cultures found along the ancient trade routes connecting Asia with the Mediterranean. Many of the Silk Road musicians first came together at a workshop at the famed Tanglewood Music Centre in Massachusetts in 2000, under Ma&apos;s artistic direction. Since then, various combinations of these artists - from Armenian duduk virtuoso Gevorg Dabaghyan to Mongolian composer Byambasuren Sharav - have intermingled western and non-western classical, folk and popular music in Silk Road performances and commissions in Europe, Asia and North America. Today, the ensemble is an ever-evolving group of musicians and composers giving concerts and making acclaimed recordings. It even led to a year-long Silk Road festival and education initiative in Chicago that culminated this June and inspired New Impossibilities, Ma&apos;s latest recording with the city&apos;s famous symphony orchestra. As a geographical reality, the Silk Road encompasses more than 3 billion people - over 60% of the world&apos;s population. But to Ma, as an idea it exists everywhere: &quot;When we talk about a Silk Road experience, we don&apos;t mean simply the cultural exchange brought about by caravans travelling across deserts, but something much broader. Whether the intercultural development of the tango in Argentina or the transport of indigo dye from India to Cape Verde to the Caribbean, to the term blues to the jeans we wear today, the collaboration and creativity of mini Silk Roads have given birth to some of the most extraordinary cultural evolutions.&quot; In an age when the countries along the Silk Road have become the faultline of cultural and political conflict, Ma&apos;s project has far deeper resonances. Its scope has inevitably led to major challenges - not least the very visa chaos about which Ma complained on Capitol Hill. Two of his Iranian musicians, despite having performed in the States eight times before, had to fly to a consular office in Dubai twice over three months before obtaining visas for a recent US tour. The process cost $5,000 and much resentment. But Ma insists the project is &quot;a way of examining our differences without looking at present-day political realities&quot;. Ma also sees the Silk Road project as a way of challenging classical music&apos;s own orthodoxies and insecurities in an age dominated by pop music. &quot;Nobody today grows up listening to just one type of music - it&apos;s impossible,&quot; says the musician who, in 2002, performed with Sting during the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. &quot;I&apos;m neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the outlook for classical music. I think if we partake in a tradition, we have to ask how it is going to live on. You have to ask if what you are doing is seeding something, something you actually believe in. I could be playing the cello and just figured out the most fantastic way to play a phrase, but nobody would realise that point unless I could communicate it to them effectively.&quot; Just as Ma&apos;s willingness to learn isn&apos;t restricted by musical genre, nor is his determination to communicate restricted by medium. It&apos;s one reason why his appearances have not been confined to concert halls, why he has also been willing to appear on TV shows such as Sesame Street: &quot;So often, music education seems to be about bringing kids to the concert hall, which is great, but on the TV show I was a guest invited into their world. That&apos;s really powerful, and it means that the cello and a cellist is never going to be an unfamiliar figure to those kids.&quot; As well as his discography of 70-plus recordings and regular TV appearances, he&apos;s also exploited the potential of film. In the 1990s, he made Inspired By Bach, a memorable series of films based around the six Bach Cello Suites, the musical Mount Everest every cellist hopes one day to climb and for which Ma has won one of his numerous Grammy awards. The films were collaborations with - among others - choreographer Mark Morris and garden designer Julie Moir Messervy in Canada. As well as providing further evidence of Ma&apos;s intellectual openness and curiosity, it&apos;s also a tantalising glimpse into what directions he might have taken had he chosen not to pursue music. &quot;My true passion is to contextualise,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t know whether I would have the talent to be anything other than a musician - but growing and cultivating is what musicians are all about. So, in a way, the film about the garden was a metaphor for life. Music is very ephemeral, but I&apos;ve always thought that the creation of music was what made us evolve from hunter-gatherers. Like music, a garden is not just about creating something beautiful - it&apos;s also about the struggle to get there. And, like music, it&apos;s not about winning anything, it&apos;s about being able to build something over a period of time. &quot;It&apos;s what I think we are trying to do with the Silk Road,&quot; he concludes, &quot;but there&apos;s still a huge amount of digging to do to touch on those shared connections.&quot;  Yo-Yo Ma&apos;s latest Silk Road recording, New Impossibilities, is out now on Sony Classical.", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture"], "title": "Paul Cutts meets cellist Yo-Yo Ma", "sentences": ["Two of his Iranian musicians, despite having performed in the States eight times before, had to fly to a consular office in Dubai twice over three months before obtaining visas for a recent US tour."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/sep/07/classicalmusicandopera", "publicationDate": "2007-09-06T23:18:06Z"}, {"article": "Nasdaq has extended the deadline for the sale of its 31% stake in the London Stock Exchange into next week as it looks to get a better price from a slew of potential bidders.

But today &quot;the peasants&quot;, as some of the residents cheerfully describe themselves, are revolting - in a rally in the Royal Square against a new tax which they claim will hurt the poor to benefit the fabulously wealthy. &quot;Jersey people tend not to demonstrate,&quot; said Suzette Hase, one of the organisers of the rally and of a petition which has been signed by around a fifth of the island&apos;s 90,000 population. &quot;It&apos;s not a normal thing for them to do but they will if they think they are being ripped off.&quot; The immediate cause of the demonstration is a plan to introduce a new goods and services tax (GST) which the States of Jersey government argues is essential to fill a &quot;black hole&quot; in the economy caused by their decision to cut income tax on companies to zero (10% on finance companies) in order to keep the island competitive with rival havens like the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands. Attention on Jersey in the past has focused on famous tax exiles - Geoffrey Boycott, Alan Whicker, Jack Higgins, Gilbert O&apos;Sullivan and Ian Woosnam - who pay a maximum of 20% on their income. But the bigger players by far are the companies which, between them, have more than \u00a3400bn in bank deposits and funds under administration in Jersey. The government is anxious that they should not depart. &quot;Better to get less tax from business than risk losing the finance industry altogether,&quot; is how the official government guide to the new tax puts it in its four-page supplement in the Jersey Evening Post this week. &quot;Imposing a higher rate of tax on incomes would ... simply encourage the wealthy, who are also the most mobile, to move elsewhere.&quot; Instead, the 3% GST is being introduced. The decision to bring in the tax was made by a majority of the island&apos;s representatives - 12 senators, 12 constables and 29 deputies - in April, and the chief minister, Frank Walker, is adamant the new tax is essential. &quot;We have to fill that black hole and they are not offering any alternatives,&quot; he said of the protesters. Alan Breckon, chairman of the Consumer Council and a deputy (representative), said dismay was widespread. &quot;Individuals are concerned about their basic living costs because Jersey is a pretty expensive place to live and businesses are concerned because of all the red tape they will have to deal with.&quot; Residents say the concentration on the tax status of Jersey by its government has been to the detriment of the society. &quot;Walker is a multimillionaire [he is the former publisher of the local newspaper] who has no concept of what it is like to struggle on a very small income,&quot; said John Heys, who spent 25 years in the RAF. &quot;Now we have all our eggs in the finance basket and those people could just flap their wings and be off to Dubai. We used to have a thriving tourism industry but we&apos;ve lost 30 or 40 hotels. I find what has happened here very depressing.&quot; Mr Heys advocates the payment of death duties and development tax. &quot;If this was France we would have had a revolution years ago.&quot; Richard Murphy, an accountant and adviser to the organisation Tax Justice Network, said: &quot;The tax exiles are a sad bunch but they are not the problem - that&apos;s the tax haven industry and their pressure to charge income tax on companies at zero per cent. &quot;The fact that the ordinary people of Jersey are going to have a rally is an indication that there is massive disquiet. These people are going to be paying a subsidy to ensure that people and companies who can really afford to pay their taxes do not have to. It&apos;s a case of tax the poor to support the rich in Jersey, and you can see why people are protesting.&quot; The stakes were further upped this week when one former supporter of the tax who has changed his mind called for a referendum. Simon Crowcroft, a St Helier constable, said if the government believed it had carried out a proper consultation it should have nothing to fear from putting it to the vote. &quot;It is not over yet,&quot; said Alan Breckon. &quot;We have to ask ourselves: are we, as a government, morally bankrupt when we are taxing pensioners on a loaf of bread?&quot; At a glance Population: 89,300 Area: 118 square km Distance from England: 140km Status: Crown dependency, not part of the United Kingdom but owes allegiance to British crown.

Now my phone has been cut off as I can&apos;t afford to pay the inflated bills - it hit pounds 300 in July. Please help. JL Surrey Your problem was caused by the little-known habit of recycling mobile phone numbers. All operators - including T-Mobile - have a limited number allocation but waste many when contracts end or when new buyers change back to old numbers. Regulator Ofcom allows re-use of these old numbers after six months&apos; &quot;hibernation&quot; to ensure payments or content contracts for horoscopes or football results are wiped clean. T-Mobile did this with your number but sms.ac, which dealt with your number&apos;s previous owner, failed to remove the service. So you were hit with charges each month, only noticing when they reached such a level they bust your bank account. Your phone was then suspended as your bill remained unpaid. T-Mobile did not deal with your original complaint because it does not have any relationship with sms.ac. Instead, it deals with an &quot;aggregator&quot; which organises content providers. But T-Mobile now tells Capital Letters it discovered sms.ac had acted improperly in more than one case and it is now the subject of an investigation by premium rate regulator, Icstis. T-Mobile told the aggregator to drop sms.ac, the subject of complaints on American consumer websites. T-Mobile will now write to say sorry. More importantly, it will send you a cheque for pounds 1,847.50 - the sum of your sms.ac deductions over the past three years - and ensure your account is unfrozen without any overhanging credit reference problems. Breaking point over Churchill&apos;s response On August 2 my VW Golf wing mirror was destroyed by a motorist who did not stop. My garage gave me a pounds 338 estimate. My insurer, Churchill, made an appointment to look at the car, but this never happened. I am elderly, have a blue disability badge, and am totally dependent on my car which cannot be used without a mirror because it will fail its MoT. I am now running out of food and other necessities. Please help? ZF London It seems surprising Churchill wanted to inspect the car and not let the garage just go ahead with the repair for such a small claim. Deducting your pounds 200 excess leaves the insurer with a bill of just pounds 138. Churchill says it tried to visit but you were not at home. It then failed to arrange another visit, due to &quot;a breakdown in communications&quot;. Churchill will apologise, tell the garage to go ahead, and waive the pounds 200 excess. Why can&apos;t they tap in to my water meter? I am a private estate tenant and get water from a private bore-hole. The estate put in meters reducing my bill (I live alone). But our waste water is dealt with by Southern Water, which does not recognise our meters. If it did, I would pay less, as charges will be based on usage (low), not rateable value (high). Southern Water won&apos;t discuss this. Can you help? SMSussex You were told nothing could be done as Southern did not have a contractual requirement to recognise your meters. But Southern proved to be more understanding when Capital Letters called. It says it would have got back to you earlier but it has been bedding-in a new billing system which led to some teething problems causing delays in dealing with correspondence. It will now arrange a meeting with the estate manager and, providing the meters have been installed to regulator OfWat&apos;s standards, it would be willing to bill you on a usage basis in future. Renault faces turbocharged complaint In January I bought a 2003 Renault Megane 1.9 DCI with a full service history. Last month, the turbo failed prematurely. I discovered this was a known problem with this engine and Renault should replace it for free. Our local dealership contacted Renault which agreed on a new turbo. But when the dealer started the work, he discovered the catalytic converter was flooded with oil and the whole exhaust system needs replacing - a further pounds 800 - due to the turbo failure. Why should I pay this? DM Birmingham You were originally told the exhaust would also be replaced &quot;as a goodwill gesture&quot; but this was rescinded as the car had 88,000 mileage and someone at Renault decided the exhaust replacement limit was 80,000 miles. However, Capital Letters argued that the exhaust problem was a direct consequence of the turbo failure - and had nothing to do with &quot;goodwill&quot;, a formula designed to avoid legal liability. Renault said it had now carried out a further diagnosis of your car, confirming the turbo was linked to the exhaust. It will now pay for all the repairs to get your car back on the road.

But it is paid with tax deducted, even though no one pays tax here. Is this right? AW Dubai Yes. According to expert Peter Horn at international tax consultants Blevins Franks, all UK pensions are taxed here under PAYE - although you do get your personal allowance. As Dubai is a tax haven, with no tax treaty with the UK, the matter stops there. You cannot reclaim the tax. However, if you lived in a nation with a tax treaty, such as France or Spain, you would be taxed in your country of residence. An added complication is that your occupational pension comes from a local authority, and most &quot;government&quot; pensions including civil service, local government, armed services, fire brigade and police are usually ignored in double tax treaties.", "tags": ["Money"], "title": "Tony Levene fights for your consumer rights", "sentences": ["AW Dubai Yes.", "As Dubai is a tax haven, with no tax treaty with the UK, the matter stops there."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/sep/08/moneysupplement11", "publicationDate": "2007-09-08T22:55:09Z"}, {"article": "Blaze at chemical factory A large fire broke out at a chemical factory in Ayrshire last night.

Bhutto, who was exiled from Pakistan eight years ago after two stints in government that both ended amid accusations of incompetence and scandal, said her campaign would be inspired by the old slogan of her Pakistan People&apos;s Party (PPP) - &apos;food, clothing, shelter&apos;. &apos;Under my leadership, the PPP will bring moderation, democracy and the basics that the nation&apos;s poorest need,&apos; she said. &apos;We represent the underprivileged, the peasants, women, young people, the minorities, all those who have been neglected by elite governments.&apos; Bhutto, many of whose key supporters are drawn from among the so-called &apos;feudal&apos; landowners of Pakistan&apos;s south and east, confirmed talks with representatives of General Pervez Musharraf, who has ruled Pakistan since taking power in a bloodless coup in 1999. &apos;Pakistani politics is a rollercoaster ride,&apos; Bhutto told The Observer. &apos;We were 80 per cent there, then negotiations stalled, then we started off again. My return will take place irrespective of the dialogue process.&apos; Bhutto, educated at Oxford and Harvard and the first woman to govern a post-colonial Muslim state, risks imprisonment if she returns to Pakistan, as multi-million-pound corruption charges dating from the mid-1990s are still outstanding. However, with his popularity at an all-time low, Musharraf may be tempted to do a constitutional deal with Bhutto to give his rule some much-needed domestic and international democratic legitimacy. Time is, however, running out for the former premier to return. Both Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, the Prime Minister ousted in a coup by Musharraf nine years ago and subsequently given a life sentence for hijacking, want to be present for presidential elections that, for constitutional reasons, have to be held within four months, but are likely to take place within six weeks. The exiled Sharif said yesterday he would stick to his plan to return to Pakistan tomorrow despite a request from Saudi Arabia to abandon his planned trip. &apos;I will go back to Pakistan on 10 September with my brother because my country needs me,&apos; he told a news conference in London, hours after an envoy urged him to respect a Saudi-brokered deal made in 2000 under which he had agreed to leave Pakistan for 10 years. It is unclear what kind of welcome he might receive in a country ruled by a man he once attempted to kill. Bhutto is now almost certain to return herself, albeit after Sharif. To become premier once more, she would have to reverse a constitutional amendment passed in the aftermath of the 1999 coup and directed at her and Sharif that limits individuals to two terms as Prime Minister. &apos;I am doing this for the constitution, not for personal benefit,&apos; Bhutto said. &apos;If the people of Pakistan want me there and want to trust me with the leadership of my country it will be a great honour to accept it.&apos; Pakistan&apos;s government yesterday urged Sharif not to return home. A judge has already said that the industrialist&apos;s brother faces arrest on terrorism charges. Mohammed Ali Durrani, the Information Minister, reiterated that Sharif had only been allowed to leave because of the pledges he made to the leaders of several countries, including Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, to stay away. &apos;Sharif should honour his word and should respect the commitment he had made with certain Islamic countries to secure his release. He should not come,&apos; Durrani said. Despite widespread discontent with continuing military rule, Pakistani commentators have not greeted the news of the return of Sharif and Bhutto with any notable enthusiasm. &apos;As ever, everyone is posing as the saviour of Pakistan. We have the old saviour, Sharif, the older saviour, Bhutto and the oldest saviour of all, the army,&apos; said Najam Sethi, editor of Pakistan&apos;s Friday Times. &apos;If they can do a deal and put aside the authoritarianism and personal ambition they have always shown then they can do some good. If not, it will just be a disaster.&apos; Bhutto insisted that her policies would bring growth, jobs and healthcare to Pakistan&apos;s poor. &apos;Food, clothing and shelter, that&apos;s the basis of the PPP,&apos; said the veteran politician, who splits her time between Dubai and London. The slogan was coined by her father, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, when he launched the PPP in 1967, 12 years before he was hanged by military dictator Zia ul-Haq. Despite a series of referendums and elections, Musharraf has never successfully established a strong democratic base and has been forced to rely on fringe groups or breakaway factions of Pakistan&apos;s main political parties to bolster his rule. Critics say this has led to a surge in Islamic militancy; yesterday a bomb exploded outside an army-run bank in the restive frontier town of Peshawar. Musharraf has struggled to maintain a balance between policies that please Western allies such as the US and that are acceptable to a population that has shown itself to be increasingly anti-American. The recent armed assault on Islamic militants who had been allowed to establish a stronghold in a mosque in the centre of Islamabad, the capital, was well received by the West and endorsed by Bhutto, but caused angry demonstrations in much of Pakistan.", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "I see a new future for Pakistan, says Bhutto", "sentences": ["&apos;Food, clothing and shelter, that&apos;s the basis of the PPP,&apos; said the veteran politician, who splits her time between Dubai and London."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/09/pakistan.jasonburke", "publicationDate": "2007-09-09T22:29:20Z"}, {"article": "Pakistan&apos;s former prime minister Nawaz Sharif left London last night on course for a stormy showdown with President Pervez Musharraf in a defiant bid to end his seven-year exile. Mr Sharif, who was ousted in a 1999 military coup, faces the prospect of arrest or deportation when he arrives at Islamabad airport on a scheduled flight from London at 11.45am (7.45am BST) today. The government has banned political rallies, arrested hundreds of opposition officials and declared an airport &quot;terror alert&quot; in an effort to scotch plans by Sharif supporters for a rousing welcome. Local media reported that intelligence officials had taken up positions throughout the airport, where mobile phone jamming devices and additional surveillance cameras had been installed. Mr Sharif said he was undeterred. &quot;I&apos;m feeling great,&quot; he said as uniformed British police escorted him through a crowd of supporters at Heathrow airport on his way to the flight last night. &quot;My ambition is very clear, I have to take Pakistan back to the rule of democracy, because unless we have this, we will continue to be in a state of mess, as we are today,&quot; he told reporters on the plane as he waited for takeoff. Earlier, he acknowledged that it might be dangerous to return. &quot;I know that this is a risky course and there are dangers in it for me, but I am doing this for Pakistan,&quot; he told Geo news from London. &quot;I will be happy that for a small price - my going to jail - Pakistan will win freedom.&quot; In Islamabad, Mr Sharif&apos;s supporters planned giant rallies to converge on the airport as he arrives. &quot;The government&apos;s knees are shaking,&quot; said a spokesman, Ahsan Iqbal. &quot;Gen Musharraf is already defeated.&quot; The deputy information minister, Tariq Azim, said there were &quot;no special plans&quot; for Mr Sharif, but hinted that he faced arrest. &quot;He will be allowed to land and treated like any other commercial passenger. What happens after that is up to the legal experts,&quot; he said. There was a whiff of panic about government efforts to thwart Mr Sharif, who has unexpectedly positioned himself on the frontline of efforts to oust Gen Musharraf. At the weekend police rounded up hundreds of Sharif supporters across the Punjab - his party claimed 2,500 - while many others disappeared into hiding. The drama took a surprise twist on Saturday when the head of Saudi Arabia&apos;s intelligence services, Prince Muqrin bin Abdul Aziz, appeared in Rawalpindi alongside the prominent Lebanese politician Saad Hariri, urging Mr Sharif to respect a 2000 agreement in which he promised to remain in exile for a decade. &quot;It is here and signed,&quot; said Prince Muqrin, waving a copy of the agreement before reporters. But in London Mr Sharif rejected that assertion and claimed that he understood the deal, under which he escaped a sentence of life imprisonment, would lapse in 2005. On arrival in Islamabad, Mr Sharif plans to go by road to his political heartland in Lahore in a giant motorcade intended to further undermine Gen Musharraf. The general has several options, none of them palatable. He could have Mr Sharif bundled on to a plane and flown to Saudi Arabia, as he did when his brother Shahbaz tried to return in 2004. But that would trigger a fresh confrontation with the supreme court, which ruled on August 23 that Mr Sharif has an &quot;inalienable&quot; right of return. The most likely course may be arrest. Last week the courts revived corruption charges against Mr Sharif and a murder accusation against his brother. But arrest would almost certainly trigger protest and violent unrest. Gen Musharraf&apos;s greatest hope may lie with the other exiled former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, though power-sharing talks in Dubai have stalled and Ms Bhutto says she will announce her own return date to Pakistan on Thursday.", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Sharif return prompts government crackdown", "sentences": ["Gen Musharraf&apos;s greatest hope may lie with the other exiled former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, though power-sharing talks in Dubai have stalled and Ms Bhutto says she will announce her own return date to Pakistan on Thursday."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/10/pakistan.declanwalsh", "publicationDate": "2007-09-09T23:29:36Z"}, {"article": "Out of sight and mind for almost two decades, inmate number 38699-079 completed his sentence yesterday an older, frailer figure than the world remembered. Manuel Noriega served out his time at Miami&apos;s Federal Correctional Institution with a gammy leg, his hair dyed and in the uniform of an army which no longer exists, a bogeyman from another era. It was a return to the limelight, but not a return home. The former dictator is to be sent across the Atlantic to become France&apos;s prisoner; only afterwards, truly a relic, can he return to Panama. The 73-year-old general no longer has a machete in his fist nor an army to command, but he still inspires enough anxiety for three governments to play an elaborate game of pass the parcel. Noriega has served almost 18 years for drug racketeering in a special Miami cell, dubbed the presidential suite because it had two rooms, a television and an exercise bike. He wants to return to Panama, the country he ruled and ravaged in the 1980s, despite convictions there for embezzlement, corruption and murder, including that of an opponent who was decapitated. Rather than allow him back, the US has decided to extradite him to Paris to face money laundering charges and up to 10 years behind bars. Noriega will remain in US custody while appealing, but is likely to lose. Few want him back in Panama. &quot;There has been a deal to keep him away from here,&quot; said Mario Rognoni, a friend and former cabinet minister who is one of those few. &quot;It&apos;s not right.&quot; The extradition fight is the latest chapter of a spectacular downfall. Once Central America&apos;s alpha strongman and CIA ally, Noriega fell out with Washington in the late 1980s over deals with cocaine cartels and increasing repression. President George Bush ousted him in a 1989 invasion named Operation Just Cause. Civilian casualties, looting and suspicion over US motives prompted critics to rename it Operation Just &apos;Cuz. But the similarities with Iraq end there; today, few Panamanians question the price of deliverance. While Noriega languished in Miami, US troops withdrew and the country transformed from a cowed, bankrupt backwater into a democratic, economic dynamo. The question is whether it is ready to have him back. &quot;Noriega&apos;s time brought a lot of pain and suffering, but we have been able to overcome that,&quot; Samuel Lewis Navarro, Panama&apos;s vice-president and foreign minister, told the Guardian. &quot;Democracy is flourishing and the economy is producing jobs and prosperity.&quot; Consecutive elections have been peaceful, and economic growth has roared ahead at more than 8% in 2006 and the first quarter of 2007. A forest of cranes and new skyscrapers loom over Panama City and 4x4s clog the avenues. A \u00a32.5bn expansion of the Panama Canal started last week, and a \u00a32.4bn Dubai-style centre is planned for the city&apos;s outskirts. Inequality and squalor endure but are largely invisible to the tourists who pack hotels and restaurants. &quot;We&apos;re fashionable, everyone wants to come here to do business,&quot; beamed Aristides Hernandez, an economic consultant. The area around the Vatican embassy, where Noriega sought refuge before surrendering to US forces, is unrecognisable. In place of the school football pitch where thousands of protesters gathered to demand his head, there is a gleaming shopping centre selling Lacoste and Calvin Klein; where the Americans once used loud rock music to unnerve the general, the air is filled with construction drilling. &quot;I actually prefer that to the music. God it was awful, boom boom boom, day and night,&quot; said Alcibiadez Correa, 58, a security guard present during the acoustic assault in 1989. With more than half the population aged under 30, and Noriega&apos;s army and &quot;dignity battalions&quot; of militia long since abolished, Panama is a different country. Does it fear the return of Noriega, a limping septuagenarian grandfather who says he has found Jesus? No, said Mr Navarro, the vice-president. The general is &quot;politically irrelevant&quot; and the government was &quot;disappointed&quot; he would face justice in France instead of Panama, where he faced much more serious charges. &quot;We would like him back.&quot; That claim is widely scorned. &quot;They do not want him, it&apos;s obvious,&quot; said Julio Berrios, one of Noriega&apos;s lawyers. Commentators and diplomats agree the government soft-pedalled its extradition request to keep &quot;Pineapple Face&quot;, so-called because of his pock-marked features, on the far side of the Caribbean. In return for pursuing his extradition for buying three Paris apartments with drug money, France will be rewarded with commercial contracts in Panama, alleged Mr Berrios, echoing widespread cynicism about contracts and tenders. The US has made no secret of its desire to keep Noriega out of Central America. The former intelligence chief is wealthy and astute enough to unsettle Panama&apos;s small ruling elite, an oligarchy of half-a-dozen families which includes so many former regime cronies, such as Daniel Delgado Diamante, the justice minister, that it has been nicknamed Noriegaville. A recent law change to allow those aged over 70 to serve jail sentences at home fits the general so well the tailor of Panama could not have done better. President Martin Torrijos and other senior officials do not harbour sympathy for Noriega and could be embarrassed by his return and genteel incarceration in his own home. &quot;His presence would be a reminder of what many in the government did before,&quot; said Mario Rognoni, Noriega&apos;s friend and confidant. &quot;People have to learn to live with their pasts.&quot; Some don&apos;t need lessons. In Chorillo, a foul-smelling slum which bore the brunt of the fighting when the Americans invaded, many carry injuries from the missiles and gunfire. Along with his lower left arm, Ricardo Samanel, 46, lost his wife and his job as an electrician. Bitter and angry, he blamed Noriega for sowing disaster, the Americans for being trigger-happy, and, most of all, successive governments for ignoring him and the 40% of Panamanians who live in poverty. &quot;What do I care if Pineapple Face comes back? Makes no difference.&quot; He pointed his stump skyward to a flock of seagulls circling overhead. &quot;The sewage brings them here. Noriega went away, but the sewage never left.&quot;", "tags": ["World news", "Panama", "Americas"], "title": "No return for Noriega, the dictator whose nation is still trying to forget", "sentences": ["A \u00a32.5bn expansion of the Panama Canal started last week, and a \u00a32.4bn Dubai-style centre is planned for the city&apos;s outskirts."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/10/rorycarroll.international", "publicationDate": "2007-09-10T12:44:11Z"}, {"article": "The former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif was arrested and deported to Saudi Arabia within hours of arriving at Islamabad airport today. The airport drama was a major blow to Mr Sharif&apos;s campaign to oust the current president, General Pervez Musharraf, who deposed him in a 1999 coup and sent him into exile one year later. But the deportation will stoke public anger at Gen Musharraf&apos;s increasingly authoritarian rule, and could trigger a fresh confrontation with the judiciary. Clashes have been reported between Sharif supporters and police in Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Attock. Mr Sharif&apos;s party vowed to launch an immediate appeal before the supreme court, which only two and a half weeks ago ruled that Mr Sharif had an &quot;inalienable&quot; right of return to Pakistan. In the event, Mr Sharif spent less than four hours on Pakistani soil. Dozens of police commandos surrounded his Pakistan International Airlines flight after it arrived from London at 8.45am (0445 BST). Earlier the authorities thwarted efforts by his supporters to reach the airport by sealing off roads, jamming mobile phone signals and arresting hundreds of people. A tense standoff started as Mr Sharif refused to hand his passport to an immigration official who boarded the plane. A helicopter waited outside, its rotors turning. Ninety minutes later he was moved to a VIP lounge, accompanied by about 30 mostly foreign reporters, where a government&apos;s anti-corruption investigator showed him a charge sheet, fuelling speculation that he was about to be arrested. The charges included an accusation that Mr Sharif pocketed $21.2m (\u00a310.4m) from the sale of a sugar mill business during his last term in offiice. But Mr Sharif refused to sign the papers. Shortly afterwards he was hustled into a bus that took him to the helicopter, and then into a waiting plane. Officials in Saudi Arabia told Reuters that Mr Sharif was expected to arrive in the Red Sea city of Jeddah later this afternoon. The deportation solves one problem for Gen Musharraf, who is battling to retain power in the face of swelling civilian opposition, but it may create many more. Legal experts said the deportation appeared to contravene the August 23 supreme court ruling allowing Mr Sharif to return home. Gen Musharraf has been at loggerheads with the court since March when he unsuccessfully tried to sack the chief justice, Muhammad Iftikhar Chaudhry. Mr Sharif&apos;s Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (PML-N) party vowed to launch an appeal to the court by tomorrow, said Muhammad Iqbal, son of spokesman Ahsan Iqbal, who was arrested on his way to the airport. On Sunday Mr Iqbal told a press conference: &quot;The government&apos;s knees are shaking ... General Musharraf is already defeated.&quot; But today defiance gave way to disarray as the military-led government clamped down hard on the party. &quot;The situation is really messed up,&quot; said his son. &quot;The majority of our leadership have been arrested. Our central secretariat was raided, the staff are gone and our phone lines have been cut.&quot; A former president of Pakistan, Rafiq Tarar, was among Sharif loyalists who said they had been roughed up before being taken into police custody. Now the mantle of leadership falls to Mr Sharif&apos;s younger brother, Shahbaz, who bade him a tearful farewell at Heathrow airport yesterday. &quot;This will be counted as the blackest day in Pakistan&apos;s history,&quot; Shahbaz told Geo television from London. &quot;I do not have words to describe my grief.&quot; Before his arrest Mr Sharif acknowledged that his return was a &quot;risky course&quot;. But his aim was to &quot;take Pakistan back to the rule of democracy&quot;, he told reporters on the plane. &quot;Because unless we have this, we will continue to be in a state of mess, as we are today.&quot; As his plane touched down in Islamabad he moved from business to economy class, where he offered prayers amid a clutch of journalists and supporters. The crisis has dragged the government of Saudi Arabia ever deeper into Pakistani politics. On Saturday the head of the Saudi intelligence services, Prince Muqrin bin Abdul Aziz, arrived in Pakistan, where he urged Mr Sharif to respect an earlier promise to stay away until 2010. &quot;It is here and signed,&quot; said Prince Muqrin, waving a copy of the agreement before reporters. But the most immediate impact could be on negotiations between Gen Musharraf and Pakistan&apos;s other exiled former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto.

A journalist working in Lahore called to tell me how absurd it was that the very man who stormed Pakistan&apos;s supreme court in 1997 and had been an accomplice in threatening to kill an active chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) became a folk hero merely by following the judiciary&apos;s cues to return to the country that unlawfully exiled him. Seven thousand indisputably innocent supporters of the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (PML-N) were arrested by police for waiting outside Islamabad airport to witness his arrival. Citizens in Pakistan have been calling General Musharraf &quot;Busharraf&quot; for years now, and now that Hariri and the Saudis have dabbled their hands in the mess, Sharif has become one of the country&apos;s &quot;good ol&apos; boys&quot;. Given Nawaz&apos;s own pedigree in corruption, he was probably aware that the plane he was being escorted to by hulking commandos and Busharraf goons wasn&apos;t headed for Karachi. From where I&apos;m sitting, it seems like one big fat publicity stunt. Another Pakistani reporter echoed these sentiments more poetically. He said that since Nawaz announced his return a week ago, Mush&apos;s &quot;arrow was already out of the bow&quot;. The PML-N admitted failing to mobilise in time, something I find hard to believe seeing that 7,000 of their own were arrested in the incident. The real blame lies in the way party lines were drawn up during the protests to reinstate the suspended CJP last spring, which have prevented these rival parties from participating in reinstating democratic rule together. These enmities were first apparent to me outside the Lahore high court last April when women&apos;s rights activists and students with Jimaati Islami pins chanted &quot;Go Musharraf, go&quot; together with striking lawyers, and jeepfulls of Pakistan People&apos;s party (PPP) and PML-N supporters, dressed in uniform party colours, rolled in. Instead of waving flags with the unlawfully suspended CJP, they hoisted up posters of the same tired Bhuttos and Sharifs. When I was marching alongside other college-aged protesters shouting an anti-Musharraf chant led by a youth with a megaphone, who was still wearing her school uniform, the other party slogans seemed played out. To the PPP and PML-N, the protests were only a recruiting ground. As rallies were organised by lawyers outside Lahore, the only non-lawyers being quoted in press coverage were party workers. Parties are much easier to co-opt into the existing cronyism than the public and, as a result, we have Musharraf meeting Benazir in Dubai and Nawaz sent packing back to Jeddah. With no end to the current ban on student unions in Pakistani campuses, we aren&apos;t likely to see a fresh set of leaders emerging from our youth.

Mr Sharif&apos;s lawyers lodged a court petition saying that government security agents acted illegally when they bundled the former prime minister on to a plane for Saudi Arabia just four hours after landing in Islamabad. The former prime minister is relying on last month&apos;s supreme court verdict that he had an &quot;inalienable&quot; right of return and should not be hindered by the government. The supreme court, previously a rubber stamp for Pakistan&apos;s military-led governments, has become a powerful check on the powers of General Musharraf. It is headed by his arch-rival, chief justice Muhammad Iftikhar Chaudhry, whom he unsuccessfully tried to fire last March. But the Sharif deportation suggests that Gen Musharraf&apos;s mood is hardening, and the courts are under increasing pressure. On Monday supporters of the MQM, a pro-Musharraf party whose leader lives in London, stormed a Karachi courthouse holding an inquiry into political violence last May. The judges adjourned the hearing for a week. Also in Karachi an outspoken anti-government lawyer was shot dead in a taxi on his way to work. Mr Sharif&apos;s Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (PML-N) party was in disarray following an iron-fisted government clampdown. The party said 4,000 activists had been arrested in recent days; the interior ministry put the figure at 1,000. &quot;There&apos;s a great sense of despondency in the party. They hadn&apos;t really thought this through,&quot; said Ayaz Amir, an analyst and former PML-N parliamentarian. Among those in detention last night was spokesman Ahsan Iqbal, who spoke by phone to the Guardian. He was being sent to a prison in Bahawalpur, near the Indian border, for 30 days. &quot;This is a very serious crisis of governance, a blatant violation of the supreme court,&quot; he said. &quot;It is no longer about Nawaz Sharif, it&apos;s about the rule of law in this country.&quot; He warned that Pakistan&apos;s secular parties would give rise to greater religious fundamentalism. &quot;When they crack down on us, they create a vacuum for the religious parties to gain ground,&quot; he said. Mr Iqbal spoke during a six-hour parole break to attend a relative&apos;s funeral. He was due to return to jail last night. The controversial deportation won Gen Musharraf valuable time to consider his next move in his campaign for re-election between September 15 and October 15. Power-sharing talks in Dubai with the other banished former premier, Benazir Bhutto, have stalled. In the light of Monday&apos;s deportation, the failure of talks could lead to harsher measures such as the imposition of a state of emergency or martial law.

The deputy information minister, Tariq Azim, drew a distinction between Ms Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, who was expelled four hours after his return on Monday. &quot;Nawaz Sharif&apos;s case was different. He went back to Saudi Arabia because of an undertaking he had with the Saudi government,&quot; Mr Azim told the Associated Press. &quot;She (Bhutto) was always allowed to come back.&quot; Ms Bhutto, who lives between London and Dubai, has announced she will fly back to Pakistan on October 18. Asked about pending corruption cases against Mr Bhutto, Mr Azim said: &quot;It&apos;s for the law to take its own course. Everybody has to face cases against them and the same applies to her.&quot; Ms Bhutto has been negotiating with the embattled president, Gen Musharraf, on a power-sharing deal to allow her to run for prime minister while he stays on as president. Mr Azim said the talks with Ms Bhutto had become bogged down over her request for corruption cases to be dropped, for a constitutional amendment to let her seek a third term as prime minister, and over Gen Musharraf&apos;s re-election. Ms Bhutto has led her party from exile since leaving Pakistan in 1999 amid corruption claims. Her party said it would announce her return date at simultaneous news conferences later today. Her bargaining with Gen Musharraf has divided her own Pakistan People&apos;s party, with opponents fearing it will be tarnished by associating with an unpopular leader. Gen Musharraf has cut an increasingly forlorn figure since he tried to get the head of the supreme court sacked. Now he faces an unfriendly court, which is due next week to begin hearing a petition against his bid to stand for a second term and his holding the offices of president and army chief simultaneously. General elections are due by January. A coalition of Musharraf and Bhutto is favoured by the US, which wants a dependable ally against al-Qaida&apos;s influence on the Afghan-Pakistan border. Mr Sharif&apos;s party today again urged Ms Bhutto not to cut a deal with Gen Musharraf, who overthrew Mr Sharif in a coup in 1999. &quot;We welcome her coming back, but let me say that it will be an insult to democracy if she agrees to share power with a man who ousted the elected government of Nawaz Sharif and has caused irreparable damage to democratic institutions,&quot; said Sadiq ul-Farooq, a senior figure in the Pakistan Muslim League. In a reminder of the militant threat confronting Pakistan, a suicide bomber detonated a car inside a high-security military base, killing 16 soldiers from an elite counter-terrorism force. Twenty-nine soldiers were wounded in the attack on Thursday at Ghazi Tarbela base, about 60 miles south of the capital, Islamabad.

They&apos;re very quiet. Dana Thomas remembers how in 1982 she shopped in Christian Dior&apos;s old Avenue Montaigne store in Paris for perfume, which the sales clerk &quot;silently wrapped in sheets of matte grey paper without tape or glue and tied up with white ribbon&quot;. She recounts a recent visit to the Herm\u00e8s workshop in a Paris suburb to watch the assembly of a Kelly bag, again in silence: one pair of skilled hands, two needles, metres of linen thread, a skin of Crocodylus porosus from Australia, or niloticus from Zimbabwe, or Alligator mississipiensis raised on the firm&apos;s Floridan farm, two inspections of the finished object. And there&apos;s a more conventional story of a raid by Chinese cops on a tenement workshop in Guangzhou, to round up pathetic kids pasting together fake bags: phoney Versace labels stashed in a tin, a wordless child who punches his timecard on the way out, still hoping to get paid. In these and a few other moments, Thomas&apos;s writing changes as she explores what luxury meant - patience, skill, a knowledgeable interaction between creator and purchaser - before the word was both inflated and devalued; and also the misery attendant on its current global misuse. Overall, though, her book is constructed as American journalism - she&apos;s a Newsweek correspondent - as a sequence of interviews: &quot;he told me&quot;, &quot;she told me&quot;, the time and place, and the appearance of the interviewee, ritually remarked on. And it&apos;s financial journalism at that, with entire paragraphs, sometimes pages, of turnover figures, &quot;sales racheted up&quot;, &quot;double-digit growth&quot;, &quot;successful initial public offers&quot;, and quotes such as &quot;we believed it was an innovative yet legitimate way of leveraging our brand and enhancing its awareness in the luxury market&quot; reported with no lifted eyebrow in the surrounding text. Thomas&apos;s base thesis is simple and persuasive: that in 1977, the matriarch of the declining Parisian family firm of luggage-makers, Louis Vuitton, asked her son-in-law, businessman Henry Racamier, to take the company over. Makers of luxurious objects had traditionally retailed them through franchises but Racamier stopped supplying franchisees and opened his own shops - vertical integration. He used the profits released by the expulsion of the middlemen to expand, advertise, list the company on the stock exchanges of Paris and New York, take over the Veuve Clicquot champagne and perfume group, merge with the Mo\u00ebt -Hennessy ditto, and buy the fashion house of Givenchy in 1998. So far, so virtuous - the finance was corporate, but each brand retained integrity. But then, Thomas writes, Racamier allied himself with the only other, much younger, French businessman who had constructed a group of crafters of luxury garb and objects: Bernard Arnault, owner of Christian Dior and backer of Christian Lacroix. In 1990, Arnault gobbled Recamier&apos;s LVMH conglomerate, spat out Racamier, and was free to purchase any company and hire any outrageous design talent for just as long as their catwalk pzazz pushed the sales of mass-luxe goodies. Arnault failed in his bid for the restyled Gucci Group, but, though his Demon King methods - a whiff of sulphur with every transaction - were loathed, his model of group ownership, which concealed any individual line&apos;s loss of lustre in the dazzle of conglomerate profits, now dominates the luxury business. If, of course, you define luxury as Thomas does - as being nominated brands of clothes, accessories, hotels and Roederer Cristal champagne swigged from the magnum by rappers. The business is obliterating native luxuries worldwide. Thomas&apos;s fact and bargain-finding trips to Japan, China, India, the discount outlets of California and the luxury malls of Las Vegas, record our present in which significant percentages of the global population have caught, or been taught, the mad idea that they can acquire the signifier of modernity, immunity, celebrity, identity - Thomas can&apos;t or won&apos;t define what the fantasy they&apos;re after is - for the price of a Prada bag, or failing that, a Gucci wallet. Luggage is stacked so high throughout the book that I kept exclaiming &quot;a handbag?&quot; in Lady Bracknell tones, because Wilde&apos;s old bat was right - the notion that a leather sack with handles and a non-precious-metal clasp can confer a sense of origins on the socially and geopolitically bewildered is preposterous. Thomas only presents the saleable present, though. Her history, other than that of labelled products as researched in company museums, is questionable - embroidery in China is around four millennia old, not the 10 she claims. (Some of her futures seem iffy too - even before the book was published, her preferred prognosticators, the Wall Street investment bankers Bear Stearns, had proved fallible.) She&apos;s thrilled to retail tales of spite and treachery among stylists of stars on the red carpet at the Oscars, but that doesn&apos;t provide much cultural context for the ascendancy of upmarket bling. There&apos;s hardly a mention of the market deregulation and the associated expansion of retail credit in the 1980s that supported the rise of Arnault and Racamier. Nor any explanation as to why the Japanese, who pay in crisp fresh cash, can spot a millimetric deviation in a line of stitches, and have always had local taste in craftsmanship, should consume the naffest Cartier in Hawaii&apos;s duty-free gallerias. (Must be the exoticism of the occident.) Thomas barely registers the displacement of physical reality by the camera: that we now look to photographs for guidance on what we should buy to look good in photographs, explains much about the immateriality of our material possessions. There&apos;s the main motivating fantasy, not to enjoy and live but to be seen in photographs to be above enjoyment while playing at living. An empress of China wouldn&apos;t now be buried with grave goods, stuff you could stroke and unroll and put on exhibition, just the latest copy of Chinese Vogue with many spreads of her modelling the current names in destination hotels in Dubai. By the end of the book, Thomas sounds a bit glutted with the greed and inanity of it all. The Russians seem particularly raucous - next time revolutionaries won&apos;t storm the Winter Palace but the limestone hallways of Crocus City Mall outside Moscow. She begins to notice that the fabulousness of the Daslu department store in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, depends on a huge staff of servile maids and multiple security gates: &quot;Daslu&apos;s director of marketing explained to me &apos;The really rich don&apos;t go out and walk in the streets&apos;.&quot; She tries to find what the &quot;people who are as rich as air&quot; (Karl Lagerfeld&apos;s definition) now dream about: bespoke Patou perfume created from the flowers of Grasse, too costly for the deluxe masses, an Alice Cadolle made-to-measure bra, handsewn couture new and vintage, and still those Herm\u00e8s bags - Arnault never annexed Herm\u00e8s.

Although no official rating system has incorporated this new level of extreme luxury and service, it has been self-awarded by the flashy super-hotels of the Middle East, Dubai&apos;s Burj Al Arab and the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi.  This year the Rixos Premium Hotel Belek opened in Turkey, claiming to be Europe&apos;s first seven-star. It&apos;s not surprising to find it on the outskirts of Antalya, a Mediterranean resort that has become something of an accommodation theme park thanks to the development of several gimmicky luxury hotels, including the Adam and Eve, which touts itself as &apos;the world&apos;s sexiest hotel&apos;.  Sheer size is the Rixos&apos;s USP. It is a monster of a hotel, covering 350,000 acres and built at a cost of \u00a380m by the Turkish Rixos chain. The map of the grounds looks like one of Alton Towers - cartoonish, with areas divided by stretches of garden and lakes, and 66 different facilities marked, among them a waterpark and an amphitheatre. It is so colossal you easily become lost, and it takes me a frustrating half hour to find my way to breakfast. There are 12 restaurants, and the corridors are the length of football pitches, full of boutiques selling designer clothes and Turkish rugs. On the way I stumble across French Street, a none-too-convincing reproduction of a quaint continental lane, like a museum&apos;s replica Victorian village. Thankfully, there are no drama students dressed as chimney sweeps here; but a fake rainstorm is staged daily, with thundery audio effects, lightning flashes and sprinkler system spitting from the ceiling. Outside, the grassy grounds leading down to a stretch of golden beach are packed with activities. There is a climbing wall, skate ramp, trampoline, beach volleyball, 10 tennis courts, playgrounds, archery, table tennis, a cinema, dance studio, football pitches, gondola rides along the lake and watersports. The point of the hotel becomes clear - it is heaven for kids. There is even a Troy-themed waterpark with rapids, curly slides and a 25-metre wooden horse.  Next door is the dolphinarium. I am forced to inspect it by Volcan, the hotel manager. Dolphins circle a cringingly small pool to a pumping dance soundtrack, and a few minutes into the show I&apos;m horrified to see the trainer leading a performing walrus out onto the stage. The creature is wearing a sweatband, for god&apos;s sake. It drops to the floor to do press-ups and sit-ups, then stands upright while the trainer produces a microphone. The dance music cuts out and a wailing ballad drains from the speakers while the walrus sways, mimicking a karaoke act.  The whole thing is gruesome and ridiculous. It would be funny if it weren&apos;t so sick. Volcan doesn&apos;t really get my point when I say that these creatures are amazing enough behaving naturally in the wild; capturing them and forcing them to act human is demeaning. &apos;But they are only animals,&apos; he laughs. I get a similar reaction when I ask about the hotel&apos;s eco credentials: &apos;It&apos;s just not something we&apos;ve thought about.&apos; Volcan believes the facilities at the hotel justify the seven-star claim, and you can&apos;t argue with their quantity - it&apos;s the quality I question. The restaurants are good but not mindblowing; the decor throughout is fancy and grand but rather lacking in style; the bedrooms are modern but bland; and service is standard.  I am more persuaded by the luxury villas in the gardens. These are sensational, with private pools and gardens, theatrical outdoor dining, cool modern rooms and butler service. The spa is stellar, too, with an opulent marble Turkish hammam surrounded by little curtained rooms draped in rich red fabrics. It is a fantasy harem brought to life, with sex slaves replaced by jolly masseuses.  The tranquillity of the indoor pool is disrupted somewhat by the raucous group of Russian businessmen who delight in dive-bombing each other and screaming down the slide. Some of the drunker ones turn up at the excellent gym clutching cans of beer, and one falls flat on his face off the running machine after trying to mount it on full speed. The fact that the hotel is all-inclusive, slightly old-fashioned and soulless, and so excessively big as to be unmanageable for the guest, might be off-putting for some, yet the Rixos will undoubtedly have wide appeal. Families will love it and its spa, yoga tents, designer boutiques and proximity to historical sites will attract others. But for all the fun and games, the fake rainstorms and the arrant magnitude of this gaudy megadrome, I think the walrus would agree that it just hasn&apos;t earned seven stars.

Borse Dubai was last week censured by the Swedish financial regulators for failing to follow so-called best-practice rules when it built up a big stake in OMX ahead of launching a full takeover bid in early August. HSBC was responsible for conducting the complex bookbuilding exercise, however, and has not as yet faced any criticism. Sources close to OMX say, however, that the investigation remains open and that regulators in Sweden are now taking a close look at exactly how HSBC was able to complete its mandate for Dubai, while staying within the bounds of Sweden&apos;s notoriously strict takeover rules. FSA regulators in London are standing by to assist their Swedish counterparts. In early August, HSBC began the bookbuilding exercise and contacted a number of hedge funds, proprietary trading desks at banks and other institutional investors known to hold OMX shares. The exercise, which involved a complex call-and-put option, was the forerunner to a SEK27.7bn (\u00a32bn) bid for OMX by Dubai that trumped an earlier SEK25.5bn bid for the exchange by Nasdaq, the New York-based stock exchange. The Swedish authorities want to know if the way in which HSBC contacted the OMX shareholders, and the timing of its calls, broke any takeover rules. Borse Dubai maintains it has done nothing wrong, despite the slap on the wrist it received last week, and is lodging an appeal against the decision. The Dubai company is the first to appeal against a ruling by the Swedish financial services regulator to Stockholm&apos;s country administrative court. &apos;Borse Dubai fully respects the ruling but feels it raises matters that should be clarified in the public interest, as well as specifically with respect to the OMX transaction. Borse Dubai remains of the belief that it acted in good faith and according to applicable Swedish law process,&apos; said a company statement. Meanwhile, HSBC is aware of the continuing investigation into its role in the bookbuilding process, but a spokesman for the investment bank in London declined to comment. The renewed scrutiny of HSBC could not have come at a worse time for the troubled investment bank as Knight Vinke, an activist investor, continues its campaign to force a break-up of the giant banking group. Eric Knight, leading the campaign and the chief critic of HSBC&apos;s current strategy, has arranged 30 meetings over the next couple of weeks with key investors, and with Stephen Green, HSBC&apos;s executive chairman. Knight Vinke, which holds just 1 per cent of HSBC&apos;s shares, called last week for other HSBC investors to join its campaign for strategic change and improvements in corporate governance.

When I was a kid he&apos;d fly up ladders at the side of the house while I got wobbly legs just watching him. Even going into the loft is a problem for me, so for the last few years I&apos;ve made it my mission to overcome my vertigo. It started because I wanted to stay in my uncle&apos;s Spanish holiday home. The only obstacle was that it was a top-floor flat so I had to grit my teeth and tackle the stairs. I was so pleased with myself when I eventually made it that since then I&apos;ve made it my mission to climb to the highest point wherever I go. My job with an adventure travel website helps me source those places. We organise trips for people who want to travel according to interest rather than destination. However, the heights thing isn&apos;t something that I run for the general public. For now, at least, it&apos;s personal. For me the process of conquering a great height involves a combination of fear and adrenaline but the incentive is always the views. Having said that, when I went up to the Burj al Arab Sky Bar in Dubai the promise of a cold Guinness on arrival helped. That was probably the best pint I ever had - and at \u00a312, also the most expensive. Generally I choose the destination first and then look for something high to climb. One of the most frightening was the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur which are the second highest towers in the world. I also like to choose places that aren&apos;t on the tourist trail because I get to see the landscape from a different perspective. A great spot is the Tallinn TV tower in Estonia, which has an observation deck at 200m but, unfortunately, very steep stairs. There&apos;s also a breathtaking vista from the Tokyo tax tower where, unusually for Tokyo, the top-floor decks are free of charge. It&apos;s not just buildings. In China I braved Wuzoulou mountain and the 1km-long Simatai zip wire over a lake near the Great Wall of China. But I still get wobbly legs and butterflies, so recently I&apos;ve decided it&apos;s time to push myself again. That&apos;s why next year I&apos;ve booked myself a mid-flight biplane wing walk.

The conflicting statements were part of speculation about the military leader&apos;s next move in his effort to cling to power. Under the constitution, Gen Musharraf has until October 15, one month before his term of office expires, to have himself re-elected for another five years by Pakistan&apos;s national and regional assemblies.

Mr Sharif accuses the government of contempt of court by ignoring a recent supreme court ruling supporting his return home. Zafarullah Khan, a senior official with Mr Sharif&apos;s party, said their case had been delayed by the election hearings, but may be opened next week. Gen Musharraf had some good news from the national election commission, which changed a rule that potentially barred him from standing for office. Citing a 2005 supreme court ruling, the commission said a constitutional clause requiring retired government officials, including army officers, to wait two years before running for office did not apply to presidential candidates.

The International Air Transport Association slashed its profit forecast for 2008 by 19% to $9.6bn, saying the downturn in the credit market would affect airline balance sheets regardless of whether the global economy has a hard or soft landing next year. Iata said bottom lines would be hit if an economic slowdown affected sales on key routes such as the highly profitable transatlantic market. It added, however, that profitability would also decline if governments rejuvenate economies and drive up costs such as oil by slashing interest rates. &quot;Either we get hit with higher costs or we get hit with lower demand,&quot; said an Iata spokesman. The trade body said it expected profits for 2007 to be higher than forecast at $5.6bn, against $5.1bn previously. Iata said profitability was most robust in North America, where carriers have increased capacity by 11% and improved their load factors - a measure of how full planes are - by 6%. In the Asia Pacific region, however, growth has been more one-sided with capacity increasing by 42% and load factors rising 2%, contributing to a decline in profits from $1.2bn in 2005 to $700m this year. &quot;The Iata forecast is not a surprise because the mood music is pretty appalling,&quot; said Chris Tarry, an airline industry analyst. &quot;Consumer spending is coming under greater pressure, there is too much capacity in the market, and fares will have to come down. I think 2008 will be the peak of the profit cycle.&quot; Giovanni Bisignani, Iata&apos;s chief executive, said the recent liberalisation of the transatlantic market must be matched by governments around the world if the industry is to reach its full potential.

The all-business-class airline said it would benefit from companies clamping down on travel costs. &quot;We have an advantage in a downturn because people will cut back on budgets,&quot; said Lawrence Hunt, Silverjet&apos;s chief executive. &quot;As budgets get tighter we have such a price advantage over the rip-off legacy airlines that we will fare very well in a downturn.&quot; A return flight to New York on Silverjet costs about \u00a3900, whereas the same trip in a British Airways business cabin could cost up to \u00a34,500. Mr Hunt added that Silverjet was insulated from a downturn because of its size: &quot;Some people will travel less often or not at all but it&apos;s small numbers. We sell 100 seats per day in a 7,000-seat market.&quot; Silverjet, which launches a second plane on its Luton-New York service next week, also announced plans for a daily service to Dubai from November. The airline posted a pre-tax loss of \u00a318.2m in its maiden annual results, published yesterday. Mr Hunt said the airline was not in sale talks with Lufthansa or Air France, which were reported to be interested in using the airline&apos;s business model on the Heathrow-JFK route. &quot;Why anybody would want to fly from Heathrow is beyond me,&quot; he said.", "tags": ["Business", "Airline industry", "Travel"], "title": "Airlines say credit crunch will put \u00a31bn dent in profits", "sentences": ["We sell 100 seats per day in a 7,000-seat market.&quot; Silverjet, which launches a second plane on its Luton-New York service next week, also announced plans for a daily service to Dubai from November."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/18/theairlineindustry.travel", "publicationDate": "2007-09-18T08:27:56Z"}, {"article": "A man described as the UK linchpin of a global conspiracy to sell fake medicines over the internet was yesterday sentenced to four and a half years in prison following what police described as the biggest counterfeit drugs bust in British history. Ashish Halai, 33, masterminded the multimillion-pound movement of fake Viagra and other lucrative drugs from factories in China, India and Pakistan into the UK and then on to the Bahamas and the US. Three other men were also convicted of conspiracy charges; Gary Haywood, 58, Halai&apos;s brother-in-law Ashwin Patel, 24, and Pakistan-based Zahid Mirza, 45, are yet to be sentenced. Four others face a retrial after the jury failed to agree verdicts. Sentencing Halai at the end of a nine-month trial at Kingston crown court, Judge Nicholas Price told him: &quot;I&apos;m satisfied that greed is the overriding motivation for such offences. I have absolutely no doubt that large profits were made...You are undoubtedly a highly intelligent man. I accept that you have business acumen which should have been better employed in legitimate enterprise.&quot; It was a chance find that led to the unravelling of a massive global prescription drug fraud in which UK criminals were key players. Customs staff at Stansted airport opened a package containing plastic tubs of fish protein and dog protein. Inside were 12,000 little blue diamond-shaped pills. It was counterfeit Viagra, destined for thousands of young men seeking pleasure and older men seeking help for impotence not only in the UK but in other countries around the world. The tablets, repackaged to look like the original, would be sent out to customers who had ordered Viagra through internet websites, either because they were too embarrassed to see a GP or because they did not qualify for a prescription. What few realise is that most lifestyle drugs sold on the internet are fake. The package was intercepted in November 2002; several more that arrived later were logged and sent on their way. Investigators from the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority (MHRA) watched as the evidence grew of a fake drugs trail that led to the door of Haywood, a Leicester businessman and linked him to a company called Stormgrand based in Edgware, north London, which was owned by Halai, a Kenyan citizen. At the end of June 2003, the MHRA received a call from DHL. A package the firm had been delivering to Haywood had split open to reveal the tell-tale blue Viagra tablets, wrapped in Chinese newspapers. Chick Hatchwell, the MHRA&apos;s senior investigator, told them to seal the package and deliver it on July 2. His team went in 15 minutes later. &quot;We saw the first box and there was another DHL delivery too. In the garage, we found big wads of patient information leaflets and a press to put on the caps of the pots and labels with Pfizer on,&quot; said Mr Hatchwell, a former police officer. Inside a filing cabinet, he found 30 or 40 tubs full of tablets at the back of a drawer. In all, they found more than 100,000 fake tablets, which cost around 25p each and are sold for \u00a315 a time - an estimated value of \u00a31.6m. Correspondence at Haywood&apos;s house threw up the names of a number of pharmacies in the UK and a company called Global Medz in the Bahamas. It was the first clue to the global nature of the counterfeiting scam. Global Medz was handling website orders from all over the world, including delivery to the US. The United States is vigilant against internet medicines purchased from countries in Asia, where it is known that legal factories sometimes turn out illegal fakes at night; other counterfeiters are known to produce copies in cement mixers in back yards. The internet trade - even if the products are not fake - undermines the multibillion-dollar US pharmaceutical industry, the biggest in the world. Global Medz was sending crates full of envelopes to pharmacies in the UK from where they could be dispatched with a UK stamp. Seven days after the raid on Haywood&apos;s house, he fled the country despite agreeing to be interviewed by the MHRA at Hinckley police station in Leicestershire. Instead, he phoned them on his mobile, claiming to be in Costa Rica. He said his wife had left him. Days later, he sent a text message saying he was dying in hospital and the Triads were after him for non-payment of drugs he had bought from China. The he sent a fax. It amounted to a two-page confession, naming others involved in the medicines trade, including Ashish Halai. The MHRA got a warrant for his arrest for non-appearance at court. Then, in March last year, police boarded a plane returning to London from Thailand to make random checks on the passengers and found Haywood and his wife. But the key figure at the UK end of the global conspiracy was Halai, who was supplying counterfeits to the US market. He claimed he was an innocent go-between for his father in Kenya who did not speak English, but the court was told he organised the movement of fake drugs manufactured in Asia to his company, Stormgrand in London - often via Gary Haywood - and on to Global Medz in the Bahamas and elsewhere. The operation involved fake packaging, labels, patient information leaflets and even fraudulent documents laying false trails to bona fide companies. Halai operated at first through a pharmacy in north London, which he set up with his wife, a registered pharmacist, and originally specialised in herbal weight-loss drugs. After Haywood fled the UK and the US authorities, tipped off by the MHRA, moved in on the US end of the operation, Halai continued to supply fake drugs through a new company called Health First Marketing. Halai was arrested in June 2005 and pleaded guilty to four counts of conspiracy relating to the marketing and sale of the fake drugs. Several big players in the US have been arrested and $13m (\u00a36.5m) worth of confiscations have been made. Others have been arrested in Dubai, which was a transit point for disguising shipments from China heading to London. Factories making counterfeit drugs have been closed down in China after representations from the US government. This has been the biggest worldwide conspiracy involving medicines ever brought to trial, and the authorities expect that it will have damaged the counterfeit trade, if only temporarily. &quot;It&apos;s really taken off,&quot; said Mr Hatchwell. &quot;I think it&apos;s getting as big as some of the major drug deals.&quot;", "tags": ["Health", "Crime", "Life and style", "Society", "UK news"], "title": "Made for 25p, sold for \u00a315.

Enescu is Romania&apos;s most famous composer. Actually, he is its only famous composer. As the 18th George Enescu international festival sweeps the capital, his face stares out from billboards everywhere. Hotel corridors resound to the sound of violinists practising. By the time the three-week festival closes this weekend, 3,000 musicians will have passed through the city. The pianists alone make for quite a lineup: the elusive, cultish Martha Argerich, Yevgeny Kissin, Murray Perahia, the Lab\u00e8que sisters, Nelson Freire, Boris Berezovsky, Polina Leschenko. They form only part of the draw alongside other big names, such as Maxim Vengerov, Valery Gergiev and Christophe Eschenbach, Romanian opera companies and visiting orchestras including the Orchestre de Paris, Oslo Philharmonic, Rotterdam Philharmonic, Freiburg Baroque and the London Symphony Orchestra. A prestigious competition for violinists, pianists and composers runs concurrently, as do related concerts in other cities dotted around the EU&apos;s new member country. With Wizz offering budget flights and easyJet about to, there are plenty of reasons why Romania should be a destination for cultural tourism, rather than just stag groups looking for the next Tallinn. The festival has come a long way since its 1958 launch, when the then communist regime honoured a composer who had been driven out by its politics, dying in Paris three years earlier. Its ability to attract top-rank artists may have something to do with the formidable reputation of its artistic director, Ioan Holender. The 72-year-old Romanian expat is due to step down as head of the Vienna Staatsoper in 2010, and his name is already being mentioned in connection with lucrative projects including the Zaha Hadid-designed opera house in Dubai. Most of the logistics of the festival are down to the manager, Mihai Constantinescu, though. The festival, he says, is a biennial fix for Romanian music-lovers. Regular budgets don&apos;t allow for top-flight international performers, but &quot;during these three weeks, we can offer the best of the moment&quot;. Tickets cost \u00a37-\u00a314. &quot;The Salzburg festival costs around \u20ac46m [\u00a332m]; ours costs \u20ac6m [\u00a34.2m],&quot; says Constantinescu. &quot;The budget is a huge one for Romania. But we use the money well.&quot; Not only do audiences benefit from hearing the best in the world, the performers do, too; and rising Romanian soloists have the chance to get noticed by influential international conductors. The main venues are centred around, you guessed it, Enescu Square. The Sala Mare a Palatului (Palace hall) is a vast auditorium seating 4,000. But the most memorable is the neo-classical rotunda that is the Ateneul Roman (Romanian Atheneum), whose auditorium, lavishly decorated with a red, gold and blue plasterwork ceiling, seats 1,000 in deceptive intimacy. The area is one of Bucharest&apos;s most tourist-friendly; on a warm night, with its cocktail bars and bustling outdoor restaurants, it has a Mediterranean feel. Along leafy, widening avenues to the north, you can still see the ornate villas and elegant townhouses that, along with a thriving cultural life, earned Bucharest the moniker of &quot;the Paris of the east&quot; between the wars. Most of these houses are now crumbling; many are crammed against grim, communist-era blocks. However, one that is in unusually good repair is the Enescu museum, housed in an art nouveau mansion owned by the composer&apos;s aristocratic wife. The smaller house behind it, which is where Enescu briefly lived, has been lovingly preserved. Preservation of Enescu&apos;s music is part of the festival&apos;s ethos, too: most visiting ensembles are encouraged, even actively required, to play one of his works. The hope is that, having learned his music, they will continue to perform it elsewhere - as well they might, because the work of Enescu, a pupil of Faur\u00e9 and Massenet, is worth the attention. Last Sunday, a concert featuring some of his largely French-flavoured songs and then his Violin Sonata No 2 was a highlight of the weekend, even with Martha Argerich&apos;s masterly, mercurial performance of Beethoven&apos;s Piano Concerto No 1 still ringing in the ears. A few hours later, Murray Perahia packed out the Ateneul for a barnstorming recital of Bach, Beethoven, Brahms and Chopin that put to rest any suspicions that he might be just too reliable to be a true great. The next morning, the Russian orchestra leaves, the Rotterdam Philharmonic arrives - and the hotel-room practice starts all over again.  The George Enescu festival ends on Sunday.

Thieves have also stolen copper lightning conductors as well as bells and statues. The latest theft took place last month in Kent, where thieves climbed to the top of the Lady Chapel at St Peter&apos;s Church, Whitstable, to steal the 70-year-old Sachring bell. Increasing metal prices have sparked the crimewave, and it is thought the stolen material is shipped to countries such as China, Dubai and India where metal stocks are struggling to meet the demand of the booming economies. Ecclesiastical Insurance, which disclosed the information and covers the majority of Church of England buildings, said more than 1,000 claims related to metal thefts from churches had been received so far this year. More than 300 of these were lodged in August. A spokesman said: &quot;We saw a similar spike in claims in the 1970s when metal prices reached a high. Because they are reaching another high at the moment we are seeing a corresponding rise in thefts, so the local parish church is becoming a victim of the worldwide demand for metals.&quot; The problem affected inner city churches as much as rural parishes, he added. One church suffered \u00a320,000 worth of damage to its organ after rain poured in when its roof was stripped.

Shares in the LSE had jumped by more than 13% to \u00a316.43 by early afternoon today as details of the power struggle emerged. Borse Dubai now holds 28% of the exchange while Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) holds 20%. The clash over the future of the LSE is just one of handful of international flashpoints to have flared up today as pressure mounts for further consolidation among the world&apos;s leading stock exchanges. There were major developments in New York, Sweden and the Middle East. In London, Borse Dubai has taken almost all of the stake previously controlled by failed LSE bidder, Nasdaq. Borse Dubai paid \u00a3790m, or \u00a314.14 a share, for the 28% stake in the London exchange. Nasdaq had held an auction for the stake, attracting offers from other sovereign fund-backed bidders including the Qatar Investment Authority and Singapore&apos;s Temasek Holdings as well as Deutsche Borse and a number of Italian institutions. Having failed to win Nasdaq&apos;s stake in LSE, QIA today announced it had raided the market, aggressively buying up shares in the London exchange. It said it had acquired a 20% stake - with much of its shares believed to have been acquired at more than \u00a35.80 from US hedge funds. In a statement QIA said: &quot;This is a key investment for QIA and one that it intends to hold for the long term. The QIA group sees itself as a shareholder that will provide stability and support for the board&apos;s strategy.&quot; LSE said it was &quot;very happy to welcome the QIA as a long term investor in the company&quot;, noting the two firms already had a number of strategic links in Doha. The London exchange made no comment about its new largest shareholder, Borse Dubai. QIA had been tipped as the frontrunner in the auction for the Nasdaq stake in LSE, but the US exchange is believed to have favoured Borse Dubai because of a complex side agreement which effectively calls an end to the bidding war between the two for Nordic exchange group OMX. A co-operative approach to an OMX takeover is intended to see the Stockholm-based firm end up under Nasdaq ownership. The side deal also sees Borse Dubai take a 28.4% interest in Nasdaq while the US firm invest in Borse Dubai operations, including the introduction of software to Dubai exchanges. But Borse Dubai&apos;s Middle Eastern neighbour QIA has been quick to challenge plans for a series of international links between Nasdaq, Dubai, OMX and - possibly - LSE.

Northern Rock slumped to a new low of 185.2p, down 71.8p. There was a combination of reasons, starting with the growing feeling that a bid for the bank may be wishful thinking. Even if Lloyds TSB or whoever comes in with a bid, it will inevitably be a low one. Added to that came the Treasury&apos;s statement that the guarantee for the mortgage bank&apos;s depositors announced on Monday did not apply to new accounts. This raised the prospect the company might have to wind down its business.   A note from Citigroup did not help, saying Northern Rock shares could be worth as little as 6p each.   It looked at three possible scenarios. If the business is run down in an orderly fashion it could be worth 130p a share. A bidder could push this up to around 220p a share, while it could fall to 6p if Northern Rock has to rely on extended Bank of England support as it staggers on to its demise.   &quot;We reduce our price target from 400p to 150p to reflect what we see as the maximum realistic bid acceptable to both seller and buyer,&quot; said Citi.   In such a febrile market, rumours about other banks applying for Bank of England help were bound to resurface, and so it proved.   Alliance &amp; Leicester lost 60p to 755.5p while HBOS fell 37p to 837p, prompting the latter to tell Reuters that rumours of funding problems were &quot;complete and utter nonsense&quot;. Bradford &amp; Bingley was also weaker, down 28.2p to 299.75p.   So the overall mood was downbeat, and by the close the FTSE 100 index was 31 points lower at 6429.0, with little help from Wall Street. US figures showed the number of people signing on for benefit last week fell by 9,000, despite expectations of a rise. But this was overshadowed by poor results from Bear Stearns - one of the banks suffering from mortgage problems - and a warning from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, that there were more sub-prime defaults to come.   Back to the takeover talk.   Insurer Friends Provident jumped 7.1p to 174.7p on suggestions that Zurich Financial was plotting a 210p a share offer. Friends, of course, is attempting to merge with rival Resolution, up 0.5p to 684p. But Pearl Assurance has built up a stake in Resolution in an apparent attempt to break up the merger, while Standard Life said yesterday it might be interested in bidding for Resolution.   Later Resolution said it had held due diligence meetings with Pearl and Standard Life, but had held no talks on proposals and had received no firm offers from them.   Elsewhere Mitchells &amp; Butler moved 7.5p higher to 627.5p as traders heard tell that billionaire Joe Lewis was building a stake.   Supermarket group J Sainsbury added 15.5p to 569.5p as it opened its books to potential 600p-a-share bidder Delta Two, the Qatari-backed investment fund. Delta Two, which owns 25% of Sainsbury, raised the equity portion of the offer by \u00a3850m.   But analyst Philip Dorgan at Panmure Gordon said: &quot;We don&apos;t think that this is a done deal by any means. There are two significant hurdles to overcome. First, the need to acquire 75% of the equity and, second, the need to satisfy the pension fund trustees. The latter in particular represents a formidable hurdle. We are also interested in the position of Justin King on all of this. With a new incentive scheme in place in the event of continued investment, does he want to swap this for life under private ownership, Paul Taylor and Tony Campbell? There must be a chance that he leaves and this possibility is not an attractive one for Delta 2, in our view.&quot;   There was little impact from the news that the Office of Fair Trading said the UK&apos;s big four supermarkets had colluded to keep milk and butter prices high.   Still with Qatar, the country&apos;s Investment Authority caused some excitement by buying a 20% stake in the London Stock Exchange. At the same time Borse Dubai bought the 28% stake in the LSE owned by the America&apos;s Nasdaq, and also took a 19.99% shareholding in the US exchange.   The Dubai exchange paid \u00a314.14 a share for its 55.9m shares in the LSE, while the Qataris bought their stake in two chunks in the market this morning, 18.9m shares at \u00a315.85 and then 20.8m for the same amount.   Traders said it looked like an attempt by the Qataris to block Dubai taking control, and that the LSE could now find itself the subject of yet another bid battle. LSE shares jumped 234p to \u00a316.87.   On the results front, cruise company Carnival sailed 157p higher to \u00a323.74 after it announced a better-than-expected 12% rise in third-quarter profits.   But nightclub group Luminar lost 66.5p to 633p after a trading statement failed to impress.   B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher fell 11.3p to 181p as it warned of a tough second half after interim profits rose 6.2%.   Panmure Gordon cut its target price from 230p to 210p. &quot;Overall the stock is relatively expensive,&quot; said analyst Christian Koefoed-Nielsen, &quot;albeit with a high dividend yield, and we are retaining our hold recommendation.&quot;   Over at Mike Ashley&apos;s Sports Direct, the shares slipped 2p to 123p after it increased its stake in replica kit firm Umbro, and completed its acquisition of boxing specialist Everlast in the US. The company has also postponed its investor day due to take place next week, blaming the &quot;additional and immediate workload relating to Everlast&apos;s successful integration&quot;.   Before the announcement, Panmure&apos;s Philip Dorgan predicted the postponement, saying: &quot;At Sports Direct&apos;s prelims in July, it was keen to promise that it had learnt its lesson and would become more user-friendly for the City. As part of this, it promised an analyst and investor day, visiting its new Shirebrook head office and distribution centre, on Tuesday September 25.   &quot;This is now just three working days away and we are not aware of any invitations having been sent out. It looks as if the visit will be cancelled. If it is cancelled, then what does this tell us? Rarely is the postponement of an analysts&apos; meeting the precursor of good news.   &quot;We believe that at some point the company will need to warn on profits. We believe that the visit isn&apos;t going to happen because the company is not in a position to answer detailed financial questions. Indeed, it may even be at the beginning of re-assessing its likely outlook for the year.&quot;   Hedge fund Absolute Capital Management, which has seen a row between its co-founder and the rest of the board followed by the suspension of redemptions in some of its funds, fell another 14p to 48.5p.   Phil Edmond&apos;s group Central African Mining continued on its volatile way, down another 2.25p to 28.75p on continuing uncertainties over its operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo.   And troubled support services group Carter &amp; Carter dropped 26p to 79p. The company said it knew of no reason for the fall, but admitted it had been in discussions with its advisers and banks about the renegotiation of its banking facilities &quot;in conjunction with an equity issue&quot;.   Although traders had speculated the company might be planning a share issue, this is the first official confirmation, and it provided impetus for the share price decline.   Finally, biotech group BTG was 10.2p better at 105.75p after Bayer and Genzyme won US approval for leukemia drug Campath, which they licence from BTG.

Northern Rock slumped to a new low of 185.2p, down 71.8p. There was a combination of reasons, starting with the growing feeling that a bid for the bank may be wishful thinking. Even if Lloyds TSB, or whoever, comes in with a bid, it will inevitably be a low one. Added to that came the Treasury&apos;s statement that the guarantee for the mortgage bank&apos;s depositors announced on Monday did not apply to new accounts. This raised the prospect the company may have to wind down its business. A note from Citigroup did not help, saying Northern Rock shares could be worth as little as 6p each. It looked at three possible scenarios. If the business is run down in an orderly fashion it could be worth 130p a share. A bidder could push this up to around 220p, but it could fall to 6p if Northern Rock has to rely on extended Bank of England support as it staggers to its demise. &quot;We reduce our price target from 400p to 150p to reflect what we see as the maximum realistic bid acceptable to both seller and buyer,&quot; said Citi. In such a febrile market, rumours about other banks applying for Bank of England help were bound to resurface, and so it proved. HBOS fell 37p to 837p, prompting it to say that rumours of funding problems were &quot;complete and utter nonsense&quot;. Alliance &amp; Leicester lost 60p to 755.5p while Bradford &amp; Bingley fell 28.2p to 299.75p. So the mood was downbeat, and by the close the FTSE 100 index was 31 points lower at 6429.0. There was little support from Wall Street. US figures showed the number of people signing on for benefit last week fell by 9,000 compared with expectations of a rise. But this was overshadowed by poor results from Bear Stearns - one of the banks deeply involved in the sub-prime crisis - and a warning from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, that there were more mortgage defaults to come. Back to the takeover talk. Friends Provident jumped 7.1p to 174.7p on suggestions that Zurich Financial was plotting a 210p-a-share offer. Friends, of course, is attempting to merge with Resolution, up 0.5p to 684p. But Pearl Assurance has built up a stake in Resolution in an apparent attempt to break up the merger, and Standard Life said yesterday it may be interested in bidding for Resolution. Later Resolution said it had held due diligence meetings with Pearl and Standard Life, but had held no talks on proposals and had received no firm offers from them. Mitchells &amp; Butlers moved 7.5p up to 627.5p on vague suggestions that billionaire Joe Lewis was building a stake. J Sainsbury added 15.5p to 569.5p as it opened its books to potential 600p-a-share bidder Delta Two, the Qatar-backed investment fund. Delta Two, which owns 25% of Sainsbury, raised the equity portion of the offer by \u00a3850m. Qatar&apos;s Investment Authority caused some excitement by buying a 20% stake in the London Stock Exchange, up 234p to \u00a316.87.

B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher fell 11.3p to 181p as it warned of a tough second half after interim profits rose 6.2%. Panmure Gordon cut its target price from 230p to 210p. Lower down the market hedge fund Absolute Capital Management, where a row between its co-founder and the rest of the board was followed by the suspension of redemptions in some of its funds, fell another 14p to 48.5p. Phil Edmonds&apos;s Central African Mining continued on its volatile way, down another 2.25p to 28.75p on uncertainties over its operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Although traders had speculated the company could be planning a share issue, this is the first official confirmation and provided impetus for the share-price decline. Biotech group BTG was 10.2p better at 105.75p after Bayer and Genzyme won US approval for the leukaemia drug Campath, which they licence from BTG. Finally oil and gas group Sandhaven - quoted on Plus Markets - was steady at 143p. Today the company is expected to finalise its cash-and-share acquisition of several oil and gas leases in Texas. These could yield 32bn cubic feet of gas worth some $72m (\u00a336m). The company expects to earn revenues from the sites by the end of October. Price hint Keep an eye on printing group St Ives, down 0.75p to 220p yesterday. Last month it gave a mixed trading statement, saying market conditions remained challenging but it expected the underlying full-year performance to be ahead of 2006. Now, however, it is believed to be in line for a multi-million pound print management contract from the Royal Mail. According to a report in trade magazine PrintWeek, Royal Mail has begun due diligence at St Ives in preparation for awarding it the contract, which has been out to tender since December. The four-year deal was reported then to be worth some \u00a3400m but it is now believed the total value could have fallen by several tens of millions of pounds. Nevertheless, confirmation of the contract would give a welcome boost to the company&apos;s shares. nick.fletcher@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Business", "Northern Rock"], "title": "Northern Rock shares could go for 6p each", "sentences": ["At the same time Borse Dubai bought the 28% stake in the LSE owned by Nasdaq, and also took a shareholding in the US exchange."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/21/2", "publicationDate": "2007-09-20T23:33:45Z"}, {"article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday September 22 2007 In the article below we reported that Borse Dubai and Qatar Investment Authority had purchased shares in the London Stock Exchange and mentioned that nearly all of the stake purchased by Borse Dubai had been previously controlled by Nasdaq. We said that Nasdaq had auctioned the stake and that this had attracted offers from, among others, Singapore&apos;s Temasek Holdings. Temasek has asked us to make clear that it did not, at any time, make any offer, nor did it participate in any bidding for the 31% Nasdaq stake.    The London Stock exchange is once again at the centre of a takeover struggle after close to half of its shares were snapped up yesterday by rival sovereign-backed firms from Dubai and Qatar. Shares in the exchange operator closed up 234p, or 16%, at \u00a316.87 after details of the power struggle emerged. Borse Dubai now holds 28% of the LSE and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) holds 20%. The clash over the LSE was one of a handful of international flashpoints to flare up yesterday as pressure mounts for further consolidation among the world&apos;s leading stock exchanges. There were major developments in New York, Sweden and the Middle East as well as in London. All were precipitated by a deluge of petrodollars from Doha and Dubai, both of which are rapidly diversifying away from a reliance on oil and gas. The Gulf cities - separated by less than 250 miles of water - are vying to become the Middle East&apos;s pre-eminent financial centre. In London, Borse Dubai has taken almost all of the stake previously controlled by Nasdaq. Borse Dubai paid \u00a3790m, or \u00a314.14 a share, for the 28% stake. Nasdaq held an auction for the stake, attracting offers from other sovereign fund-backed bidders including QIA and Singapore&apos;s Temasek Holdings. Having failed to win the stake, QIA yesterday announced it had raided the market. It said it had acquired a 20% stake in LSE - with much of its shares believed to have been acquired at more than \u00a315.80 from US hedge funds. In a statement QIA said: &quot;This is a key investment for QIA and one that it intends to hold for the long term.&quot; LSE said it was &quot;very happy to welcome the QIA as a long-term investor in the company&quot;, noting the two firms already had strategic links in Doha. The exchange made no comment about Borse Dubai. In two weeks&apos; time, however, a group of Italian banks is expected to take over as the LSE&apos;s largest shareholder, with about 28% of shares, on completion of the London exchange&apos;s acquisition of Borsa Italiana. Borse Dubai and QIA interests will be diluted down to about 20% and 14% respectively. QIA had been tipped as the front runner in the auction for the Nasdaq stake in LSE, but the US exchange is believed to have favoured Borse Dubai because of a complex side agreement that in effect ends the bidding war between the two for OMX. A cooperative approach should see the Stockholm-based exhange group end up under Nasdaq ownership, Borse Dubai take a 28.4% interest in Nasdaq and the US firm invest in Borse Dubai operations, including the introduction of software to Dubai exchanges. &quot;The combination will create the largest global network of exchanges and exchange customers linked by technology,&quot; said Nasdaq&apos;s boss, Bob Greifeld. &quot;It&apos;s a triple-win transaction.&quot; But QIA has been quick to challenge plans for a series of international links between Nasdaq, Dubai and - potentially - OMX and the LSE. As well as challenging Borse Dubai in London, QIA also raided the market in Stockholm, buying up almost 10% of shares in OMX. It urged shareholders in the exchange group to take no action on the offer from Nasdaq/Borse Dubai. The Qatari market raid is believed to include transactions at 245 kronor a share - well above the value of the SK230-a-share offer from Borse Dubai. Shares in OMX closed up 7.7% at SK259 after a record day&apos;s trading. The equivalent of a third of all OMX shares changed hands. In the US, meanwhile, some politicians were again questioning the wisdom of allowing a sovereign-backed firm to take a dominant interest in a strategic US asset. President George Bush said: &quot;We are going to take a good look at it, as to whether it has any national security implications ... I&apos;m comfortable with the process.&quot; A routine review will be carried out by the US Committee on Foreign Investments. The committee was criticised last year for approving an acquisition by Dubai Ports World of the British firm P&amp;O, which included several US ports. The ports were sold on to a US firm nine months later after intense political pressure. Under the terms of its deal with Nasdaq, Borse Dubai will hold 20% of the US exchange group directly, with a further 8.4% held in trust. Mr Greifeld said he did not expect the deal to be blocked by issues of national security because, like all shareholders in US stock exchanges, Borse Dubai cannot hold more than 5% of voting rights. Backstory This is not the first time the London Stock Exchange has found itself at the eye of a takeover storm. In recent years it has fought off unwanted overtures from Deutsche B\u00f6rse, Australia&apos;s Macquarie Bank, Euronext and - twice - Nasdaq. Seven years ago a failed bid from OMX, then called OM, valued LSE at \u00a31bn. Since then, the highest offer has come from Nasdaq, valuing the exchange at \u00a32.7bn. It was defeated in February. Yesterday, the prospect of yet another takeover tussle - this time between two oil-rich, sovereign-backed Middle Eastern firms - sent shares soaring again. The business is now valued at almost \u00a33.4bn.

The fiery denunciation came as election officials announced October 6 as the presidential polling date - when General Musharraf will seek his own re-election despite a mounting protest and a welter of legal challenges against him. The army siege of the Red Mosque, in which more than 100 people died, &quot;demonstrated Musharraf&apos;s insistence on continuing his loyalty, submissiveness and aid to America against Muslims ... and makes armed rebellion and removing him obligatory&quot;, Bin Laden said in an audio recording released through Islamist websites. Bin Laden also branded Pakistani soldiers as apostates. &quot;Pervez, his ministers, his soldiers and those who help him, are all accomplices in the spilling of blood,&quot; he said, vowing to avenge the death of Abdul Rashid Ghazi, a radical cleric who favoured strict sharia law in Pakistan. Gen Musharraf&apos;s troops are suffering heavy losses in their battle against al-Qaida and Taliban-linked militants. At least 18 soldiers were killed on Tuesday after being captured in a battle in Waziristan, where more than 200 other troops were still being held hostage. Suicide bombers have been aiming at the army&apos;s elite commando wing and the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency in recent weeks. Gen Musharraf survived two al-Qaida assassination attempts in 2003. A military spokesman, Major General Waheed Arshad, said the army was undeterred. &quot;We have the aim and objective, as our national duty, to eliminate terrorists and eradicate extremism,&quot; he said. In fact Bin Laden&apos;s threats could provide a political uplift for the president, who has played on his image as a bulwark against Islamist extremism to win crucial American support in his struggle to maintain power in his country. Yesterday his information minister, Muhammad Ali Durrani, said the announcement of the October 6 election was &quot;a good day in the history of Pakistan&quot;. But opposition members vowed to scupper the plan by resigning en masse from the national and provincial assemblies that select the president. &quot;This is not an election, it is the supremacy of a dictatorship,&quot; said Liaqat Baloch of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), a coalition of six religious parties that controls about 170 of almost 1,150 seats across the country. The MMA has joined forces with Nawaz Sharif, the ousted former prime minister who was deported for the second time to Saudi Arabia after attempting to return to Pakistan last week. But hopes of embarrassing Gen Musharraf with a half-empty parliament on October 6 have been stalled by the main opposition party, Benazir Bhutto&apos;s Pakistan People&apos;s party (PPP), which has not committed itself to the walk-out. Ms Bhutto, who lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai, is throwing a lifeline to Gen Musharraf in the hope that they might be able to share power after the general elections due by mid-January. The talks have stalled although western diplomats say that an &quot;understanding&quot; is likely to be reached that will allow Ms Bhutto to return home on October 18. &quot;I do not know what awaits me, personally or politically, once I leave the airport,&quot; she wrote in yesterday&apos;s Washington Post. Gen Musharraf could still be derailed by the supreme court, which is hearing several legal appeals. But recently his chances have been boosted by the inactivity of the previously vocal lawyers&apos; movement. Asma Jahangir, a prominent lawyer and human rights activist, said that the movement was being pressured through violence and intimidation. A Karachi lawyer was gunned down in a taxi last week. And a widely circulated text message accused Ms Jahangir of being an Indian spy. &quot;It is sad for a person with no moral authority or political legitimacy to continue to foist himself on the nation,&quot; Ms Jahangir said. Gen Musharraf has tried to quell the growing criticism by pledging to resign from the army and to become a civilian president if he is re-elected in the next elections. But the commonwealth secretary-general, Don McKinnon, visiting Islamabad, said he was reserving judgment on that promise. &quot;The jury is out for a little while yet,&quot; he said. Backstory Pakistan&apos;s election commission yesterday revealed the schedule for the presidential election, selecting September 27 as the deadline for nominations. Polling will be held on October 6 at parliament and at provincial assembles. On October 7 an army deputy chief (and potential Musharraf successor) will be appointed. (Benazir Bhutto, the twice-elected prime minister of Pakistan, is due to return to the country on October 18.) The electoral college that chooses the president is composed of the 342-seat national assembly, the 100-member senate, and the provincial assemblies, in Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan and North West Frontier province, which have about 700 seats. The vote is by secret ballot, and the candidate with the most votes wins a five-year presidential term. It is rare for a president to reach the end of a term. The last military ruler, Zia ul Haq, died in a plane crash. \u00b7 This article was amended on Friday September 21 2007. The number of seats in the bodies that make up the electoral college that chooses the president of Pakistan is 1,150, not 1,500, as we said in the article above. This has been corrected. The electoral college is made up of the national assembly, the senate and provincial assemblies.", "tags": ["World news", "Al-Qaida", "Pakistan", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Bin Laden tape urges uprising against 'infidel' Musharraf as poll date is set", "sentences": ["Ms Bhutto, who lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai, is throwing a lifeline to Gen Musharraf in the hope that they might be able to share power after the general elections due by mid-January."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/21/alqaida.pakistan", "publicationDate": "2007-09-21T14:52:23Z"}, {"article": "British Energy stood out today, up 32p to 520.5p.

Still with energy, BG Group was 7p better at 855p as it confirmed a fourth successful test well in the Santos Basin off Brazil. Elsewhere things were a bit calmer after the recent volatility. Even this morning&apos;s quarterly triple expiry of futures and options - which can lead to dramatic share price movements - passed uneventfully. As for Northern Rock, its shares recovered 8.3p to 193.5p. Investment group RAB Capital has taken a near 6% stake, betting that the worst may now be over. Still no sign of a bidder, though. So by the close the FTSE 100 was 27.7 points higher at 6456.7. Insurance group Prudential added 11p to 696.5p as it poached Tidjane Thiam as finance director from rival Aviva, down 0.5p to 688p. Meanwhile bid target Resolution rose 18.5p to 702.5p. To recap, Resolution has been trying to merge with rival Friends Provident, down 1.2p to 173.5p. But Pearl Assurance and Standard Life, up 1.25p to 275.25p, now seem to be considering bids for Resolution, while Friends could also be a target for the likes of Zurich Financial or Old Mutual, down 0.6p to 153.3p. &quot;Resolution has a real embedded value of more than 750p so there is still plenty of upside,&quot; said Tim Young at Collins Stewart. &quot;Standard Life will have to issue shares [for any bid] so it is probably a trading short. Friends is in play and would be attractive to a number of parties.&quot; Fashion retailer Next added 1p to \u00a319.36 as both JP Morgan and Seymour Pierce issued positive notes. JP Morgan said: &quot;Given a recent deterioration in the outlook for UK consumer spending, we favour companies that are compellingly valued with significant self-help potential, which are managing inventories and margins well and that are likely to see improved sales momentum, despite slowing sales for the overall sector. We think Next fits the bill and this remains our preferred stock in the sector.&quot; Seymour Pierce said Next was &quot;a share to pick up on red days in the market&quot; and repeated its buy recommendation. But B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher continued to suffer after yesterday&apos;s lacklustre results, down 6.3p to 174.7p. Home Retail Group, which owns B&amp;Q rival Homebase, was also unloved, down 7.25p to 366.5p. Building materials group Wolseley lost 18p to 848.5p, as concerns about how it would be hit by the slowing US housing market resurfaced ahead of full-year results due on Monday. Back among the risers, the London Stock Exchange jumped 113p to \u00a318 as UBS and JP Morgan placed 5.3m shares at around \u00a317.95. Dealers suggested the buyer could be the Qatar Investment Authority. Yesterday Qatar and Borse Dubai both took substantial stakes in the LSE, prompting hopes of a takeover battle. However Lloyds of London insurer Beazley lost 3.25p to 172.75p after UBS cut from buy to neutral. It was a bad day to be an investor in some of the UK&apos;s smaller companies. IT group Alphameric collapsed nearly 60%, down 17.5p to 12.5p. The company warned of significant losses at its Amalgamated Racing joint venture, as bookmakers refuse to take its TV and data service and indeed are threatening legal action in a dispute they are currently having with racecourse owners. Meanwhile Alphameric said it was seeking further funding, from third parties and from shareholders. Packaging group API lost 39.5p to 41p as it said it had a cashflow shortfall and was reviewing several options to resolve the situation. Larger than expected losses at airline catering and cabin equipment group Watermark saw its shares slump 2.25p to 14.75p, while display group Screen Technology dropped 6.75p to 5.25p as it warned sales would be below forecasts and that it needed new funding. But support services group Carter &amp; Carter recovered 10.5p to 89.5p after yesterday&apos;s news it was considering a rights issue. Kaupthing analysts said it could reduce debt with a five for three equity issue at 65p. Intellego Holdings was steady at 2.25p as entrepreneur Charles Denton edged his stake up to 20.68%. Traders believe he may have the company in his takeover sights. IT recruitment group InterQuest - where Channel 4 boss and now Borders bookshop owner Luke Johnson holds around 13% - added 5p to 110p after reporting half-year profits up 57% to \u00a31.4m. The company is expected to announce another acquisition shortly. Finally, on Sports Direct watch, Mike Ashley&apos;s company lost another 2p to 121.

The deal will guarantee coverage of 80 days&apos; racing on Channel 4 in 2008 and 2009. Dubai Holding incorporates a number of companies involved in developing and promoting Dubai both as a business centre and a holiday destination. Since it is not concerned with bookmaking, Dubai Holding will be allowed advertisement time at the beginning and end of Channel 4&apos;s Morning Line programme on Saturdays, in addition to the start and close of the live racing coverage. It will also have short &quot;bumper&quot; slots at the beginning and end of commercial breaks. It has been clear for several weeks that a sponsor was likely to be found for Channel 4&apos;s coverage, following Totesport&apos;s decision to pull out of its current agreement at the end of this year. It had been widely assumed, though, that another betting company would be the most natural fit, with firms including Betfair and Paddy Power believed to be involved in preliminary talks. However, Sheikh Mohammed has often used racing to promote Dubai in the past, via his Godolphin operation and such initiatives as the Dubai World Cup, and in effect he has now stepped in to bankroll Channel 4&apos;s output. Hannah Walker, Channel 4 Racing&apos;s public relations officer, said yesterday that the Sheikh&apos;s involvement would not compromise the programme&apos;s editorial standards. &quot;This is a fantastic consumer brand,&quot; Walker said, &quot;and the fact that it involved no editorial restraints [in respect of the Gambling Act], so that it can sponsor the complete schedule was one of the deciding factors. &quot;We have enjoyed a great working relationship in the past with sponsors such as Totesport. They have never placed any editorial requirements on us or vice versa, and I can&apos;t see any reason why that would happen now.&quot; The exact sum paid by Dubai Holding to secure the sponsorship remains confidential - &quot;it&apos;s a significant sum,&quot; Walker said, &quot;and that&apos;s all we are prepared to say.&quot; However, it is widely believed that Channel 4 were asking for \u00a34m over two years, and the final deal is unlikely to be far short of that figure. What remains to be seen is whether the new deal will bring about any major changes in the style or substance of Channel 4&apos;s coverage. A number of the programme&apos;s presenters, including John McCririck and Derek Thompson, have been part of its coverage for 20 years or more, but Walker stressed yesterday that Andrew Franklin, C4 Racing&apos;s director is &quot;always trying to groom new stars&quot;. &quot;Channel 4 Racing is a strong product and it has its loyal viewers,&quot; Walker said. &quot;You could say that if something isn&apos;t broken don&apos;t fix it, but we do have editorial reviews every year. Channel 4 Racing can only change and evolve if the sport changes and evolves, but it might be a good idea to canvass ideas on our programming.&quot; McCririck, who is the face of British racing as far as many casual observers are concerned, was thrown off a TV chat show yesterday for saying to Chris Tarrant&apos;s estranged wife, Ingrid: &quot;You must be terrible in bed for Chris to leave you.&quot; Walker said: &quot;We have a contract with him for our terrestrial racing coverage, as we do with all our presenters, but outside Channel 4 Racing we don&apos;t have any controlling power over them. &quot;It was improper behaviour, but I believe it was dealt with in a proper manner.

Punters will be hoping for clues from today&apos;s consolation Silver Cup, also over Ayr&apos;s six furlongs, but that cannot be guaranteed. High numbers had the call in the Silver Cup a year ago, Geojimali scoring from the 28 draw, only for Fonthill Road to win the following day&apos;s Gold Cup on the opposite side of the track from stall six. There was definitely a draw bias in last week&apos;s Portland Handicap at Doncaster, however, with the stands&apos; side runners greatly favoured. That sprint could provide a useful hint for today&apos;s Silver Cup, in which One More Round (4.40 ) makes a quick reappearance. This veteran raced on the far side of the track at Doncaster, away from the main action, and did well to finish second in his group. Eleventh overall, One More Round was not beaten far by the winner, Fullandby, who is a leading fancy for tomorrow&apos;s big race. A 33-1 shot in places, One More Round could spring a surprise. Commando Scott, who was a close fifth here last year and meets Geojimali on 10lb better terms, is another to note at rewarding odds. He was returning from a three-months break when turning in a pleasing effort at Goodwood recently. Ryan Moore gave up his remaining rides at Ayr yesterday after injuring his toe when unseated in the second race. Hopefully the champion will be fit to resume at Newbury today, as all his expertise is required for the classy Papal Bull (2.45) in the Dubai Duty Free Arc Trial. Sir Michael Stoute&apos;s four-year-old has looked unwilling to exert himself on several occasions, but Moore has coaxed the best out of him on his last two starts. Papal Bull won the Geoffrey Freer Stakes on his latest visit to Newbury and he had the subsequent St Leger winner, Lucarno, back in fourth when taking the Princess Of Wales&apos;s Stakes at Newmarket. It is significant that Luca Cumani steps Bauer up in class and has booked Johnny Murtagh. But the recent Chester winner is officially rated 13lb inferior to Papal Bull. The Haynes, Hanson &amp; Clark Stakes has been won by some big names over the years. Today John Gosden&apos;s Centennial (3.20) can show he is a colt going places. Ron Cox&apos;s tip of the day Cape Vale 3.30 Ayr Dandy Nicholls is renowned for his record with older sprint handicappers, less so with precocious two-year-olds, but the stable&apos;s juveniles are going well. When one can win first time out, in the style achieved by Cape Vale at Thirsk, it pays to sit up and take notice.

This has been the prevailing mood in tourism over the past decade. We want boutique hotels, cosy B&amp;Bs, family-run restaurants serving local fare, city breaks, modest rental cottages, cycling holidays. We shun the sweeping all-you-can-eat hotel buffets, multinational hotel chains, giant cruise ships, carpets of sun loungers on the beach. We seek the isolated and unspoilt and we reject the over-developed and congested. But there is growing evidence that the &quot;big is best&quot; model - typified by the skylines of Cancun, Benidorm and Las Vegas - is fast making a comeback. Across the world, major tourism developments are now planned or under construction that defy the fashion for modesty over brashness. Not since the 1970s have we seen such epic-scale tourism projects.  The spark for much of this about-turn is the success of Dubai, the holiday jewel of the Middle East, that has risen rapidly out of the deserts of the eastern Arabian peninsula and, in just over a decade, become one of the world&apos;s highest-profile tourist destinations. This is a place that is building indoor ski runs in the desert, a theme park twice as large as Florida&apos;s Disneyworld, three skyscrapers vying to be the tallest in the world, hundreds of man-made islands in the sea, a six-runway airport. It&apos;s a formula that has been a huge success: from a standing start in the early 1990s, Dubai now attracts six million visitors a year. And the infrastructure that is currently under construction aims to attract a staggering 15 million by 2010. A growing number of countries now aspire to recreate their own Dubai, largely through the rapid construction of mega-resorts serving high spenders seeking luxury. High yield, low volume is the business model for these destinations: why have four tourists spending \u00a3100 a night when you can have one willing to spend \u00a3400? Even countries such as Iran are starting to think like this, as evidenced by the building of the \u20ac1.7 billion Flower of the East development on Kish Island - a vast project that, when finished in 2010, will include a &quot;seven-star&quot; hotel to rival the famous sail-shaped Burj al Arab across the Persian Gulf in Dubai. Only time will tell the implications such developments will have for local environments and communities. But some campaign groups fear the worst. &quot;According to the International Tourism Business Partnership, the global tourism industry is now worth $6.5 trillion a year, and is projected to achieve 4.2% annual growth over the next decade,&quot; says Tricia Barnett, the director of Tourism Concern. &quot;Clearly developers and governments around the world want to have a cut of this. This latest building frenzy is like the new gold rush and the developments are positively industrial in scale.  &quot;What the tourist will never see, though, is who might have been forcibly moved from their homes to make way for the new resorts and golf courses, how much biodiversity has been lost in their development, how local needs might be sacrificed - such as water - and the extent of the corruption. The tsunami in 2004 unexpectedly and conveniently cleared land that had been longed for by the developers. It&apos;s particularly frightening because the enormity of the resorts are often obscured by their luxury. Nowadays, these developments aren&apos;t necessarily high-rise and in your face. They can be more subtle than that and are cleverly sculpted over huge acreages of land.&quot; Morocco Beautifully restored - and affordable - riads, trekking through vast, empty mountains, exploring ancient kasbahs ... these are the attractions that draw us to Morocco. But the Moroccan government clearly feels it has missed a trick by ignoring the potential of its coastline - only 3.5 miles of it are currently developed for tourism. That is about to change. To reach its goal of 10m holidaymakers by 2010, the government estimated that 160,000 new &apos;tourist beds&apos; would be needed. The result was Plan Azur - a blueprint for six coastal resorts to be built by the end of the decade - five on the Atlantic, one on the Mediterranean. The resort at El Jadida, near Casablanca will focus on &apos;gambling and entertainment&apos; and is being financed by Kerzner International, the hotel group behind the Atlantis in the Bahamas. Other Plan Azur developments include the 5,190-bed Port Lixus marina resort near Tangier.  And it&apos;s not just the beaches being earmarked for development. Dubai-based investor Emaar is spending $2bn on a ski resort in the High Atlas mountains at Oukaimeden. And with 2,000 hotel rooms, more than 300 retail units and 25,000 square metres of business and conference facilities planned, Oukaimeden will be a year-round hive of activity. But anyone who has visited the High Atlas will probably be wondering exactly how Emaar will combine the two seemingly opposite worlds of the Berbers with that of &apos;conference facilities&apos;. LH Kenya A lion surrounded by a dozen white 4X4s. White-sand beaches crammed with package-holiday tourists. Images that could easily blur the mind&apos;s-eye vision of a dream safari holiday - and ones that Kenya has worked hard to shake-off in recent years. The strategy appears to have worked; eco-lodges are thriving, while the tourist numbers continue to swell: one million visitors will fly in this year for the first time ever. So what to make of a new long-term plan to build three resort cities - one in the safari heartland, the others at the coast - with South Africa&apos;s Sun City as the inspiration? A wise move or the first step on the path downmarket? The first resort is planned for Isiolo, a backwater town 40 miles north of Mount Kenya. Situated at the gateway between the lush highlands and the desert scrub &apos;badlands&apos; that run towards Ethiopia, the town currently has little to offer the visitor in terms of amenities or attractions, bar a lively livestock market attended by Samburu, Turkana and Boran tribesmen. What it does have is a superb climate and location: there are seven wildlife sanctuaries nearby, including Samburu, Buffalo Springs and Lewa Downs.  While no firm plans have yet been drawn up - tourism officials are still studying resorts in Las Vegas, Dubai and South Africa for ideas - it is envisaged that the Isiolo will become a &apos;one-stop-shop&apos; for tourists, with hotels, restaurants, golf courses and entertainment.  &apos;We are still in the first steps but imagine that it will have a design similar to Sun City,&apos; said Mwangi Gakunga, spokesman at the tourism ministry.  Resorts are also planned for Mombasa and a second coastal city, possibly Malindi to the north, in the next 10 to 15 years.  The idea of a resort city on the coast is not new; the government identified Diani Beach, south of Mombasa, as a possible location as far back as 1971. But the plan was shelved after concerns about sustainability and the effect on local population. Eager to avoid similar problems this time, the government has pledged to conduct impact assessments on both the human and natural environment before any ground is broken. Xan Rice, East Africa correspondent  Switzerland If Dubai can build ski runs in the scorching heat of its desert, then why can&apos;t a beach be recreated up a snow-crested mountain? That is the view of Samih Sawiris, the billionaire owner of the Egypt-based Orascom hotel group, who has announced that he is to fund a huge new resort at Andermatt, complete with swimming pool and artificial sandy beach. Construction starts next year on land formerly owned by the Swiss army and will also incorporate the ubiquitous 18-hole golf course (though few can have built at such high altitude) and tropical spa complex. Five new hotels will offer at least 800 rooms and help create 2,000 new jobs in a town that has a population of 1,600 and has suffered an economic depression since the Swiss army vacated its training centre near the town following the end of the cold war. The beach will not be the only odd sight in the Alps. The \u00a370m Matterhorn Glacier Paradise Project will see a 117 metre steel and glass pyramid built on top of the Klein Matterhorn, taking it to a height of 4,000 metres - which tourist chiefs hope will &apos;make the mountain more attractive to visitors&apos;. But given that the Alps are currently one of climate change&apos;s proverbial &apos;coalmine canaries&apos; due to the region&apos;s fast-melting glaciers and disappearing snow lines, is this mountain range really the best place to spend billions of dollars on new tourism infrastructure? LH China Hainan Island, which lies off the southern coast of the Chinese mainland, is often called &apos;China&apos;s Hawaii&apos; due to its silky sand, palm-fringed beaches and year-round tropical climate. That it has attracted this nickname says something about the type of tourism on offer, The main resort&apos;s hub, Sanya, with 18 golf courses (and 10 more planned), a thick swathe of beach front and high-rise hotels mean it has the look of pretty much any identikit tropical beach resort in the world - clearly inspired by western hotels.  But it&apos;s China&apos;s domestic tourists who are really fuelling Sanya&apos;s building boom. Yalong Bay, a special &apos;tourism national reserve&apos; about 12 miles east of Sanya, is where most of the luxury hotels are now located. International hotels chains that have located there include Sheraton, Crowne Plaza and Marriott. Further along the coast still is Haitang Bay where there are plans for a $200m &apos;seven-star deluxe hotel project&apos; to be constructed by 2011.  What is happening in Sanya today could be a taster for things to come elsewhere as Chinese tourists get more adventurous and start to travel beyond their borders with increasing frequency and volume. The UN&apos;s World Tourism Organisation predicts that about 100 million tourists will be coming out of China each year by 2020, a rise of 80m from 2003. LH Libya Libya may have only just taken its first tentative steps into the world of tourism since coming in from the cold but the government is already planning to leapfrog into tourism&apos;s big league.  Earlier this month, Muammar Gadafy&apos;s 35-year-old son, Saif al-Islam, announced to a slightly perplexed gathering of the world&apos;s press that a 2,000-square-mile area of land between Benghazi and Tobruk in the north will be the location for the $3bn &apos;Green Mountain Sustainable Development Area&apos;. The plan is to incorporate a national park, eco-friendly hotels and even organic farms. It aims to create more than 70,000 jobs and comes with the endorsement of some high-profile names including Sir Norman Foster, Sir Nicholas Stern and the Prince of Wales ... well, the The Prince&apos;s School of Traditional Arts is involved. The authorities clearly know what they don&apos;t want - the Green Mountain brochure has a photograph of Benidorm with a big red cross through it - but are a little vague on the details when it comes to explaining exactly how this vision for sustainable tourism will be realised. But one sensible step taken will be to not build on the coast itself. Instead, all the hotels and tourism facilities will be set back away from the beach. LH Cambodia Cambodia&apos;s reputation as a less-developed, more pristine alternative to the well-trodden backpacker tracks that traverse Thailand and Vietnam could be short lived. The county&apos;s largely untouched south coast is the focus of a major government-backed project to develop high-end tourism. A year ago, it announced that 61 offshore islands were now available to international investors to develop into a beach paradise. According to local media reports, the government wants to jump start the country&apos;s economy and help diversify the tourism industry beyond the prime attraction of the 800-year-old Angkor Wat.  Last year, a Russian financier signed an agreement for an initial investment of $300m to develop one of the islands, sparking fears among local environmentalists about the implications for the rest of the near-pristine coastline. And in August, the government announced that the leases for five of the islands had been sold for $627m.

On Thursday the Qatar Investment Authority snapped up almost 21% of the LSE, paying \u00a315.85 a share. This came hard on the heels of the sale by US exchange Nasdaq of the bulk of its LSE stake to Borse Dubai for what now looks a knockdown price of \u00a314.14. Dealers speculated that yesterday&apos;s trades could be the Qataris topping up their stake, to strengthen their hand if Dubai decides to make a bid. British Energy also stood out, up 32p to 520.5p. Investors seem to have decided the company would benefit from recent increases in electricity prices, something highlighted in a positive note from analysts at Cazenove. &quot;The UK forward electricity price for 2008-09 has risen by 10% in the last three weeks and is now around \u00a342/MWh, its highest level so far this year,&quot; said Caz. &quot;Despite this rise, British Energy&apos;s share price reaction has been somewhat muted, with the shares still some 20% off their year-to-date high of 588p reached in late May.

To recap, Resolution has been trying to merge with rival Friends Provident, down 1.2p to 173.5p. But Pearl Assurance and Standard Life, up 1.25p to 275.25p, now seem to be considering bids for Resolution, while Friends could also be a target for the likes of Zurich Financial or Old Mutual, down 0.6p to 153.3p. &quot;Resolution has a real embedded value of more than 750p so there is still plenty of upside,&quot; said Tim Young at Collins Stewart. &quot;Standard Life will have to issue shares [for any bid] so it is probably a trading short. Friends is in play and would be attractive to a number of parties.&quot; Miners moved higher along with rising metals prices, with Rio Tinto climbing 52p to a new peak of \u00a340.49. Fashion retailer Next added 1p to \u00a319.36 as both JP Morgan and Seymour Pierce issued positive notes. But B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher continued to suffer after Thursday&apos;s lacklustre results, down 6.3p to 174.7p. Home Retail Group, which owns B&amp;Q rival Homebase, was also unloved, down 7.25p to 366.5p. Building materials group Wolseley lost 18p to 848.5p as concerns about how it would be hit by the slowing US housing market resurfaced ahead of full-year results due on Monday, while Lloyds of London insurer Beazley lost 3.25p to 172.75p after UBS cut it from buy to neutral. It was a bad day to be an investor in some of the UK&apos;s smaller companies. IT group Alphameric collapsed nearly 60%, down 17.5p to 12.5p after it warned of significant losses, while packaging group API lost 39.5p to 41p as it said it had a cash flow shortfall and was reviewing several options to resolve the situation. Larger than expected losses at airline catering and cabin equipment group Watermark saw its shares slump 2.25p to 14.75p, while display group Screen Technology dropped 6.75p to 5.25p as it warned sales would be below forecasts and that it needed new funding. But support services group Carter &amp; Carter recovered 10.5p to 89.5p after Thursday&apos;s news it was considering a rights issue. Kaupthing analysts said it could reduce debt with a five-for-three equity issue at 65p. Intellego Holdings was steady at 2.25p as entrepreneur Charles Denton edged his stake up to 20.68%. Traders believe he may have the company in his takeover sights. IT recruitment group InterQuest, where Channel 4 boss and now Borders bookshop owner Luke Johnson holds 13%, added 5p to 110p after reporting half year profits up 57% to \u00a31.4m. The company is expected to announce another acquisition shortly. On Sports Direct watch, Mike Ashley&apos;s company lost another 2p to 121p. The company has postponed an analysts visit due next week, which was set up in an attempt to be more accommodating to the City. Adventis venturesAim-listed marketing and advertising group Adventis reports its interim results on Monday and they are likely to show double digit profit growth, reflecting its recent strong run of contract wins. The first-half numbers could include a contribution from several new accounts across the group&apos;s healthcare marketing business, media buying agency and financial public relations arm. That new business followed a contract win in February with biotechnology company Merck Serono. On the costs side, the three Adventis healthcare agencies have recently moved into a shared office. Aside from cutting overheads, the move is designed to boost cross-selling opportunities. Adventis, which remains on the acquisition trail in an attempt to boost its financial arm, added 2.5p to 52p. nick.fletcher@theguardian.com", "tags": ["UBS", "Business"], "title": "Nick Fletcher: Market forces", "sentences": ["This came hard on the heels of the sale by US exchange Nasdaq of the bulk of its LSE stake to Borse Dubai for what now looks a knockdown price of \u00a314.14.", "Dealers speculated that yesterday&apos;s trades could be the Qataris topping up their stake, to strengthen their hand if Dubai decides to make a bid."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/22/marketforces", "publicationDate": "2007-09-22T22:53:23Z"}, {"article": "Swanky airline Silverjet (0844 855 0111; www.flysilverjet.com) will launch daily flights from Luton to Dubai this November, making it the first business class-only airline to offer a non-transatlantic service.

A few short years ago the basic banner ad and the flashing logo on an online skyscraper were both revolutionary steps for ads on the web. But as Britain&apos;s broadband homes continue to multiply and greater proportions of ad spend are directed online, the agency creatives are getting to grips with the web and starting to understand that their imaginations can be rewarded on behalf of increasingly sophisticated clients. Although there are apocryphal stories of ad creative directors who still struggle to open emails, much other evidence suggests that online ads are at a new stage of development - especially among the growing number of specialist digital agencies. David Hurren, executive creative director at LBi, an independent digital agency formed from the merger of Framfab and LB Icon 18 months ago, says that agencies looking at just placing banner ads are simply out of date; the key creative ideas online are now aimed more at engaging customers in interaction and creating ambassadors for the brand. &quot;Customers are subconsciously discriminating about what ad is of use online,&quot; says Hurren. &quot;They want functionality.&quot; Olly Robinson, joint head of creative at online specialist Agency.com (owned by Omnicom), says that three years ago web technology led the creative idea, but not any more. In 2004, Agency.com was one of the first to put TV-quality film into an online ad with a campaign for the NSPCC that featured children walking across the user&apos;s computer screen. Technology is still important but it is not an end in itself, it&apos;s more about facilitating the creative idea, says Robinson. For example, late last year Agency.com used specially developed VoIP software so that its ad for BT&apos;s Softphone could ask users seeing the ad to sing into their PC and &quot;break&quot; a virtual wine glass by holding a specific musical note. &quot;The issue with VoIP technology is that it can be poor quality audio, but this ad was fun as well as illustrating the point about the clarity of BT&apos;s online phone call connection,&quot; says Robinson. This summer Archibald Ingall Stretton, which counts Skoda and O2 as its biggest clients, decided to make use of the growing number of computers that have embedded cameras in a campaign linking O2 as the principal sponsor of the England Rugby team. The O2 Stare Out campaign website (www.o2stareout.com) challenges those at home to a staring contest with England rugby team members such as Mike Tindall, who can stare for 6.5 minutes without blinking - according to Geoff Gower, creative technologist at Archibald Ingall Stretton. &quot;We have some software (BitMapData) that tells us when you blink and we obviously know when the players blink,&quot; says Gower. &quot;It&apos;s a website that you can interact with in a completely different way. Microphones have been used before, but this is one of the first times an agency has used webcams.&quot; Digital agency Lean Mean Fighting Machine is also getting closer to the idea of creative TV and web convergence. Asked by Emirates Airlines to publicise the first-ever, non-stop flight from the Middle East to South America (a 14-hour trip from Dubai to Sao Paolo), the agency decided to tell potential visitors to South America about the new non-stop destination by creating the longest ever non-stop advert. Filming took place in Sao Paolo with a former Brazilian TV presenter-turned-journalist who talks for 14 hours non-stop about his homeland and why it is such a marvellous place to visit. &quot;It&apos;s an event ad that has a PR element that we can drive people to,&quot; says Tom Bazeley, managing partner of Lean Mean Fighting Machine. &quot;A year ago, the client would&apos;ve laughed at us and dismissed the idea.&quot; Interactivity equals impact But on the web, a cool idea can make an even bigger impact if it embraces interactivity. Ben Clapp, head of creative at Tribal DDB (the digital arm of BMP DDB), says getting the consumer interacting with your brand is the key to the best online creative ads. But he claims that interactivity works best if it is an extension of what users are already doing online. For example, nowadays most research for big purchases like cars is done online, so the goal for a campaign for Volkswagen Passat is to engage the potential buyers with the brand and hopefully turn research into a sale. Tribal DDB&apos;s current Vol kswagen Passat campaign offers humorous advice to middle-aged men suffering from a mid-life crisis; a microsite contains a mock psychiatric test and a chance for family or friends to make a &quot;get well&quot; video to send to the &quot;patient&quot;. This growing emphasis on participatory content shows that the creatives and the copywriters are paramount, says IAB head of marketing Kieron Matthews. The best agencies have cultivated a good working rapport between the creatives and the technical development team, with the result being titles like &quot;creative technologist&quot;. This push towards creative technology is a mark of the maturity of the UK online ad business, says IAB&apos;s Matthews. As online ads grow in importance, the traditional advertising pitch is also changing. A few years ago, the core pitch would most likely be for a TV ad that would include the customer &quot;take-out&quot; (for example, Nike might want viewers to think of the company&apos;s shoes as the highest performance trainers ever); now online video ads may still include a &quot;take-out&quot;, but the increasing question is, what can the client get the customer to put in? &quot;Before, we might be speaking to account execs, but we now talk to marketing directors or board members who can spend more money, and this means our production budgets are increasing,&quot; says Lean Mean Fighting Machine&apos;s Bazeley. There is still some hesitancy to embrace online by some but, according to Bazeley, most clients have lost their original nervousness about online ad campaigns and are ready to experiment. &quot;It&apos;s hard for some clients to change and we usually point them to someone else if all they want is a simple banner ad.&quot; However, according to the IAB, there is still a lot of creative catching up to do by UK agencies and clients in the online arena. &quot;There are a number of agencies doing exceptional work, but also a lot that aren&apos;t. The amount of good creative online overall is still very low,&quot; says the IAB&apos;s Kieron Matthews. &quot;But that&apos;s also true of the creative world in other areas like TV advertising. There is definitely room for improvement in creative consistency.&quot; Rich video content is being used heavily, he says, but there is much more to come. &quot;After all, the creative constraints in a medium like television are limiting - you can have an ad that lasts 10 to 90 seconds but it needs sound and the creativity comes from the storyline within it. But online, there are no such restrictions. Online video is not just a TV ad online.&quot; Case study: VW Golf When it comes to participatory online advertising, the recent Volkswagen Golf &quot;Night Driving&quot; campaign from the ad agency, Tribal DDB, used both online and above-the-line advertising to emphasise one of Golf&apos;s original primary brand promises - that owners will enjoy driving them. The TV campaign as well as the online ads directed owners to a microsite where they were urged to film themselves driving at night - a time when the roads are clear and driving for fun is possible. Drivers were given advice about how and what to film, what editing software to use, given soundtrack music to choose from and simple ways of compiling their own video. The submissions were shown on the site and rated by fellow Golf enthusiasts, in much the same way as YouTube viewers rate the videos. There was also a link to Google Maps to show &quot;night driving&quot; routes. &quot;This was the closest bit of advertising integration that we&apos;ve ever done, working closely with our creatives who make the TV ads and ensuring that their spots signed off with an online address to push people to the microsite,&quot; says Ben Clapp, creative director of Tribal DDB. &quot;We provided functional technology that many people enjoyed and it gave them a greater sense of what we believe Golf is all about as a car.&quot; The campaign began running this summer and within the first 12 weeks the microsite had attracted more than 106,000 unique visitors (60,000 arrived via online ads), who spent on average three minutes, 20 seconds on the site. This was longer than the average session on Volkswagen.co.uk. Half the users who either went on to the video section or the Google maps area were spending on average more than 30 minutes on the site. To date, 800 &quot;night drives&quot; have been mapped out and over 180 individual night driving movies created and published. Latest figures earlier this month reveal 13,000 online viewings. In commercial terms, the campaign generated around 3,000 Golf brochure requests and an estimated 200 people booked themselves in for a test drive in the car from the website. According to Sophus3, which monitors and organises car industry web traffic data, Volkswgen Golf increased its traffic in June alone by 15% over the same month last year.", "tags": ["Advertising", "Media", "Digital media"], "title": "Wanted: art director, copywriter, technologist", "sentences": ["Asked by Emirates Airlines to publicise the first-ever, non-stop flight from the Middle East to South America (a 14-hour trip from Dubai to Sao Paolo), the agency decided to tell potential visitors to South America about the new non-stop destination by creating the longest ever non-stop advert."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/24/advertising.digitalmedia4", "publicationDate": "2007-09-24T16:09:32Z"}, {"article": "The Godolphin operation has sent out Group One winners at dozens of tracks and in 11 different countries since it was founded in 1992, but no stage has been as generous to the royal blue silks as the Queen&apos;s racecourse in Berkshire. To date, they have unsaddled 18 top-class winners at Ascot, so after a season that has yielded just two Group Ones so far, Godolphin may be a little relieved that Ascot and its Festival meeting loom large this week. It is Godolphin&apos;s jockey, Frankie Dettori, who enjoys the closest relationship with the course, so much so that there is a statue in his honour just inside the main gate. As Kieren Fallon said last year, &quot;there are some courses where you arrive and you just feel that you&apos;re going to do well. For me, it&apos;s Epsom, and for Dettori, it&apos;s Ascot.&quot; But for his main employer too, there could be no better place to gather their strength and push on into the autumn. Ramonti, who will attempt to give Godolphin their fourth victory in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on Saturday after Mark Of Esteem, Dubai Millennium and Summoner, is the only horse in their yard with a Group One this year. His opponents include last year&apos;s winner George Washington and Darjina, who beat the pair of them at Longchamp earlier this month. What Ramonti has in his favour, though, is an attitude to the business of racing that few horses can match. Many animals would have carried a mental scar after the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, when Dettori was banned for 14 days for using his whip 25 times in the final 2\u00bd furlongs. It was a punishing experience, but Ramonti came out just a few weeks later to win another Group One, the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. &quot;He doesn&apos;t share the brilliance of Mark Of Esteem or Dubai Millennium,&quot; Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, says. &quot;What he achieves, he achieves through hard work. He has a fantastic attitude, and that is a big plus for him. He tries his hardest, and then he bounces back for more every time. &quot;It&apos;s going to be tough on Saturday, it&apos;s always difficult to keep a horse performing to that level consistently over a period of time because every race is a hard race for a horse like Ramonti. He&apos;s only had four races this year, but they have all been championship events, and he&apos;s won two and finished second in the others.&quot; Success this weekend would make Ramonti the 11th horse in Godolphin history to win three Group Ones in a single season (only two, Fantastic Light and Daylami, have managed to accumulate four). With George Washington, perhaps the most famous failure in the history of the Coolmore Stud, in the field this weekend, the QEII is also the latest chance for Godolphin to strike a blow in its unending struggle to win the hearts of breeders and Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s standing in the bloodstock business. But after a season that has been, by any measure, a disappointment, it could also be a turning point. The Flat season is so heavily weighted towards the autumn that they still have time to turn it around, and Godolphin is simply too big an operation to lie dormant for long. &quot;Rio De La Plata is entered in the Royal Lodge [at Ascot on Saturday] but that will be a bit soon after his last race in Ireland and we will be looking either to go to Paris the following weekend or to the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket. &quot;Discreet Cat had a throat abscess in the World Cup which has wiped out a lot of his season. We know it wasn&apos;t there 48 hours before the race, and there is a strong suspicion that it actually burst in the race. &quot;He&apos;s in a six-furlong race at Belmont Park on Sunday, and he&apos;s also in the Breeders&apos; Cup Sprint. We&apos;ve knocked the Classic [over 10 furlongs] on the head, it&apos;s a shame that he never got a fair crack of the whip over that trip, but bearing in mind what&apos;s been wrong with him, we&apos;re just pleased to see him back.&quot; With major runners on both sides of the Atlantic this weekend, Godolphin may feel that better times are on the way. &quot;It is being part of the big event that counts, whether it is at Ascot or anywhere else, &quot; Crisford says. &quot;Those are the races that set the pulse racing, and if they don&apos;t, you are in the wrong business.&quot; Ron Cox&apos;s tip of the day Red Somerset 5.30 Leicester Trainer Ron Hodges has a 30% strike-rate at Leicester and with his yard in good form, Red Somerset could be one for each-way punters. Badly handicapped since scoring at two, this four-year-old has now dropped nearly 20lb since April and caught the eye last time.

Competing Gulf emirates of Dubai and Qatar on Thursday splurged an estimated \u00a31.6bn or more on shares in the London Stock Exchange and Nordic bourse operator OMX. At the same time, Dubai struck a partnership deal with Nasdaq which it hopes will eventually deliver a stake worth an estimated \u00a31bn in the US operator. From Carlyle Group to P&amp;O, from Ferrari to Four Seasons, Gulf sovereign funds have been rapidly scooping up major interests in some of the western world&apos;s biggest businesses. They have not been this active since the oil price peaks of the 1970s - and, with the era of cheap borrowing apparently at a close, there is every sign such cash-rich funds could again pick up the pace of their overseas investment programmes. Control Among the busiest - and most active in Britain - have been funds from Qatar and United Arab Emirates members Dubai and Abu Dhabi. As well as investment in the LSE, Qatar has rarely been out of the headlines thanks to its efforts to win control of the number three UK supermarket chain Sainsbury&apos;s. Dubai, operating through three main funds - Dubai Holdings, Dubai International Capital and Istithmar - last year took control of ports operator P&amp;O and budget hotels Travelodge. It remains an investor in the Tussauds theme park empire, including Alton Towers and Legoland, but recently sold 80% of the business. DIC also came close to owning Liverpool football club. Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi&apos;s Mubadala fund this week emerged with a 7.5% stake in US private equity firm Carlyle. It also has a 5% holding in Ferrari. The latest wave of petrodollar investment has caused consternation in the US, where many politicians have argued sovereign funds - particularly when they are investing in assets that are strategically important to a nation - should not be treated like regular investors. The prospect of a sheikhdom becoming the largest shareholder in the Nasdaq was enough last week to draw comment from President George Bush, who gave assurances that the &quot;national security implications&quot; would be thoroughly scrutinised before the deal was closed. Influential senator Charles Schumer was quick to draw parallels with Dubai&apos;s takeover of P&amp;O, which included strategic ports in the US. That deal was eventually approved by the US committee on foreign investments but not without attracting a political storm. The controversial US sites were nevertheless swiftly sold on to a domestic operator. Critical On Dubai&apos;s planned Nasdaq holding, senator Schumer said: &quot;At this early stage, this deal gives me pause. While I am and have been a big proponent of foreign investment in the United States, we must still be careful of the kinds of investments made in our critical infrastructure, financial exchanges, utilities and other areas that are vital to the operation and security of our country.&quot; It seems clear that both Dubai and Qatar also regard ownership of the world&apos;s leading stock exchange operations to be of central strategic importance. Both are vying to be the region&apos;s leading financial centre and a bridgehead to emerging markets further east. Qatar is a relative newcomer to the ranks of Middle East high spenders. Though it does have some oil reserves its recent elevation to the ranks of the energy rich has come from its huge gas reserves. Qatar is said to be sitting on 15% of the world&apos;s natural gas - giving it reserves comparable to those of Iran and about half those of Russia. Over the last decade it has been building up its exports of natural gas, first to Japan but in recent years to the US and Europe as they have become increasingly dependent on energy imports and have built the facilities to allow them to import liquefied natural gas. War chest The expansion of its LNG business, built around a massive offshore field, coupled with lower transportation costs and new markets has given substantial fire power and its acquisition war chest is likley to increase as production rises over the coming years. Abu Dhabi is the energy hub of the United Arab Emirates, holding the bulk of the UAE&apos;s gas and oil reserves, which puts it well up the global league table for reserves of both fuels. It joined the ranks of the oil rich towards the end of the 1950s, when its huge reserves were first tapped, making Qatar something of a newcomer. The emirate has an estimated $1,000bn invested abroad and its 420,000 citizens are reckoned to be worth about $17m each - excluding the emirate&apos;s huge population of foreign workers. Despite its oil wealth Abu Dhabi is seeking to diversify to reduce its dependence on its energy resources. Dubai, like Abu Dhabi a member of the UAE, has no such luxury. It does not have Abu Dhabi&apos;s abundance of oil and gas. Instead it has built its success on its location, re-inventing itself as a top tourist attraction and, behind the glitz, a serious international business and financial centre - turning, in the words of one observer, the cash from its oil rich neighbours into capital. Cash pile The total invested on shares in the London Stock Exchange and Nordic OMX: \u00a31.6bn The hoped-for value of Dubai&apos;s stake in Nasdaq after its partnership deal: $1bn  Abu Dhabi&apos;s citizens are thought to be worth an average $17m each", "tags": ["Business", "Oil"], "title": "Wave of petrodollars from the emirates sets western stock markets alight", "sentences": ["Competing Gulf emirates of Dubai and Qatar on Thursday splurged an estimated \u00a31.6bn or more on shares in the London Stock Exchange and Nordic bourse operator OMX.", "At the same time, Dubai struck a partnership deal with Nasdaq which it hopes will eventually deliver a stake worth an estimated \u00a31bn in the US operator.", "Control Among the busiest - and most active in Britain - have been funds from Qatar and United Arab Emirates members Dubai and Abu Dhabi.", "As well as investment in the LSE, Qatar has rarely been out of the headlines thanks to its efforts to win control of the number three UK supermarket chain Sainsbury&apos;s.

Ad-Air, which is backed by \u00a35m in private equity finance, plans to create advertisements up to five acres or 20,000 sq metres in size on the ground alongside flight paths. The network includes 30 airports including London Heathrow, Paris Charles De Gaulle, Los Angeles International, Chicago O&apos;Hare and Tokyo Narita.  The first site, an advertisement for a large real estate developer, will be launched at Dubai Airport in October. The concept has been tried before, with companies such as Flight Path Media creating sites of up to 9,000 square metres at Gatwick Airport on behalf of BudgetHolidays.com in 2003. However, this is the first time a company has tried to create a global network on this scale - previous attempts have been more of an ad hoc approach, according to media agencies. Haakon Dewing, the Ad-Air operations director, said the sites would reach 96% of business travellers and 81% of leisure travellers at Heathrow belonging to the ABC1 demographic. &quot;The majority of people we have surveyed over the last few years have stated that they look out of the window if seated in a window seat - it&apos;s human nature,&quot; Mr Dewing said. &quot;We believe this offering gives brand advertisers the next level of quality and exposure in the advertising market - not only is it on an unprecedented scale but it is presented in a clutter-free environment.&quot; The advertising sites will be attached to a low-level scaffold to ensure the image is displayed flat and evenly, for an optimum viewing height of 200m and 350m. The company claims the products and processes used are environmentally friendly. Ad-Air plans to illuminate the sites where local planning laws permit, but no sites in the UK will be back-lit.

The response from UK advertisers has been lukewarm, according to Steve Bond, managing director of Posterscope Group, the outdoor advertising specialist. Mr Bond told MediaGuardian.co.uk he had suggested the idea to his clients but none of them were interested in investing serious money in the medium, which was expensive, involved a long time commitment, and lacked accountability. &quot;I don&apos;t think many advertisers are queuing up to buy regular slots unless we&apos;re all surprised by how good it looks when the first one goes down,&quot; Mr Bond said.  &quot;People are not prepared to take chances in this economy we have - I wouldn&apos;t put my own money it.&quot; Outdoor advertising is the fastest growing advertising medium behind the internet, up 27.8% to \u00a3932 million in the UK in the past three years, according to the Outdoor Advertising Association.

The problems on credit markets led to uncertainty and jitters among equity traders during what was an unusually active summer but proved good news for the exchange and contributed to the strong growth of the SETS (stock exchange trading system) electronic order book in the period April to June. Volumes increased 77% to a total 57.9m bargains for the first five months and the average daily number of SETS bargains rose to 551,000. In a trading update released yesterday, ahead of the publication of its six month results in mid-November, the exchange said that in the five months ending August 31 there were 216 new issues and total money raised from the primary market increased 12% to \u00a326.8bn. Out of the new issues, 68 were for the main market, including 25 from overseas. The total value of SETS bargains rose to \u00a3918bn, up 47%, though the average value decreased. An exchange spokesman said the decrease had been expected. &quot;The trend is towards hugely increased numbers of trades but those trades are of a lower value. This seems to be a market trend, it could be down to ... hedge funds doing lots of trades to take advantage of split-second, individual price differentials ... or because instead of trading \u00a3100,000 once a month, [traders are] doing lots of smaller \u00a310,000 trades.&quot; The use of new trading platform TradElect, which helps market users to sustain high trading volumes in peak times, also helped increase trading.

Of course you are. But what happens once the four-yearly show rolls out of town and normal service resumes? You know, half-hearted tours with weakened squads, club-versus-country rows, pretending the Pacific Island nations don&apos;t exist, a swift return to obscurity for Portugal, Georgia, etc, etc. The International Rugby Board&apos;s finest minds will be addressing the subject in November but, frankly, there is no time to waste. And so, pausing only to remind you where you heard it first, here comes the solution, freshly scrawled on the back of a Parisian bistro receipt. Unfortunately I cannot reproduce the original document here because: 1) it is covered with espresso stains, 2) those nice people in Guardian accounts need the original bill, and 3) I want to avoid losing it because it could become a priceless artifact one day, as much a part of the game&apos;s folklore as William Webb Ellis&apos;s jockstrap. Or maybe not. Anyway, for the benefit of Dr Syd Millar and friends, here&apos;s how to save Test rugby union in just five minutes. First, get yourself a clean sheet of paper, a pen and a copy of the IRB&apos;s world rankings. Write down the top eight nations in ranking order: New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, France, Ireland, England and Wales. Now divide them, tennis-style, into a seeded draw: 1 v 8, 2 v 7, 3 v 6, 4 v 5. Hey presto, you have a list of fixtures: New Zealand v Wales, Australia v England, South Africa v Ireland, Argentina v France. The away team in the previous series between the sides would be awarded home advantage for two Tests on successive weekends; in the event of a 1-1 draw the outcome would be settled by aggregate points difference. The winners would advance to the semi-finals (1 v 4, 2 v 3), the losers to a similarly-formatted relegation play-off. You might, for the sake of argument, end up with New Zealand v France and Australia v South Africa in the semis. The winners - New Zealand and Australia, in theory - would then contest the final the following weekend. Similarly the four first-round losers would also meet, culminating in a relegation play-off decider. As in the Davis Cup, the champions of the next level down (teams ranked 9-16) would be promoted. And so on, and so on. Beautifully simple, isn&apos;t it? No longer will disinterested teams shuffle around the world for Tests which mean little. The new system could even start as early as 2010 and be played on a biennial basis, with World Cup and Lions years exempt. Fixtures would be confirmed in December of the previous year, with the Tri Nations (plus Argentina) and the Six Nations championship continuing as per normal. So-called traditional summer and autumn tours would disappear, but the current number of Tests would remain roughly the same. Ideally the new competition (which needs a name: The World Series? The North-South Shield? The Syd Cup?) would last just four weeks and take place in June, which would become the sole global window for inter-hemisphere games. &apos;What about the money?&apos; I hear them cry at Twickenham. Well, let&apos;s take England as an example. At the moment they have either five or six lucrative home Tests, depending on the Six Nations fixture list. Depending on the draw, they could have seven under the new system. If a smaller nation - say Tonga - wants to do a deal with a larger one involving a share of gate receipts, they would be permitted to cede home advantage if they wanted. If not, the likes of New Zealand - and the leading European nations for that matter - would have to change the habit of a lifetime and go and play some meaningful capped games in the South Seas. Every match would mean something and the semi-finals and final could be played at a suitable neutral venue. New Zealand v England in Hong Kong or Dubai, perhaps? Television companies and sponsors would trample each other in the rush. Suddenly the world would be union&apos;s oyster, oxygen would flow into the more neglected backwaters of the game, and the IRB would not have to worry about the sport withering on the vine between World Cups. There are, of course, some sticking points. The French championship final would have to move from June and it might also help if the Six Nations was switched to May. But think of the advantages for both rich and poor countries alike. It would be less a case of diluting the aura of the Rugby World Cup than enhancing its appeal. We would also be spared the interminable four-year bleating of coaches who claim nothing much matters between World Cups. Young players could experience the true intensity of Test rugby without being away from home for months. Even the New Zealand Maori, currently set to join the Pacific Nations Cup alongside Fiji, Japan, Samoa and Tonga and Australia A, could be involved if necessary.

Dettori was in a better position than Jamie Spencer on Excellent Art on the heels of front-running Duke of Marmalade and kicking for home at that stage probably made the difference with Excellent Art not able to make up the four lengths required. Godolphin&apos;s Simon Crisford does not consider Ramonti to be in the same league as their two most notable winners of this race, Dubai Millennium and Markofesteem, but, as he intimated, the Italy-bred horse makes up for it with his determination. The time was not good in comparison to earlier Listed winner Perfect Star, but three Group Ones tell some sort of tale and you cannot help but admire Ramonti&apos;s battling qualities. Even Dettori does not appear to rate him too highly as he said: &apos;He keeps on proving me wrong.&apos; The pair of big two-year-old races on the card are always expected to answer questions about next year&apos;s Classics and the Fillies&apos; Mile - run in a decent time - did, while posing a few more. Stephane Pasquier, riding the Andre Fabre-trained favourite Proviso, found himself in a poor position early on after being squeezed out by Johnny Murtagh riding Listen. Proviso, having been forced wider than Pasquier wanted, then had to expend valuable energy early in the straight trying to catch Listen. There was no French dictionary to hand as Pasquier described another jockey, presumably Murtagh, as &apos;un connard&apos;; actually it means &apos;asshole&apos;. However, watching the replay led to the conclusion that Listen had something more to give and Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s filly makes more appeal at 8-1 for the 1,000 Guineas than Proviso at the same price. Mind you, 7-2 the pair does not look bad business. Murtagh has not established himself at the top of his profession by accident and he was at it again in the Totesport.com Challenge Cup aboard Candidato Roy. Drawn one, on the stands&apos; side, Murtagh noticed when cantering down that there was what he described as &apos;a lovely strip near the rail&apos; and there he raced on his own, leading all the way. The jockey probably noticed only because he was looking for an edge, vital in such a competitive handicap. Candidato Roy may have won had he raced with the main pack, but it must be doubtful. The colts&apos; race, the Royal Lodge, paid two compliments to Raven&apos;s Pass, now 6-1 second favourite for the 2,000 Guineas. Not only was the winner City Leader seven lengths adrift of Raven&apos;s Pass in the Solario Stakes at Sandown, but the strong-finishing fourth, Ridge Dance, comes from the same stable of John Gosden. The first eight home were covered by only over two lengths but extra credence must be given to City Leader&apos;s performance as his bit slipped through his mouth and Kevin Darley could not keep him straight as a result. On the third and final day of Ascot&apos;s meeting this afternoon, Ryan Moore has the chance to ride Romany Princess for the first time and they can click in the Security Company Nursery (2.0). Romany Princess was unlucky the only time she has raced on ground with the word &apos;soft&apos; in the going description when beaten by a horse racing on the more favoured side of the straight at Brighton. She was then beaten twice, yet not discredited, in handicaps at today&apos;s track and at Goodwood before breaking her maiden easily on Lingfield&apos;s Polytrack. She looks ready to build on that success and continue the good run of owner Maurice Sines whose five two-year-old runners sent out by Richard Hannon this season have all won, collecting eight wins and 10 places from 27 outings. Balthazaar&apos;s Gift has run three times on Ascot&apos;s new straight course and a reproduction of any of those would be good enough to see him win the Diadem Stakes (4.20). He found only Les Arcs too good in last year&apos;s Golden Jubilee, and has a 10lb pull for less than two lengths with Dark Missile on Wokingham form. He beat another of today&apos;s rivals, Al Qasi, very easily on his latest Ascot run in July. His big threat could be Stewards&apos; Cup winner Zidane, who, like Balthazaar&apos;s Gift, has a fine turn of foot and will be produced late. A 12lb pull for a length-and-a-half should be enough to turn the tables on Zidane, who did not suffer the troubled passage that Luca Cumani&apos;s colt had. Mark Tompkins has his team in form and Kinsya can collect the 4.55. At Musselburgh, Alexia Rose has a better chance than her dismal form figures suggest in the 3.35, while Pips Assertive Way can land Market Rasen&apos;s 2.45.", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Frankie Dettori"], "title": "Horse racing: Dettori rides high again as Ramonti nets mile hat-trick", "sentences": ["Godolphin&apos;s Simon Crisford does not consider Ramonti to be in the same league as their two most notable winners of this race, Dubai Millennium and Markofesteem, but, as he intimated, the Italy-bred horse makes up for it with his determination."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/30/horseracing.news", "publicationDate": "2007-09-30T00:04:49Z"}, {"article": "Letter of the week We are interested in visiting Morocco with our 10-year-old daughter; where would you advise us to stay?

Or try Imaginative Traveller (0800 316 2717; imaginative-traveller.com), which has a five-day round-trip from Casablanca, costing from \u00a3545, excluding flights. The Adventure Company (0845 450 5316; adventurecompany.co.uk) has an eight-day Kids in the Kasbahs family holiday visiting souks, Berber villages and Essaouira, with flight-inclusive prices from \u00a3599pp (children \u00a3539). We&apos;re getting married at Christmas and want to go to Italy by train at Easter for our honeymoon. We plan to travel by Eurostar from London to Paris and, after a couple of days, get a sleeper train to Venice. We would also love to visit Florence. To avoid city fatigue, we&apos;d like to spend some time on the coast or in the countryside. What would you suggest? We have around 10-12 days for the whole trip.Catherine Piggott, by email Florence is only two hours 40 minutes by train from Venice (about \u00a330 one way) but, rather than staying in the city itself, you could stay in the surrounding Tuscan countryside. You&apos;ll find plenty of choice of accommodation from farmhouses to apartments to villas. Try knowital.com for suggestions. You can return to Paris on the overnight Palatino sleeper, which has fares from \u00a326, rising to \u00a3104 per person for a two-berth couchette. These must be booked at least 14 days in advance. Another option would be to travel from Florence or Venice to the Italian lakes. There are regular trains from both to Desenzano at the southern end of Lake Garda, which take three-and-a-half and five hours respectively. You can then take a ferry to one of the prettier towns, such as Sirmione, which has thermal baths, cobbled streets and olive groves. Alternatively, Lake Como, more tranquil than Lake Garda, is four-and-a-half hours by train from Florence. For accommodation on both lakes, try italyheaven.co.uk. There are overnight trains to Paris (via Milan) from both Desenzano and Como. For times and fares see trenitalia.com. I&apos;m trying to organise a week&apos;s skiing for four friends of mixed abilities. One of the group, who lives in Dubai, has suggested Lebanon. At the time of writing, the Foreign Office website warns against non-essential travel to this region. Considering the nature of our proposed trip (which doesn&apos;t involve visiting metropolitan areas) how seriously should this be taken? If we do decide to go, is the skiing any good? Roly Grant, London Crystal, the UK&apos;s biggest operator of ski holidays, introduced packages to Lebanon last year, but decided to suspend travel to the country just a few weeks later when war broke out. A spokeswoman said the operator was waiting to get the all-clear from the Foreign Office to reinstate its programme, but admitted it &apos;doesn&apos;t look good for this winter&apos;. She added: &apos;We hope to be able to offer skiing there again in 2008/09.&apos; The main ski resort, Faraya-Mzaar, is only an hour by road from Beirut, where there have been several bomb attacks this year. The FO is continuing to advise against non-essential travel to Lebanon, as militant groups have threatened further attacks. Going against this advice would be a bad idea because, apart from the risk to your safety, you would find it difficult to get travel insurance - absolutely vital for skiing. If you do decide to go, you will find 80km of pistes spread over three mountains, served by 18 lifts. The longest run is 4km and, although this is really an intermediates resort, more experienced skiers should find some challenging runs. If you are looking for a safer but unusual alternative, however, how about Japan? Hokkaido has some of the best powder in the world, an average snow depth of four metres and a variety of skiing. Crystal (0870 405 5047; crystalski.co.uk) has packages to Rusutsu Resort from \u00a31,157 for seven nights&apos; B&amp;B plus one night in Osaka or Tokyo, including flights.  To me, &apos;spa&apos; means superb mineral waters and highly trained therapists. This year, I went to Hotel Therme in Vals, Switzerland - featured in The Observer (Escape, 13 May). The waters and the hotel were superb. My frozen shoulder was cured in nine days. What other spa locations can you suggest, in addition to the also wonderful Baden-Baden spa, which is now number two on my &apos;paradise&apos; list? Sarah Meyer, Rodmell, East Sussex These days almost every smart hotel has a &apos;spa&apos; of some sort but, as you&apos;ve discovered, some are better than others and many are little more than glorified beauty salons-cum-massage parlours.  What you&apos;re after is a medical spa, fed by thermal or natural mineral waters, with therapists to diagnose and treat complaints. Thermalia (0870 165 9420; thermalia.co.uk), a specialist spa tour operator, recommends the town of Abano in northern Italy, which has more than 160 hotels with hot thermal pools and mud rooms. These, combined with physiotherapy, will help rheumatic conditions such as frozen shoulder and tennis elbow. It has seven-day packages to Hotel President Terme, renowned for its cuisine as well as its spa, from \u00a3910 including flights, transfers, meals and treatments. The healing hot springs of central Europe, including the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia, offer a cheaper alternative.

The move is seen as a major step towards &quot;normal relations&quot; between the two, which have had three full-scale wars since independence. Lorries carrying tomatoes passed through the heavily armed Wagah border post in Punjab. The 30-mile road the goods travelled on has been under construction since India and Pakistan began the current phase of peace talks, in 2004, and represents a major step forward for both countries. Over the years, Wagah has become best known in the west for the circus-like, Goose-stepping antics of rival soldiers, who march aggressively at each other in front of cheering crowds. But the prospective peace comes at a cost. Decades of mutual animosity meant 1,000 porters spent decades carrying produce on their backs across the no man&apos;s land that divides the two countries. Now hundreds of poor Indian and Pakistani workers are likely to lose their jobs.  As the first trucks arrived, on the Indian side, angry crowds of coolies pelted the vehicles with stones, though police quickly moved in. There has also been anger from Punjabi farmers on the Indian side, who have protested against compulsory acquisition for the cargo terminal of 132 acres of fertile land belonging to local people. Despite the political turmoil in Pakistan and the threat of snap polls in India, both governments are keen to press ahead with more peace moves.  The two have said they want to modernise the Wagah border to help to boost bilateral trade tenfold from the current $1bn (\u00a3500m) a year.  At present, business is routed through Dubai, where many business houses from the subcontinent are located. There are many bureaucratic hurdles to surmount. The designated list of goods that can transit through Wagah is small, with only meat, tomatoes and onions exempted from duties.  For security reasons drivers will be required to wear bright yellow jackets with Driver India and Driver Pakistan inscribed on the back. Also, trucks are restricted to making short trips into each other&apos;s territory.  Allowing commercial traffic to enter any deeper, rather than just dropping off goods inside the border, seems a distant prospect. But even letting traffic cross would have been unimaginable five years ago, when both nations stood at the brink of possible nuclear war. Many analysts on both sides of the border are calling for a &quot;more pragmatic&quot; relationship between the two countries. &quot;We need to have a pragmatic approach towards Pakistan, not one tinged by irrational hate or by callow sentimentalism,&quot; wrote Jaithirth Rao, a prominent liberal columnist in the Indian Express.  &quot;A strong, stable Pakistan, which has passably cordial relations with us, is something we should support, we should root for.&quot;", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "India", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Goods vehicles cross India-Pakistan border for first time", "sentences": ["At present, business is routed through Dubai, where many business houses from the subcontinent are located."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/01/pakistan.india", "publicationDate": "2007-10-01T12:16:38Z"}, {"article": "The new boss of the Racing Post has warned anyone hoping to start a rival to the bible of British horseracing that there is only room for one player in the market.  After a lengthy battle, Irish private equity group FL Partners was finally confirmed as the daily&apos;s new owner today. Its \u00a3170m deal to buy the title from Trinity Mirror puts the former Racing Post editor Alan Byrne back at the helm - a move welcomed by staff as heralding a brighter future.   Mr Byrne said he was confident of reversing the 21-year-old paper&apos;s declining circulation and making more out of its website, but the new owners have not yet decided whether to charge for online access.   &quot;It&apos;s really going to be business as usual in the short to medium term, in that the paper does an excellent job and many people rely on it either for their hobby or their job,&quot; Mr Byrne said. &quot;We&apos;ll seek to build on what is already there, and over time I hope that we&apos;ll expand the online offering.&quot;   Mr Byrne was news editor at the Racing Post from 1990 to late 1992 and then editor from January 1993 to January 2002. He described his new role as editor-in-chief as a &quot;sort of homecoming&quot;. The paper&apos;s buyers, led by former investment bankers Peter Crowley and Neill Hughes, cited the appointment as proof of their long-term commitment to the paper.   The paper&apos;s sports editor, Bruce Millington, becomes editor and the editor, Chris Smith, becomes managing editor.   The new owners take over just as a new paper gears up to hit the market. A year after the demise of the Sportsman, Racing Ahead Weekend is due to launch on October 20. Edited by Stephen Mullen, a former Sun racing journalist, the new weekly has vowed to avoid the fate of the Sportsman, which closed after seven months.   The new paper will be targeted at gamblers and will be cheaper than the Racing Post, but Mr Byrne seemed unworried about the competition. &quot;He&apos;s moving onto our territory and we wish him the best of luck,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope he can expand the market, but it&apos;s a tough market out there and I think he&apos;ll find the punter is brilliantly served by the Racing Post Saturday edition already.&quot;   The Racing Post has suffered from falling sales in recent times, but it still has a circulation of more than 72,000. When Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum, the racehorse owner who is now emir of Dubai, set up the paper in 1986 he positioned it as a rival to the Sporting Life, owned by the Mirror Group. The sheikh licensed publication of his title to the Mirror Group in 1997. The group then folded the Sporting Life, leaving the Post as the monopoly provider of daily racing coverage.   Mr Byrne signalled that was unlikely to change. &quot;I&apos;ve been in this market when we were taking on the Sporting Life and we discovered then the hard way - and the people who put their money into the Sportsman discovered subsequently the hard way - that there&apos;s only really room for one paper.&quot;   As for how to drive up sales without alienating punters or industry professionals, Mr Byrne said the Racing Post&apos;s &quot;balancing act&quot; would go on.   &quot;You try to tick as many boxes for each of the constituencies every day as you can. But you have to accept that what is good for one constituency might actually outrage another in that you&apos;ll get bloodstock professionals who say &apos;why do you have all this sport in the paper?&apos; and you&apos;ll get punters who just want to have a bet on the racing at the weekend saying &apos;what on earth have they got all this bloodstock news in for?&apos;&quot;   One the key priorities for the new managers will have to be making more out of the websites, say analysts.   Mr Byrne said the buyers had an &quot;open mind&quot; over whether it would need to start charging for the vast amounts of analysis and betting data available online.   &quot;We think we have some compelling content in terms of news, analysis, views and opinion and form. A lot of people rely on that content and we think there are new ways we can deliver it to them,&quot; he said. &quot;I think in the short term if we are going to experiment with charging we will see if there is a demand for new services. We might add some additional services and see if there is a demand for those.&quot; ", "tags": ["Business", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media business", "Media"], "title": "A one horse town?", "sentences": ["When Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum, the racehorse owner who is now emir of Dubai, set up the paper in 1986 he positioned it as a rival to the Sporting Life, owned by the Mirror Group."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/01/pressandpublishing.citynews1", "publicationDate": "2007-10-01T14:05:51Z"}, {"article": "John Hollingsworth I must be one of the few westerners that takes the bus to work in Dubai - crammed into the 8a along the Jumeirah Beach Rd to Media City.

I&apos;m hoping to add to my bongo collection and pick up some samba rhythms along the way, so that I can join a band during the carnival in Brazil. In Peru there&apos;s a crate-like drum called a caj\u00f3n which is used in certain types of rumba and I&apos;d quite like to check that out too. As a child I learned piano, flute and recorder but found playing them rather solitary. The first time I saw people drumming at a festival, I was mesmerised - what a sociable way to make music! Even better, it didn&apos;t demand a lot of skill. I could go in at any level and become part of this incredible, raw sound by just reacting to the people around me. I was born in Kenya so I think it took me back to my roots, too. I have drums stored all over the place and each one requires a different playing technique - so whenever I visit a new country I take lessons from local drummers. Each of my teachers in Africa taught me a different rhythm on the djembe and when I lived in Dubai a few years ago I studied with an Indian tabla master. Every week I sat in his class with 20 three-year-old kids, who were always way better than me. It wasn&apos;t great for my ego but my technique certainly improved. These days I practise by going to drum weekends or I drum at clubs and festivals such as the Burning Man in the Nevada desert. My Turkish goblet drums went down a storm there last year. Drumming is a natural high; it&apos;s actually prescribed as therapy for people from children with disabilities to company executives because it eases physical and mental stress.

But when it became clear that Moores would sell out entirely Usmanov chose to pursue a &quot;meaningful&quot; but minor stake in Arsenal. Usmanov, whose portfolio of investments ranges from mining to telecoms and now includes a 23% stake in the Premier League leaders, is said first to have been attracted to Arsenal after observing and admiring Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s management style.

Usmanov has paid \u00a3125m for the 23% share - a sum that his companies are believed to generate in a single month - and has not ruled out further minor investments. A recent 2% purchase came as a result of earlier dialogue with shareholders who later decided that they would sell; a repeat could well follow, though the sources say Usmanov is unlikely to exceed the 30% threshold that would trigger a takeover bid. Usmanov&apos;s investment vehicle, Red &amp; White Holdings, stated in August that his company has no intention of making a full bid for Arsenal.

He looked around the room of another anonymously swanky hotel in Birmingham, Alabama, and almost buckled. The moment he had been trying to deny so long, the moment when he knew the end had finally come, engulfed him. Like the great old fighters he loves, especially Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Robinson when the worst beatings had drained them of their unforgettable genius as well as everything else that had once made them feel most alive, Ballesteros faced a terrible emptiness. &quot;I felt very alone,&quot; he remembers, &quot;and I could hear my voice in my head: &apos;Seve, what the hell are you doing here? What are you doing to yourself?&apos; I&apos;d heard these questions a long time, because for the last two years I was virtually retired from serious golf. But inside I was not accepting it. There was still confusion in me. But I changed that night. There had been too much stress, too much effort, for too many years. I felt a long way from home and I had to say: &apos;Seve, it&apos;s not worth it.&apos; It&apos;s time.&quot; He had turned 50 six weeks earlier and the completion of his sporting demise was brutal. Just before his birthday he shot 86 and 80 at the Masters and announced his intention to restrict himself to the Champions Tour - where veterans can still rake in millions. His debut was in that 54-hole Alabama tournament. After he shot 78 and 81 in his opening two rounds there was desolation more than embarrassment. He knew that this was how it ended for Robinson, the greatest of all boxers, when he lost at the age of 44 to the journeyman Joey Archer. And emotionally, if not in terms of the physical ruin he suffered, he felt like Ali after he was battered in his last fight by the mediocre Trevor Berbick. Ballesteros is a sporting colossus to be compared to Robinson and Ali, to Pele and Jack Nicklaus. His natural brilliance, and the impact he had on his sport, belongs in such elevated company. But there he sat, on his hotel bed, facing the end, in a tournament about to be won by 52-year-old Brad Bryant - whose lone victory on the PGA Tour had come in the 1995 Walt Disney World/Oldsmobile Classic. A few feet away from Ballesteros now, on a sunny day in Madrid, after an hour in which he has been as engaging as he is expansive, there is a flash of his cussed competitiveness. His face darkens when asked if finishing last in Alabama had sealed his decision to retire completely. &quot;I didn&apos;t finish last,&quot; he bristles before sighing gracefully. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter. I was at the back.&quot; If the record books confirm that Ballesteros shared last place with the 67-year-old Lee Trevino, it is more uplifting to note that he shot his best round of the week with a closing 73. Fittingly, he birdied the 18th hole. Yet he flew back to Spain in silence and the rumours grew. After a close friend was killed in a car accident there was cruel gossip that Ballesteros had attempted suicide. He dismisses &quot;the lies and ugly fantasy&quot; but acknowledges that stress took its toll. &quot;You can see now,&quot; he grins, &quot;that I feel fantastic. I&apos;m not too bad for an old guy! But before, health-wise, it was not as good. I was in hospital 16 hours. They were checking the [irregular] beating of my heart but since then nothing has happened. I feel fine. I think the heartbeat was a result of that trip to Alabama and making the decision to retire, of saying this is it. It was a big stress.&quot; Ballesteros announced his retirement in the week of the Open at Carnoustie. His dignified press conference allowed a groundswell of British affection to re-emerge in detailed eulogies for his three Open and two Masters victories. He was even more rightly hailed for the way in which he almost single-handedly transformed golf in Europe, both as an outrageously gifted individual and as the most fiercely competitive of all Ryder Cup players. &quot;I could have retired in Spain but that would have been wrong. The Spanish never appreciated me like the British. I so valued the love the British public showed me that it was respectful to retire in Great Britain. And Carnoustie was perfect because that&apos;s where I played my first Open in 1978. It was the best place to say bye-bye.&quot; In his new autobiography one of his main themes is that, &quot;in Britain, there was always a great connection between me and the gallery. It was a very good chemistry because I was never flat in my face. The British liked that. My face showed every emotion - from happiness to anger. I also played a different way to everyone else on tour. I could be erratic and, like a weekend golfer, hit it into the car park.&quot; Ballesteros holds his head in mock anguish. But he played recovery shots of such wild majesty that even the Americans, who initially sneered at him as &quot;a parking-lot champion&quot;, succumbed. &quot;The British always saw this. I would hit a shot that maybe they recognised from their own game. But they loved it when I got out of trouble with what Peter Alliss called miracle shots.&quot; As he relives the way in which he learned to play such crazily inventive golf, Ballesteros becomes almost boyish in his delight. &quot;My brother says I played my most imaginative golf between 13 and 17 and maybe he&apos;s right. I had to. We were poor and I could not afford any clubs. So when I found the head that had broken off a club I stuck it on to a piece of wood which I tore off a tree. I then put the wood in water to make it solid overnight. I did this many times because the shaft kept breaking. And because there were no balls available I would hit pebbles on the beach. I taught myself a different game. And because I was born next to a golf course there were times when I would go on to it at night and play in the dark. I learned my feel for the game and how to play unusual shots. Today it is not really possible because the equipment even \u00b0ordinary players use is so good that everything is geared to hitting the ball in a straight line. It is very hard to manoeuvre the ball today. I think that takes away from the player who has the instinct to play a more individual game. &quot;That&apos;s why there is no point comparing Ben Hogan to Jack Nicklaus to Tiger Woods. The equipment and conditions have changed too much. I would agree Tiger is on his way to being called the best ever but Jack never gave away a tournament. I saw Tiger blow a tournament in Dubai. But of course he is a great player and by far the best today.&quot; If he is as keen to talk about boxers as golfers it is perhaps unsurprising that his own favourite player is a pugnacious little man whose game was built more on gritty fight than pure talent. &quot;Gary Player became the golfer I admired most from 1972 when I got to caddie at a pro-am in Spain. He grabbed my attention because, every day, he was the first to arrive and the last to leave. He worked so hard. &quot;People forget I had the same work ethic. It&apos;s important you have the natural talent but your dedication matters even more. That was a reason why my game went. I hurt my back when I was boxing a friend of mine in 1977 and it was never the same after that. But I made it worse by practising so hard year after year. So in the end I couldn&apos;t play like I&apos;d once done - because it was physically impossible.&quot; Ballesteros shrugs when asked if he has played much, socially, since his retirement. &quot;I play with my children. I&apos;m not playing so well because I don&apos;t practise any more. But the big difference now is that when I don&apos;t win a hole I feel OK. There is no pressure. And that&apos;s good because it reminds me that what happened to me on the golf course was not so bad. Real trouble is when you are ill or unemployed - not because you don&apos;t play golf so good any more.&quot; The bruised old master leans back in his chair and smiles in relief. &quot;That&apos;s why I would not change a single thing. If you do that you can change the whole story. And when I look at the whole story I feel very proud of myself. I was part of the growth of golf in Europe and I&apos;m very happy to have done that. I&apos;m happy with all the good things I did myself and, also, I accept my mistakes. I feel calm now. I feel content. I am ready to get on with the rest of my life.&quot; Seve: The Official Autobiography is published by Yellow Jersey Press at \u00a318.99", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport", "Seve Ballesteros"], "title": "Big interview: Seve Ballesteros", "sentences": ["I saw Tiger blow a tournament in Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/02/golf.sport", "publicationDate": "2007-10-02T10:54:00Z"}, {"article": "War has been good to Masumbuko Kakera. The peace is making him richer still but the wily Congolese trader could not have become one of the wealthiest men in Goma without the years of foreign invasion, occupation and rebel governments, besides the help of nature&apos;s occasional assault. &quot;There was no government to speak of so people helped themselves,&quot; said the 42-year-old, who has just added a luxury hotel to his assets. &quot;There is a lot here. Gold, coltan, everything. People are building everywhere these days. There&apos;s a lot of wealth.&quot; Whether war has been as good for his traumatised hometown and most of the rest of its 160,000 residents is another question. The &quot;tourist capital of Congo&quot;, perched on unforgiving volcanic rock on the northern shore of Lake Kivu in the far east of the country, has emerged from each crisis over the past 15 years a little bit more wrecked and hoping that whatever came next would not be worse than what went before. But it was. The mass graves of Rwandan refugees, the tide of lava that ripped the heart out of the town and the booming security industry to protect those with money from those without (but who do have some of the guns that came with the wars) are a testament to what Goma has endured. So are the deeply rutted roads, the days without electricity and the grand but crumbling old post office built by Belgian colonisers on the main street that hasn&apos;t delivered a letter in more than two decades. But, for now at least, Goma is enjoying a boom of sorts as new cars and motorbikes clog its streets, and a property surge has driven up the price of land more than ten-fold in the past few years. Mr Kakera waves his arm toward a small plot next to his hotel. It has just sold for $200,000. &quot;Five years ago you could get that for $30,000. Prices are going up because the money from the gold and coltan have created a lot more demand for land,&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone is making money, even the guys who used to sell pieces of goat on a stick next to the road. Now they are selling mobile phone recharge vouchers.&quot; That is not a universal view. &quot;War is good for some people and bad for others,&quot; said Jean Paul Lukunato, singer in Goma&apos;s best-known rumba band. &quot;Some do excellent business and others just go down into a hole. There are many more cars, many new houses. But you never know how these people with their big cars and nice houses got their money. Perhaps it was the wrong way. Many people get rich because the government isn&apos;t really in charge.&quot; Lukunato&apos;s band used to call itself Financier, deriding the spirit of the age in Goma. Now the members are known collectively as Tout Chic OBG Mouv. &quot;In Kinshasa everybody sings love songs but we play music for peace and life,&quot; he said. &quot;People in Kinshasa haven&apos;t really experienced war like we have so they don&apos;t think about it. We think about it a lot.&quot; The wars, Lukunato said, changed everything. &quot;It created division between people. Before the war, I could live with you without caring where you are from. But after the war, I would say you are from the south or Rwanda, you are not from my village, you are different,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t think we know what we are anymore. We are not one country. We are not one people. We are Gomatraciens.&quot; Few towns have suffered as much. Goma&apos;s decline under Mobutu Sese Seko&apos;s neglectful rule in the seventies and eighties from a thriving resort popular with tourists in pursuit of mountain gorillas was hastened by the mass looting of the town by the army in 1992. Soldiers barracked a few miles to the north were not paid so they followed the example of their comrades in the capital, Kinshasa, and tore the town&apos;s shops apart. There wasn&apos;t much in the stores to begin with but by the time the army swept through just about all that was left were a few of the basic foodstuffs. A month later the soldiers were not paid again. The commanding officer arrived in Goma to offer the mayor a choice; come up with the cash to pay his men or they would be back to loot people&apos;s homes. The Catholic church led a massive collection, with townspeople carrying cardboard boxes of the rapidly devaluing national currency - then running at about six million zaires to the US dollar - into a local bank. (The bank is now a Chinese restaurant, another innovation for Goma). When the army commander returned, the mayor broke the news that about half of what the soldiers were demanding had been collected. It was good enough and the town was spared another pillage. Still, the destruction from the first one had driven many businesses into the ground and the future was bleak as Goma&apos;s economy sank. Hutu influx Two years later came the next blow. Gomatraciens awoke one July morning to an indecipherable low rumble as hundreds of thousands of Rwandan Hutus shuffled through the town, broken, exhausted and silent as they fled the Tutsi rebel victory across the border. The soldiers of the defeated Rwandan army, and the Hutu militiamen who had led the genocide of Tutsis, arrived fed and often riding on the backs of lorries. The women and children arrived on foot after walking for days, living off bananas and a few other plants along the roadside. Some crossed into what was then Zaire and, relieved of the burden of trying to escape, died on the spot from exhaustion. More than a million Hutus struggled into Goma over three days. Those that could were forced to keep walking north and settled in refugee camps on the unsparing volcanic rock where they swiftly began to die in their tens of thousands from cholera. It was another testament to the shortcomings of the United Nations that so many should succumb to a disease that kills through dehydration within a short distance of one of the biggest lakes in Africa. UN officials said they couldn&apos;t hire lorries to carry water to the refugees because they lacked the necessary forms for authorisation. It took an Irish medical charity to shell out the cash to get things moving. The roadsides were lined with corpses wrapped in the reed mats the dead had carried from Rwanda. Yet many Gomatraciens and aid workers could not shake off the knowledge that a large number of these &quot;refugees&quot; were unrepentant murderers of their Tutsi neighbours. Adding to the sense of apocalypse, the Nyiragongo volcano that dominates the Goma skyline fired up a carpet of ash that hung over the town, darkening the skies and prompting mutterings of divine retribution. There is nothing today to mark the mass graves of the Rwandan Hutus in Goma. There is one opposite the airport, covered in banana plants these days, and others on the edge of town carved out by diggers and filled within days. Many in Goma pass by the burial sites every day without even knowing they are there. &quot;It&apos;s as though we forgot part of our history,&quot; said Lukunato. &quot;We all knew they came here and died. Everyone saw it. They were tripping over the bodies. But I don&apos;t think anyone really remembers that they are still here, beneath our feet.&quot; Invasion and civil war But the Hutu refugees&apos; legacy to Goma was to be more than their own graves. Few would have imagined it at the time but the exodus was to herald years of invasion and civil war. The soldiers and murderous militiamen kept up their killing of Tutsis with cross border raids and in 1996 the new government in Rwanda invaded Zaire through Goma to clear the camps - the start of years of slaughter in Eastern Congo. The Rwandans were back two years later installing a puppet rebel government in Goma to control a large swath of the east of the country. It was then that Kakera saw his chance, trading with the rebel leadership as the money from the plunder of the gold and cobalt mines rolled into the town. &quot;I made my money trading. I started at the lowest level bringing in sand from Rwanda and sending lorries to Bujumbura and then branched out to Kampala, Nairobi, even Dubai,&quot; he said. Kakera was one of a clutch of businessmen who swiftly replaced the old Mobutu loyalists and Belgians and came to dominate trade in the town by tying themselves to the Rwandans and their rebel allies who took over Goma. &quot;Under Mobutu people were like prisoners. No one could see what people did in other countries. Goma had no future. It wasn&apos;t like this before. Mobutu just took what he wanted and left nothing for anyone else. Now Goma has a future,&quot; said Kakera. The old kleptomaniac, who stashed away about $5bn while his country went to ruin, was driven from power by the first Rwandan invasion. It is striking how completely the visible signs of Mobutuism have been erased. The greatest monument to the thieving dictator&apos;s disdain for his people was his Goma palace on the banks of Lake Kivu. While the rest of the town struggled to get around in clapped out cars, and relied on a hospital with few medicines and a lack of even the most basic medical equipment, when Mobutu fell, six new black Mercedes and a fully equipped ambulance - the only one in Goma - were discovered parked at the palace ready for the rare occasions the great man visited. But the young view fondly an era that they cannot remember but which at least didn&apos;t involve war. &quot;Mobutu wanted to unite people, to make one country,&quot; said Muhindo Musi, who plays in the rumba band and who was 12 years old when the man who ruled Zaire for 32 years fled the country of his creation and died a few months later of cancer. &quot;People could travel without being attacked. Now it&apos;s very difficult to go from one region to another because of these armed groups. We are not one country anymore.&quot; Some things don&apos;t change. Travelling the length of Lake Kivu to the city of Bukavu in the south is very much easier than in years past with a three-hour ride on a comfortable high-speed boat in place of an eight-hour journey on some of the worst roads in Africa. But the old Congo rears its head at the port&apos;s immigration desk, which everyone must pass even when travelling from town to town inside the country. Passports are scrutinised with intensity to see if some minor infraction might be used to extort a few dollars. Failing that there is the &quot;hygiene&quot; desk where foreigners are obliged to produce evidence of their vaccinations. No yellow card and you&apos;re offered a choice, neatly spelled out in an official looking form: pay $10 for a jab or $15 not to have one. Pulling out a camera to photograph a butterfly nearly causes a national security incident even though there are no military installations to be seen and the buildings look as if they&apos;ll collapse of their own accord without help from foreign saboteurs. Eruption The volcano finally erupted in 2002, sending a tide of lava a kilometre wide and two metres deep through the centre of town. Walk along the main street today and suddenly the potholes give way to a hump of hardened volcanic rock. Some of the old shops remain, their entrances strangely below the new street level. But most were carried away as the eruption cleared a swath through the town and down to the lake. Near the water&apos;s edge a clutch of rusting cars sticks out of hardened volcanic rock like tombstones after their owners left them atop a hillock and fled into Rwanda, but the lava rose high enough to engulf the vehicles. The eruption destroyed about 40% of the town - more than 4,500 buildings and a large part of the airport runway, although the progress of the lava was slow enough that there were few human casualties. But the new coat of volcanic rock also cleared the way for a building boom, and set off a bidding war for land. Dotted across its surface are new shops and homes. Kakera&apos;s hotel, which opened in April, is one of an array of new and comfortable hotels sprinkled along the lake front, a huge advance on the filthy and dilapidated Grand Lac hotel that had a near monopoly before. The tourist town doesn&apos;t have many tourists but the hotels are busy enough with businessmen, aid workers and an array of foreigners with east European and southern African accents. &quot;Goma is a town different from the rest of Congo,&quot; said Kakera. &quot;It doesn&apos;t look to Kinshasa for its survival. It looks to its neighbours to the east - Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda. It looks to the rest of Africa. They all come here, for good or bad.&quot; Yet, for all Goma&apos;s tribulations, the rumba band members agree on one thing. They would all like to travel and make their names as famous musicians, but they will always come back. &quot;Goma is a paradise,&quot; said Mr Lukunato. &quot;People outside may not see it but if we had peace this would be the first town in all Congo.&quot;", "tags": ["World news", "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "Africa", "Volcanoes"], "title": "Goma: the town that refused to die", "sentences": ["I started at the lowest level bringing in sand from Rwanda and sending lorries to Bujumbura and then branched out to Kampala, Nairobi, even Dubai,&quot; he said."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/02/insideafrica.congo", "publicationDate": "2007-10-02T11:54:34Z"}, {"article": "The new boss of the Racing Post has warned anyone hoping to start a rival to the bible of British horseracing that there is only room for one player in the market. After a lengthy battle, Irish private equity group FL Partners was finally confirmed as the daily&apos;s new owner yesterday. Its \u00a3170m deal to buy the title from Trinity Mirror puts the former Racing Post editor Alan Byrne back at the helm - a move welcomed by staff as heralding a brighter future. Mr Byrne said he was confident of reversing the 21-year-old paper&apos;s declining circulation and making more out of its website, but the new owners have not yet decided whether to charge for online access. &quot;It&apos;s really going to be business as usual in the short to medium term, in that the paper does an excellent job and many people rely on it either for their hobby or their job,&quot; Mr Byrne said. &quot;We&apos;ll seek to build on what is already there, and over time I hope that we&apos;ll expand the online offering.&quot; Mr Byrne was news editor at the Racing Post from 1990 to late 1992 and then editor from January 1993 to January 2002. He described his new role as editor-in-chief as a &quot;sort of homecoming&quot;. The paper&apos;s buyers, led by former investment bankers Peter Crowley and Neill Hughes, cited the appointment as proof of their long-term commitment to the paper. The paper&apos;s sports editor, Bruce Millington, becomes editor and the editor, Chris Smith, becomes managing editor. The new owners take over just as a new paper gears up to hit the market. A year after the demise of the Sportsman, Racing Ahead Weekend is due to launch on October 20. Edited by Stephen Mullen, a former Sun racing journalist, the new weekly has vowed to avoid the fate of the Sportsman, which closed after seven months. The new paper will be aimed at gamblers and will be cheaper than the Racing Post, but Mr Byrne seemed unworried about the competition. &quot;He&apos;s moving on to our territory and we wish him the best of luck,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope he can expand the market, but it&apos;s a tough market out there and I think he&apos;ll find the punter is brilliantly served by the Racing Post Saturday edition already.&quot; The Racing Post has suffered from falling sales in recent times, but it still has a circulation of more than 72,000. When Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum, the racehorse owner who is now emir of Dubai, set up the paper in 1986 he positioned it as a rival to the Sporting Life, owned by the Mirror Group. The sheikh licensed publication of his title to the Mirror Group in 1997. The group then folded the Sporting Life, leaving the Post as the monopoly provider of daily racing coverage. Mr Byrne signalled that was unlikely to change. &quot;I&apos;ve been in this market when we were taking on the Sporting Life and we discovered then the hard way - and the people who put their money into the Sportsman discovered subsequently the hard way - that there&apos;s only really room for one paper.&quot; As for how to drive up sales without alienating punters or industry professionals, Mr Byrne said the Racing Post&apos;s &quot;balancing act&quot; would go on. &quot;You try to tick as many boxes for each of the constituencies every day as you can. But you have to accept that what is good for one constituency might actually outrage another in that you&apos;ll get bloodstock professionals who say &apos;why do you have all this sport in the paper?&apos; and you&apos;ll get punters who just want to have a bet on the racing at the weekend saying &apos;what on earth have they got all this bloodstock news in for?&apos;&quot; One the key priorities for the new managers will have to be making more out of the websites, say analysts. Mr Byrne said the buyers had an &quot;open mind&quot; over whether it would need to start charging for the vast amounts of analysis and betting data available online. &quot;We think we have some compelling content in terms of news, analysis, views and opinion and form. A lot of people rely on that content and we think there are new ways we can deliver it to them,&quot; he said. &quot;I think in the short term if we are going to experiment with charging we will see if there is a demand for new services. We might add some additional services and see if there is a demand for those.&quot; Trinity thoroughbred - Winnings fall short Trinity Mirror&apos;s \u00a3170m sale of the Racing Post brings the total raised from its sell-off to \u00a3263m. Originally, after the owner of the Mirror announced a review in December, analysts forecast proceeds of between \u00a3550m and \u00a3600m. It has sold off regional newspapers in the south-east and London but yesterday scrapped plans to sell its Midlands regional newspapers after there were no satisfactory offers. Sly Bailey, the chief executive, said turmoil in the financial markets was a key factor. She stuck by her forecast that the outlook was brightening for regional newspapers. &quot;We remain confident in the outlook for 2007 and certainly we believe the ad cycle is turning,&quot; she said. Trinity Mirror shares rose after the news, supporting Ms Bailey&apos;s assertion that shareholders were not looking for a sale at just any price of the division that includes the Birmingham Post and Coventry Evening Telegraph. Trinity Mirror&apos;s failure to get a good price for the Midlands titles and some of its newspapers in the south-east follows the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust&apos;s abandoned auction of its regional business, Northcliffe Newspapers, last year.", "tags": ["Business", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media"], "title": "Racing Post's new boss warns off other runners", "sentences": ["When Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum, the racehorse owner who is now emir of Dubai, set up the paper in 1986 he positioned it as a rival to the Sporting Life, owned by the Mirror Group."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/02/pressandpublishing.media", "publicationDate": "2007-10-02T14:05:48Z"}, {"article": "For the next four days, Authorized is a racehorse, the favourite for the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe, and the thousands of punters who intend to back him in Paris cannot see beyond Sunday afternoon in the Bois de Boulogne. For Sheikh Mohammed, though, the end of Arc day will mean that the real fun is just beginning. With the retirement of Authorized seemingly certain after Sunday&apos;s race, his two-season track career will be over after just seven starts. His stud career, however, could stretch to 20 years or more, and Darley, the breeding arm of the Sheikh&apos;s bloodstock operation, has not taken charge of a more exciting stallion prospect since Dubai Millennium seven years ago. If nothing else, Authorized is going to make Darley a great deal of money over the next few seasons. Money, though, is not what Sheikh Mohammed wants or needs. Instead, he wants to offer serious competition to the Coolmore Stud operation in the international bloodstock business, and securing Authorized was a real statement of intent. As yet, the Sheikh has yet to decide where to stand Authorized, though the choice appears to be between Dalham Hall in Newmarket, where Dubai Millennium spent his sole season as a stallion before his premature death from grass sickness, and Kildangan Stud in Ireland. The covering fee, meanwhile, will depend to some extent on whether he can justify favouritism at Longchamp on Sunday. Whatever the outcome in Paris, though, Authorized will be busy. Dubai Millennium sired just 56 foals in his first and only year at stud, but these days, Darley have moved towards the sort of production-line approach that has made Coolmore the most powerful player in the market. &quot;Once a stallion would have been syndicated in 40 shares, with each share representing a single cover,&quot; Tony Morris, the Racing Post&apos;s bloodstock and breeding correspondent, said yesterday. &quot;Now, it&apos;s a free-for-all, and I expect they&apos;ll be looking towards 150 covers per season in his first few years. Darley have moved much more towards the Coolmore way since Dubai Millennium&apos;s day, perhaps because he died so early. What sort of fee he will stand for is a moot point. They charged around \u00a3100,000 for Lammtarra, but he turned out to be an utter failure.&quot; Lammtarra, of course, was also a Derby winner, and one who managed to win the Arc too before retiring unbeaten. Authorized, though, also has a Group One victory over 10 furlongs to his name in the International Stakes at York in August, and that extra speed will be an important selling point when Darley market him to breeders over the next few months. &quot;If you look at the last 20 or 30 Derby winners, it doesn&apos;t take long to count how many were a real success as stallions,&quot; Morris says. &quot;[The Coolmore-owned] Galileo revived the Derby as a plausible race for a stallion, but the last one before that was Shirley Heights. People will say that the 10-furlong victory will make him more attractive, though it shouldn&apos;t make a scrap of difference. Galileo ran over 10 furlongs twice and got beaten both times, and it&apos;s not made any difference to him.&quot; From a racing point of view, it has to be a positive sign that Sheikh Mohammed is investing so heavily in bloodstock at a time in his life when many other owners might be winding down. This is a long-term project, based around a colt who was himself sired by one of the stars of Coolmore&apos;s younger stallion roster, Montjeu. Yet the intricacies of thoroughbred genetics are such that it may yet end in failure. &quot;As far as redressing the balance with Coolmore goes, in the short term it goes no way at all towards doing that,&quot; Morris says, &quot;because it&apos;s going to be a long time before we know if he is any good or not. If he really wants to rival Coolmore then this is a start, but it&apos;s still going to be a very long road from here.&quot;", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "title": "Horse racing: Sheikh gets Authorized ready for breeding war", "sentences": ["His stud career, however, could stretch to 20 years or more, and Darley, the breeding arm of the Sheikh&apos;s bloodstock operation, has not taken charge of a more exciting stallion prospect since Dubai Millennium seven years ago.", "As yet, the Sheikh has yet to decide where to stand Authorized, though the choice appears to be between Dalham Hall in Newmarket, where Dubai Millennium spent his sole season as a stallion before his premature death from grass sickness, and Kildangan Stud in Ireland.", "Dubai Millennium sired just 56 foals in his first and only year at stud, but these days, Darley have moved towards the sort of production-line approach that has made Coolmore the most powerful player in the market.", "Darley have moved much more towards the Coolmore way since Dubai Millennium&apos;s day, perhaps because he died so early."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/03/horseracing.sport", "publicationDate": "2007-10-03T00:09:22Z"}, {"article": "Time Out magazine has launched in Sydney - the 20th international edition of the iconic entertainment bible.

Qatari-backed fund Delta Two has already made a 600p a share proposal for Sainsbury, of course, and has access to its books.   But today a speculative tale went round that a private equity firm in partnership with Marks &amp; Spencer might be planning to spoil the party.   This may seem a little left-field, but Marks did admit last February it had looked at a possible deal with Sainsbury.   It said then: &quot;In response to recent speculation, the board of Marks &amp; Spencer confirms that it has been considering its position in relation to a possible combination with Sainsbury. Further to this, the board has decided that it does not intend to make an offer for Sainsbury at this time&quot;.   As with the Barclays talk, though, dealers were not convinced Marks had changed its mind, with one calling the story &quot;complete rubbish&quot;. A more plausible alternative version said that Delta Two was poised to announce an agreement with Sainsbury this weekend.   So Sainsbury added 3p to 583p while Marks was unchanged at 640p.   There was also speculative interest in services and infrastructure group Alfred McAlpine, up 10p to 510p, with Carillion said to be interested.   As for Barclays, it added 5p to 660p as it formally withdrew from the bid battle for Dutch group ABN Amro.   Overall the market ended the week on a fairly upbeat note. The FTSE 100 closed 47.9 points higher at 6595.8 while the FTSE 250 added 19.9 points to 11,390.4. The key US non-farm payroll numbers for September turned out to be quite positive. They showed a 110,000 rise, 10,000 more than forecast, and calmed fears about a major slowdown in the American economy. The US government also revised the August figures, which originally fell by 4,000 and at the time upset the markets considerably.   That number has now been changed to an 89,000 increase, since it appears that the first time round no account was taken of the number of teachers being hired at the start of the new school year.   Even a profit warning from Merrill Lynch - blamed of course on the sub-prime crisis - failed to take the shine off shares.   Back in the UK, miners rebounded after an upbeat note from ABN Amro, with Kazakhmys 70p higher at \u00a315.96 and BHP Billiton 43p better at \u00a317.45.   &quot;We are now looking for a 25% increase in iron ore prices and a 20-25% increase in coal prices,&quot; said ABN. &quot;BHP Billiton remains our preferred investment among the miners, with a portfolio positioned to take advantage of stronger bulk and energy earnings.&quot;   But if it lifted the miners, ABN did some damage to the housebuilders. It said: &quot;We believe trading conditions for the UK housebuilders are likely to soften due to higher mortgage rates, stricter lending standards and lower confidence.&quot;   It cut its recommendation on Barratt Developments, down 33p to 765p, from buy to sell.

Qatari-backed fund Delta Two has already made a 600p-a-share proposal for Sainsbury&apos;s, of course, and has access to its books. But yesterday a tale went round that a private equity firm in partnership with Marks &amp; Spencer might be planning to spoil the party. This may seem a little left-field, but Marks did admit last February it had looked at a possible deal with Sainsbury&apos;s. It said then: &quot;In response to recent speculation, the board of Marks &amp; Spencer confirms that it has been considering its position in relation to a possible combination with Sainsbury&apos;s. Further to this, the board has decided that it does not intend to make an offer at this time.&quot; Dealers, however, were not convinced Marks had changed its mind, with one calling the story &quot;complete rubbish&quot;. A more plausible alternative version said that Delta Two was poised to announce an agreement with Sainsbury&apos;s this weekend. Sainsbury&apos;s added 3p to 583p while Marks was unchanged at 640p. As for Barclays, it added 5p to 660p as it formally withdrew from the bid battle for Dutch group ABN Amro.

The key US non-farm payroll numbers for September turned out to be quite positive. They showed a 110,000 rise, 10,000 more than forecast, and calmed fears about a major slowdown in the American economy. The US government also revised the August figures, which originally fell by 4,000 and at the time upset the markets considerably. That number has now been changed to an 89,000 increase, since it appears that the first time round no account was taken of the number of teachers being hired at the start of the new school year.

On top of that, a couple of Syrian investment groups have between them taken a 7% stake in the business, paying 145p a share. The two are the Al Mashreq Investment Fund, controlled by Syrian businessman Rami Makhlouf, and Hickam Ventures, a group associated with oilman Nizar Assaad.

By early yesterday afternoon, supporters were already celebrating a win for the president, who has been weakened in recent months by a series of domestic crises, internal militant violence and a loss of international goodwill. Though the victory can still theoretically be overturned by a supreme court judgment, the massive win, with 252 of the 257 votes cast in parliament and landslides in all four provinces, makes that unlikely. The huge victory allowed ministers yesterday to claim &apos;a return to full democracy&apos;. Many senior Musharraf loyalists looked forward to full legislative polls, due to be held in the new year. &apos;We will be fighting on our record in power in free and fair elections,&apos; said the Information Minister, Mohammed Ali Durrani. &apos;The election process is very transparent and we respect our country and its institutions.&apos; However, the margin of Musharraf&apos;s victory owes much to a last-minute deal with opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. In just over a week, Bhutto will make a spectacular return to her homeland after nearly a decade in exile in London and Dubai, in a move that will return her to power. In return for Musharraf pledging to resign as head of the army, and a new legal device lifting corruption charges against her, representatives from her Pakistan People&apos;s Party did not resign, merely staging a symbolic walkout from voting in parliament yesterday. Many observers are concerned that such deal-making is distracting attention from the real issues in one of the most strategically crucial states in the world: rising Islamic militancy and, despite recent economic growth, the profound, crushing poverty in which at least half of Pakistan&apos;s 160 million citizens live. At dawn tomorrow, the thousand men, women and children who work on the brick kilns of Tarli village will wake up at 5am, pray and go to work. Their day will last until sunset, 13 hours of backbreaking physical toil in the heat and dust of a Pakistani autumn. In the evening, they will draw water from the fetid well, eat a thin lentil curry and sleep. The day after, they will wake at 5am again, pray and go back to work. There is no electricity, water or sanitation in Tarli. Saddled with unpayable debts to the owners of the kilns, often incurred generations ago, the families of Tarli know that escape is impossible. At night, the village is ringed by armed guards. During the day, the villagers are watched closely. And where would they go if they made good their escape? The families of Tarli are at the bottom of Pakistan&apos;s social and economic hierarchy. They have no protectors, no one looking out for them. &apos;We are nothing,&apos; said Mohammed Akram, 36, a father of three who has worked all his life on the kilns, paying off a loan taken by his father. Tarli lies in a small hollow of red clay beside a stagnant lake. The kilns send plumes of thick smoke into the clear sky, six days out of seven. Just a 10-minute drive away is Islamabad, the capital, where the white marble-fronted blocks of Pakistan&apos;s parliament, supreme court and presidential palace are clearly visible from where the villagers live and work. Akram has never been to Islamabad and few people from the city, apart from the owner of the kilns who lives in a &apos;big house&apos; there, have ever visited Tarli. &apos;It is a different world,&apos; he said, raising his voice as a Boeing 747 on its way into Islamabad roars overhead. The main players in that world are familiar: Musharraf himself; Benazir Bhutto, the 54-year-old Harvard-and Oxford-educated aristocrat and two-time Prime Minister, who has spent the past nine years in exile; the standard array of bit players in Pakistani politics grouped into an alphabet soup of parties, factions and lobbies of every complexion of religious observance, political affiliation, ethnic and regional loyalty. Musharraf and Bhutto dominate. Each detests, and is dependent on, the other. Musharraf, a former commando who has refused to give up his post as head of Pakistan&apos;s powerful army, needs the smiling, female, moderate, democratic face of Bhutto to bring to his wavering rule a vital degree of international legitimacy. And without the corruption charges against her - which she says are trumped up - being dropped, Bhutto&apos;s return to her homeland would have meant prison, not power. The two have spent the past few weeks thrashing out a deal that may have fascinated the world&apos;s media and the Pakistani political elite - many of whom have massive private incomes from land or commerce - but has hardly gripped the country as a whole. The biggest landowner in Tarli is Ahmed Shamraz, whose 10 acres, on sandy slopes above the brick kilns, bring him of \u00a34,000 a year, 10 times the average annual income. Shamraz says he likes the way Musharraf has built lots of roads, but is troubled by the recent surge in prices of staples such as palm oil. Unlike many of his countrymen, troubled by recent revelations of the major economic assets amassed by the Pakistani military over the decades, by the lucrative sinecures in the newly booming private and public sector that so many senior military officers seem to find, Shamraz still admires the army. &apos;They have fought two wars against the Indians to protect us. They are the shield of Pakistan,&apos; he says. Nor is he bothered by the fact that the only people the Pakistani army is fighting at the moment are his own countrymen, in the bloody and ineffective campaigns against Islamic militants and &apos;the Pakistani Taliban&apos; on the borders with Afghanistan. &apos;Those people are terrorists and bandits, and it is good that our army is battling with them,&apos; he says loyally. Shamraz, 31, vaguely remembers Bhutto&apos;s previous two stints in office when he was in his late teens and early twenties. He thinks she would make &apos;a good prime minister, but a lousy president&apos;. &apos;When she was in power, prices were cheaper...but I am not sure if all the allegations of corruption are true or not,&apos; Shamraz said. Two 11-year-olds, walking down to the brick kilns nearby with spades and shovels and dirt-smeared faces, said they had never heard of Bhutto. But they had heard of Musharraf. He was &apos;the king&apos; of Pakistan. Neither had been to school and, like more than 50 per cent of the country, were and would remain illiterate. &apos;We would really like to see entirely new political people,&apos; said Shamraz. Yet this weekend, it looks unlikely that his wish will be fulfilled. Negotiations for the deal between Musharraf and Bhutto started in earnest in the late spring, after a crisis sparked by the violent opposition of the country&apos;s lawyers to an attempt to intimidate and sideline the vain but independent chief justice and the supreme court. Then, in July, a pitched battle against Islamic extremists who had taken over and fortified a mosque in the centre of Islamabad shocked many Pakistanis who detest their president&apos;s commitment to the &apos;war on terror&apos;. A spate of suicide bombings followed, undermining Musharraf&apos;s claim to be guarantor of order and security. Overseas, Musharraf also found himself weakened. Many in Washington have lost patience with an ally who, despite receiving massive financial aid, delivered neither democracy nor results against al-Qaeda and Islamic militants fighting Nato forces in Afghanistan from bases in Pakistan. Clever lobbying by Bhutto also left Musharraf, who refused to give up his position as head of the armed forces despite the dubious constitutionality of keeping his uniform, wrong-footed. &apos;She has put a lot of effort into wooing Congress... and has seen results,&apos; a Western diplomat in Islamabad said. Pressure on Musharraf to &apos;democratise&apos; also came from London. Though Foreign Office spokesmen strongly deny any &apos;intermediary role&apos;, a series of sources, from key ministers to officials at other Western embassies, told The Observer that key London-based Foreign Office diplomats had been involved in bringing the parties together. London was certainly the key location for negotiations with senior military personnel, such as General Ashfaq Kayani, the man in effect nominated by Musharraf to succeed him as head of the army if, as seems now likely, the president resigns the post in the coming weeks, regularly visiting representatives of Bhutto in the British capital. Though spending much of her time in exile in Dubai, Bhutto has used London as a base, particularly for her lobbying and media campaigns. Yet despite the months that the negotiations have lasted, the past few days have been frantic. First, Bhutto wanted to secure Musharraf&apos;s promise that he would indeed resign from his army post. Her own father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was deposed and then hanged by an army chief, Zia ul-Haq, and she made it clear that she would not allow the members of parliament loyal to her Pakistan People&apos;s Party to vote in the presidential elections yesterday - and thus give the result a degree of credibility - unless Musharraf pledged to ditch his uniform. According to one minister, this was the easiest demand to meet: &apos;He was always going to do it. It is no big deal.&apos; On Thursday, negotiations centred on a trickier issue: amnesty for all those facing outstanding corruption charges. For seven hours, Musharraf and the cabinet sat in a lounge in the prime minister&apos;s house as an agreed text was faxed back and forward between Islamabad and Bhutto and her aides in London. At 1.30am Pakistan time, a solution was found and the next day Musharraf signed a presidential &apos;national reconciliation&apos; ordinance withdrawing all &apos;politically motivated&apos; charges of corruption dating from before the military coup. Constitutional obstacles to Bhutto becoming prime minister still remain, particularly a law introduced in the aftermath of the 1999 coup limiting anyone to two terms in the job, but the threat of arrest on arrival has now gone. Bhutto will not be the only beneficiary of the &apos;National Reconciliation Ordinance&apos;. Her great rival, Nawaz Sharif, who was deposed by Musharaf in 1999, is likely to also make a new attempt to return to Pakistan. His most recent, last month, got him no further than Islamabad airport. And there are hundreds of other senior bureaucrats and politicians who have been accused of graft who no longer face investigation. Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao, who himself faces &apos;politically motivated charges&apos;, said yesterday that the ordinance was necessary &apos;to build a national consensus&apos; to &apos;further democracy&apos;. So with two of her key demands fulfilled, Bhutto&apos;s PPP did not boycott the election. The deadlines were met. The deal was done. The representatives of national and provincial assemblies calmly cast their ballots unhindered. And Musharraf won a massive victory. Was it a stitch-up? Yes, said Mubarak Ali, a columnist in the Dawn newspaper. &apos;Instead of political succession by the approval of the people, the transfer of power is basically a question of compromise among those who are already at the helm of affairs in the country.&apos; Not entirely, said Ayaz Amir, a political analyst. &apos;We are moving from a pure military rule to something different, and we shouldn&apos;t discount that,&apos; he said, pointing out that the president, soon to be a civilian, will now not have the unalloyed power his uniform gave him. Not a stitch-up at all, said Durrani, the information minister: &apos;It was the responsibility of government to stay in dialogue with Mrs Bhutto. We hope we have changed the political culture of Pakistan. We will contend the coming [legislative] elections on the basis of our record over the last years.&apos; Recent months have been less exciting for the people of Tarli. Each day of brutal physical labour on the kilns, which are run at full capacity to keep up with the demand from Pakistan&apos;s construction boom, is the same. Akram remembers May not for the legal crisis that rocked Musharraf, but because his wife, Safia, injured her hand. Seeing a doctor is out of the question: with his earnings rarely exceeding 300 rupees (\u00a32.50) a day, he has barely enough to feed his family, especially with recent price rises. The alternative is a further loan from the kiln owner, to whom he already owes 125,000 rupees (\u00a31,040). &apos;We are not human beings,&apos; he said. &apos;We are donkeys.&apos; Akram remembers September, when Bhutto announced her return, for the end of the rains that meant no work, no income and therefore hunger. Akram does not remember much of last week at all. On Thursday, he worked late to buy some meat. &apos;They ask us for chicken so we try to give it to them once a week,&apos; he said. Friday, the weekly day off, Akram remembers simply for the pleasure of not working. Yesterday, he was back at the kilns. The elections? Akram spits. &apos;The politicians don&apos;t think or know anything about us,&apos; he says. &apos;We don&apos;t know anything about them. We are nothing.&apos; How Pakistan votes - and what comes next Who elects Pakistan&apos;s president?Members of the two houses of parliament - the 342-seat National Assembly and the 100-seat Senate and assemblies in the four provinces of Punjab, Sindh, North-West Frontier and Baluchistan. It is a secret ballot and the president has a five-year term. Who disputes Musharraf&apos;s right to stand?Critics say his re-election while army chief is illegal. Opposition parties have challenged his candidacy, while 160 opposition lawmakers resigned in protest. Will Musharraf remove his uniform?He says he will resign as chief of staff before November&apos;s presidential swearing-in. He has named a successor, golf-loving Lieutenant General Ashfaq Pervez Kiani. But no date has been set and he has broken promises before. If he quits, he will retain power to dismiss the government and parliament but could be weaker, especially with a popular prime minister in place. Why has Pakistan had such a tricky year? Taliban militants have been on the rise, attacking the army along the Afghan border. There has been a surge in violence and suicide bombings. Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry has made a number of judgments against the government and Musharraf&apos;s efforts to sack him caused riots.Tracy McVeigh", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Musharraf wins but faces fight for power", "sentences": ["In just over a week, Bhutto will make a spectacular return to her homeland after nearly a decade in exile in London and Dubai, in a move that will return her to power.", "Though spending much of her time in exile in Dubai, Bhutto has used London as a base, particularly for her lobbying and media campaigns."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/07/pakistan.jasonburke", "publicationDate": "2007-10-06T23:20:59Z"}, {"article": "Some celebrity gurus are coy about their clients, but not Nish Joshi. Princess Diana, Cate Blanchett, Juliette Binoche, the Sugababes... the names fall from his lips like coins from a slot machine. &apos;Gwyneth!&apos; he purrs delightedly, when I mention, in passing, Gwyneth Paltrow, who once appeared in a backless dress that revealed the circular marks where Joshi had applied hot glass cups to her skin to &apos;boost her qi&apos; and &apos;purify&apos; her blood. &apos;Bless her! She came because three of the ladies at her baby shower were patients of mine. So sweet.&apos; Of course, Joshi owes the rich and famous such a lot. It&apos;s not only that gossip about his relationships with them helped to put his Wimpole Street practice on the map, or even that their testimonies were so useful when he came to write his book, Holistic Detox (&apos;He sent me a medicinal drink for a bad bronchial infection I was suffering while I was performing Coriolanus in Tokyo,&apos; says Ralph Fiennes, on page 114). In the case of Diana, Princess of Wales, he owes his very career to her; it was she who urged him to look to the East, to the Ayurvedic medicine on which his Indian family had relied for generations, for solutions to common Western ailments: &apos;&quot;Go back to your roots,&quot; she said. She believed so much in holistic medicine, in giving patients what they need rather than masking their symptoms.&apos; He smiles at me beatifically. This takes a little digesting: that Joshi, who is always at pains to point out that he is a highly qualified osteopath, was willing to take advice from the notoriously daffy and faddish Princess Diana. But we must move on. The big news is that Joshi is now giving his clients something back - something other than the love and care that they receive from him already. He has opened a Wellness Centre: a gym and yoga studio in which they will be able to stretch their (not very) wobbly thighs in total privacy. Programmes will be tailored to their health needs. Isn&apos;t that what all personal trainers do? Apparently not. &apos;Let me give you an example. If your sugar levels are out of control, exercise could make you feel even more tired. We&apos;ll tell the trainer: here is this lady, make sure that before exercise she has an isotonic drink. We&apos;ll work on postural training, and the session will finish with a shiatsu body stretch to dissipate tension.&apos; So, in addition to the stuff that Joshi ordinarily recommends to his exhausted, stressed-out clients (diets, colonic irrigation, acupuncture) they&apos;ll now be able to pick up a prescription for exercise at the same time. &apos;It&apos;s about giving people tangible help,&apos; he says. Joshi and I are sitting in the Wellness Centre right now, perched on two high stools in an area where people will soon be drinking their energy-boosting shots of wheatgrass juice. He is a disarming man. He has a camp voice and an unctuous, calculatedly soothing manner that I find mighty annoying, but which neurotic celebrities no doubt love, and he answers questions in sprawling sentences which do not always contain the facts I am after. He is also undeniably plump. Does the guru actually practise what he preaches? &apos;Yes,&apos; he says, smoothly. &apos;I don&apos;t eat fish, meat, eggs or dairy. I&apos;m a Hindu vegetarian. I have a purely Ayurvedic diet. My meals are cooked for me by my housekeeper. I don&apos;t do well with croissants. I feel very bloated. Cheese makes me mucusy.&apos; Exercise? &apos;I do my sun salutations every day, and I work out with a personal trainer twice a week.&apos; However, I hear from a top source that Joshi loathes the gym; faced with a punchbag, his wrists droop like sunflower stalks in a heatwave. The Wellness Centre, in Marylebone, is a glamorous place: in the changing room, there are towels so fluffy that to wrap yourself in one is almost comic - as if you&apos;re auditioning for lead sheep in a nativity play. The yoga studio is light and airy. To become a member is not cheap (\u00a3125 a month; yoga classes cost \u00a325 on top, and personal training sessions \u00a360), but membership is, by necessity and design, destined to be exclusive. It&apos;s another outward sign, then, of the success of the Joshi brand. His rise has been rapid and somewhat eventful. Joshi grew up in north London. After school, he studied for a medical degree in India and then, having left after only three years, he trained at the British School of Osteopathy. After he qualified, he ran a practice treating dancers until, in 1993, while he was working at the Hale Clinic, he met Diana, who demanded to know what he was giving his patients, and could she please have some. Soon, he was a regular visitor to Kensington Palace (you can just see him, sweeping through the gates, the back seat of his car laden with tofu and tincture of liquorice), where he taught her to make pilau rice. He helped her through her bulimia - &apos;You saw how she flourished; she started to glow!&apos; - grew more interested in alternative medicine, and finally, with financial help from his parents, set up his practice in Wimpole Street. The question is: what sets him apart from the other celebrity gurus? Is his Wellness Centre, for instance, really any different from all the other boutique gyms that have lately sprung up to cater for the anxious rich? Joshi insists that his success is down to the fact that his treatments really work, so he gets great word of mouth. But he would say that, wouldn&apos;t he? I wonder out loud if the Joshi phenomenon isn&apos;t an example of the placebo effect. His remedies are surely not so important as the fact that he spends time with his patients, smiling and soothing and calling them &apos;dear&apos;. He disagrees. &apos;You can see a private GP, and get more time with your doctor. Lots of my patients have private GPs.&apos; OK, then. But does he worry that some patients are fixated on dramatic weight loss which they dress up as a desire to be &apos;well&apos;? &apos;Completely! I&apos;m trying to encourage people to have a healthy relationship with their diet.&apos; So if Cate Blanchett came in and wanted to lose a stone... &apos;No, no, that&apos;s ridiculous. My programme doesn&apos;t allow you to lose weight unless your body requires it.&apos; I&apos;m not absolutely convinced by this, but the upshot is that I ask Joshi if he will treat me as a patient for three weeks so that I can attempt to discover his secret for myself - and he, very kindly, agrees. A week later, I rock up for our first meeting (an initial consultation with Joshi is \u00a3180, and appointments thereafter cost \u00a3120 - but some patients fly him across the Atlantic or to Dubai if they can&apos;t make it to London). His clinic, I can&apos;t help but notice, is almost next door to the consulting rooms of Jan Stanek, the cosmetic surgeon who regularly appears on the Channel 4 show 10 Years Younger. In reception, I fill in a questionnaire. It asks me about illness in my family, whether I suffer from a range of ailments from insomnia to anxiety and, more bizarrely, about the length of my fingers. Joshi appears and talks to a waiting patient. He is all twinkly - almost giddy-seeming at finding her there, just beside the fridge that is stocked with his own brand of gluten-free loaves. She flirts with him a little, and says something about her father, who is also feeling ill. Joshi asks what star sign he is. &apos;Is he a Pisces?&apos; &apos;Oh, Dr Joshi!&apos; I feel quite left out. Oh, well. It&apos;s my turn now. We go up to his consulting room: big desk, couch, photographs of Joshi on the mantelpiece. I hand over my forms, but he barely looks at them. I tell him, truthfully, that I am tired, that I get headaches, and that my sleep seems to do me no good. I find the gym exhausting; I worry I will brain myself with a dumb-bell simply for want of some strength in my wrists. He tells me, without examining me, or taking any samples, that he thinks I have a hormonal imbalance, that my adrenal glands are not functioning properly, and that my bowel is lazy. I also have a chromium deficiency. He is going to put me on a diet and give me supplements that will sort these things out. He is also going to refer me to the Wellness Centre, where the trainers will work with me in a way that is not exhausting. Now, would I hop on the couch? I do, and he starts sticking acupuncture needles into my temples, wrists and ankles. Why? &apos;To reboot your computer,&apos; he says, lightly. But what will they do? &apos;I already told you,&apos; he says. &apos;They will reboot your computer.&apos; He is going to leave me to relax for 20 minutes; I may feel a little sleepy. After a while, the door opens and a young man in white overalls comes in. He sits down and begins insistently rubbing the arches of my feet - they supposedly connect to the relevant bits of my insides - which is quite painful. He is from Poland. In Poland, he says, the people in the villages are properly rustic, and thus honest and true: if they like you, they welcome you; if they don&apos;t, they will &apos;hit you&apos;. This is not a particularly relaxing thought. Finally, Joshi comes back. He puts two tiny needles into my ears - to keep cravings at bay, OK? - and then he takes me downstairs to make an appointment at the Wellness Centre. He also hands over seven bottles of supplements and a diet sheet on which is a list of good foods, of forbidden foods, and of all the pills I should take, and when. The forbidden list includes alcohol, bread and gluten products, dairy products, sugar, tea, coffee, chillis, fizzy drinks, red meat, all fruit (except bananas), vinegar, cucumber, courgettes, and the deadly nightshades: i.e. potatoes, aubergines, tomatoes and peppers. But I am allowed eggs, salad, dark green vegetables, white meat, soya and tofu, pulses, fish, brown rice, seeds, rice milk and live yoghurt. Where does spaghetti carbonara fit in? Last of all, he sends me back upstairs for colonic irrigation. He doesn&apos;t explain why, but I know that Diana was a fan, so maybe that&apos;s it. It&apos;s horrible: uncomfortable and strangely humiliating, like being a giant baby. The therapist who performs this procedure - what a job! - tells me that I will have a colonic once a week for the next three weeks, but even as she announces this, I know I won&apos;t. I don&apos;t think you should shove plastic pipes up your backside without a very good reason and, at this point, I can&apos;t fathom what that reason might be. So, now I&apos;m on my &apos;voyage of discovery&apos;. The diet is a nightmare: boring, restrictive, unsatisfying. Also, Joshi&apos;s &apos;Metabolic Detox&apos; pills, of which I&apos;m supposed to take four a night, seem to be giving me diarrhoea. I look at my sheet. It warns that they may cause cramps and loose stools, adding that: &apos;they are not laxative - they maintain the water content of your food to improve elimination of toxins&apos;. But when I look on the side of the bottle, the first ingredient listed is senna, a bowel irritant widely used in the treatment of constipation. I stop taking them. The good news, however, is that the gym is a revelation. Joshi&apos;s trainers, James and Ross, are fantastic: knowledgeable, enthusiastic, motivating. They know about posture and about muscles, which means that they notice and know how to care for my tight calves. If I were rich, I would see them every day for the rest of my life. After a week, I see Joshi again. How am I? Well, I say, those detox pills: are they laxatives? He insists not, but adds that he remembers &apos;school biology lessons&apos; in which he learnt that it should take food an hour to pass through the system: I should be going to the loo three times a day, after every meal. But they&apos;re giving me the runs! &apos;So, take two instead of four.&apos; Today&apos;s session is brief: more acupuncture, and some manipulation of my neck. It all seems rather random: a bit pick and mix. He doesn&apos;t seem to focus on what I&apos;m saying, or make an effort to answer my questions. Nor does he mention the needles he stuck in my ears a week ago (in fact, I&apos;ve already removed them; they were sore). I have enough pills, so when I leave, all I take with me is an appointment to see a masseur, Tommy (a former dancer from Sweden, he turns out to be excellent, and gives me the most expert massage I&apos;ve ever had). I persist with my sessions at the gym but, though I pop the other supplements dutifully - this takes minutes - I again cease taking the Metabolic Detox pills. I try hard with the diet, but it&apos;s difficult when there is your other half to consider - soya milk, darling? - and, if I eat only rice cakes and salad for lunch, I feel so hungry I can&apos;t work. I&apos;m due to see Joshi one more time but (I admit this is not very journalistic of me) I duck out at the last minute, largely because I gather he is going to insist on that plastic pipe going back up my bottom. How do I feel after three weeks? Good; I&apos;ve got more energy. But I think this is mainly due to the brilliant James and Ross, and their boxing regime. I&apos;ve lost a couple of pounds, but anyone would with a diet this restricted and, since that wasn&apos;t my aim anyway, I&apos;m wondering... where did I hide those biscuits? It is good fun being treated by Joshi - if nothing else, I got to see a world I could never afford to visit in real life - but I can&apos;t work out what his diagnosis is based on (he&apos;s taken no blood or urine), nor can I see the logic in his detox diet (it&apos;s contradictory unless, as I suspect, it is simply about reducing calorie intake: for instance, dairy products are forbidden, while cottage cheese is acceptable). Question his ideas and Joshi&apos;s first line of defence is that Western medicine has always pooh-poohed that of the East, and that many of his treatments - from Ayurvedic herbs to Gwyneth Paltrow&apos;s favourite, cupping - have been used for thousands of years. This isn&apos;t good enough. He should be able to explain both why treatments are suitable, and how they work. The testimonies of other patients - &apos;Joshi is a miracle worker,&apos; says Patsy Kensit - are not enough for me, nor should they be. &apos;People go to the doctor because they feel ill,&apos; says John Garrow, professor emeritus in human nutrition at London University and vice-chairman of Healthwatch, a charity that promotes the better understanding of the importance of clinical trials in medicine. &apos;More often than not, the next time they go to the doctor, they will be feeling less low. These things are cyclical.&apos; Colonic irrigation has certainly been practised for thousands of years, but its benefits have been neither proved nor discredited scientifically. However, most doctors think it is, at best, unnecessary. Holistic practitioners seem to believe that the colon is a sewage system, and that if it isn&apos;t properly cleaned out, toxic substances will leak into the body. &apos;It&apos;s now recognised that the contents of the colon are not rubbish,&apos; says Garrow. &apos;Fibre that is not digestible by enzymes is metabolised by the bacteria there, and turned into fatty acids which make a very small contribution to your energy.&apos; I show Joshi&apos;s diet to Catherine Collins, chief dietician at St George&apos;s Hospital, London. She, too, finds it inconsistent. Is it a diet aimed at avoiding common allergens like milk protein? If so, why am I encouraged to eat live yoghurt? &apos;Red meat is a valuable source of iron for pre-menopausal women,&apos; she says. &apos;The lack of fruit is not great, especially since it will be difficult to compensate by eating lots of vegetables because he has excluded so many of those, too.&apos; Why might foods from the deadly nightshade family be forbidden? &apos;There is evidence that they are a potential irritant, but the research is old and mostly relates to those with arthritic conditions. I work in arthritis, and I&apos;ve never found a patient who has benefited from these exclusions. So I&apos;m not sure why he forbids them. I&apos;m afraid this diet is typical of those recommended by self-styled nutritionists. It is nutritionally compromised, and its inadequacies need to be offset by vitamin supplements.&apos; Ah, yes. My supplements. Of the seven white bottles Joshi gave me, the one labelled Super Liver Cleanse is just a vitamin and mineral supplement in disguise. The one called 5HTP is too, though it also contains the controversial amino acid 5HTP which, in some countries, is marketed as an anti-depressant (it can have serious side effects, though not in the amount contained here). The others are: Metabolic Detox; PH Balance; Digest-Aid; Kidney Support; and Essential Chromium. Collins is unimpressed by one of the primary ingredients of the Metabolic Detox tablets: senna. She wouldn&apos;t recommend senna for constipation except as a last resort (and I never said I had constipation), and &apos;anything that results in diarrhoea is not recommended&apos;. PH Balance contains magnesium, sodium and potassium - salts that are found naturally in the bloodstream. Digest-Aid contains a number of enzymes, but enzymes are proteins, which are destroyed by the stomach acid before they are able to reach the site of absorption in the small intestine. Kidney Support contains vitamin C and cranberry juice, plus other plant ingredients like horsetail. Cranberry juice has been shown to have a borderline effect in the treatment of cystitis, but in the quantities contained here it is unlikely to be effective. What about my chromium deficiency? &apos;The body only needs chromium in tiny amounts,&apos; she says. &apos;There&apos;s very little research to show than an ordinary member of the public would need any extra.&apos; Collins is bewildered as to how Joshi came to his diagnosis, especially of my below-par adrenal glands (the adrenal glands regulate the body&apos;s stress response through the production of hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline). &apos;If something were wrong with your adrenal glands, it would be a major medical event. You&apos;d have loads of symptoms. You&apos;d be very ill. I&apos;m concerned that he can presume a diagnosis of what would be a serious complaint without any physical examination, or analysis of blood biochemistry.&apos; After I speak to Collins, I telephone Joshi and ask him how, exactly, he diagnosed all my problems. &apos;I looked at your symptom picture, to what you told me about your periods of tiredness, your headaches, your sugar levels dropping.&apos; But what about my adrenal glands? What him made him think they weren&apos;t functioning properly? &apos;It&apos;s all clinical experience. I could have done some tests that confirmed this, but that would have been very expensive. I see this symptom picture over and over again. This is what I deal with a lot of the time.&apos; I am sure that Joshi means well. He certainly works hard. As he says to me with a weary but satisfied smile: &apos;There are so many ill people who need to be made well.&apos; But if it is anything like the information he gave to me, a lot of what he tells his patients is, at best, confused and somewhat vague - and, irrespective of how rich and famous they are, those patients put their trust in him. He styles himself Dr Joshi but, as he also admits to me on the telephone, he never completed his medical degree, which is why he is not registered with the General Medical Council - and when I ring the General Osteopathic Council, with whom he is registered, a spokeswoman me that they actively discourage members from using the title &apos;Dr&apos;. Oh, well. You can join his Wellness Centre without even having to see him - and I certainly recommend that. Although I flush his supplements down the loo, and go back to eating bread, red meat and - oh no! - fresh fruit, I must admit that I haven&apos;t had thighs as firm as this for ages.

The Guggenheim Foundation has gone from being a museum with a main base in New York and an outlet in Venice to being a global venture, with outlets scattered across the world. Gehry&apos;s Bilbao museum in 1997 was the first step in this expansion. In the same year, a small gallery in the Unter den Linden area opened as the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin. In 2001, a spectacular building designed by Rem Koolhaas opened its doors in Las Vegas, showcasing highlights of the Guggenheim collection and of the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Russia. Recently, there have been reports of plans for a Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, planned for completion in 2011. Unlike many European museums, most American art galleries aren&apos;t state funded. This helps to explain the more businesslike direction the Guggenheim franchise has taken under the leadership of its current director Thomas Krens. Krens was the driving force behind the gallery&apos;s expansion and sponsorship deals with Deutsche Bank and BMW. Visitor numbers have rocketed under his reign, but not everyone has been happy with the gallery&apos;s &quot;GuggEnron&quot; image: chairman Peter B Lewis resigned from his position in 2005, saying that he wished the foundation would &quot;concentrate more on New York and less on being scattered all over the world&quot;. From Bilbao to Abudhadi: the cultural city Running a city took a step closer to computer simulation with the apparent discovery of the &quot;Bilbao Effect&quot;. The fabled consequence of Gehry&apos;s great swoops of titanium was a huge influx of tourist money, as culture filled the void left by Bilbao&apos;s fading industry. That, at least, was the theory. The truth wasn&apos;t quite so black and white, but it didn&apos;t stop planeloads of mayoral deputations arriving from around the world, all eager to imitate its success. Everyone wanted their own culture magnet, often calling up Gehry himself and effectively asking him to replicate the scheme. Few have taken the concept of a cultural magnet as far as the UAE. Saadiyat Island is a proposed cultural supercity in Abu Dhabi, clearly inspired by the ongoing global fascination engendered by neighbouring Dubai. The 27-square-kilometre complex has a projected cost of $27bn and, most importantly, is intended to be the Middle East outpost of the world&apos;s most recognisable cultural &quot;brands&quot;. Naturally this includes the Guggenheim (and Gehry is already on board), but the arched and plucked eyebrows of Paris&apos;s smart set were raised even higher at the news that the UAE had paid the Louvre $520m for the rights to use the august institution&apos;s name for the next three decades. The island hopes to combine the wattage of the likes of Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Jean Nouvel and Tadao Ando to create a new architectural wonder. It&apos;s what&apos;s inside that counts One of the main criticisms levelled at Gehry&apos;s museum is that the building is so overwhelming that it distracts from the artworks on display inside. It is certainly true that while the Guggenheim&apos;s architecture has amassed headlines over the last decade, little has been written about its often considerable exhibitions. In keeping with the foundation&apos;s dedication to modern art, the museum has exhibited works by Mark Rothko, Willem de Kooning, Clyfford Still and Anselm Kiefer, as well as a rather unusual show about motorcycle design. Still, it would be unfair to say that Gehry forgot to leave space for art among the architecture. Perhaps more so than any other museum, the Guggenheim Bilbao has managed to commission artworks that engage specifically with the spaces in and around the museum. At the front, visitors to the Guggenheim are greeted by Jeff Koons&apos; 13-metre puppy clad in flowers - more kitsch, but also less intimidating than Louise Bourgeois&apos; enormous bronze spider scuttling about at the back of the building. Inside, there are light installations by Jenny Holzer and an oversized badminton shuttlecock drooping from a balcony, designed by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen. The curators have left a space for Picasso&apos;s Guernica - because they feel that Bilbao has a moral and sentimental right to the work depicting the fascist bombing of the nearby town. So far, Madrid&apos;s Reina Sofia museum has rejected all loan requests. Independence or cultural imperialism? The initial plans for a Guggenheim museum in Bilbao were not without controversy. Funded entirely by the host country but masterminded from New York, many Basque commentators, including the now-banned separatist party Herri Batasuna, saw the museum as a sign of cultural imperialism, an economically motivated attempt to purge the region of its history. A week before the opening gala in October 1997, police officer Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aguirre was shot and killed after he interrupted a group of Eta terrorists disguised as gardeners, who tried to plant remote-controlled grenades in the Jeff Koons sculpture outside the museum. When the Spanish monarchs, King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia officially opened the museum on October 18, police snipers watched on from the rooftops of surrounding buildings. Whether Gehry&apos;s building actually erases the city&apos;s cultural heritage, as Eta suggested, is debatable. Bilbao is famous for its maritime history: after Barcelona, it has Spain&apos;s largest port. Gehry&apos;s building, which edges on to the Nervi\u00f3n riverfront and has been likened by many to a shipwreck, seems to pay tribute to its own surroundings. Richard Serra&apos;s two permanent installations at the Guggenheim Bilbao - Snake and The Matter of Time - are fashioned out of steel, traditionally the main industry in the city. In fact, Serra&apos;s work is deeply intertwined with Spain: his father is from Mallorca, and he cites the Basque sculptors Eduardo Chillida and Jorge Oteiza as two of the main influences on his work. Behind the Guggenheim name Meyer Guggenheim was a Swiss Jew who emigrated to Philadelphia in 1847 and later made a fortune in mining and smelting. These days, the Guggenheim name is more closely associated with the philanthropic endeavours of two of Meyer&apos;s descendents: Solomon Guggenheim, and his niece Peggy Guggenheim. Solomon started collecting art in 1919 on retirement. His collector&apos;s eye was trained by the young German artist Hilla Rebay, and by 1929, aged 66, he was buying important works by European modernists, including Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee and Marc Chagall. In 1937, he formed the Solomon R Guggenheim Foundation, alongside Rebay, for &quot;the promotion and encouragement and education in art and the enlightenment of the public&quot;. They opened a gallery, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, on 24 East 54th Street in 1939 and commissioned their friend Frank Lloyd Wright to build a permanent home for the collection four years later. Construction of the famous museum on Fifth Avenue was delayed by post-war inflation until 1959, when the Guggenheim Museum New York finally opened - just a few days after Wright&apos;s death. If Solomon lent financial support to the Guggenheim brand, Peggy gave it glamour. A champion of the avant garde in Paris and a lover of Dada sculptor Laurence Vail, Max Ernst and Samuel Beckett, she got in ahead of her uncle by opening the first family gallery - the Guggenheim Jeune - on 30 Cork Street in London in January 1938.", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture"], "title": "Great modern buildings: Guggenheim Bilbao", "sentences": ["Saadiyat Island is a proposed cultural supercity in Abu Dhabi, clearly inspired by the ongoing global fascination engendered by neighbouring Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/oct/08/architecture1", "publicationDate": "2007-10-08T07:59:04Z"}, {"article": "The editor of beauty magazine Brand New You, Rachael Lloyd, has stepped down after just over a month in the role.

An interior ministry spokesman said the company had apologised to the Iraqi government. The shooting occurred near Unity offices in central Baghdad&apos;s Karradah district. Michael Priddin, Unity&apos;s chief operating officer, issued a statement saying: &quot;We deeply regret this incident and will continue to pass on further information when the facts have been verified and the necessary people and authorities notified.&quot; The deaths came just hours after Iraq&apos;s government demanded that the US security company Blackwater pay a total of $136m (\u00a367m) in compensation to the families of civilians killed in a shooting in Baghdad last month. Seventeen people were shot and at least 20 injured when Blackwater guards protecting a US diplomatic convoy opened fire. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki&apos;s government has urged the US to sever its relations with the company within six months. Police at the scene of the shooting said they had collected 19 shell casings used by Nato forces and by Iraqi security agencies which have recently received new US weapons. In a scene that has become depressingly familiar to Baghdad residents, the women were shot after they drove too close to a convoy of three unmarked four-wheel drives close to the former German embassy. One witness said the guards in the convoy, who were reported to be masked, had fired a warning shot and a smoke bomb in the direction of the women&apos;s car. He said the woman driving appeared to panic and failed to stop. A police spokesman said their car had then been hit with at least 16 bullets.

His visit to the site this week has reminded them, if they needed it, that they are pitted against one of the world&apos;s most famous and famously ruthless businessmen. But they should take comfort from the thought that they are not alone. Three thousand miles away, in the rather less rustic location of SoHo in lower Manhattan, a very similar battle is being played out between residents and the Trump phenomenon over his plans to construct a $450m (\u00a3220m) condominium. The scheme&apos;s opponents say the 46-storey tower would ruin the low-rise nature of the neighbourhood, in much the same way as Aberdeen&apos;s antagonists rail against the 950 homes and 45-room hotel envisaged for &quot;Trump Boulevard&quot;. The heartening news for the Scottish campaigners is that Mr Trump&apos;s ambitions in New York have provoked an unusual degree of solidarity between neighbourhoods across the city, who are going to the courts in an attempt to stop the development. The bad news is that the tycoon has proved uncannily successful in winning over the city government. &quot;He has been very able at ingratiating himself with the city authorities,&quot; said Andrew Berman, director of the historic preservation society for Manhattan&apos;s Greenwich Village. It&apos;s Trump&apos;s forte, working contacts among the great and the good, using his reputation as a celebrity deal-maker to drive through his designs. He sums up the approach concisely in the title of his forthcoming book: Think Big and Kick Ass in Business and Life. It has certainly got him a long way. His background helped: father Fred was a wealthy developer, but most of the elder Trump&apos;s property portfolio was in Brooklyn. Young Donald took the family business over the East river into the much more brutal real estate market of Manhattan, where he now owns more than 18m square feet of prime space. From there, he has taken the Trump empire national - with casinos in New Jersey, hotels in Las Vegas and Chicago, golf courses in Florida and Los Angeles - and global, with properties bearing his name in Toronto, Panama City and Dubai. But his headline successes hide a more complicated picture. For a start, no one can agree on precisely how much he is worth. Business magazine Forbes puts him at $3bn, but every year he disputes the figure, claiming his personal wealth is more than twice that. &quot;He is clearly a very wealthy man, but just how wealthy has always been unclear,&quot; says his biographer, Gwenda Blair. &quot;Anyone who has sat down and done the math on what is visible knows that he can&apos;t possibly be worth what he says he is.&quot; Her book, Donald Trump: Master Apprentice, reminds us that he has come close to business extinction on several occasions. What saved him was his ability to turn himself into an international brand which melded his reputed ruthlessness in business with the glamour of his personal life in the penthouse of Trump Tower (worth $50m on its own) and his succession of beautiful wives: Ivana, Marla and Melania. &quot;It&apos;s pretty remarkable, but he has established the Trump brand as someone associated with leading a super-luxury lifestyle.&quot; But what really sent the value of the Trump brand sky-rocketing was the launch of The Apprentice, his leap into television with the famous catch-phrase: &quot;You&apos;re fired!&quot; The show is ostensibly about young people competing to work for him, but in reality it is all about Donald Trump. Mark Lamkin, a former competitor on the show, grew in awe of his sharp side: &quot;He will use every means at his disposal to make his money. If that means pissing off the locals, he has no qualms about it.&quot; There is a lesson there for the protesters of Aberdeen, as there is in what happened to comic and TV personality Rosie O&apos;Donnell, who criticised him on air and in the fallout was forced from her job as a presenter of talk show The View. &quot;Trumped, I was,&quot; she writes in her new book, Celebrity Detox. &quot;I started to see that he was not a man.

Seat design differs by plane and airline, so do some research to make sure you get the right sort of seat. The long journey is also much more bearable if you split it and get a good sleep at an airport transit hotel. These are in the transit terminal itself, so make sure your bags are checked right through to New Zealand from the UK. They operate in six-hour slots (you can pre-book online) and are eminently affordable. If possible, go via Changi airport (Singapore) - it&apos;s the best international airport I&apos;ve been to, and there&apos;s even a swimming pool and gardens for transit passengers. And don&apos;t forget to check if you can get air miles too, especially if you stump up for business class.

I arrived much less stressed and didn&apos;t dread the journey back home.

People scuttle home across the city&apos;s potholed roads and broken pavements and the few taxis still operating will only make short trips. With only 30 minutes to curfew, no one takes chances with the Burmese military these days. Carrying shotguns and assault rifles, teenagers in military and police uniforms cluster at street corners until curfew, then retreat to fenced-off government buildings as darkness settles. When the residents of this sprawling city of five million people withdraw to their homes, only pick-up trucks carrying troops ply the downtown area, scattering the dogs that take over the empty streets until the curfew ends at 4am. With the killing of an unknowable number of peaceful protesters and the imprisonment of thousands more during the pro-democracy demonstrations last month, many people fear reprisals by the military. At the Shwedagon pagoda, the nucleus of the protests, the military is still in force. Wearing steel helmets, flak jackets and carrying extra ammunition, the number of troops far exceeds the few old monks who potter among the golden spires of what is the spiritual centre of Burmese life. At the pagoda&apos;s eastern gate, from which the monks began their days of peaceful marches around Rangoon, six fire trucks - the type used to water cannon crowds, not put out blazes - are stationed. Dozens of monastic houses lining the route to the gate remain locked and empty, despite reports in Burma&apos;s state-controlled media that most of the monks have been released from jail. Sources said that around 1,000 monks had lived and studied at these small monasteries, but where they have gone is not a question that anyone ponders aloud. One man simply put his wrists together in the sign of locked handcuffs when asked where they are. &quot;We cannot speak. We cannot defend. We have no weapons. They have all the weapons,&quot; said another 30-year-old man, who cannot be identified for his own safety. He, like many thousands of others, joined the monks in the early part of the protests, before the killing. What most people know is that when the military and police moved to crush the demonstrations they went after the monks under the cover of darkness - kicking in doors and bundling monks, young and old, into trucks. Buddhist nuns were also taken away. The military were too powerful to be beaten by peaceful protests but some feel that the attacks and the disappearance of the Buddhist clergy will be the undoing of General Than Shwe, the Burmese junta&apos;s leader. &quot;We are a Buddhist country. We believe that if you do good, you receive good. If you do bad things you receive bad things. This will be the same for the military,&quot; said the 30-year-old. The military announced, in the New Light of Myanmar newspaper, that monks and nuns taken in the raids were defrocked before interrogation and those found to not have participated in the demonstrations were reordained and sent back to their monasteries. &quot;The handling of the situation during the violent protests and measures taken by officials for purification of the Sasana [religion] amounts to serving the interest of the Sasana,&quot; the paper added. &quot;Officials are to make continued efforts for perpetuation, purification and propagation of the Sasana.&quot; Barricades remain stacked beside pavements, in the centre of wider roads and in alleys ready for use, though after the crushing of the recent protests none of those spoken to in Rangoon seem to have the stomach for more - just yet. Many of those who took part in the protests, even as onlookers, have fled to the countryside fearing the ongoing night-time sweeps by the intelligence services who video-taped demonstrators and are now putting names to faces. In the aftermath of the protests the military has cut the country&apos;s internet connection to stem the flood of protest images to the outside world. Cable TV, however, remains connected and residents in Rangoon watched the brutal crackdown in their city on TV sets tuned to CNN and the BBC. In shops and hotel lobbies, Burmese staff whisper: &quot;Have you seen CNN? Have you seen what happened?&quot; Many said that the world had now seen the true face of their leaders thanks to images smuggled out of the country. They hope that the international media attention will make a difference, though none believe the generals are anywhere near allowing democracy or handing over control of the country. The Burmese follow the &quot;three monkeys rule,&quot; said a 45-year-old businessman as he sipped a cup of coffee overlooking the street corner where the Japanese cameraman, Kenji Nagai, 50, was shot dead on September 27. &quot;We see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. That is the way to survive. But inside we know,&quot; he said. &quot;I heard the Japanese cameraman worked in Afghanistan and Iraq, but did not die. Here in Burma they shot him dead,&quot; he said, dropping his voice to explain why he left the demonstrations early, he added: &quot;I have a wife and three children. If I am killed they will have nothing.&quot; Thousands were killed in pro-democracy protests in Rangoon in 1988 which the businessman also witnessed and supported. Since then the military has grown richer, stronger and has invested more in maintaining power, he said. The demonstrations had little chance of toppling the military but he believed the latest show of defiance gave the generals the jitters. A story that was repeated by several sources claimed that the wives and children of the junta had left the country for Dubai, some said Laos, in the early days of the demonstrations, while their husbands hunkered down in the country&apos;s new jungle capital, Naypyidaw, to coordinate the military&apos;s response. &quot;They transferred their money to Singapore, many millions of dollars,&quot; claimed the businessman as he chatted calmly but wearily about the contempt felt by the people toward the military. Midway through he stopped abruptly, his face drained and he moved in his chair, twisting his body away from two men sitting silently at a nearby table. &quot;They are listening. They are special police,&quot; he said, politely ending the conversation and leaving. In this city that quietly seethes with anti-government resentment, the people are terrified of the spies of the intelligence services. Burma&apos;s state-run TV channels and newspapers have been packed since last week with footage of big pro-government demonstrations in provincial areas. In daily, full-page notices in newspapers and frequent TV announcements the public are warned against tuning into the &quot;traitors,&quot; &quot;saboteurs,&quot; and &quot;neo-colonialists&quot; at the BBC, Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. The generals are &quot;gangsters&quot;, said one man with overseas experience, but the economic sanctions by western nations simply benefit China and Asian nations that are still content to do business with the junta, particularly in the fields of gas, oil and other natural resources, which Burma has in abundance. &quot;Democracy does not fit well in Burma, the generals are gangsters but at least they can run things. These democracy parties have no experience of running the country,&quot; he added. The military may not even want the western foreign investment that is being denied them through sanctions - with investment comes influence both cultural and economic. &quot;The military have everything they need. They don&apos;t like the influence of western culture, because then they would have to change,&quot; he added. &quot;All this is hurting the very poor, they cannot go about their business.&quot; But the Burmese security forces are not a monolith and many of the rank and file in this Buddhist nation may fear the religious implications of the attacks on the monasteries and the continued detentions of monks. Earlier this week, at Shwedagon pagoda, a light rain fell as the last few worshippers trickled up the stairways to the hilltop temple carrying offerings of flowers and incense. Small groups of men and women sat on reed mats meditating and reciting mantras at the pavilions at the top of each stairway. Among them was one young man who kneeled, not to mediate but to ask forgiveness. At 26, this man had been a police officer for six years and had risen to become a plainclothes officer. When the night swoops on the monasteries began, he was ordered to take part. On Monday night he deposited his police uniform and weapon at his station before coming to the pagoda for one last visit before fleeing to the Thai border. It&apos;s an act of betrayal that will mean several years&apos; imprisonment if he is caught. As he rose from his knees he said: &quot;I have had enough. I have to leave.&quot; Then with two other young men he started out on the journey to the border and the refugee camps where tens of thousands of Burmese have fled before him.", "tags": ["World news", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "title": "After the riots, Burma returns to an unspoken terror", "sentences": ["A story that was repeated by several sources claimed that the wives and children of the junta had left the country for Dubai, some said Laos, in the early days of the demonstrations, while their husbands hunkered down in the country&apos;s new jungle capital, Naypyidaw, to coordinate the military&apos;s response."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/13/topstories3.burma", "publicationDate": "2007-10-12T23:21:57Z"}, {"article": "Neil and Deborah Baker can pick out the dull orange glow of Swansea and sometimes hear the steady hum of the M4 from their home on a hillside north of Llanelli. But early next year, they will swap the old coalfields of Carmarthenshire for an island with no street lights, no shops and no doctor. The Bakers and their two children, Elinor, six, and Anwen, four, have been chosen from more than 350 applicants from countries including Germany, Canada and Dubai to become the new residents of Canna, a tiny island barely a mile wide and six miles long off the west coast of Scotland. After the bustle of south Wales, the Bakers will move to the small township of A&apos;Chill, a straggling string of white-washed cottages, timber-walled holiday chalets and farm buildings that hugs the island&apos;s secluded bay, a natural harbour dotted with islets and fringed by beaches, mudflats and kelp. Then their view will be dominated by the looming bulk of the neighbouring island of Rhum, the mountainous ridges of Skye and, in the far distance - two and a half hours away by ferry - the dark peaks of the Scottish mainland. And that, said Mr Baker, 43, was the entire point. &quot;One of the things which attracted us to make the move is we&apos;re keen for our children and the two of us not to be taken in by the fast food culture, and that temptation won&apos;t be there on Canna. We feel it would be good for the family.&quot; Elinor has been busy telling her friends and classmates about her new adventure, he said. &quot;Anwen is still a little small to fully grasp it, but Elinor is quite excited about it and is old enough to really appreciate the implications.&quot; Mr Baker, a fluent Welsh speaker and former television gardener for the Welsh-language channel S4C, has been hired by the National Trust for Scotland - which owns the island - to resurrect the overgrown garden at Canna House, last owned by the Gaelic folklorist and historian John Lorne Campbell. Described by the trust&apos;s experts as a classic island laird&apos;s garden and a model of self-sufficiency, it features a collection of rare apple, pear, peach and plum trees. On his last visit, Mr Baker waded through leaf mould two inches thick on broken pathways and discovered a fruiting grapevine against one wall. &quot;It was fascinating stuff,&quot; he said. The community, isolated by its size and distance from the mainland, has been in slow decline for generations. Once home to 450 people in the early 1800s, its population dwindled to only 15 several years ago, leaving its tiny two-roomed school with just one pupil, nine-year-old Caroline. That forced the trust, which was given Canna by Lorne Campbell in 1981, to advertise last September for two new families to settle there. It was inundated with applications. The first couple chosen by the islanders - Sheila Gunn, a teacher, and John Clare, a former Royal Navy communications specialist - moved over from Oban, just to the south, two months ago. Trust officials say they are quietly and slowly settling in, but are resisting publicity. One family, the Mackinnons, date their arrival on Canna to the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, and the islanders guard their privacy. That does not worry the Bakers. &quot;As a family we&apos;re very self-contained and I think that&apos;s essential. But the very fact that there&apos;s only 14 to 15 people on the island does mean that the community will pull together when it needs to,&quot; Mr Baker said. &quot;We&apos;re very conscious of the fact we&apos;re moving to an island that has a long history, a culture, it has indigenous people on it, and we wouldn&apos;t want to do anything which would interfere with that.&quot; Elinor will soon become the school&apos;s third pupil, joining Caroline and Johnny, eldest child of the school&apos;s sole teacher, Eilidh Sae-Paing, who started there in August. On their last visit, Elinor spent a morning in the school and wanted to stay all day. &quot;At that age, it&apos;s just such a mind-expanding experience, where you&apos;re so free and safe to do whatever you want,&quot; Mr Baker said. Even so, he admitted, the high winds that batter their new environment and demolished a footbridge linking the two islands which make up Canna three winters ago &quot;will be the main challenge for us&quot;. The National Trust for Scotland warned applicants last year that winters on the island can be harsh: &quot;Winters are long, dark and can be hard for those not used to it.&quot; The nearest doctor lives on Eigg, and uses a speedboat to make home visits. Electricity is provided by generators, the gas is bottled, and the telephones and computer broadband rely on a satellite link. Another, even more isolated, island owned by the trust, Fair Isle, has been struggling to find a headteacher for its small school with nine pupils. Yesterday Shetland council re-advertised for the \u00a343,683-a-year post after reportedly attracting only four applicants several months ago. Clearly, not everyone shares the Baker family dream of a life away from the temptations of modernity. Canna in numbers The island has eight inhabited houses, three churches, and a farm. Its current population is 17 Its main business is tourism and each year visitor numbers reach up to 30,000 It has remnants of neolithic farms, an early Christian hermitage linked to St Columba, Celtic crosses, Bronze Age burial mounds and forts from its 6,000 years of human settlement.

The crisis in the financial markets changed everything because the big buyout firms such as Permira, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and CVC had made use of the same cheap credit as the poor Americans who sparked the crisis by defaulting on super-sized mortgages. Like those Americans, their credit ratings have been affected, leaving multimillionaire partners unable to tap the huge reservoirs of debt that had enabled them to outgun listed companies. &apos;Mega-deals will be rarer, the sheer amount of debt the markets are prepared to lend has been reduced,&apos; says one senior investment banker. &apos;But as soon as I started to see esoteric debt instruments such as PIKs [payment in kind loans], which were last in fashion 20 years ago, I knew we were in the last gasp of a red-hot market.&apos; But if you have just regained consciousness after being in a coma for two months, you might be forgiven for thinking the &apos;credit crunch&apos; is just a new kind of breakfast cereal. The FTSE 100 hit a near seven-year high on Thursday and, despite the turmoil, a string of bumper deals have remained on course. Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin is this week swirling in his chair, basking in victory after his consortium won the \u00a350bn race for Dutch bank ABN Amro (see below). Meanwhile, at its London headquarters Sainsbury&apos;s staff are waiting for regime change as the Qatari government puts the finishing touches to its \u00a310.6bn bid for the supermarket chain. So while on the surface it looks like business as usual in the City, the protagonists are changing as the cogs of the debt markets wind more slowly following the summer hiatus. This time, instead of finding the private equity bosses who earn eye-watering returns at the bridge, it is other listed companies and secretive sovereign wealth funds that are greasing the wheels as the mergers and acquisitions [M&amp;A] cycle changes gear. Last week the Boots deal, already tarnished by the inability of banks to sell on some of the loans provided during the height of the credit squeeze, was dealt another knock when Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s withdrew its credit ratings, recognising that it was a leveraged buyout, financed with debt rather than cash. The sea of cheap money that had enabled buyout houses to outbid listed rivals by funding deals with aggressive levels of debt retreated abruptly. This left huge parcels of loans marooned while countless other transactions, including the \u00a37bn sale of Cadbury Schweppes&apos; drinks arm and asset sales such as British Land&apos;s stake in Meadowhall shopping centre and MWB&apos;s hotel business, dashed on the rocks. Most agree it would have been impossible for KKR to have pulled off the Boots takeover in the current climate, but the sale price sought by Apax and Permira in the failed auction of fashion retailer New Look in the spring is also cited as evidence of the turning tide. The consortium had bought the group for \u00a3700m three years earlier and was trying to sell it for a multiple of nearly eight times operating profit against a norm of around five. Indeed, the prices paid by gung-ho venture capitalists helped to drive world M&amp;A activity up to unprecedented levels. The running tally for global deals in 2007 is running at \u00a31.8 trillion, which is already \u00a3500bn more than last year, according to the latest data from Thomson Financial. The bumper figures are swollen by the buyout binge in the first half of this year that saw UK institutions such as Boots and Hanson change hands. So who are the agents in the City at the moment? &apos;The M&amp;A cycle isn&apos;t going to grind to a halt,&apos; says one adviser. &apos;The stock market is still quite strong and we are seeing more interest in utility and oil and gas stocks, like the bid for Burren Energy last week. We are going to see more public-to-public transactions while private equity is likely to be replaced by sovereign funds in the short term.&apos; Although the proposed takeover of Sainsbury has all the hallmarks of another private equity takeover, it is atypical in that the financiers are backed by the wealth of oil-rich Qatar. &apos;These are investors with different investment horizons. There is also a bit of braggadocio between the City states with Abu Dhabi competing with Qatar and Dubai,&apos; says another City banker. &apos;What is more typical is mid-cap activity such as the Cookson Foseco deal [Cookson is buying the engineering group for nearly \u00a3500m].&apos; Indeed, despite their domination of the headlines, private equity, whose bosses have been run over the coals this year by the unions and MPs over tax avoidance and profligate profit-taking, were responsible for only one - Alliance Boots - of the top 10 European M&amp;A deals so far this year. In a recent interview, Permira partner Charles Sherwood said their importance in the financial world had been overblown. &apos;In Europe, the masters of the universe were never as masterly as they thought,&apos; he said. &apos;If you think of KKR, CVC and Permira as Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United, I would say don&apos;t. Think about Derby, Sunderland and West Ham. We were never quite as important as people thought we were.&apos; One senior investment banker agrees: &apos;M&amp;A reverts to being about public-to-public deals, as at the end of the day these are the guys that can make the most use of the assets.&apos; But, despite the mismatch between a strong equity market and constricted debt markets, few expect private equity houses to give up. &apos;It&apos;s a different world, but there&apos;s still a lot of money people have to put to work and they will find a way to make it happen,&apos; says one adviser. Buyout firms are expected to switch to alternate strategies such as buying stakes rather than companies outright. Permira, for example, invested \u00a3400m in Hong Kong casino operator Galaxy Entertainment last week as it looks to cash on the Macau gambling boom. Most observers expect the buyout firms to have regrouped by spring at the latest. &apos;Within a few months they will be used to the new reality,&apos; adds another City insider. &apos;We are still seeing private equity guys looking at assets. The Southern Water sale [a deal worth \u00a34.2bn] shows they can still raise money. Leveraged buyouts will probably start again soon, probably with smaller deals involving banking syndicates as people get their confidence up. But will we get the same appetite for mega-deals in the future? Probably not.&apos; New stars: sovereign wealth funds The wane of private equity will see the rise of &apos;sovereign wealth funds&apos;, which are equally cloak-and-dagger. This new breed of investor is set to claim its highest-profile scalp yet, with the Sainsbury board expected to recommend a \u00a310.6bn takeover from a fund backed by the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) this week. Such is the power of sovereign funds that Merrill Lynch predicts the value of assets they control will quadruple to \u00a34 trillion by 2011, as Middle Eastern states, China and Russia look to diversify hoards of foreign currency. The QIA is run by Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, right, a cousin of the Emir, so if the deal wins the backing of the Sainsburys there will be intense interest in how active a role it takes in running the stores. Although such funds have been around since the Eighties, ownership of public-facing businesses, as BAA owner Ferrovial has learnt, puts them under a microscope. Last week&apos;s pre-Budget report, which ended some private equity tax breaks, was evidence of the effect a public backlash can have when opaque - and, some say, unfair - practices are pursued. It remains to be seen if protectionism comes back into vogue if another &apos;national treasure&apos; passes into foreign hands.", "tags": ["Business", "Money"], "title": "Grinding change of gear for the big deal machines", "sentences": ["There is also a bit of braggadocio between the City states with Abu Dhabi competing with Qatar and Dubai,&apos; says another City banker."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/14/money8", "publicationDate": "2007-10-14T22:46:36Z"}, {"article": "A few weeks ago the QE2, one of the world&apos;s last ocean liners, sailed into Greenock docks - a final homecoming for the 40-year-old ship, built by John Brown &amp; Co at Clydebank. Next year the retiring Cunard liner sails to Dubai where, demoted to serve as a floating hotel and casino, her mighty engines and deep hooters will be silenced. The many thousands of people who came to watch this beautiful ship, as the RAF&apos;s Red Arrows performed aerial reels above her, will surely have felt as I did - sad that the Clyde is quite unable to produce such an internationally admired work of design and engineering today. In our knowledge-based New British economy we like to believe that making nothing much beyond money, while replacing engineering works with vast, energy-gobbling Shanghai-style shopping malls, or &quot;urban regeneration projects&quot;, is somehow clever. Just days after the QE2&apos;s tumultuous arrival on the Clyde, the Association of Consultant Engineers (Ace) revealed that Britain has a shortage of 20,000 engineers, a figure likely to rise by 4,000 next year. To meet demand, Ace is calling on the Home Office to relax immigration rules so that civil, structural, environmental and building services engineers can be headhunted from around the world to do the jobs that we oh so very postmodern British snub. And yet, because we want ever more major engineering-driven projects, including the 2012 Olympics, Crossrail, new high-speed railways, and ambitious &quot;urban regeneration&quot; schemes the length and breadth of the country, we need an army, navy and airforce of engineers to realise them. Just as we require ever more cheap labour from across the world to clean our offices, sweep our streets, drive our buses, pick our cockles and generally wipe our collective bottom, now we need engineers from Poland, India, China and elsewhere to design and build the infrastructure we find increasingly hard to make for our digital selves. We think it clever for foreigners to do our dirty, and now our practical and even creative, work for us. Eventually, though, we will lose out to nations willing to shape and make things, and who still take pleasure in what we see as grubby old heavy-duty engineering. The Germans clearly enjoy making things while enjoying a high standard of living. Bavaria is bristling with knowledge-based industries, while boasting many &quot;old fashioned&quot; engineering enterprises. On its Thuringian borders, the Meiningen works of the Deutsche Bahn (German state railways) has recently built a high-pressure steam boiler for the A1 Locomotive Trust, a Darlington-based organisation currently completing the first British mainline express steam locomotive in more than 50 years. This might seem quixotic, but no British company could take on a work that will give pleasure to countless people. A nation of call-centre operatives and customer service facility managers, we look on, stupefied, as foreigners weld and rivet for us. In an age of 300kph electric trains crisscrossing the Federal Republic, the idea of making a steam locomotive boiler is something the German railway is able to take in its stride. In Finland, the land of Nokia, the Aker Yards in Helsinki, and other major cities, continue to design, engineer and construct the world&apos;s largest passenger ships, among them the Freedom of the Seas class for Royal Caribbean International. Even bigger vessels are on the drawing board. The Finns, it seems, are quietly content engineering ships that are much bigger than the QE2 while mass-producing the latest in lightweight digital mass-consumption technology. In Britain we have come to believe that we are a nation of consumers rather than producers, that life is all about borrowing unfeasible sums of money to buy the disposable gewgaws we crave. But even shopping malls and the complex infrastructure underpinning them have to be engineered by someone. Still, leave that to foreigners. We&apos;ll complain, of course, as they arrive to take on the senior jobs we increasingly refuse to do, but now that we have begun to look upon heavy-duty engineering projects in much the same way as forest tribes might have gazed, uncomprehendingly, at Roman aqueducts two thousand years ago, what else can we do? \u00b7 Jonathan Glancey is the Guardian&apos;s architecture critic jonathan.glancey@theguardian.com", "tags": [], "title": "Jonathan Glancey: Extinction of the engineers", "sentences": ["Next year the retiring Cunard liner sails to Dubai where, demoted to serve as a floating hotel and casino, her mighty engines and deep hooters will be silenced."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/15/comment.comment1", "publicationDate": "2007-10-14T23:08:59Z"}, {"article": "&quot;We&apos;ve been working on the idea of complexity for a long time,&quot; says Zaha Hadid. Not that anybody who had seen any of her buildings would doubt it, but the Phaeno Science Centre was one of the first large buildings where Hadid had the opportunity to put all that research into practice. As such, it appeared almost out of the blue. With its unfathomable geometries, its unorthodox structure and its alien otherworldly interiors, here was a building that appeared to have rewritten all the rules of architecture, a building that was operating on a different plane of complexity. But behind the shock of the new lay decades of patient, often frustrating, research and experimentation.  &quot;It was the culmination of a lot of ideas,&quot; Hadid continues. &quot;We had been looking at the idea of projection and how perspectival issues and geometry have an impact on the way you perceive space and how you are propelled through space. We had looked at land formation and landscape as a way of dealing with urban space, large public buildings. We also did a lot of work on fluid morphology and movement. I think all these things have had an impact on each other, and therefore they do create a different kind of experience.&quot;  Until recently, Hadid had more time for research than most architects. Frequently condemned as &quot;paper architecture&quot;, her designs were seen as too radical and untested to risk in the real world. Particularly in her adoptive Britain, where the fiasco over her competition- winning but ultimately unbuilt design for Cardiff Bay Opera House is seen as a missed opportunity in retrospect. Hadid has always fared better abroad, especially in Germany and Austria. More than any other building, though, Phaeno proved to the world that her unique breed of architecture really does work.  Phaeno is as grounded in practicality as any other building. Just like any other project, the starting points were the site and the programme, Hadid says. &quot;The site has the city of Wolfsburg on one side and the largest manufacturing site in Europe, which is the Volkswagen factory, on the other. It was clear to me from the beginning that one should create a building that does not break that connection. So the idea was to lift the exhibition space up and to land it on other buildings, which we called cones. These cones become the urban part of the project - restaurants and cafes and kiosks and all the entrances - and leave the exhibition space as one uninterrupted space.&quot;  Raising up Phaeno&apos;s exhibition hall on the cones helped preserve the city&apos;s pedestrian and vehicular links, and also created a new covered public plaza at street level. It also gave Hadid the freedom to create a self-contained world within the volume of the exhibition hall, which houses 250 interactive &quot;experimental stations&quot; explaining scientific principles and phenomena. It never feels like it, but it is one continuous room. Nor are there any clear views across the entire space. Instead there are diagonal views across different levels, as the space curves and banks and winds and dips. The result can only be described as an alien landscape of craters, caverns and plateaux.  The idea of raising up the exhibition hall is not new in itself, as Hadid is the first to point out, but in Phaeno it has been investigated and reinterpreted. In conventional 20th-century construction, there are structural elements, such as columns and beams, and there are elements to define space, such as walls. In Phaeno, everything is one and the same. There is no separation between the building&apos;s function, its structure or its physical, sculptural form. &quot;There is no secondary structure,&quot; Hadid says. &quot;Each piece of the building has to multi-task, if you like. So a cone has to have the right incline for an escalator or a staircase, but it also has to support the structure above. Everything has to come together, like focusing a camera.&quot;  Having dispensed with a rectilinear grid or any other conventional ordering system, each &quot;cone&quot; had to be carefully considered in terms of placement and form, in order for it to carry out its many tasks. It was a painstaking process, Hadid admits. &quot;I watched cones in front of me for, like, a year. All of these different arrangements. It was like watching the continuous erosion of rocks in front of me, in front of the computer.&quot;  Phaeno represents the cutting edge of construction technology. Its complex structure was achievable only through sophisticated computer programming, and its plastic forms were made possible by a new material known as &quot;self-compacting concrete&quot;, which lends itself to complex forms cast in situ. Hadid doesn&apos;t get carried away with the technology, though; she&apos;s more interested in the result.  &quot;You have to think about how people see it, how they&apos;ll use it, move through it, occupy it.&quot; In fact, the Phaeno&apos;s operators are still learning how to occupy it, she says. &quot;It&apos;s given them a degree of freedom because it&apos;s so fluid. Like, we provided lots of mezzanines, which are supposed to be used for exhibitions, but they discovered they were great spaces for performances. They&apos;re intimate and acoustically quite nice, so they have recitals there now.&quot;  Hadid&apos;s architecture is continuing to evolve. She puts Phaeno in the same generation as several of her other projects - the BMW Central Building, the Rosenthal Centre in Cincinnati, plus the Salerno Maritime Terminal and Maxxi: National Centre of Contemporary Arts in Rome, both of which will open next year. &quot;They were all competitions that we won within a few months of each other in 1998 and 1999,&quot; she says. &quot;So they were all the same generation, even though they&apos;re very different in terms of programme. In the last few years things have changed a lot. They&apos;ve become more fluid.&quot;  You can see what she means, looking at some of the huge array of projects her office is working on. There is plenty more Hadid to come: an opera house in Guangzhou, a skyscraper in Dubai, a university in Beirut, a train station in Innsbruck. There will even be some more of her buildings in Britain, including a new building for the Architecture Foundation and a transport museum in London, not to mention an aquatic centre for the London Olympics. &quot;We&apos;re having fun now,&quot; she says.

The stunt was an inglorious flop. Before the plane had even docked at Lahore airport, a senior police officer stepped on board and shook hands with Mr Zardari. &quot;Please come with me,&quot; he whispered into his ear. Mr Zardari, who had already served five years behind bars, meekly complied. Then a wall of brawny, tracksuit-wearing policemen surrounded the reporters on board, including this one, and started to rummage through their bags, confiscating notes and videotapes. Tomorrow Ms Bhutto will try the same trick again when she flies from Dubai to Karachi, eight years after she fled into self-imposed exile. This time, though, the outcome promises to be very different. An infectious Bhutto buzz has gripped Karachi for the first time in a decade. Giant posters of the opposition leader in her trademark white headscarf hang from every streetlamp. Buses from across the country are arriving, carrying tens of thousands of party faithful. Last night swarms of young men weaved through the dense traffic on motorbikes, waving posters and honking their horns. When Ms Bhutto lands at 1pm (0900 BST) tomorrow, her party expects 1 million people to be waiting to greet her. If they are right, she will take the entire afternoon to reach her first stop, the tomb of Pakistan&apos;s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah - a highly symbolic choice. Mr Jinnah was the secular lawyer who founded Pakistan in 1947. Now Ms Bhutto - the scion of the country&apos;s dominant political dynasty - wants to ressurect that vision and defeat the threat of violence Islamism. But her homecoming is clouded by dark compromises and immense uncertainty. The police will be protecting rather than arresting Ms Bhutto thanks to a controversial deal with President Musharraf. Due to his plummeting popularity, Gen Musharraf wants to befriend Ms Bhutto and broaden his appeal before general elections due by mid-January. And his British and American allies would like their strategic partner to maintain a democratic veneer. So to ease Ms Bhutto&apos;s return , the general recently signed an amnesty that shields her from a raft of annoying corruption charges dating back to her last term of office in 1996. Slightly embarrassed, the two sides tried to package it as &quot;national reconciliation&quot;. But nobody was fooled. The papers have been filled with vitriolic criticism. For many the thinly disguised political deal is an unpleasant reminder of the greasy-palmed 90s, when Ms Bhutto&apos;s husband was known as &quot;Mister 10%&quot; and the economy tipped towards insolvency. Ms Bhutto rejects the allegations as politically motivated, which may well be true. Corruption cases are a favoured tool of political one-upmanship in Pakistan. But it is harder for her to explain the motivations of public prosecutors in Switzerland and Spain investigating tales of backhanders, offshore accounts and several hundred million dollars - unless she accuses them of having some irrational beef with the Bhutto family. But perhaps that doesn&apos;t matter so much after all. Corruption is a secondary political issue in Pakistan. Most voters simply take it for granted - and after all, several army generals have also become inexplicably wealthy in recent years. Curiously, their good fortune comes at a time of surging US aid. What really threatens Ms Bhutto&apos;s tottering reputation is her political courtship with Gen Musharraf. Since the 1970s, when her father, Zulfikar Bhutto, was hanged by a general, opposition to military rule has been the &apos;sine qua non&apos; of her Pakistan People&apos;s party. Ms Bhutto herself was detained by a military dictator, Zia ul Haq, for many years in the 1980s, but now she is giving a second, five-year presidential pass to a sitting army general. Stung supporters feel badly betrayed. Pragmatists say that principle is a luxury anywhere, and that this is simply Pakistani politics at its most full-blooded and intriguing. Perhaps, they reason, Ms Bhutto, a seasoned pro, is simply playing her cards well. History shows that leaders as unpopular as Gen Musharraf - his approval rating was 21% in a recent poll - don&apos;t tend to last long. And much can change, quickly. The Sphinx-like supreme court is a potential spoiler for both sides. In the coming weeks it must decide on the validity of Gen Musharraf&apos;s sweeping October 6 re-election, and the legality of Ms Bhutto&apos;s amnesty. A decision against either will tip the country into a fresh crisis and, possibly bring about the imposition of martial law. The ruling party PML-Q party, which has most to lose from her return, is rubbing its hands in glee. In Washington this week, the prime minister, Shaukat, Aziz noted that there had been a &quot;strong reaction&quot; to the corruption amnesty. If Ms Bhutto won&apos;t stay away until the legal challenge is settled, he sighed, well who knows if she will face arrest in the future? And then, of course, there is the x-factor - not inconsiderable in a country where power has changed hand through military coups and mysterious plane crashes more frequently than through any democratic action. When her plane descends on Karachi tomorrow lunchtime, Ms Bhutto will undoubtedly be delighted to be finally home. The size of the crowd awaiting her will speak to the size of her popularity. But whether it will be a truly soft landing is hard to tell. As she may soon discover the ground below is bumpy, unpredictable and highly treacherous.

After her planned arrival in Karachi tomorrow afternoon she is expected to team up with her old rival Gen Musharraf in a western-backed power-sharing deal. He was elected president by an electoral college earlier this month. But his victory can only become official if his eligibility for office is approved by the Supreme Court. The nine-member court resumed hearings in Islamabad today. It&apos;s uncertain how it will rule. Ms Bhutto will need to secure a third term as prime minister after elections in January. She has been promised an amnesty from corruption charges that made her leave Pakistan in 1999. She has received assassination threats if she returns after saying that she would cooperate with the American military in tracking down Osama bin Laden. Asked about the threats, Ms Bhutto said today: &quot;Muslims know if they attack a woman they will burn in hell.&quot; The authorities in Karachi appealed to Ms Bhutto to abandon plans for a 10-mile procession through the city, saying it would leave her vulnerable. &quot;We have informed Ms Bhutto and her team of the situation and advised them to cut short the programme instead of going for a 18-20 hours long procession as this would be tantamount to inviting trouble,&quot; said Ghulam Muhammad Mohtarem, the home secretary of Sindh province, whose capital is Karachi. Ms Bhutto&apos;s Pakistan People&apos;s party (PPP) is organising rallies and convoys of supporters across Sindh. The party is predicting more than one million people.

Every week seems to bring a new management book on the topic, and everywhere, from France to Dubai to Singapore, is busy trying to create the next Silicon Valley. The funny thing is that most of these efforts are pointless - or worse. That is because, as this week&apos;s Economist notes, the most powerful thing that corporate bosses and government leaders can do to spur innovation in their companies and countries is to give people freedom: freedom to move, freedom to think, freedom to create. Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, observes that innovation in the past was dominated by elites - the &quot;wealthy gentlemen tinkerers&quot;, for example - who had privileged access to information, money and markets. He believes his firm&apos;s success owes a tremendous amount to the radically different, bottom-up culture he encountered in California: &quot;we were tremendously lucky to be at Stanford and in Silicon Valley.&quot; He is right that the history of innovation is one dominated by centralised processes and elites in ivory towers, but look closer and you find that the ordinary punter has silently played an important role. In his book A Culture of Improvement: Technology and the Western Millennium, a fine history of the topic, Robert Friedel shows in convincing detail how countless small efforts by individual bright sparks, be they low or high on society&apos;s ladder, to improve life have actually contributed to the astonishing advances that we enjoy in today&apos;s postmodern, post-industrial societies. Imagine how much better firms and countries could innovate if they actively harnessed the distributed creative potential of all those innovators-in-waiting rather than turning up their noses at them. The key, Mr Friedel observes, is freedom: &quot;Technology and the pursuit of improvement are ultimate expressions of freedom, of the capacity of humans to reject the limitations of their past and their experience, to transcend the boundaries of their biological capacities and their social traditions.&quot; To put the argument the other way round, domineering bosses and authoritarian governments may succeed for a while, and may even notch up some successes along the way. But eventually, history shows that all empresarios - be that Steve Jobs, the currently high-flying boss of Apple, or Lee Kuan Yew, the man who built modern Singapore - stagnate. Some die or are forced out, some lose the magic touch, and some, like Fidel Castro, simply hang around too long after the revolution. Tim Brown, the head of Ideo, a global design consultancy, has observed the enthusiastic efforts in Dubai, China, Singapore and elsewhere impose such top-down innovation, and he remains sceptical. &quot;You can ordain the money but not the brilliance and free-thinking,&quot; he insists. &quot;Creative people like to challenge constraints and authority - and very scared people are not very innovative.&quot; That sort of assessment mightily irritates those who argue that benevolent bureaucrats can indeed steer a society toward innovation. Kishore Mabhuhbhani, the head of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore and the country&apos;s former UN ambassador, rejects criticism of his government&apos;s approach as western arrogance and naivete. In a forthcoming book, he sets out his arguments for why Asia&apos;s rise is unstoppable, and why Singaporeans and mainland Chinese entrepreneurs and innovators are not at all bothered about the political freedom that so obsesses western commentators: &quot;businessmen are very practical, and they know the alternative political system here is chaos - so they are perfectly comfortable being free and innovative in business while accepting the reality of the political situation.&quot; This argument for state-directed capitalism was always shaky, though it must be admitted there have been times during the past few decades when its proponents could point to success stories. The east Asian success with manufacturing-oriented, export-led growth was the poster child for the &quot;Asian Way&quot;, but the fragility of that model of growth was exposed by the southeast Asian financial crisis. However, the times are changing fast, as this special report has demonstrated. Low-end manufacturing is yielding rapidly to knowledge-based industries, a transformation that is being accelerated by the twin forces of globalisation and Googlisation. In today&apos;s knowledge economy, innovation is the new currency of global competition. And as firms move toward open innovation models to stay a step ahead of disruptive innovators, so too must governments that want to keep their economies competitive in the fiercely competitive global economy. As William Weldon, chairman of Johnson &amp; Johnson, a healthcare giant, observes, &quot;Innovation is no longer about money, it&apos;s about the climate: are individuals allowed to flourish and take risks?&quot; Stuart Brand, an internet pioneer, has famously argued that &quot;information wants to be free.&quot; Then surely the knowledge worker, the creator of that information, also yearns for that same freedom? Those companies and governments that liberate the innovator inside every one of us will find that their economies will roar and the spirits of their people will soar. And best of all, they will benefit the whole world as they do so because innovation is not a zero-sum game. The rising tide of inventions that make one country wealthy benefit many others that bring those clever ideas to market or simply make use of those products, processes or services. In this new age of mass innovation, the world may even find profitable ways to deliver the 21st century&apos;s greatest needs, including affordable universal healthcare and sustainable clean energy, creating entirely new industries in the process. After all, the world will then at last be harnessing the one natural resource that the world has left in infinite quantity: human ingenuity.

The shipment was arranged by Robert Satu, the director of Solomon Islands Marine Mammal Education Centre and Exporters.

The charismatic opposition leader, who fled in 1999 under a cloud of corruption charges, is returning in the hope of becoming prime minister for a third time in general elections due by mid-January. But she must first overcome deep scepticism about a controversial alliance with her old rival, President Pervez Musharraf. Last night a boisterous mood gripped Karachi, a sprawling metropolis of 16 million people, as supporters flooded in from around the country. Giant Bhutto posters hung from street corners and young men on motorcycles zipped through traffic in the city centre, yelling and waving Bhutto flags. Party officials predict a crowd of 1 million people to greet Ms Bhutto off a commercial flight at 1pm (9am BST) today; at least 100,000 looked likely. Police sealed off side roads with shipping containers and bomb squads combed the streets following threats by a Taliban commander, Baitullah Masood, to dispatch suicide bombers to kill Ms Bhutto. More than 3,500 police officers and 5,000 supporters will patrol the route, and city schools will be closed. Ms Bhutto will move through the city atop a truck-mounted, bulletproof platform equipped with anti-bomb jamming devices. The procession will crawl towards the tomb of Pakistan&apos;s founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah - a 10-mile journey that officials said could take the entire day. In Dubai Ms Bhutto predicted her return would trigger a transition from military to civilian rule. &quot;My return heralds for the people of Pakistan the turn of the wheel from dictatorship to democracy, from exploitation to empowerment, from violence to peace,&quot; she said, flanked by her husband and two daughters. She warned that any bomber who tried to kill her would &quot;burn in hell&quot; under Islamic laws. &quot;I am very proud of what my mother is doing,&quot; said Bakhtawar, her eldest daughter. The dramatic scenes are expected to re-inject colourful populism into Pakistan&apos;s sterile political scene. But the homecoming is also tainted by long-standing graft allegations and bitter family feuds. Many supporters of Bhutto&apos;s Pakistan People&apos;s Party (PPP) are deeply unhappy about talks with Gen Musharraf. In return for her support Gen Musharraf, whose popularity is diving, signed an amnesty against corruption charges that have dogged Ms Bhutto since she left power in 1996. The Oxford-educated politician also leaves behind allegations in Spain and Switzerland, where prosecutors are investigating allegations of kickbacks involving tens of millions of dollars. In 2003 a Swiss court convicted her of money-laundering and ordered her to pay $11m to the Pakistani government. The conviction was thrown out when she contested it, but the investigation continues. Ms Bhutto has always denied any wrongdoing. Ms Bhutto&apos;s return is most bitterly opposed by some of her own relatives - the fallout from rivalries that have divided the Bhutto dynasty. &quot;I&apos;m scared for what this means for this country. It&apos;s so repulsive,&quot; said Fatima Bhutto, a 25-year-old niece. &quot;But her return doesn&apos;t upset me.&quot; Fatima, a newspaper columnist, blames Ms Bhutto for the death of her father, Murtaza, who was gunned down by police in murky circumstances in 1996. Benazir, his sister and political rival, was prime minister at the time. Impassioned and articulate, Fatima is considered a possible future rival for Ms Bhutto. But her party - a splinter of the PPP - has little support, and her Lebanese mother, Ghinwa, will contest the family seat at the next election. Benazir Bhutto will hope to answer her critics today with a convincing display of public support. She made history in 1988, becoming the world&apos;s first Muslim female leader. Now, though, her political future has become intertwined with that of Gen Musharraf. Yesterday the supreme court started hearing a legal challenge to his October 6 re-election. Gen Musharraf&apos;s bitter rival Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, the chief justice he tried to fire last spring, has excused himself from the case. Ms Bhutto also has pressing legal worries: in a few weeks the supreme court is due to start hearing a challenge to the new corruption amnesty. If the amnesty is overturned she could be faced with a fresh prosecution.

Ms Bhutto&apos;s plane safely touched down in Karachi.  Both Sky News and BBC News 24 are carrying rolling news images of her plane. Pakistani Spectator says don&apos;t believe the media hype. &quot;She has committed more than one mistake&quot; it says and lists four of them including allegation of corruption. Pakistan Uncut has a sympathetic cartoon of Ms Bhutto parachuting in. It also reports that her plane was twice delayed due security arrangements and the refusal of passengers to sit down. 10.20am Fights have broken out between Ms Bhutto&apos;s excited supporters and those trying to marshal the crowd. But the crowd scenes are mostly good natured with singing and chanting, according to BBC News 24. 10.30am &quot;It feels very good to be home,&quot; a tearful Ms Bhutto said on her arrival. 10.40am An analyst on Watandost predicts that Ms Bhutto&apos;s popularity will not be significantly dented by the proposed power sharing deal with her arch-rival General Pervez Musharraf. Nasim Zehra writes: &quot;Benazir returns to yet again benefit from the political support that this charisma accrues to her. Her dealings with the uniformed president are unlikely to be a support-loser for Benazir. Her core support will remain intact.&quot; Ms Bhutto kissed a copy of the Koran in the airport, according to Reuters. Yesterday she said that any Muslim that tried to kill her would &quot;burn in hell.&quot; Reuters reminds us of the threats she is facing. It quotes Haji Omar, a Taliban commander in Waziristan saying: &quot;She has an agreement with America. We will carry out attacks on Benazir Bhutto as we did on General Pervez Musharraf.&quot; 10.55am My colleague Mark Tran says that if you want an idea why the Bush administration is such an ardent backer of Ms Bhutto you should watch this polished address she gave back in July at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, a thinktank in London.  11.15am The prominent Pakistani blogger Glasshouse accuses Ms Bhutto of &quot;pathetic appeasement&quot; in her negotiations with General Musharraf.  Our man on Ms Bhutto&apos;s plane, Declan Walsh, managed to get a word with her on the flight from Dubai. She told him that she was determined to fight the extremists who are &quot;trying to take over my country&quot;. Here&apos;s Declan&apos;s latest story in full. Guardian Unlimited has produced a photo gallery of Ms Bhutto&apos;s return, which we will be updating throughout the day. 11.45am Dressed in patriotic green and white Ms Bhutto begins her slow procession through the crowds atop a customised shipping container.  12.10pm There is little support for Ms Bhutto on the BBC&apos;s news forum. Yousuf from London says: &quot;All she has to show for herself is her arrogance and her father&apos;s legacy of failed promises.&quot; Aftab says &quot;Allowing Benazir back into Pakistan is OK. Allowing her back with a chance of becoming PM again is both dangerous and a backward step.&quot; And Jawwad Ahmed Minhas from Islamabad says, &quot;a corrupt is always a corrupt, whether morally or financially.&quot; Zakintosh a blogger from Karachi is not convinced by Ms Bhutto either. He writes: &quot;Even if we accept that the cases against her and AZ [her husband] were politically motivated (and, no doubt many were), and she did not line her Swiss Bank Lockers with &apos;our&apos; money, what about the millions of dollars - certainly &apos;our&apos; dollars, earned at great risk by being a front-line state - spent overseas by this government in uncovering all the false accounts and real mansions and stuff? Or was that a politically motivated lie, too?&quot; 12.40pm Reports of the turnout in Karachi are differing wildly. The PPP says a million people are expected to line the streets. The police say that &quot;more than 75,000&quot; have showed up, while the news agency Reuters puts the figures at 200,000. Pakistan&apos;s The Nation newspaper says that other exiled former prime minister Mian Nawaz Sharif should now also be allowed to return.  &quot;With Ms Bhutto back in Pakistan, it should be no more possible to keep Mian Nawaz Sharif in forced exile. With elections approaching any bar on his return is bound to be widely interpreted as an exercise in match fixing.&quot; But the papers notes the superiority of Ms Bhutto&apos;s political skills. &quot;Unlike Mian Nawaz Sharif, Ms Bhutto has demonstrated better organisational skills and grassroots support, nor does she face the same level of opposition from the establishment on her return. This is due to an overall understanding reached with the power brokers at home and in the international arena.&quot; 1pm The Economist applauds the PPPs preparation in Karachi.  It says: &quot;Miss Bhutto&apos;s reception in Karachi--the capital of her native Sindh province--was a crucial first test of her popularity. Its organisers did their work well: if there is no such thing as a free crowd in Pakistani politics, the one in Karachi was unusually pricey. For over a week thousands of billboards along the 16km (10 mile) route that Miss Bhutto&apos;s &quot;caravan of democracy&quot; was to take had been rented by PPP supporters to advertise the event. &quot;Welcome homeland Benazir!&quot; was a poem emblazoned on one of them.&quot; 1.40pm The crowds are chanting &quot;prime minister Bhutto&quot;, according Associated Press. Her comeback procession is making slow progress on its way to the tomb of Pakistan&apos;s founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, where Ms Bhutto is due to address a rally. 1.45pm A blog post on Proliferation Press is uneasy about the BBC&apos;s coverage of Ms Bhutto&apos;s return. &quot;Where are the questions about the past failure of parliamentary politics in Pakistan?&quot; it asks. 2.35pm Teeth Maestro on Metroblogs Karachi has a question. &quot;Considering all the negativity surrounding her reeling and dealing with the King Musharraf, and now when we all observe this tremendous welcome being accorded to her on the streets of Karachi, one does have to wonder is this truly what the people want?&quot; he/she writes. Sid on the same site reckons: &quot;The people that can be seen waiting to welcome BB all over Shahrah e Faisal are political workers that have gathered from all over the country. The Internet edition of the Pakistan&apos;s the Dawn points out that BB is not making full use of the safety features on her Bhutto mobile. &quot;She rode atop a specially modified lorry but chose to stand in front of bullet-proof screens specially fitted for her safety to wave to her supporter.&quot; 3.10pm On Comment is Free Adrian Levy argues that behind all the hoopla of BB&apos;s return lies a cynical political fix.  But Amardeep on Sepia Mutiny is trying to remain hopeful. 4pm Glasshouse dismisses Ms Bhutto&apos;s &quot;selfish antics&quot; but he adds if her arrival can &quot;destabilise Musharraf and his corrupt, power-obsessed cronies I am all for it.&quot; 4.15pm Ms Bhutto&apos;s procession is still crawling its way to Jinnah&apos;s tomb. With impeccable timing a Swiss judge says he now finished a long-running investigation in money laundering charges against Ms Bhutto. His findings will be handed over to a chief prosecutor next week, according to Business Recorder. 4.45pm Ms Bhutto&apos;s unfettered homecoming is proof of Gen Musharraf&apos;s commitment to freedom of expression, his information minister Muhammad Ali Durrani claimed, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan. 4.55pm We may not have heard BB&apos;s speech yet, but she gives a foretaste of the kind of thing she might say in an article for the Boston Globe. In it she writes: &quot;The forces of moderation and democracy must, and will, prevail against extremism and dictatorship. I will not be intimidated. I will step out on the tarmac in Karachi not to complete a journey, but to begin one. Despite threats of death, I will not acquiesce to tyranny, but rather lead the fight against it.&quot;", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "Benazir Bhutto"], "title": "Benazir Bhutto is Back in Pakistan", "sentences": ["Our man on Ms Bhutto&apos;s plane, Declan Walsh, managed to get a word with her on the flight from Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2007/oct/18/benzirbhuttosreturn", "publicationDate": "2007-10-18T08:44:00Z"}, {"article": "Bolton Wanderers will look into the availability of Paul Jewell and Chris Coleman - who is managing Real Sociedad in the Spanish second division - after Sammy Lee&apos;s dismal reign as manager was brought to an unceremonious close yesterday. Lee was sacked after the Bolton chairman, Phil Gartside, consulted the players and discovered that Sam Allardyce&apos;s successor was so unpopular that the dressing room was approaching mutiny. The list of possible replacements also includes David O&apos;Leary, who is out of work since being sacked by Aston Villa in July 2006 and has asked his representatives to inform Bolton of his interest, as well as Aidy Boothroyd of Watford and Peter Reid, who lives in Bolton, did well enough at first with Manchester City and Sunderland but has not managed since leaving Coventry in 2005. Jewell would be the most popular choice with the club&apos;s supporters, having led Wigan Athletic to the Premier League for the first time in their history and kept them in the top division for two years before resigning at the end of last season. He is keen to return to management and is said to be open-minded about what Bolton might have to offer. Lee was summoned to a meeting with Gartside yesterday and paid the ultimate price of player-power after winning only one game in 171 days in charge, a period that has included a near-complete breakdown in his relationship with a group of influential players led by Gary Speed, the captain Kevin Nolan, Stelios Giannakopoulos, Ivan Campo and El-Hadji Diouf. Relations have been so strained that one player allegedly belittled Lee in front of the squad by telling him his opinion was worthless. There have been stand-up rows and Speed relinquished his duties as first-team coach last week after a series of arguments led to him being axed from the squad. Nolan was also dropped from Lee&apos;s final game, a 1-0 home defeat by Chelsea. It is said Jussi Jaaskelainen has declined to sign a new contract partly because of Lee&apos;s presence as manager and on another occasion the senior players declined to do post-match interviews after a defeat at Birmingham as they would have been asked to express their backing for Lee. Gartside reported back to the club&apos;s owner, Eddie Davies, and they announced in a brief statement it was a &quot;difficult decision for all parties but we have agreed the time is right&quot;. Lee will be remembered as one of the more calamitous managers since the formation of the Premier League. Previously one of Allardyce&apos;s coaches, he has been increasingly flustered in interviews and people dealing with him have noted how sensitive he is to criticism. It is thought he had begun to regard Speed in particular as a threat despite appointing the 38-year-old as one of his coaches on his first day in the job. Speed is now among the outside bets to replace him. Lee is unlikely to work as a top-flight manager again and his failures will be of embarrassment to Gartside bearing in mind his claims back in April about the new manager having better credentials than the last one. Six months on Bolton are last but one in the league and Lee has changed virtually the entire backroom staff that was responsible for much of Allardyce&apos;s success. Over two seasons Lee lasted a total of 11 games. &quot;Our efforts will now be to look for a replacement manager and to concentrate on the future,&quot; Gartside said, but he may have to act quickly if he is serious about Jewell - the former Wigan manager is due to leave today for a holiday in Dubai. \u00b7 This article was amended on Tuesday October 23 2007.

Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP As Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan&apos;s twice former and now would-be prime minister lands in Pakistan, a country from which she has been exiled for eight years, expect anything - apart from democracy. Although nothing is ever actually certain in Pakistan until it happens, her return has been preconditioned by the terms of an extraordinary pact, struck with the country&apos;s new President Pervez Musharraf, one that will set the tone for the next five years in a country straddling some of the most incendiary ethnic and religious fault lines in the world. The crowds have been marshalled to line the way from Karachi airport, jubilant and curious at the return of the scion of the Bhutto dynasty. However, behind the hoopla lies a deal that represents the culmination of four years of back-channel meetings in Washington, London, Islamabad and Dubai, one that might quickly transform joy into frustration and anger. The wrangling began in July 2006, when US assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher called on Bhutto with a message. &quot;Things are about to change,&quot; Bhutto recalled Boucher telling her, cryptically. He then urged her to reach out to Pakistan&apos;s dictator General Pervez Musharraf and to discourage her Pakistan People&apos;s Party supporters from destabilising the country, which was already pitching and yawing in its tribal belt, where a hotch-potch of jihadists, Taliban and al-Qaida surrogates were on the rampage. Boucher&apos;s intervention culminated in September 2006 in a first direct contact, in Dubai, between two of Bhutto&apos;s aides and two of Musharraf&apos;s: Tariq Aziz, Pakistan&apos;s national security adviser, and General Pervez Kiani, the director general of the Inter Services Intelligence directorate, (now Pakistan&apos;s new military chief). General Kiani, who had once been Bhutto&apos;s deputy military secretary, advised her that the major sticking point was Musharraf&apos;s pride. He had served as Bhutto&apos;s director general of military operations in 1993 and proposed Pakistan invade Indian-occupied Kashmir (a plan he would reheat as the disastrous Kargil war in 1999), only to have the idea laughed out of the cabinet office, leaving Musharraf smarting. He would exact his revenge. Bhutto left Pakistan in April 1999 for a US speaking tour, taking only two weeks of clothes in her suitcase while her maids kept the cut flowers fresh at Bilawal House, her villa in Karachi. However, as soon as she was aboard the plane, she was barred from returning, her husband jailed, both of them facing a welter of criminal charges, a move that was confirmed by Musharraf when he took control of Pakistan in a coup that October. For the next five years, Bhutto would direct her party&apos;s affairs down a phone line from Dubai. &quot;I lived in my own little parallel society, islands of friends and colleagues from Pakistan,&quot; Bhutto reflected. The deal-making continued in earnest in early 2007, propelled by Musharraf&apos;s weakening position. Aziz and General Kiani returned to see Bhutto again in March with a dangerous proposal. If she stayed away from Pakistan during the general election, Musharraf would &quot;adjust the vote&quot; to favour her party. He was offering to rig the election. Bhutto refused. Instead, she penned 36 demands, including the freeing of all political workers and a transparent election, but also indemnity from all personal criminal actions, as well as a change to the law preventing anyone from serving as prime minister for three terms. By the end of September, with her conditions met, Bhutto was presented with Musharraf&apos;s terms. If she won the election, she would agree to support him as a civilian president for his full five-year term and cede all responsibility for foreign affairs, internal and external security, the country&apos;s WMD programme and its armed services to him. Given that the opaque military also fixed its budget, that left Bhutto&apos;s prospective new government with a paltry number of low-octane domestic portfolios that revolved around the gritty municipal functions of government (including education and health). All very worthy, but not where power in Pakistan lies. For the increasingly difficult-to-read Pakistan military, this deal, which Bhutto&apos;s return today highlights, spells salvation, continuity and prosperity. Since Musharraf came to power in 1999, the armed services have acquired spectacular wealth, investing in everything from the asphalt people drive on, to the petrol they put in their tanks. They also control the equivalent to 12% of the total landmass of Pakistan, of which only 70,000 acres is set aside for military facilities. The other 12m acres have been turned into private farmland and individual estates for Musharraf&apos;s key generals, making them millionaires. Musharraf, too. Although he officially lives for free in Army House, in Rawalpindi, on a salary of $1,400 a month, he has somehow acquired a real-estate portfolio worth $10m. For Bhutto, the deal represents one last shot at getting it right after her two previous administrations were mired in scandal. In December 1988, when she was first ratified as prime minister, she recalled entering the prime minister&apos;s secretariat: &quot;There were no pens, pencils, not even a sheet of paper. I had only one staff officer. How was I supposed to run a country? I rang up the generals and asked why I had no official files. &apos;The President asked for all files to be sent to him,&apos; an officer said.&quot; She recalled: &quot;I had been throttled.&quot; However, Bhutto is going to struggle to do better with the terms of this latest deal, which appears to have handed the stationary to the President even before her plane leaves for Pakistan. For the George W Bush administration, this cobbled-together arrangement of unequal powers is a half-hearted compromise. Mindful of the venal excesses of the 10 years in which Pakistan was a democracy, the Americans have bypassed the protracted business of attempting create a viable democracy altogether. Instead, and much against the advice of State Department old hands, Bush continues to back a tolerable military figurehead, tethered to a firm military base, legitimised by an underpowered (and therefore impotent) civilian leader. The only problem in all this is the increasingly alienated and angry Pakistani people, who asked for none of these things, only demanding the right to choose their own fate, away from the managed democracies imposed on them by the west and the grand old feudal parties that have governed Pakistan for so long. For these vast, pooling, disaffected crowds, who are also increasingly blaming the west for their fate, there is always one door that remains open - that of the jihadist.", "tags": ["Benazir Bhutto", "Pakistan", "George Bush", "Al-Qaida", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "US politics"], "title": "Karachi charade", "sentences": ["However, behind the hoopla lies a deal that represents the culmination of four years of back-channel meetings in Washington, London, Islamabad and Dubai, one that might quickly transform joy into frustration and anger.", "Boucher&apos;s intervention culminated in September 2006 in a first direct contact, in Dubai, between two of Bhutto&apos;s aides and two of Musharraf&apos;s: Tariq Aziz, Pakistan&apos;s national security adviser, and General Pervez Kiani, the director general of the Inter Services Intelligence directorate, (now Pakistan&apos;s new military chief).", "For the next five years, Bhutto would direct her party&apos;s affairs down a phone line from Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/18/karachicharade", "publicationDate": "2007-10-18T11:00:00Z"}, {"article": "Pakistan&apos;s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, today vowed to save the country from extremism as she returned to launch her political comeback after eight years of self-imposed exile.

The terrorists are trying to take over my country, and we have to stop them.&quot; Celebrations of Ms Bhutto&apos;s return began on the plane. Members of her Pakistan People&apos;s party (PPP) waved the party flag and clapped and cheered as the plane&apos;s wheels hit the runway. As a tearful Ms Bhutto stepped from the aircraft, she said she was &quot;very excited, very happy, very proud&quot; and felt a &quot;tremendous sense of responsibility because there are so many people at the airport&quot;. She later climbed onto the roof of a truck to begin a triumphant procession through Karachi, Pakistan&apos;s largest city. Squeezed between PPP officials at the front of the truck rather than in the bulletproof cubicle towards the back, she waved to thousands of ecstatic supporters. Hundreds of buses and other vehicles carrying billboards welcoming her back were parked along the streets leading to the city centre. A huge red, green and black PPP flag hung from a block of flats overlooking the route. Supporters - including representatives of Pakistan&apos;s minority Christian and Hindu communities and Baluch tribesmen with flowing white turbans - walked towards the airport, while groups of men performed traditional dances. Amid intense security following assassination threats, Ms Bhutto returned to contest elections that could return her to a central role at a time when Pakistan is facing tough challenges. Azad Bhatti, a 35-year-old poultry farmer from the southern city of Hyderabad, said he had &quot;blind faith&quot; in Ms Bhutto&apos;s leadership. &quot;When Benazir Bhutto is in power, there is no bomb blast because she provides jobs, and there is no frustration among the people,&quot; he told the Associated Press. &quot;Whatever she thinks is for the betterment of the people.&quot; Last night, an elated mood gripped Karachi as Bhutto supporters flooded in from around the country. Police sealed off sideroads with shipping containers, and bomb squads combed the streets after threats by Baitullah Masood, a Taliban commander, to send suicide bombers to kill Ms Bhutto.

However, she must first overcome deep scepticism about a controversial alliance with her old rival, President Pervez Musharraf. In return for her support, General Musharraf, whose popularity is falling, signed an amnesty against the corruption charges. There are also allegations against the Oxford-educated politician in Spain and Switzerland, where prosecutors are investigating allegations of kickbacks involving tens of millions of dollars. In 2003, a Swiss court convicted her of money laundering and ordered her to pay $11m (\u00a35m) to the Pakistani government. The conviction was thrown out when she contested it. A Swiss judge today said he had completed a long-running investigation into alleged money laundering by Ms Bhutto and her husband, Reuters reported. Judge Vincent Fournier said he would hand over his confidential findings to the Geneva chief prosecutor, Daniel Zappelli, next week. Ms Bhutto has denied any wrongdoing. In the next few weeks, the supreme court is due to begin hearing a challenge to the new corruption amnesty. If the amnesty is overturned, Ms Bhutto could face a fresh prosecution. Yesterday, the court began hearing a legal challenge to Gen Musharraf&apos;s re-election on October 6. His bitter rival Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, the chief justice he attempted to sack last spring, has excused himself from the case.", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "Benazir Bhutto", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Bhutto returns to rapturous welcome in Pakistan", "sentences": ["Speaking before leaving Dubai, Ms Bhutto predicted that her return would trigger a transition from military to civilian rule."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/18/pakistan.benazirbhutto1", "publicationDate": "2007-10-18T14:43:29Z"}, {"article": "Two apparent suicide bombers struck a truck carrying Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto through Karachi late on Thursday, killing at least 80 people. Ms Bhutto escaped unhurt and the procession carrying her through Karachi, which had been attended by tens of thousands of supporters, was abandoned in the chaos. Hours earlier Ms Bhutto had flown into Karachi from Dubai, ending eight years of self-imposed exile. In the week before her return Baitullah Masood, a Taliban commander from the tribal belt, vowed to send suicide bombers to kill her. Witnesses said that two explosions occurred in quick succession near the truck carrying Ms Bhutto and party leaders as it passed through the massive crowd. The blast was heard several miles away. Party official Qasim Zia told Dawn news that Ms Bhutto was using a toilet inside the bus when the explosion occurred.  Dr Ejaz Ahmed, a police surgeon, said that 80 dead had been brought to three hospitals in Karachi. Many of the dead were thought to be party security officials and policeman accompanying the convoy, which started moving through Karachi eight hours earlier. A cameraman with a local television station also died, Geo News said. Local television showed graphic images of mutilated bodies lying on a street littered with charred debris and pieces of flesh. A blazing police vehicle stood beside the deserted Bhutto truck. The pictures showed a distressed man kneeled over a motionless body, desperately trying to revive the man. Bloodied victims were rushed to local hospitals. Several female party leaders including information secretary Sherry Rehman and parliamentarian Abida Hussain were seen being hoisted the bus. On Sunday Ms Bhutto said she feared extremists within the country&apos;s military establishment more than Taliban commanders like Baitullah Masood. Earlier yesterday she repeated those fears. &quot;Of course this is not the same Pakistan it was in 1996 when my government was overthrown. The militants have risen in power. But I know who these people are, I know the forces behind them, and I have written to General Musharraf about this,&quot; she told the Guardian. &quot;They&apos;ve got some covert support from sympathisers within the system.

Behind her was the plane from Dubai, the desert metropolis where she has spent much of the past eight years, battling to retain relevancy and waiting for this moment. Ahead was Pakistan, the fragile, nuclear-armed country she had once run, and hoped to do so again. Call it a personality cult, feudal politics or genuine democracy, but overwhelming street power is the potent calling card of Ms Bhutto&apos;s Pakistan People&apos;s Party. It also proved to be a point of vulnerability. A sea of supporters washed up against the fortified bus carrying Ms Bhutto as it crawled through Karachi. Adolescents waved from tree branches; men danced, jigged and screamed, craning for a glimpse of their leader with the adulation of boy band fans; leather-faced &quot;aunties&quot; - elderly women supporters - battled to hold on to the buses, which throbbed with disco music. &quot;Long live Bhutto!&quot; they chanted, flinging petals into her path. &quot;Benazir for prime minister!&quot; Ms Bhutto watched from the bus rooftop, jammed between party bigwigs in a green shalwar kameez. She smiled, waved and, in a nod to modern addictions, checked her email on her Blackberry. &quot;It&apos;s really overwhelming,&quot; Ms Bhutto told the Guardian, looking over the sea of supporters. &quot;And we haven&apos;t even reached the main crowd yet.&quot; Acknowledging that it was &quot;not the same Pakistan&quot; she had left, she said: &quot;The militants have risen in power. But I know who these people are, I know the forces behind them, and I have written to General Musharraf about this.&quot; The size of the crowd was impossible to gauge. News wires quoted a government official who said 150,000; Ms Bhutto claimed 3 million. The clear truth, though, was that her party machine remains intact. &quot;Benazir&apos;s programme is for the poor. We are just waiting for jobs,&quot; said Mansoor Ali Abro, an unemployed 24-year-old labourer who had driven 12 hours from a village in interior Sindh with 1,500 others. &quot;Criminal man is powerful. Poor man is on the ground,&quot; said his neighbour, Mashuk Ali. &quot;I love Benazir.&quot; The journey started in Dubai, where Ms Bhutto bid goodbye to her husband, Asif Zardari - who used to be known as Mr Ten Per Cent and has also faced corruption charges - and two daughters. During her years of exile the local government was always keen not to publicise Ms Bhutto&apos;s politics. Yesterday it was easy to imagine why. Bhutto supporters whooped and yahooed amid the airport&apos;s brand name shops and plastic palm trees. On the flight, as a boisterous Bhutto rally erupted in economy class, flight attendants looked on helplessly. Ms Bhutto has excited such emotions and expectations before, only to allow them to evaporate in bitter disappointment. Crowds lined the streets in 1986 when she returned from exile in London. But when her second government foundered 10 years later amid scandal and corruption, few were weeping. This time it will be different, she promised. &quot;I have gained a lot of experience. I&apos;m older now, and wiser I hope.&quot; Time will tell. For now her fate is tied with that of the president, Pervez Musharraf, who reportedly spent the morning at his army offices in Rawalpindi. Did she think he was watching on TV? &quot;You must ask him,&quot; said Ms Bhutto. &quot;But I am glad there&apos;s been no disruption of my welcome. This is a good sign of reconciliation.&quot; For critics the &quot;reconciliation&quot; is little more than a greasy political deal. Gen Musharraf wants to keep power despite plunging ratings and Ms Bhutto offers a solution. Many of those critics are within her ranks, and she will spend the coming weeks quietly convincing them.

Ms Bhutto escaped unhurt and was evacuated to her residence in the city. A procession that had attracted several hundred thousand supporters was abandoned in chaos. The opposition leader had flown into Karachi hours earlier, ending eight years of self-imposed exile in Dubai and London. Two weeks ago, Baitullah Masood, a Taliban commander, vowed to send suicide bombers to kill her. Last night&apos;s attack, one the deadliest in the country&apos;s history, is likely to deepen the ongoing political crisis against the backdrop of a surge in Islamist violence. Local television stations captured the two blasts, which occurred in quick succession near a heavily protected truck carrying Ms Bhutto and her party leaders through the throng. Television footage showed onlookers running towards the vehicle after the first blast, only to be caught in the second explosion. Party official Qasim Zia said Ms Bhutto had descended into the vehicle to use the bathroom at the time of the explosion. TV stations showed graphic images of mutilated bodies lying on a street littered with debris, body parts and lumps of charred flesh. A blazing police vehicle stood beside the deserted Bhutto truck, which was emblazoned with the slogan &quot;Long Live Bhutto&quot;. &quot;People were shouting for help but there was no one to help them out. It smelled like blood and smoke,&quot; said Associated Press photographer B K Bangash, who was 50 metres from the explosion. The government had mounted a huge security operation to protect Ms Bhutto, who was travelling to the tomb of Pakistan&apos;s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah, where she planned to give a speech. About 20,000 security personnel lined the route and sophisticated anti-bomb jamming devices were fitted to her vehicle. Mobile phone signals were blocked in the area and armed bodyguards accompanied her truck. The rooftop had been fitted with a bullet-proof enclosure but she spent most of the day standing at the front, chatting to party officials and waving at wellwishers. Many of the dead were thought to be police and party security officials who had formed a moving security cordon around the vehicle. A local television cameraman also died. Ms Bhutto&apos;s information secretary, Sherry Rehman, and Punjab parliamentarian Abida Hussain were seen being hoisted away by officials. Government security officials met in Islamabad last night to discuss further measures to protect Ms Bhutto, who had planned to hold a rally in her home town, Larkana, this weekend. The Taliban had threatened to kill Ms Bhutto after she suggested that she would help American troops hunt for Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaida fugitives inside Pakistan. &quot;She has an agreement with America. We will carry out attacks on Benazir Bhutto as we did on General Pervez Musharraf,&quot; Taliban commander Haji Omar said yesterday. Intelligence reports suggested at least three groups with al-Qaida or Taliban links were plotting suicide attacks, according to a provincial official quoted by Reuters. Ms Bhutto returned from exile hoping to win a third term as prime minister at general elections due by mid-January. With encouragement from the US she has been holding power-sharing talks with Gen Musharraf. Speaking from Dubai, her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, implied that members of the Pakistani security services, the ISI, were responsible. &quot;I blame government for these blasts,&quot; he told Aryone World Television. &quot;It is the work of the intelligence agencies.&quot; David Miliband, the British foreign secretary, who is attending the EU summit in Lisbon, said: &quot;I condemn utterly the use of violence against entirely innocent people and the attempt to suppress the right of Pakistanis to express their democratic voice. I share the shock of the Pakistani community in the United Kingdom at these horrific attacks. And I commit the government of the United Kingdom to work with all those committed to building a peaceful and democratic Pakistan.&quot; The US government also condemned the attack. &quot;Extremists will not be allowed to stop Pakistanis from selecting their representatives through an open and democratic process,&quot; said White House security spokesman Gordon Johndroe. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon was &quot;shocked&quot; by the blast. His office said in a statement: &quot;The secretary general strongly condemns this terrorist attack and expresses condolences to the families of the victims. He trusts that all political forces will act together to strengthen national unity.&quot; There was no immediate comment from Gen Musharraf but the deputy information minister, Tariq Azim Khan, said Ms Bhutto had disregarded warnings to delay her return. &quot;She was given friendly advice she should delay her return. Obviously that she did not take it,&quot; he said. Asked what extra measures the government could possibly have taken given the size of the crowd, he said: &quot;There can never be 100% foolproof security, but you can provide extra efforts. We tried to make the maximum effort possible.&quot; The attack will be seen as a wider assault on the political system in Pakistan. Violent extremists have gathered force in Pakistan this year. An eight-day siege of the extremist Red Mosque in Islamabad in July left more than 100 people dead. After arriving home, Ms Bhutto said she would help the country of 160 million people to defeat extremism. &quot;That&apos;s not the real image of Pakistan. The people that you see outside are the real image of Pakistan. These are the decent and hardworking middle-classes and working classes of Pakistan who want to be empowered so they can build a moderate, modern nation,&quot; she said. Now the violence may endanger her power-sharing talks with Gen Musharraf, who has threatened to impose emergency rule or martial law if his plans to retain power are frustrated. Before returning to Pakistan, Ms Bhutto told the Guardian she feared that retired military officials from the country&apos;s powerful military establishment were plotting her assassination. Taliban commanders were &quot;just pawns&quot;, she said. &quot;It is those forces behind [them] that have presided over the rise of extremism and militancy in my country.&quot; Hours before the attack, she reiterated those concerns. &quot;I know who these people are, I know the forces behind them, and I have written to Gen Musharraf about this,&quot; she said as she looked out over a sea of supporters. &quot;They&apos;ve got some covert support from sympathisers within the system.

The Max Mara art prize, about to be awarded for the second time, showcases the talents of British women artists. This weekend The Observer can reveal the five artists now in contention for the chance to spend six months working in Italy before the art produced by the winner is shown in London and acquired by the prestigious Collezione Maramotti. The winner of the prize, which is funded by the fashion label Max Mara, will be announced early in December. The shortlist includes film-makers, sculptors, an animator and an artist who works with sound. Each is at the &apos;emerging&apos; stage of her career. The only painter on the shortlist is Georgie Hopton, 40, a graduate of St Martin&apos;s School of Art in London, who also uses sculpture and photography. Her work includes portraits of herself with flowers and fruit she grows herself. Yasmeen Al Awadi, 29, is a film-maker who makes urban life a pivotal part of her theme. Of Arab and British parentage, she has focused on migrant workers in Kuwait and Dubai in her recent work. The youngest nominee is 28-year-old Hannah Rickards, a conceptual artist who has used recordings of birdsong, her own voice and storms to explore nature and artifice. The second film-maker on the list is Melanie Jackson, 39, who combines animation, video and sculpture. The fifth nominee is Lisa Peachey, 34, a multimedia artist interested in the mythologies of image-making. In a recent work she is seen whittling Concorde from a piece of chalk. The prize is run in collaboration with the Whitechapel Gallery in east London and the shortlist has been drawn up by a panel of female experts in the field, led by the gallery&apos;s director, Iwona Blazwick. Helping Blazwick to decide were the gallery&apos;s owner, Cornelia Grassi; the collector Judith Greer; the writer and critic Rachel Withers; and the Turner Prize-nominated artist Cornelia Parker, best known for her exploding shed, entitled Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View &apos;The prize is very important for a number of reasons. It comes at a crucial point in an artist&apos;s career because it is not an award for a body of work,&apos; said Blazwick. &apos;Time is our most important commodity and this prize buys both time and distance. &apos;The residency in Italy is a way to move outside normal routines and, unusually, there is an imperative at the end of it because we ask the artist to make a work of art from their experience.&apos; The winner will spend half their time in Rome and half in an artistic retreat at the Pistoletto Foundation in Biella, north of Turin. Women artists, Blazwick believes, need places to work and ways of publicising their art. Only two women, Gillian Wearing and Rachel Whiteread, have won the Turner Prize in 20 years and the Turner shortlist is often all male. &apos;Things are immeasurably better than they were 20 years ago,&apos; said Blazwick. &apos;But women artists face all sorts of different issues. Childcare may be difficult, and so can being available to travel, as artists have to do nowadays. Getting studio space that is safe to use late at night can also be difficult and it is hard to be recognised by an art market which is largely macho.&apos; Georgie Hopton says she and her partner, former Turner nominee Gary Hume, spend part of the year working together in America&apos;s Catskill mountains. &apos;A lot of my work comes out of a desire to use myself as a tool, not just rely on the tools of the trade. Sometimes I want to liberate myself from these tools.&apos; Hopton regularly appears in her pictures and often dresses in character. &apos;I sometimes interact with the things around me and I find I relate to the characters of Harlequin and Pierrot in particular.&apos; The appeal of working in Italy was half the lure of the prize, said Hopton, who loves the culture and cuisine of the country. &apos;It was very unexpected to be shortlisted,&apos; said Yasmeen Al Awadi. &apos;The idea of working in two different locations in Italy is personally interesting because my work has been about cities and how people react when they fall between the cracks of an urban structure.&apos; The prize&apos;s first winner was Yorkshire-based film-maker Margaret Salmon.", "tags": ["UK news", "Art", "Culture"], "title": "Five women vie to be the next Emin", "sentences": ["Of Arab and British parentage, she has focused on migrant workers in Kuwait and Dubai in her recent work."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/21/artnews.art", "publicationDate": "2007-10-20T23:14:57Z"}, {"article": "Even her supporters call it &apos;blind faith&apos;. In a Karachi mortuary last week it was a faith articulated by Rustam, a poor Sindhi farmer, who choked back tears as he searched for the body of his slain brother. &apos;If we have to, I will sacrifice 10 more brothers,&apos; he said. Last week the growing political cult of Benazir Bhutto was cemented in the most terrible way, amid bomb blasts and bloodshed, during a rapturous return to Pakistan, the country from which she was exiled. Suddenly a persecution which seemed soft and unshaped during her years of exile has been given a hard edge by events. &apos;What I really need to ask myself,&apos; Bhutto told the BBC in the wake of the explosion which killed 138 of her supporters, &apos;is, do I give up, do I let the militants determine the agenda?&apos; She has decided to fight the parliamentary elections due in mid-January. It is a long way from the Benazir Bhutto in exile in Dubai. It was 2005, six years after she fled Pakistan, clouded by corruption charges. She was stranded in the desert metropolis in a large suburban house decorated with Arabic furniture and European paintings. Life was bearable, she said. She spent time with her teenage children. She travelled to Europe and the United States to give talks. She was kept busy holding her Pakistan People&apos;s Party (PPP) together by email and phone. &apos;I&apos;m being persecuted because I stand for democracy,&apos; she sighed then. &apos;We want internal change to come peacefully and politically. I don&apos;t think that is always appreciated by General [Pervez] Musharraf.&apos; She wanted to come home. Last week Bhutto touched down at Karachi airport on a commercial flight from Dubai, surrounded by ballyhooing supporters and a frenzied media. Ten hours later a spectacular suicide fireball nearly wiped out her party leadership and plunged the fragile nation into a fresh crisis. Out of that fireball a defiant new Bhutto was born. She has put on ice plans to go to Larkana, a town 150 miles north-east of Karachi, to pray at the tomb of her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan&apos;s first popularly elected Prime Minister, who was executed after a military coup three decades ago. Late yesterday police announced they had arrested three people in connection with a vehicle from which a grenade was thrown at Bhutto&apos;s convoy just before the suicide bombing. The men were picked up in southern Punjab, a hotbed of Islamist militancy. Police released a photograph of the severed head of the suspected bomber - an unshaven man in his 20s with curly hair and green eyes - and scanned a database of national identity cards for clues. Newspapers warned of dark days ahead. If anyone doubted the danger posed by religious extremists, an editorial in The News declared, &apos;then perhaps their eyes will open now.&apos; Last week&apos;s carnage dramatically opens a new chapter in the extraordinary career of Pakistan&apos;s greatest political survivor. Thirty years ago Bhutto, a 24-year-old university graduate, was thrust into the fray after her father was overthrown by a power-hungry military general, Zia ul-Haq. Two years later her father was hanged and Benazir spent another four in detention or jail. She suffered from dysentery, malaria, boils and sores during a stay in baking-hot Sukkur jail, according to her memoirs, Daughter of the East. When her hair started to fall out, she dreamed of eating steak and mushrooms in Oxford or peppermint-stick ice-cream from America. Now Bhutto is pressing for a third term as Prime Minister, most likely through a deal with another khaki-clad ruler, Musharraf. America and Britain are quietly egging them on. If the triumphant procession through Karachi demonstrated one thing, it is that the Bhutto political magic has not been extinguished. Ecstatic supporters clogged the streets and hung from trees to get a glimpse of their newly returned leader - a stark contrast with the rent-a-crowd rallies for Musharraf, where dour-faced supporters are excited only by the prospect of a free meal. As the throng pressed against her truck-mounted platform - emblazoned with pictures of herself and her father - dozens of young followers wearing white T-shirts formed a human chain around the vehicle, vigorously shoving the crowd from their path. A bulletproof platform had been erected on the roof. But Bhutto ignored it, squeezing between party bigwigs at the front of the platform. &apos;This is the moderate middle that doesn&apos;t want extremism,&apos; she told The Observer, gesturing to the heaving throng. &apos;They want peace so there can be security and the government can address issues like education and employment. &apos;The militants have risen in power. But I know who these people are, I know the forces behind them, and I have written to General Musharraf about this.&apos; The attack came around midnight, ripping limbs from bodies and flinging charred bodies across the road. Bhutto missed it because she had gone downstairs 10 minutes earlier, complaining of swollen feet. Pictures taken as she emerged, with security guards frantically pushing her into a bulletproof police van, show her eyes glinting with fear. &apos;There was blood and gore all over our clothes and the streets were littered with dead bodies,&apos; she said. The brunt of the blast was borne by a police van and her security guards. At least 50 were killed &apos;We owe our lives to those boys,&apos; she said. A deal with President Musharraf now looks more likely. She brings popularity. He provides a known quantity within the military that Bhutto feels she can deal with. But sinister forces may have other ideas. A Taliban commander who had threatened to kill her denies any involvement, but someone is out to get her. The next stop for Bhutto is to address the faithful in her hometown, Larkana. A peaceful meeting will give her the confidence she needs to continue to Punjab, Pakistan&apos;s most populous and politically significant province. But if the bombers strike again, the days of traditional politics in Pakistan may well be over. Pakistan: the key questions Who tried to killed Benazir Bhutto? The finger of blame has been pointed at various people by Bhutto, her husband Asif Ali Zardari and supporters. What is clear is that before her return two militant leaders - accusing her of being a &apos;slave of the US&apos; - had threatened to kill her. Her husband blames those associated with the Musharraf government, while Bhutto has suggested associates of former president General Zia-ul-Haq, who hanged her father, were involved. What are the long-term implications? The most important is that state institutions, such as the army and intelligence services - whether they were involved or not - are unaccountable, underlining the fragility of the political system. It also emphasises the problems Pakistan has with Islamist militants, which it has failed to control. What does it mean for Bhutto? Despite the attack, her return showed she was the most popular Pakistani politician. The attack might further cement her position and further polarise politics. Or it might throw Musharraf and Bhutto together in the fight against extremism.", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Bhutto defiant as bombing suspects held by police", "sentences": ["It is a long way from the Benazir Bhutto in exile in Dubai.", "Last week Bhutto touched down at Karachi airport on a commercial flight from Dubai, surrounded by ballyhooing supporters and a frenzied media."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/21/pakistan.declanwalsh", "publicationDate": "2007-10-20T23:57:46Z"}, {"article": "I heard a presenter on XFM talking about the recent series of Hell&apos;s Kitchen, and he said, &apos;I don&apos;t know who that chef guy was but he was very good&apos;, and someone else piped up, &apos;I think he&apos;s the man who trained Gordon Ramsay&apos;. Oh Marco, I sobbed, has it come to this? He was the youngest ever chef, at 33, to win three Michelin stars and the first Briton. He was our one-man answer to French gastronomic complacency because he had never trained in France. In the Eighties and Nineties he bestrode the British restaurant industry like a colossus. And now he is &apos;the man who trained Gordon Ramsay&apos;- it is tragic. But it is his own stupid fault: he retired from cooking on 23 December l999, handed back his three Michelin stars, and since then has squandered his reputation in a bewildering succession of short-lived business ventures. I first interviewed him back in 1992 when he was still at Harvey&apos;s in Wandsworth, the restaurant that made his name. He was gorgeous in those days, very thin, staring-eyed, and fiery, but almost unintelligible. He spent hours expounding his &apos;philosophy of life&apos;, which seemed to consist of baffling aphorisms like &apos;Only dead fish swim with the tide&apos;. Presumably it went down well with junior staff and models (he was a great modeliser in those days) but a bit wasted on me. Anyway we &apos;go back a long way&apos;, as he keeps telling me, while pouring compliments over me like custard. The only thing that slightly spoils the effect is that he later goes into a paean of praise to Rosie Boycott that makes my portion of compliments seem somewhat meagre by comparison. Unfortunately Marco has developed a whole new concept in making life difficult for interviewers. He keeps saying, &apos;On the record but not for publication&apos;, which seems to mean that I am allowed to keep the tape recorder running but am supposed to - what? - lock his secrets in my bosom? Deliver them to the Public Record Office for release 30 years after his death? Bah, humbug. It is not the job of journalists to keep secrets. But it means that he keeps half-telling me things then refusing to explain. For instance, he told me, &apos;on the record but not for publication&apos;, that he no longer owns his own brand name: &apos;I gave it to a trust to ... So if you want to do a deal with me, you don&apos;t deal with me. I can&apos;t go into details. But it&apos;s simplified a lot of my life.&apos; Perhaps this explains why he disappeared from the Sunday Times Rich List a few years ago. We are lunching at Luciano&apos;s, a restaurant he co-owns with Sir Rocco Forte, which used to be Prunier&apos;s, in St James&apos;s Street. It is a glorious art deco room but puzzlingly empty - for much of lunchtime we are almost the only customers. Marco is thrilled when an elderly lady arrives in a hat. &apos;Oh I love ladies in hats!&apos; he exclaims. &apos;One rule of restaurants: never take a hat from a lady; wait for her to offer you the hat because she might not want to take it off - she might not have had time to do her hair properly.&apos; This is typical of Marco&apos;s persistent enraptured infatuation with the upper classes - I have never met anyone, let alone anyone from a Leeds council estate, so uncritically devoted to the ancien regime He asks a waiter for the menu and reads it as if for the first time. &apos;Why is this starter \u00a36.20?&apos; he wonders. &apos;I can understand \u00a36.50 or \u00a36.95, but not \u00a36.20.&apos; But this is supposed to be his restaurant - it is named after his eldest son - so why doesn&apos;t he know? Apparently he doesn&apos;t do the money side - Rocco Forte does all that. Anyway, he quickly orders riboletta (bean soup) and fettucine for himself and tells me to have the veal cutlet, with zuccini on the side, and crab with &apos;pane caude&apos; to start with. Pane caude turns out to be some sort of crispbread rolled like a brandy snap, which makes it completely unsuitable for sopping up crab. I can&apos;t believe the old three-star Marco would have approved. He orders a glass of champagne for me but not for him. &apos;I don&apos;t really drink,&apos; he tells me, and looks stern when I laugh. &apos;Think of all the times you&apos;ve met me, you&apos;ve never seen me drink. I never had a drink at all till I was 38, I&apos;m just not a drinker. I go days without drinking. Only journalists sometimes get me drunk!&apos; Is this right? I&apos;ve never had a sober meal with Marco but, come to think of it, maybe that&apos;s just me. On the other hand, when I ask for a glass of red later, he orders a bottle of Bardolino Classico and seems quite happy to share it - &apos;It&apos;s a little wine from my mum&apos;s village, and I always think if it came out of the same ground as my mum, it must be good&apos;. His mum, of course, is a constant companion in any Marco conversation. When he recently had &apos;words&apos; with Angus Deayton, who presented Hell&apos;s Kitchen and made some disparaging remark about his name, his parting shot was, &apos;Angus, the eyes you look at are the eyes that watched my mother die&apos;. Deayton was understandably perplexed but anyone who knows Marco knows that he habitually uses his mother&apos;s death as his Get out of Jail Free card. He saw her collapse with a brain haemorrhage when he was six and that explains and excuses everything. A customer comes over to compliment Marco on Hell&apos;s Kitchen and I warmly pitch in, saying truthfully that I loved the show. But Marco is very sniffy at first and says he hasn&apos;t even watched it. He claims he was first asked to do it four years ago - before Gordon Ramsay - and only agreed this time &apos;for my kiddies, because they&apos;d never seen the old man cook&apos;. But it was his first time in the kitchen for seven-and-a-half years - wasn&apos;t he apprehensive? &apos;I don&apos;t think like that. I went there to do a job and my job was to feed 76 people every night and sometimes 100 people with what I&apos;d been given. And I proved to myself that I can still do it. I might not be as fast as I was - my boys said that I was 35 or 40 per cent slower than I used to be - but if I was that fast, I&apos;d have left the celebs behind.&apos; It was a long hard stint. For a month he was living and working in this strange telly bunker in darkest east London, away from his family and with his mobile phone switched off. He reckons he worked at least l8 hours a day, starting at six and finishing at midnight. The previous Hell&apos;s Kitchen chefs, he sniffs, didn&apos;t work nearly such long hours and had prep chefs round the back but, &apos;I didn&apos;t. I led from the front. Sometimes I took such a bashing on that pass - you&apos;d got all these tickets and all this food to serve and I&apos;d put one ticket in my mouth, one over there, one over there, so that it didn&apos;t look so monstrous.&apos; He had just two experienced assistants, Matthew and Tim, who&apos;ve worked for him since they were l8, and then 10 assorted celebs as his brigade. He had no say in choosing the celebs, and still seems a bit vague about who some of them were. But right at the beginning he gave them the task of cooking an egg, which allowed him to assess their basic competence: &apos;You can tell by the way they crack it, they hold the pan, by the way they stand by the stove.&apos; He found Jim Davidson most reliable: &apos;He was the person that from very early days I could turn my back on in the kitchen and know that what he did was right. He&apos;s very bright and he enjoys cooking - he cooked for the staff most days.&apos; And he loved Rosie Boycott: &apos;She was my favourite - interesting, intelligent, a proper person, and I remember the day she was voted off I was very sad. She was a lady.&apos; But they were all good, he says, because &apos;In the kitchen they&apos;re no longer celebs, they&apos;re my crew, and my job was to lead them like I led young boys in Harvey&apos;s all those years ago. The best bit of the entire journey was actually teaching and inspiring them.&apos; As soon as we have finished the first course Marco asks, &apos;Do you still smoke? Do you want a fag?&apos; so we dash outside to puff away under scaffolding in the rain and he gives me his jacket to keep warm. &apos;It&apos;s not bad sneaking for a fag outside, is it? Are you happy in life, Lynn? Despite your bereavement? I think the best you can do is accept it, like with my mum - the pain will never go. I&apos;ll always remember 20 February, the day she died, and 30 November, her birthday, so I always go very strange on those days - I always go to Brompton Oratory and light a candle and stay there for about an hour by myself. But I&apos;ve learned to accept it, and my mum lives on through my children. I&apos;m not saying life&apos;s easy - I have my complications - but it all contributes to this life we live.&apos; Back indoors for the main course, I ask whether doing Hell&apos;s Kitchen made him want to get back to cooking? &apos;No! I&apos;ve been there, done that. I won my three stars, I did what I had to do, and you&apos;ve got to move on. I wouldn&apos;t want to be in one room, 20 hours a day, 52 weeks a year, with four white walls and a stove. I think it stunts your growth as a human being. When I left the kitchen at 38, I was quite socially inept. I think I&apos;ve developed more as a person in the past seven years than I did in all my years in the kitchen.&apos; But what&apos;s he been doing all this time? He has opened several restaurants and closed some of them, he has established a pasta chain called Frankie&apos;s with Frankie Dettori that seems to be doing quite well, and has just opened a new Marco&apos;s at Chelsea football ground. He has published his autobiography, White Slave, though he freely admits it was all written by his friend James Steen, &apos;But I did lots and lots of interviews with him and it&apos;s the most wonderful form of counselling ever, free of charge, and I was being paid for it!&apos; But even he admits that he has not been focused, like he used to be. &apos;To be quite honest, I did nothing in seven years really, apart from try to discover myself and understand myself as a person. I was unemployed and I&apos;d lost all sense of direction in my life. I was 38 and I&apos;d just had enough. Because I&apos;d won my three stars at 33 and I felt, &quot;Oh, is that it?&quot; It was quite weird. If I&apos;d been 48 like Albert Roux [when he won three stars] it&apos;s different, but at 33 - it was very young. When you start, you&apos;re always pushing, always chasing, wanting to do better and better, but once you get to that level, it becomes very systematic. And I just thought: I&apos;m not happy. I thought that by winning three stars I would be happy, I thought I&apos;d be accepted. But I was almost in a worse position. Because when you&apos;re a one-star chef, your mentors don&apos;t feel threatened by you; even when you&apos;re a two-star chef they don&apos;t, because they&apos;re still top of their tree and they think &apos;my boy Marco&apos; - because remember, I was totally home-grown, I never went to France. And then when I won three stars, they&apos;d all started to crumble, or got bored with the stove, and what they couldn&apos;t cope with was that Marco was now the boss in their world. And then I saw the knives come in behind me and I started getting disillusioned with my whole world. Because with all my failings, I&apos;m a very loyal individual.&apos; This is not the impression one gets from his autobiography. In the past seven years Marco seems to have fallen out with everyone - with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Gordon Ramsay most publicly, but also with his mentor Albert Roux who he used to say was &apos;like a father&apos; to him; with Michael Winner who paid for his honeymoon; with Michael Caine who backed his restaurant Canteen; and with his youngest brother to whom he hasn&apos;t spoken for nine years. In White Slave, he recounts these fallings-out as if they were great moral victories, but they hardly resound to his credit. Take the famous incident at Heston Blumenthal&apos;s Fat Duck restaurant in Bray. He was having lunch there when he saw Gordon Ramsay also having lunch. He immediately summoned Blumenthal and told him to tell Ramsay to leave. Blumenthal was embarrassed; Gordon Ramsay was furious and called Marco a &apos;fat bastard&apos;; the other customers were agog. Marco thinks he deserved a standing ovation. For what? For making a scene in a restaurant? Respect! A few months ago he threatened to sue Gordon Ramsay over a chapter in Ramsay&apos;s autobiography in which he admitted stealing the reservations book from Aubergine - his own restaurant - and then blaming it on Marco. Ramsay told Bill Buford: &apos;It was my one stroke of genius, fucking someone over without his knowing that I was the one who did it.&apos; Marco threatened to sue for malicious falsehood but says now that he didn&apos;t need to sue because he got the publishers to withdraw the chapter. But of course they&apos;re still not speaking. Were he and Ramsay ever friends? &apos;No. Gordon worked for me. I helped set up his first deal at Aubergine. I was always brought up in life, by my father, never to forget what people do for me - unfortunately some people have short memories.&apos; Quite - rather like his own short memory \u00e0 propos Albert Roux. But the most serious of all the recent fallings-out has been with his wife Mati, mother of his three youngest children. Their relationship was always fiery. In 2003 she found texts on his mobile phone which she thought meant he was having an affair with a woman banker and sent a message to everyone on his mobile saying, &apos;Marco Pierre White has left his wife and three children for Robin Saunders&apos;. A year or so later she called the police to their house and accused Marco of assault - he spent the night in the cells though she never pressed charges. Last summer she marched into Luciano&apos;s and fired a waitress, telling her, &apos;You are the second waitress my husband is fucking&apos;. On another occasion, she went to Frankie&apos;s and publicly demanded a divorce. And, according to Marco, they are now divorced - &apos;I have my decree nisi&apos; - though they are still living together. Isn&apos;t that a bit odd? &apos;My life has not been normal, Lynn!&apos; So are they back together? &apos;I think in life, the more you force things, they break. You just let things happen.&apos; But is there someone else in his life? &apos;Not to my knowledge. And, to be honest, I have no interest.&apos; What? No interest in women? This must be a first. &apos;Not really. I have my children. I get so much love from my children. I love my family. I know what it&apos;s like to come from a broken world.&apos; So why did they ever divorce in the first place? &apos;On the record but not for publication - I think my wife was just trying to get my attention. Trying to win my respect. And that&apos;s her right. It&apos;s very easy for Marco to go off and do this, do that, do whatever. I have all this freedom in the world - or I&apos;m perceived to have this freedom - whereas my wife is a mother and it can be very difficult for a woman.&apos; He claims that he is now more mature and happier than he&apos;s ever been. &apos;I think my biography played a very big part in that - going down that road of self-discovery and reliving my life and questioning everything. I stepped into Hell&apos;s Kitchen because I finally felt comfortable with myself as a person. Seven-and-a-half years is a long time away from the stove. But I felt very confident in myself mentally. I felt I could do the job. And I know my industry is very happy that I stepped back into the ring.&apos; Everyone was happy to see him back in the ring. So why doesn&apos;t he stay there - not necessarily in a restaurant but at least on television, teaching people to cook? He was so good in his heyday. Instead he is flying madly round the world in the next few months opening new Frankie&apos;s restaurants in hellholes like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Shanghai and planning 20 more Frankie&apos;s in the Caribbean. It sounds a nightmare: he says he enjoys it. He likes the fact that Frankie&apos;s is &apos;democratic&apos;, that families can eat there with their children. And he likes the people he is dealing with. &apos;Even in these superficial worlds, where one is an illusion, one is a building site, there are interesting people. And when I go to Jamaica for example, I love going to a jerk shack, I love buying fish off the locals - they all enrich my life and they all contribute to this multi-dimensional, multi-coloured tapestry that I live in. I&apos;ve got to enjoy what I&apos;m doing, otherwise there&apos;s no point in doing it.&apos; Oh maddening Marco. He seemed to have come back with Hell&apos;s Kitchen and now he&apos;s gone again. Such a loss. \u00b7 What do you think?

Kazakhstan may not be the first place that springs to mind when looking for a weekend break, but its former capital, Almaty, is about to become the ultimate destination for an edgy escape. New direct flights with BMI start this month and November sees the launch of a new guidebook, A Hedonist&apos;s Guide to ... Almaty and Astana, showing Almaty, nearly 2,000 miles south east of Moscow, to be the new cultural and party capital of Central Asia. Checking in If you want to be in the centre of old Almaty, head for the Grand Tien Shan Hotel in the neo-classical building of the former Ministry of Geology, which has beautiful mountain views (00 7 727 244 9600; ts-hotels.kz; doubles from \u00a3150). From mid-2008 you can stay at the JW Marriott Hotel Almaty (marriott.com) in the new 38-storey Esentai Park Tower on Al-Farabi Avenue, set to become the country&apos;s chicest address. Hit the streets The Zelyonni (Green) Bazaar is the best place in town to experience &apos;Central Asia&apos;. Opposite, at the bottom of Dostyk Avenue, there&apos;s an informal flea market where you can pick up Soviet-era household items and antiques for next to nothing. Almaty&apos;s Central Public Baths, the Arasan Banya, are a truly local haunt, and the perfect way to relax on a winter&apos;s day, when temperatures can fall as low as -15C. Choose between Russian, Finnish or Turkish baths, or a large steam room with wood-panelled walls, where you can beat yourself with birch branches. Coffee break Kazakhstan is a nation of tea drinkers, but the hottest place in town for a &apos;jumbo latte&apos; is Coffeedelia (79 Kabanbai Batyr Street; 00 7 727 272 6409) - coffee shop by day and hangout for the children of the new elite at night. More sophisticated, and only a block away, is L&apos;Affiche (83 Kabanbai Batyr Street; 00 7 727 272 1092) with its postcard-perfect views of the Opera and Ballet Theatre opposite. Our favourite is the homely 4A Coffee (81 Zhibek Zholy Street; 00 7 727 273 1181).  Neighbourhood watch Walk along the streets of Valikhanov, Tulebaev or Baisetov in Old Almaty after a snowfall for one of the most peaceful experiences the city has to offer.

But Saturday&apos;s top-quality juvenile contest was as much about the spending power of Sheikh Mohammed, as he continues to strengthen stallion prospects for his Darley Stud operation. Already part-owner of New Approach with trainer Bolger&apos;s wife Jackie, Sheikh Mohammed has also purchased a share in Raven&apos;s Pass, the Dewhurst third. But unlike those colts, who will remain with their respective trainers for their three-year-old careers, Fast Company, the runner-up on Saturday, has run his last race for Manton&apos;s Brian Meehan. &quot;Fast Company will be coming to Godolphin,&quot; said the Sheikh&apos;s racing manager Simon Crisford yesterday. &quot;He looks an exciting horse for next year.&quot; Fast Company changed hands after his second win and ran in the colours of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s son, Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed, on Saturday. Rio De La Plata, carrying the royal blue of Godolphin, finished fourth in the Dewhurst - not exactly a clean sweep for Dubai&apos;s ruler, but not far off it. Derby winner Authorized and multiple Group One winner Manduro have also joined the Darley stallion roster, not forgetting Teofilo, the Bolger-trained winner of last year&apos;s Dewhurst. Teofilo never ran again after picking up an injury, which is worth bearing in mind for anyone tempted by offers as low as 7-4 about New Approach for next year&apos;s 2,000 Guineas. Bolger would not be drawn into comparisons between the colts but described New Approach as a &quot;machine&quot;. That did not always look the case on Saturday, when New Approach was awkward leaving the stalls and had to be put under considerable pressure by Kevin Manning, earning the jockey a five-day ban for his use of the whip. Yesterday, however, Manning said he was always confident he had matters under control. &quot;Jimmy Fortune&apos;s horse [Raven&apos;s Pass] jumped across us at the start which is why we weren&apos;t too well away,&quot; said Manning. &quot;But we wanted to settle him in anyway and race on the heels of the leaders. He keeps finding plenty and I think he will get a mile and a half next year no bother, but he has plenty of pace.&quot; Manning says there is no temperament issue with New Approach, who was accompanied to the start by a pony, as he had been prior to his National Stakes win at The Curragh. &quot;Going to the start he can be a bit buzzy,&quot; said the rider. &quot;But once he&apos;s behind the stalls there&apos;s no problem.&quot; The first four in the Dewhurst are the first four in betting on next year&apos;s 2,000 Guineas, and Fast Company looked Classic material when getting within half a length of New Approach. &quot;When we hit the rising ground I thought we might just get there, but the winner pulled out a bit more,&quot; said jockey Ted Durcan yesterday. &quot;He&apos;s a lovely horse with a good attitude.&quot; Fast Company pulled two and a half lengths clear of Raven&apos;s Pass, who would have preferred faster ground according to trainer John Gosden, and it was another two and a half lengths to Rio De La Plata. &quot;I think he ran a couple of lengths below his best,&quot; said Simon Crisford yesterday. &quot;He has done a fair bit this season.&quot; Coolmore, Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s arch rivals in the breeding stakes, have yet to produce a colt of Dewhurst class this year.

Yesterday&apos;s announcement did not include a valuation for DP World but the flotation is expected to put a price tag of up to \u00a310bn on the company. An indicative price will be given early next month when the offer opens. DP World has expanded very rapidly in recent years through a combination of merger and acquisition. It joined forces with Dubai Ports Authority in 2005 and bought Britain&apos;s P&amp;O in 2006 for \u00a33.3bn. &quot;Today marks another step in the development of DP World from a local, to a regional, to a global player,&quot; the company&apos;s chairman, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, said yesterday. Shares in DP World will be listed on the Dubai International Financial Exchange and the IPO will be open to international investors as well as residents of the United Arab Emirates. Dubai is a member of the UAE federation. Mohammed Sharaf, the chief executive of DP World, said the company had transformed itself over the past three years but intended to continue its rapid expansion. &quot;Today we are in 22 countries with 42 terminals. In 10 years&apos; time we expect to have nearly doubled last year&apos;s capacity.&quot; Mr Sharaf said the company had a number of new terminal developments in the pipeline, including the London Gateway, a \u00a31.5bn project to build a deep water container port on the site of a former oil refinery. Mr Sharaf said the company had considered listing in London but had opted for Dubai. &quot;We are a global operator but we are a home-grown Dubai company. We have full confidence in the IFX to deliver the value we are looking for and the value our shareholders are looking for.&quot; Mr Sharaf declined to be drawn on the amount of money the IPO would raise. &quot;That&apos;s going to be market driven.&quot; The proceeds of the IPO will go to the shareholders, rather than the company, but Mr Sharaf said DP World had the financial capability in order to deliver its growth plans. &quot;We have enough capability on the balance sheet to take the business through into the future,&quot; Mr Sharaf said. The IPO would not mean a change of culture at DP World, according to Mr Sharaf. &quot;We believe we have all the best practices in the organisation,&quot; he said. &quot;The only change is that greater transparency will come about. &quot;That will show we are running a global organisation with the best practices. The company&apos;s management has been running the business successfully for a long time and we will continue doing that.&quot; DP World&apos;s vote of confidence in DIFX came as it was reported that its parent company, Dubai Bourse, was in talks with the Qatari Investment Authority over a possible swap deal involving their respective holdings in the OMX, which owns a number of Baltic stock exchanges, and the LSE. Dubai Bourse holds around \u00a31.2bn worth of LME shares but, according to the Sunday Times, is in discussions with the QIA about exchanging that holding for the QIA&apos;s 10% stake in OMX. If the talks are successful the QIA would have a 29.9% stake in the LSE, the newspaper reported, which would make it impossible for anyone else to mount a successful bid for the London market. The move comes after Borse Dubai, along with its bid partner Nasdaq, had sweetened their offer for OMX to $4.9bn (\u00a32.5bn) last month and sought to boost their stake in the Scandinavian exchange after the Qatari investor started buying OMX shares.

More generally, should foreign governments be allowed to buy western companies? These are big questions, which have so far had disappointingly small-minded answers. That may be about to change. Last weekend, finance chiefs from the group of seven industrialised countries jointly and publicly acknowledged what some of them have briefed only in private: that these government-run savings pools - known as sovereign wealth funds - are not like other investors. They also proposed a code for these funds (which together are estimated to be worth a trillion pounds), setting out what they can invest in and some ground rules for how they should behave. This marks a significant advance. When asked about sovereign funds, western leaders have typically chosen one of two opposed positions. Some, such as the chancellor Alistair Darling (at least until very recently), have argued that a free market must be just that - free. Others have been uneasy about foreign governments buying their national corporate treasures. The first is dogma; the second is possibly prejudice; neither is particularly useful. This latest communique paves the way for a more thoughtful approach. It is always gratifying when market-mesmerised politicians make investors behave within certain parameters. A list of industries too sensitive to be bought by state funds is a good idea. It should include energy companies. Calls for greater openness from Beijing, Moscow and other sovereign investors sound promising. But more information is useless without someone to process it, so governments would ideally strengthen under-powered financial regulators. Still, this process must be careful to ensure that one group of investors is not discriminated against because they are foreign. Where, for instance, are the calls for greater transparency from hedge funds, which have similar financial might? Alarm bells rang last week when France&apos;s Nicolas Sarkozy spoke of the transparency usual &quot;in a civilised world&quot;. Not only did the French government oppose last year&apos;s takeover of Arcelor, a steel company, by India&apos;s Lakshmi Mittal; it did not slap down Arcelor for dismissing the bid as &quot;monkey money&quot;.

Although Souness could conceivably be appointed in time for Thursday&apos;s Uefa Cup match at home to the Portuguese side Braga, Gartside is believed to be drawn to the idea of attracting Gary Megson from Leicester City and also retains an interest in Real Sociedad&apos;s Chris Coleman. While recruiting either Megson or Coleman would involve paying out at least \u00a31m in compensation, Souness is out of work, which makes him a more financially attractive proposition. Formerly in charge of Rangers, Liverpool, Galatasaray, Southampton, Torino, Benfica, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United, the volatile Scot has been out of work since being sacked at St James&apos; Park in February 2006, but is keen on a new challenge. News of his strong candidacy has provoked mixed reactions among Bolton fans, with some concerned by his history of acrimonious fallouts with players, most recently with Craig Bellamy at Newcastle. Others, however, point to the early success Souness achieved at Blackburn, where he presided over a League Cup win in 2002. Whoever is appointed by Gartside must not only endeavour to keep Bolton in the Premier League but restore harmony to a dressing room which became divided under Lee, who fell out with key figures, including Gary Speed and Kevin Nolan. Five weeks after joining Leicester, Megson - dubbed &quot;the Ginger Mourinho&quot; by his new public - has apparently still to sign a contract, but Milan Mandaric, the club&apos;s owner, claims he has already secured a legally binding agreement tying the former West Bromwich and Nottingham Forest manager to the Foxes which can only be broken by a \u00a31m cheque. Further across the midlands, sources close to Steve Bruce indicate that the Birmingham City manager - who is concerned about the potential implications of the Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung&apos;s pending takeover - could also be interested in the Bolton job. However, Birmingham would be unlikely to countenance the idea of him moving to the Reebok Stadium. Another manager to have caught Gartside&apos;s eye is Hibernian&apos;s John Collins, but he has made it clear he is not prepared to break his contract with the Edinburgh club. Meanwhile the former Wigan manager Paul Jewell, who is in Dubai, has apparently told Bolton that he does not yet feel ready to return to management. Coleman&apos;s achievements on a limited budget at Fulham have not gone unrecognised and there are suggestions that he has had some contact with Gartside, but Real Sociedad have steadfastly refused the Welshman, who moved to northern Spain only this summer, permission to speak to Bolton and their stance is likely to remain unyielding. With senior players apparently having told Gartside that they would like a new manager appointed sooner rather than later, with Bolton bottom of the table, Souness&apos;s instant availability is making him an increasingly appealing option. The Blackburn defender Christopher Samba has signed a new five-year deal at Ewood Park following a string of impressive performances.

The advert, for Sorouh Real Estate, covers more than 20,000 sq m - more than two football pitches - and is viewed from the air by arriving and departing plane passengers. The site was independently verified by an inspector from the Guinness Book of World Records and designated as the record holder for the new category of &quot;world record for banner size&quot;. Stephen Jones, the managing director of Ad-Air Middle East, said the sheer scale of the ad was &quot;unbelievable&quot;. &quot;It is fitting that our first advertiser should be a real estate company, given the current explosion of property development in the region,&quot; he added. &quot;The Ad-Air site offers an unprecedented marketing opportunity for any brand wishing to put its stamp on Dubai and immediately make an impression on visitors.&quot; Sorouh is using the site as a branding exercise for four months. It plans to fill the banner with a million faces from around the world in the new year as part of a charitable campaign to raise money for the United Arab Emirates Red Crescent. Members of the public are invited to upload their photograph free at sorouhfaces.com. For each face the company will donate $1 (49p) to the humanitarian organisation. The amount Sorouh paid is undisclosed, but the site forms part of a multimillion-pound brand awareness campaign. Ad-Air has previously said the price is \u00a340,000 to \u00a380,000 a month depending on location, with copy changing every six to 12 months. The site in Dubai is the first of an international network of mega advertising at airports planned by Ad-Air. It will be seen by an estimated 14 million people. The company, which is backed by \u00a35m in private equity finance, has rights to 30 airports, including London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Los Angeles International, Chicago O&apos;Hare and Tokyo Narita. Each airport will have a maximum of four sites. Ad-Air intends to calculate impact on the basis of average numbers of annual passengers per runway, the number of flights during visible periods, average plane capacity, and visibility from window seats. Ad-Air indicated it would launch at least four new sites in early 2008, two in Europe and two in the US.

Perhaps his own direct responsibility for New Labour&apos;s reforms, as Tony Blair&apos;s senior health policy adviser, which he did not mention, has made him lose objectivity. Milne&apos;s article was based on the clear evidence of the government&apos;s stated intention to dismember the NHS and create a healthcare market. Le Grand&apos;s letter is the sort of spin one has come to expect from the CBI or a rightwing thinktank, not from an academic. All serious academic observers agree that far from being inefficient, as he declares, the pre-reform NHS was the most efficient - and also one of the most equitable - of all national healthcare systems. The claim that the independent sector treatment centres have significantly assisted the NHS to cut waiting times and increase choice is simply false. The House of Commons health select committee could find no evidence for this, and an in-depth study by Stewart Player and myself at the University of Edinburgh shows that, on the contrary, ISTCs are not innovative and have if anything reduced choice and NHS capacity. Their real purpose has been to establish a hugely expensive and ringfenced bridgehead for private providers in NHS secondary care, at the cost of NHS trusts having to close services and lay off staff because their patient income is being diverted to for-profit providers. Colin Leys Emeritus professor, Queen&apos;s University, Canada; and honorary professor, Centre for International Public Health Policy, University of Edinburgh It is Julian Le Grand&apos;s view of the privatisation of the NHS that is rose-tinted. One of the problems with the NHS reforms is there is no effective evaluation demonstrating that they are improving performance. What is certain is that private contracts and the increased bureaucracy and the huge amounts of money involved are diverting money and resources away from the NHS and fragmenting services. All this is borne out in the experience of the ISTCs Julian holds up so proudly as a beacon of private sector involvement in our public services. There is no evidence ISTCs have helped cut waiting times or drive efficiency. ISTCs performed 50,000 fewer operations than the Department of Health expected last year and procedures carried out in ISTCs cost 11% more than in the NHS. Even so ISTCs are paid irrespective of their performance and primary care trusts are picking up the tab for their failure to the tune of \u00a35bn. Furthermore, even though the relative number of procedures ISTCs conduct is small, their impact on the NHS is disproportionately large. Close to 10% of the total elective workload of the NHS is now being performed by ISTCs and in some localities this represents all the elective care in particular specialities.Kevin Coyne National secretary for health, Unite Le Grand&apos;s assertion that ISTCs offer &quot;efficient, responsive care&quot; has no discernible basis in fact. Conversely, Seumas Milne (Only dogma and corporate capture can explain this, October 18) rightly diagnoses the invasion of McKinsey and the eruption of PFI debt boils as pre-morbid symptoms of an inevitable NHS demise. Indeed, only yesterday my inbox gave information on DoH-initiated pilot-transfer schemes to overseas hospitals, such as the American hospital in Dubai. Almost 30 years after entering the NHS, I sorely regret its passing. Can the Le Grand neo-Fabians genuinely imagine that partnerships such as those with the G\u00e9n\u00e9rale-Beaulieu Swiss infertility clinic will offer a more &quot;equitable&quot; response to the healthcare needs of residents at their local high-rise estate? The imminent disappearance of the NHS is a no-brainer and Milne rightly observes that none of the political parties sees other than a privatised future for UK health. It has become an insult to the intelligence of the population to pretend otherwise. It&apos;s high time the government put its mouth where our money is and gave us a real chance for choice before it is too late.Janet Wilson Professor of otolaryngology, head and neck surgery, Newcastle University", "tags": ["Politics", "Health", "Health & wellbeing", "Society", "UK news", "Life and style"], "title": "Letters: Grand visions of a privatised NHS", "sentences": ["Indeed, only yesterday my inbox gave information on DoH-initiated pilot-transfer schemes to overseas hospitals, such as the American hospital in Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/oct/25/health.publicservices", "publicationDate": "2007-10-24T23:06:44Z"}, {"article": "The Breeders&apos; Cup expands into a second day for the first time this year, and the three new events on the card at Monmouth Park, New Jersey tonight could produce two winners for Europeans - according to some bookmakers, at any rate.

General Mohammad Ali Jafari&apos;s remarks came after the Iranian interior minister, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, vowed any aggressor would meet a &quot;crushing response&quot;.  The minister acknowledged the probability of a US attack was &quot;very small&quot; but warned it would &quot;lead to America&apos;s collapse&quot;, according to Iran&apos;s state news agency IRNA.  The Bush administration yesterday branded the revolutionary guard a &quot;proliferator of weapons of mass destruction&quot; and said its elite Quds division was a terrorist organisation, the first time a country&apos;s military has been put on America&apos;s terrorist list.  The US says the Quds division, numbering about 15,000, is involved with Lebanon&apos;s Hizbullah and groups elsewhere in the Middle East.  But Gen Jafari said he did not consider Washington&apos;s &quot;words&quot; a threat, Iran&apos;s student news agency, ISNA, reported. &quot;The Islamic Republic has the strength and power of its people&apos;s faith. This power is joined with experience, knowledge and technology in the realms of defence. The enemy knows it cannot make any mistake, so these words are just exaggeration,&quot; he said.  &quot;We will reply to any strike with an even more decisive strike,&quot; he said Mohammad Ali Hosseini, a spokesman for Iran&apos;s foreign ministry, said the sanctions were &quot;doomed to failure&quot; and said the Bush administration&apos;s accusation that Iran was arming Shia militants in Iraq was &quot;ridiculous&quot;.  The US measures target the 125,000-strong Iranian revolutionary guard (IRG), one of the best-resourced parts of the country&apos;s military, with its own tanks and planes. It also owns hotels, oil companies and other businesses.  Making the announcement at a press conference yesterday, the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said the punitive moves were intended &quot;to confront the threatening behaviour of the Iranians&quot;. The sanctions and other steps would &quot;increase the costs to Iran of its irresponsible behaviour&quot;.  The administration also imposed sanctions on three Iranian state-owned banks: the banks Melli and Mellat, for alleged arms proliferation, and Bank Saderat, which was labelled &quot;a terrorist financier&quot;.  In addition to the IRG and the banks, eight individuals and several other companies are covered by the sanctions. The measures have long been threatened and Tehran responded by saying they would have no more success than in the past.  However, the US under-secretary of state, Nicholas Burns, conceded that past sanctions, in place since 1984, had done little to constrict the growth of Iran&apos;s trade with other countries, in particular China and Russia. &quot;They [China] are now the number one trade partner with Iran. It&apos;s very difficult for countries to say we&apos;re striking out on our own when they&apos;ve got their own policies on the military side, aiding and abetting the Iranian government in strengthening its own military,&quot; he told the BBC.  Mr Burns said the US still hoped Russia and China would approve a third UN security council resolution imposing new sanctions next month.  Israel, a strong supporter of the US action, said today its foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, would travel to Beijing this weekend to lobby for harsher UN sanctions on Iran.  However, China warned today that &quot;sanctions should not be lightly imposed in international relations&quot;.  &quot;Dialogue and negotiations are the best approach to resolving the Iranian nuclear issue,&quot; the foreign ministry said.  &quot;To impose new sanctions on Iran at a time when international society and the Iranian authorities are working hard to find a solution to the Iranian nuclear issue can only complicate the issue.&quot;  The response of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was more scathing. He said sanctions made a negotiated settlement harder.  &quot;Why worsen the situation by threatening sanctions and bring it to a dead end?&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s not the best way to resolve the situation, by running around like a madman with a razor blade in his hand.&quot;  Some analysts believe the unilateral measures will have little effect in isolating Iran - and still less in changing its policy. Selig Harrison, of the Centre for International Policy, told BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme: &quot;I don&apos;t think these will be very effective. Arab traders in Dubai thumb their noses up when people say you shouldn&apos;t trade with Iran. A lot of Iran&apos;s foreign trade hasn&apos;t been affected.&quot;  There have also been claims that the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, will be strengthened by the sanctions.  &quot;Hardliners in Tehran were looking forward to the sanctions. It helps them hide their incompetence behind the embargo,&quot; said the political commentator Saeed Laylaz. However, other observers say the measures could weaken Mr Ahmadinejad, leaving him open to charges that his stance is pushing the US into punishing the country and damaging its already fragile economy.  The sanctions package, combined with the sending of a second US carrier group to the Gulf earlier this year, is aimed primarily at containing Iran, which has been expanding its influence in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It is also intended to force Tehran to stop its alleged attempts to develop a nuclear bomb and end its alleged supply of weapons to Iraqi militia groups.  Ms Rice, who has had to withstand pressure from within the Bush administration for military action, insisted she remained committed to the diplomatic route. But she said: &quot;Unfortunately the Iranian government continues to spurn our offer of open negotiations, instead threatening peace and security by pursuing nuclear technologies that can lead to a nuclear weapon, building dangerous ballistic missiles, supporting Shia militants in Iraq and terrorists in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, and denying the existence of a fellow member of the United Nations, threatening to wipe Israel off the map.&quot;  The US president, George Bush, has said repeatedly that a military strike is an option.  As part of a multibillion-dollar request for more military spending earlier this week, the Pentagon asked for $88m (\u00a343m) to develop the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a huge bunker-busting bomb, for its Stealth bombers. The Bush administration said the bomb was needed &quot;in response to an urgent operational need for theatre commanders&quot;.  Democratic members of Congress questioned whether the weapon was intended for use against Iran, where nuclear facilities are largely hidden underground.  Jim Moran, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives defence spending committee, said: &quot;My assumption is that it is Iran, because you wouldn&apos;t use them in Iraq, and I don&apos;t know where you would use them in Afghanistan. It doesn&apos;t have any weapons facilities underground that we know of.&quot;  The immediate impact of the sanctions announcement will be felt in the boardrooms of banks and companies in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. Any business continuing to trade with Iran risks US reprisals.  Total and Shell, have already been stalling on committing to the large liquefied natural gas they have been awarded. The sanctions make it illegal for any US citizen to knowingly provide material support or resources to the Quds division. As the US has had few links with Iran since 1979, this is mainly academic. The impact will be felt by non-American companies that have business interests in the US and Iran.  European governments, including Britain, are discussing whether to also designate the Quds division a terrorist organisation, though the legal definition and the process of designating groups as terrorist is different to that in the US.", "tags": ["World news", "US news", "Iran", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Iran warns it would strike back against force", "sentences": ["Arab traders in Dubai thumb their noses up when people say you shouldn&apos;t trade with Iran."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/26/usa.iran", "publicationDate": "2007-10-26T15:22:41Z"}, {"article": "She lived the life of a footballer&apos;s wife with a fleet of Porsches and Ferraris in the drive, a \u00a3100,000 kitchen and a penchant for downing \u00a3500 bottles of wine &quot;like water&quot; at Gordon Ramsay&apos;s restaurant.

Sangster lived with Bridgewater and told police and jurors that he was a &quot;kept man&quot; and a &quot;modern-day househusband&quot;, despite enjoying extravagances such as flying lessons and her luxury villa in Spain. He was found guilty of perverting the course of justice and given a nine-month suspended sentence. Bridgewater&apos;s career as a thief began in 1996 when she secured the job of accounts manager at Dyna Five, a computer hardware firm in Epsom, Surrey. Despite being described in court as little more than &quot;a lapsed accountancy student&quot; she was able to disguise the theft of \u00a325,000 as payments to suppliers and the taxman. Her scam was only exposed when her boss checked the company accounts to find just a few pounds left. The company collapsed. Bridgewater was convicted on eight counts of false accounting and sentenced to 150 hours community service, but this did not deter her from taking another job. She aimed for a position of greater responsibility and was appointed the \u00a378,000-a-year finance director at Hicklin Slade, a London marketing company which works for Camelot, the National Lottery operator. She was so skilled at lying that she even managed to cover up her regular absences to fulfil her community service sentences with the excuse that she was doing charitable work. It was a lie that prepared the ground for a \u00a32m theft. Jurors heard her usual method of spiriting the money away was to transfer funds to a dormant company she had set up years earlier and used in her previous fraud. But other times she &quot;brazenly&quot; paid for luxuries directly from the company account. Dinner at top restaurants, including the Mandarin Oriental in Knightsbridge and Gordon Ramsay&apos;s at Claridges, cost up to \u00a32,200. She blew \u00a365,000 on holidays to Barbados, the Maldives, Sydney and Dubai with her boyfriend. Police said her deceit sustained a &quot;lavish lifestyle of a footballer&apos;s wife&quot;. Even when the company ordered redundancies to cope with its unexplained cashflow problems, Bridgewater continued to steal. Finally, after taking \u00a32m, she felt further thefts could be too risky and got another job. Having set up an internet banking facility, she started work for Universal Sound Principles, a small West End radio recording company, whose owner she persuaded to begin banking online. She then stole \u00a355,000 by making unauthorised withdrawals and wrongful salary payments. The six-year spree ended when Hicklin Slade, her biggest victim, asked auditors to investigate the company&apos;s &quot;parlous financial state&quot;. Bridgewater admitted 16 counts of theft, two of furnishing false information and one of perverting the course of justice. Passing sentence, the recorder said: &quot;Because of their trust in you they did not check or audit the accounts which you had done and the performance of the company deteriorated because of the losses from your stealing. You sat in meetings as staff were made redundant around you without saying a word.&quot; Outside the court, Detective Sergeant Dom Lucas said: &quot;Her actions led to the collapse of a company and the near collapse of two more companies. &quot;Today&apos;s sentencing proves that such excessive greed and blatant disregard for her victims would eventually catch up with her.&quot;", "tags": ["UK news", "Crime"], "title": "Six Porsches, \u00a3500 bottles of wine and a Spanish villa - trail of 'Walter Mitty' thief", "sentences": ["She blew \u00a365,000 on holidays to Barbados, the Maldives, Sydney and Dubai with her boyfriend."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/27/ukcrime.topstories3", "publicationDate": "2007-10-27T00:31:41Z"}, {"article": "Age-old Fleet Street rivalries have resurfaced in the desert, according to Emirates Today online. It reports that The Times and the Daily Telegraph are going head-to-head in the United Arab Emirates to win the attention of its booming business community.

At the other end of the 28 sq metre room, a woman periodically looks over as she enjoys a cup of coffee in the calming earth tones of her surroundings. But this is not a creche but a bank - Raiffeisenbank Gastein in Austria. The town of Bad Gastein might be a sleepy looking ski resort with only 5,600 inhabitants but it is home to one of the most innovative banking concepts around: female-oriented banking. With the introduction of the euro, Raiffeisenbank Gastein&apos;s currency exchange business broke away in 2002 leaving a large, unused space. The banking consultancy Emotion Banking was called in to drum up ideas on how to use the space and increase local business. It found that while 13% of women in the Gastein valley were self-employed and required high-level banking strategies, 50% were housewives with more basic banking needs. The consultancy devised a strategy to target the wealth of opportunity among Gastein&apos;s women, and &quot;female-banking&quot; was born. Now, a year after its official opening, Raiffeisenbank&apos;s headquarters has been transformed. It operates a &quot;branch in branch&quot; concept with separate areas devoted to separate clientele. That its female customer base has seen double digit-growth for the first time in 20 years shows female-oriented banking is not about frivolity and bows but profit and the bottom line. Emotion Banking&apos;s chief executive, Christian Rauscher, says that until now banks have failed to tap into the lucrative female market. &quot;Fifty-one per cent of [banking] clients worldwide are female ... more women are standing on their own feet and deciding their own finances ... [banks] tend to address men in their communication, which is not necessarily the best way to be successful.&quot; Glass ceiling He also makes the point that women have more financial clout than is often attributed to them, for example, overseeing household finances. As more women break through the glass ceiling, it is clear that tailoring services to them will be an expanding area for banks. One UK bank determined to focus on their growing clout is the private bank Coutts. Sarah Deaves, who became Coutts&apos;s first female chief executive, says a spur for the bank is the growing number of rich women in the UK. About one-third of Coutts&apos; 60,000 clients are women. &quot;Women are increasingly becoming a substantial segment,&quot; Ms Deaves says, citing figures from a 2006 Centre for Economic Business Research study, which estimated 53% of millionaires are likely to be female in 2020. Additionally, figures from the independent research firm Datamonitor suggest there are 448,000 women in Britain classified as &quot;high net-worth&quot; (with \u00a3200,000 in liquid assets). Of those, 112,000 - or 25% - have \u00a3500,000 in liquid assets, the criteria for holding a Coutts account. The Datamonitor study also revealed the wealth gap between males and females is narrowing. In 2006, the average female millionaire was worth \u00a31.97m, while the figure for men was \u00a32.96m. This compares with \u00a31.28m for women in 1998 and \u00a32.71m for males. Ms Deaves says there has been a noticeable change in the way women acquire wealth. No longer reliant on divorce settlements or inheritances, women are now making their own money. Some 38% of Coutts&apos; clients gained wealth through salary, 19% did so from their spouse, 7% inherited it and the remainder acquired it through unknown means. &quot;People are able to make their mark [in business] earlier. Women are coming through in investment banking; they&apos;re becoming corporate executives and are earning lots of bonuses,&quot; she says. Coutts&apos; aim is to create a culture that fosters female entrepreneurship. What started as a small lunch programme two years ago has grown into an array of networking events, charity fundraisers and the launch of Coutts Woman online magazine, which had 6,000 hits in July. The private bank is also making a niche for itself by linking finance to fashion, and is sponsoring an exhibition of designer Matthew Williamson&apos;s work at London&apos;s Design Museum. But Catherine Tillotson, a partner at the wealth management consultancy Scorpio Partnership, says private banks are often guilty of &quot;wrap[ping] up their services in pink ... now it&apos;s becoming [clearer] the issue is not about whether women should be treated differently. [Banks need] a different marketing approach, rather than different service.&quot; She says British banks were at the vanguard of female-oriented banking 10 years ago but European banks had now moved ahead. &quot;It&apos;s a shame because the UK is such a strong financial centre ... and a major honeypot for very high net-worth individuals&quot;. North American banks are also addressing females&apos; needs. Just two decades ago, it was commonplace for a female entrepreneur to have to get her husband to co-sign a loan, says Kris Depencier, national manager of small business and women&apos;s markets at Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). After setting up a business specifically for women, RBC hoped to address this. Fifteen years on, the success of women entrepreneurs has shown the idea to be fruitful and still relevant today. &quot;[Women] don&apos;t have the same legacy of established networks and availability of mentors that perhaps some of their male colleagues have had,&quot; she says &quot;I would suggest that is changing rapidly as more and more women go into business.&quot; Financial education As in Britain, Canadian women&apos;s financial power is growing: between 1991 and 2001, women&apos;s self-employment grew 43%, and there are some 821,000 female entrepreneurs in Canada, contributing in excess of C$18bn (\u00a38.58bn) to the economy. In the US, a financial education programme, Woman &amp; Co, is at the forefront of such banking. The company, which is part of Citigroup, offers advice on issues ranging from childcare to property and has strong leadership to fall back on - its chairwoman, Lisa Caputo, is the former press secretary to Hillary Clinton. &quot;[When we launched] no company was initiating a real conversation about how women feel about their money,&quot; says Ms Caputo. &quot;The challenge was to present a financial service for women in a way that would not be perceived as a traditional service wrapped in pink.&quot; But that does not mean Women &amp; Co shies away from its task, and she says the brand is &quot;unapologetically feminine, confident and inspiring&quot;. Although Women &amp; Co was launched four years ago, Ms Caputo doesn&apos;t see any direct competitors, which shows the gap in the worldwide market. Other countries picking up on the trend include Bangladesh&apos;s Grameen Bank - 97% of the microcredit outfit&apos;s 7.24 million borrowers are women; Pakistan&apos;s First Women Bank and the Dubai Islamic Bank, which offers a women-only service called Johara Banking. But do female-oriented strategies render women a homogeneous group and contradict their shared underlying mission to emancipate them? Mr Rauscher disagrees. &quot;[Female banking] is just a concept so employees can be more sensitive to women&apos;s lifestyle approaches and the goals and dreams that they have. &quot;It&apos;s still important to ask women individually [what their needs are].&quot;", "tags": ["Business", "Gender", "Banking", "Pay", "Money", "UK news"], "title": "Money men develop a female focus as women's economic clout grows", "sentences": ["Other countries picking up on the trend include Bangladesh&apos;s Grameen Bank - 97% of the microcredit outfit&apos;s 7.24 million borrowers are women; Pakistan&apos;s First Women Bank and the Dubai Islamic Bank, which offers a women-only service called Johara Banking."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/30/genderissues.banking", "publicationDate": "2007-10-30T23:49:12Z"}, {"article": "He is one of the most respected - not to say feared - rugby players in the world. Capped almost 50 times for New Zealand and still only 26, Jerry Collins is already seen by many as one of the All Black greats. So pity the players from Newton Abbot rugby club in south Devon when none other than Collins himself trotted off the coach bringing Barnstaple&apos;s second team for their weekend game - and began limbering up. Collins, 17 stone and 6ft 3ins, had agreed to turn out for Barnstaple after meeting the team&apos;s head coach, Kevin Squire, in a restaurant while taking a holiday in the west country following New Zealand&apos;s exit from the World Cup last month. Mr Squire said: &quot;I did a double-take when I saw who it was and knew I had to introduce myself. He was very polite and unassuming. We talked for several minutes and I mentioned the club and invited him to come down and watch a game, but of course never expected him to turn up. He did though and even coached a session with the under-14 side, who were completely awestruck.&quot; Barnstaple have been relegated twice in the past four years and now play in the South West 2 West division - a little below international level. Still Mr Squire asked Collins if he fancied a game. &quot;I told him we had a match coming up and he was welcome to join us, but again I was gobsmacked when he showed up to catch the bus with the rest of the players.&quot; Collins, a blindside flanker, could not turn out for the first team but was eligible to appear in the seconds. &quot;It was very surreal for the lads as they are all amateurs - most are builders, bricklayers, plumbers and so on,&quot; said Mr Squire. &quot;He had even been to a sports store to buy a new pair of boots.&quot; On Saturday the Newton Abbot seconds heard a rumour that a famous player could be playing for Barnstaple. But Tom Meek, 32, who plays prop for Newton Abbot, said it was still a shock when Collins, sometimes known as the Terminator for his fierce tackling, arrived. &quot;There were a few jitters,&quot; said Mr Meek. &quot;But we sat down and said, &apos;He&apos;s only one man. There are 14 others. He can&apos;t really win the game on his own.&apos; But actually he could have. I had one close encounter - I thought I&apos;d handed him off but the next thing was flat on my face eating grass.&quot; Collins played at half speed or less but still managed to score a try and made three try-saving tackles, most notably when the Newton Abbot winger, Aidan Tolley, was gleefully flying through the air about to touch down. He never made it and instead was scooped up by Collins and hurled back down the field. For the record, the final score was 21-7 to Barnstaple. Newton Abbot coach Phil Burford said he didn&apos;t mind. &quot;You take it with a pinch of salt,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s not every day you get someone of his stature playing at your club - it was quite a shock. I think the second-team lads were pinching themselves after playing with such an icon.&quot; Things could get worse for opponents of Barnstaple. Not only has Collins said that he may play again for the team - there are rumours that All Black Dan Carter, arguably the best fly-half in the world, could turn out for them too. Newton Abbot flanker Andrew Breeze told how he lined up Collins for a tackle. &quot;I thought, this is your chance to put one of the best flankers in the world on his arse. &quot;He stepped to his left, stepped to his right and was gone. They scored a try from that. Were we scared? We come upon big men all the time.

The former Pakistan prime minister went to see her husband and three children in the Arab emirate, where she had been living in self-imposed exile for the past eight years. Her departure ended days of confusion over her travel plans. She said initially she would postpone her departure amid speculation that the president, General Pervez Musharraf, might impose emergency rule. She said at a news conference yesterday that senior party aides had told her such a move was possible if the supreme court found that Gen Musharraf&apos;s recent presidential election win was unconstitutional. A ruling could come as soon as tomorrow. The government has denied any intention to declare emergency rule. Ms Bhutto said at the news conference: &quot;I wanted to go to Dubai. But when these rumours surfaced, I decided to change my programme. &quot;If a state of emergency is imposed, we will not accept it,&quot; she said, speaking on behalf of her Pakistan People&apos;s party. &quot;If fundamental human rights are suspended, we will not accept it.&quot; A state of emergency would shatter long-standing efforts to create a power-sharing deal between Ms Bhutto and Gen Musharraf, the scenario favoured by the west as Pakistan faces an emboldened Islamist movement. Ms Bhutto has strenuously stated her opposition to emergency rule, which would make it impossible for her to ally herself with Gen Musharraf. Relations between Ms Bhutto and the government are already strained after an assassination attempt during her October 18 homecoming in Karachi, which killed 145 people. Ms Bhutto suspects that elements of Pakistan&apos;s intelligence services, the powerful ISI, had a hand in the plot. The government has vowed to track down those responsible for the atrocity, which was widely blamed on Islamist extremists fighting security forces near the Afghan border. But Pakistan&apos;s top judge, whom Gen Musharraf tried to fire earlier this year, has expressed impatience with the investigation and said he would open his own inquiry. The supreme court, led by the chief justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, will review the case to ensure the &quot;perpetrators of this barbaric act are brought to book, which will result in restoring the confidence of the nation in the system of governance,&quot; the court said. The court is already in the spotlight with its pending decision on the legality of Gen Musharraf&apos;s landslide victory. Opposition MPs have challenged the vote on the grounds that Gen Musharraf, who seized power in a coup in 1999, was ineligible to stand because he had retained his position as army chief. Gen Musharraf has said he would give up his military role before starting a new presidential term. But he declined on election night to say whether he would accept a negative verdict from the court. The court is also considering whether Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister ousted by Gen Musharraf eight years ago, should be allowed to return from exile to make a political comeback. As Gen Musharraf awaits the court&apos;s decisions, his government has to deal with almost daily attacks from extremists. In the latest show of force by militants, a suicide bomber on a motorbike rammed into a Pakistan air force bus, killing at least eight men and wounding about 40. The assailant struck at about 7am local time (2am GMT) near an airbase in Sargodha, about 125 miles south of Islamabad.

When one eminent historian, Sean Wilentz of Princeton, pronounces bluntly that George Bush the Younger is &quot;the worst president in American history&quot;, and another, Tony Judt of New York University, calls the Iraq war &quot;the worst foreign policy error in American history&quot;, not many of us will argue with them. And yet history still doesn&apos;t know the half of it. It has long since ceased to be a matter for debate that the Iraq adventure began in mendacity and ended in calamity. Sir Richard Dearlove&apos;s public penitence this week merely confirmed what he had already said privately, and not only has every single one of the original official reasons for the invasion been falsified, they have all been stood on their heads. Now even what many suspected was the ulterior motive - a war for oil - has gone awry Speaking at the LSE on Wednesday, Dearlove said the government had put &quot;too much emphasis on intelligence&quot; as a justification for the war in order to win parliamentary support. But even before the notorious specious dossiers were compiled - which is what he meant - he had already said with deadly candour in the July 2002 memo, written in greatest secrecy by Dearlove as head of MI6 for the eyes of Blair and his colleagues, that a decision for war had been taken, and that &quot;the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy&quot;. He might have added that, while there were no &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; in Iraq, there was a great deal of noxious weaponry, which went missing at the time of the invasion and has since been put to dreadful effect. Nor were there any fundamentalist terrorists in Iraq five years ago - Saddam Hussein was a secular tyrant, and had a very short way with Islamic zealots - but today the country is awash with jihadists. Many of them come from Saudi Arabia, whose monarch we have just greeted in such obsequious fashion so that we can continue corruptly to sell his country arms. As to the idea, flourished after the event by the dreaded liberal hawks as well as neoconservatives, that an invasion would bring democracy to Iraq, it&apos;s tempting to say that comment is superfluous. In fact there is still something to be said - and it was said by Jacques Chirac at a meeting with Tony Blair that has been described by Sir Stephen Wall. While reiterating his opposition to the war that was about to begin, Chirac made a number of specific points. He reminded Blair that he and his friend Bush knew nothing of the reality of war but that he did: 50 years ago, the young Chirac served as a conscript in the awful French war in Algeria, which Iraq resembles in all too many ways. Then he said that the Anglo-Saxons seemed to think that they would be welcomed with open arms, but they shouldn&apos;t count on it. In a very percipient point, Chirac added that a Shia majority shouldn&apos;t be confused with what we understand as democracy. He ended by asking whether Blair realised that, by invading Iraq, he might yet precipitate a civil war there. As the British left, Blair turned to his colleagues and said, doubtless with that boyish grin we happily see less of nowadays, &quot;Poor old Jacques, he just doesn&apos;t get it.&quot; Well, who got it? Even supposing that it had been possible to spread democracy at gunpoint, it&apos;s curious that anyone thought this would actually serve western interests. Reporting recently from Dubai under the droll headline &quot;US promotes free elections, only to see allies lose&quot;, Hassan Fattah of the New York Times observed drily that &quot;the paradox of American policy in the Middle East - promoting democracy on the assumption it will bring countries closer to the west - is that almost everywhere there are free elections, the American-backed side tends to lose&quot;. Well, yes. Then there&apos;s Blair&apos;s apparently sincere belief that he had an obligation to follow Washington&apos;s lead, because &quot;it would be more damaging to long-term world peace and security if the Americans alone defeated Saddam Hussein than if they had international support to do so&quot;, and that by offering such unconditional support he would &quot;keep the United States in the international system&quot;. Absurd in any case as theory, this too has been drastically confuted by events. As the hair-raising BBC programme No Plan No Peace has just confirmed beyond doubt, the British government had no influence whatsoever on American policy or conduct. Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary at the time of the invasion, has comically and humiliatingly contradicted himself as to whether he did or didn&apos;t oppose the crazy decisions to disband the Iraqi army - thereby setting loose large numbers of resentful armed fighters - and to dismiss all Ba&apos;ath party members - thereby denuding the country of administrators. In any case, what is now quite clear is that his views didn&apos;t matter one way or the other. If London meekly agreed with Washington, the Americans went ahead; if London shyly expressed reservations, the Americans took no notice and still went right ahead. Finally there is what has sometimes been dismissed as a conspiracy theory: that it was really a war for oil. This idea looks a little less cranky now that Alan Greenspan, the former head of the Federal Reserve Board, has acknowledged &quot;what everyone knows: the Iraq war is largely about oil&quot;. But here again, there was no need to await his verdict. After all, the most powerful man in British politics had told us the same thing even before the war began. &quot;The greatest thing to come out of this for the world economy,&quot; said Rupert Murdoch, &quot;would be $20 a barrel for oil.&quot; And so, on top of the whole list of false predictions and collapsed justifications, we have this final absurdity. As both Greenspan and Murdoch have very likely noticed, the price of oil hit a record $96 a barrel yesterday, and is still going up. In April 2003, our previous prime minister confidently pronounced that &quot;just as we had a strategy for war, so we have a strategy for peace&quot;. It is not pre-empting the judgment of history to say with even greater confidence that no good whatever has come out of this war, that no single good reason for it can any longer be adduced - and that &quot;we&quot; had never had any plan at all, not to say the faintest idea what &quot;we&quot; were doing. wheaty@compuserve.com", "tags": ["Politics", "US news", "Iraq", "World news", "UK news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Geoffrey Wheatcroft: The calamity of Iraq has not even won us cheap oil", "sentences": ["Reporting recently from Dubai under the droll headline &quot;US promotes free elections, only to see allies lose&quot;, Hassan Fattah of the New York Times observed drily that &quot;the paradox of American policy in the Middle East - promoting democracy on the assumption it will bring countries closer to the west - is that almost everywhere there are free elections, the American-backed side tends to lose&quot;."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/02/usa.iraq", "publicationDate": "2007-11-02T00:17:19Z"}, {"article": "Pakistan&apos;s supreme court today said it would move forward hearings on legal challenges to President General Pervez Musharraf&apos;s re-election last month. The court had planned to resume hearings on November 12, three days before Gen Musharraf&apos;s current term ends. But Javed Iqbal, head of the 11-member bench hearing the opposition challenges, said the court had rescheduled the case because of the climate of political uncertainty. The former prime minister Benazir Bhutto this week mentioned rumours that Gen Musharraf would declare emergency rule should the supreme court, which has been a thorn in his side, declare his re-election invalid. The opposition has challenged Gen Musharraf&apos;s landslide victory on the grounds that he should have first stood down as head of the army. Ms Bhutto, who travelled to Dubai yesterday to see her husband and children, had talked of cancelling her trip amid fears that Gen Musharraf would assume emergency powers in her absence. His government has denied any such intention. Mr Iqbal said efforts would be made to conclude the case in the shortest time. &quot;The court will not take any blame for the controversy being created,&quot; he said today. The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, today said the Bush administration opposed emergency rule, and that elections should go ahead next year. &quot;I am not going to get into the details of our conversations but I think it would be quite obvious that the United States would not be supportive of extra-constitutional means,&quot; Ms Rice told journalists while en route to Turkey. The US favours a power-sharing agreement between Gen Musharraf and Ms Bhutto, who survived a bloody assassination attempt in Karachi last month, to confront Islamist militants. But Ms Bhutto would find such an alliance impossible in the event of emergency rule. In a deal with Gen Musharraf, Ms Bhutto, who has spent the last eight years in effective exile, agreed not to boycott the October presidential election. In return, the president signed an amnesty that cleared away corruption charges against her and all other political leaders - except for Nawaz Sharif, another former prime minister who wants to return to politics. For now, Gen Musharraf will have to wait for the supreme court&apos;s verdict. The court, which has assumed an increasingly important role in Pakistani politics, has not flinched from challenging the government. In the latest show of defiance of Gen Musharraf, it rejected this week the government&apos;s decision to deport Mr Sharif when he tried to return to Pakistan in September. He wants to contest elections planned for early next year, further complicating Pakistan&apos;s political situation. The court ordered the government to allow Mr Sharif to return home, saying his deportation violated an earlier court ruling. According to the court, the prime minister, Shaukat Aziz, made preparations in advance to prevent Mr Sharif&apos;s return from exile. The court even admonished the chairman of Pakistan International Airlines for trying to conceal information about the incident. In March, Gen Musharraf tried to sack the supreme court&apos;s chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammed Chaudhry. But the move backfired when the court threw out misconduct charges against Mr Chaudhry and ordered him reinstated.

In a new policy announced last week, US foreign service officials will be forced to serve in Iraq or face disciplinary action - including dismissal - in the first order of its kind since the Vietnam war. Diplomats have reacted angrily, with one calling the directive a &quot;potential death sentence&quot;. Ambassador Ryan Crocker insisted diplomats who put their safety before that of the US were &quot;in the wrong line of business&quot;. &quot;As we try to staff the embassy in Iraq, it is good for all our colleagues to remember that we took an oath to serve our nation worldwide when we joined the foreign service, just as the military swore an oath,&quot; Mr Crocker told reporters in Dubai. The union representing diplomats has said security in Iraq is precarious and the completion of a new, heavily fortified embassy compound and living quarters in Baghdad has been dogged by logistical and construction problems. Mr Crocker said diplomats could not pick and choose their fight. &quot;It&apos;s not for us to decide if we like the policy or if the policy is rightly implemented,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s for us to go and serve, not to debate the policy, not to agree with it.&quot; The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, yesterday launched a worldwide appeal for volunteers after uproar over the new rules. She plans to send a cable to all US embassies abroad explaining the decision to launch the largest diplomatic call-up since Vietnam. The cable would make it clear that foreign service officers are obliged to uphold the oaths they took to carry out the policies of the US government and be available to serve anywhere. Under the new order, 200 to 300 diplomats have been identified as &quot;prime candidates&quot; for 48 vacancies coming up next year at the US embassy in Baghdad and in Iraqi provinces. Those notified have 10 days to accept or reject the offer. If too few say yes, some will be ordered to go. Only those with compelling reasons, such as a medical condition or extreme personal hardship, will be exempt from disciplinary action. Diplomats forced into service in Iraq will receive the same additional hardship pay, vacation time and choice of future assignments as those who have volunteered. The state department said that since the call-up to fill the 48 vacant Iraq posts was announced last Friday, 15 diplomats had volunteered to work there. &quot;The most important service for the US at the present time is in the world&apos;s hardest places,&quot; Mr Crocker said, referring to Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan. At a heated meeting on Wednesday, some diplomats spoke bluntly about the policy to begin &quot;directed assignments&quot; to fill up vacancies in Iraq. Jack Crotty, a member of the foreign service for 36 years, was among the most vocal, calling the forced deployment to the US embassy in Baghdad or in so-called provincial reconstruction teams in Iraq a &quot;potential death sentence&quot;. Ms Rice sought to dispel the impression that diplomats did not want to serve in Iraq. &quot;I am very sorry that the recounting of the comments of a few people left the impression that somehow the foreign service does not want to serve in Iraq,&quot; she said, on her way to Turkey. &quot;It could not be farther from the truth.&quot; Three foreign service personnel - two diplomatic security agents and one political officer - have been killed in Iraq since the war began in March 2003.", "tags": ["World news", "US news", "Iraq", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "US envoy defends forced diplomat call-ups to Iraq", "sentences": ["&quot;As we try to staff the embassy in Iraq, it is good for all our colleagues to remember that we took an oath to serve our nation worldwide when we joined the foreign service, just as the military swore an oath,&quot; Mr Crocker told reporters in Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/02/usa.iraq", "publicationDate": "2007-11-02T12:07:16Z"}, {"article": "Soldiers in Iraq endure any number of indignities: protecting a populace that wants them gone, defending a government at war with itself and its constituents, redeployments that leave them with increasingly less time back at home. Being professionals, they tend to accept what they call &quot;the suck&quot; as a part of the job, however unfortunate. One suck they have a hard time embracing, however, is the fact that, by and large, the 160,000 troops bear the burden of Iraq alone. The US state department is comparatively absent from the Iraq war, with the majority of its 200 diplomats holed up in the (relatively) secure Green Zone or scattered in a handful of bases around the country, leaving diplomacy largely in the hands of twentysomethings in uniform. Diplomats emphatically do not embrace the suck. The extent to which they&apos;re resisting it approaches outright insubordination. Defence department officials have grumbled all year that the military has to fill empty civilian jobs in Iraq, but despite promises from secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, little has been done to lighten the military&apos;s load. Last week, in a dramatic step, the department sent its foreign-service officers an ultimatum: unless 50 of them volunteered, officials would forcibly reassign diplomats to Iraq. Diplomatic conscription hasn&apos;t occurred since Vietnam. Something unexpected happened in response: a full-scale revolt. On Wednesday, the head of the foreign service, Harry Thomas, hosted a town-hall meeting at the state department to discuss the call-up. It became a free for all. The chief of the diplomat&apos;s union pointed out that a recent poll found that only 12% of diplomats think Rice has their best interests at heart. A frustrated Thomas, who said he was &quot;insulted&quot; by the poll, compared his diplomats&apos; perspective to support for slavery. Another veteran diplomat called service in Iraq a &quot;potential death sentence,&quot; adding, &quot;any other embassy in the world would be closed by now.&quot; He drew sustained applause. Thomas, beaten, adjourned the meeting. Foreign service officers, it should be noted, swear an oath to serve anywhere they&apos;re assigned, but rarely has a diplomatic need been so intense as to warrant forcible service. Indeed, for the past several years the state department has endeavored to make service in a &quot;hardship post&quot; a requirement for promotion, with mixed results. Unlike the US military, the state department doesn&apos;t inculcate into its diplomats an expeditionary culture, nor does it prepare young foreign service officers to conduct diplomacy in war zones. But senior state department officials were clearly caught off guard by the diplomatic revolt. In Dubai, Ryan Crocker, the US ambassador to Iraq, tied the resistance to a re-litigation of the invasion, saying: &quot;It&apos;s for us to go and serve, not to debate the policy, not to agree with it.&quot; But it&apos;s far from clear that the diplomatic resistance derives from opposition to the war. Self-preservation, after all, is a much more powerful disincentive to Iraq service. Diplomats, who until now had the option of not going to Iraq, don&apos;t see much in it for them to volunteer, particularly when most of them don&apos;t have experience or expertise specific to the Middle East. &quot;At this point it seems that there&apos;s a strong sense that the benefit of serving in Iraq is being watered down. By benefit, I mean promotion, recognition, etc,&quot; a diplomat told me when I asked earlier this year about the reluctance to go to Iraq. &quot;State folks aren&apos;t in it for the money - and that&apos;s the largest benefit of serving in Iraq.&quot; It&apos;s tempting to contrast the diplomatic resistance to Iraq with the military&apos;s culture of selfless service. Earlier this year, after all, the commandant of the marine corps, general James Conway, expressed his desire to see &quot;every marine into the fight.&quot; And no matter what someone&apos;s view of the war is, the idea that an instrument of national power would resist a legal order to serve where the country required him to is hard to accept. After all, nearly every liberal&apos;s plan to end the war involves a &quot;diplomatic surge.&quot; If the diplomats refuse to surge, hopes for averting post-occupation chaos diminish significantly. But it&apos;s important to keep in mind that diplomats aren&apos;t soldiers. Although it&apos;s hardly unprecedented for diplomacy to happen amid a war, the state department&apos;s posture toward conflict diplomacy reveals a binary mentality: war represents the breakdown of diplomacy, and a return to diplomacy represents the end of war. Counterinsurgency, which the military has also been slow to embrace, shows the inadequacy of that model. Diplomatic and political activity must occur during hostilities if the combatants are to believe that their struggle for power is better achieved politically. Even if Iraq is an impossible mission, the current paradigm isn&apos;t going away, and so the state department has to train, equip and support its diplomats accordingly. Otherwise we&apos;re going to see the soldiers bearing, permanently, an unfair burden of a militarized foreign policy - something sure to yield domestic acrimony, to say nothing of a whole lot more lost wars.

Traditionally, a PCO is an order which suspends the constitution and dissolves all fundamental rights as well as legislation and judiciary, installing martial law. Except that Musharraf&apos;s PCO only dissolves the judiciary (for overstepping its limits and interfering with the war on terror) while leaving the Assembly intact. The limited scope of the PCO means the current situation is something less than martial law. Yet it cannot rightly be called an emergency either, because that does not involve a PCO. This in-between situation is being called &quot;emergency plus&quot;. Musharraf&apos;s act comes at a time when Pakistan has almost 100,000 troops in the Waziristan region, battling the Taliban. Meanwhile, the country is being hit by almost daily suicide bombings (since July, more than 450 people have been killed by terrorists). Islamist militants recently ambushed and held 250 solders hostage, and another 48 soldiers were paraded as a trophy by a Taliban commander. Throughout this time, Musharraf has rejected US Centcom&apos;s offer to send American troops, arguing that Pakistan&apos;s army can handle its own internal situation. The emergency comes shortly before a series of petitions were to be heard by the Pakistani supreme court. These petitions would have questioned: Musharraf&apos;s standing to run for president in the forthcoming elections while staying in uniform; the waiving of the corruption charges against former prime minister Benazir Bhutto; and the legality of Musharraf&apos;s re-exiling of former conservative prime minister Nawaz Sharif. The date for argument was set for Friday, November 3, but was recently moved to the November 5 and 6. Obviously, in this Machiavellian stroke, Musharraf has pre-empted the hearing. The last act of the sitting supreme court - which was hardly a non-political actor itself - was to issue a ruling stating that Musharraf&apos;s actions were illegal. It urged all superior judges to resist taking an oath under Musharraf&apos;s PCO. However, as it stands, four supreme court justices have taken an oath to uphold Musharraf&apos;s PCO. Benazir Bhutto, the recently returned former prime minister (who oddly enough decided to go to a family reunion in Dubai earlier in the week even while being aware of the likelihood of something like this occurring) is returning to Pakistan spouting all sorts of populist rhetoric, making one wonder why she left in the first place. My guess is that she will throw a fake fit, while Musharraf consolidates. Earlier, US secretary of state Condoleeza Rice had told Musharraf that the US would not accept martial law, and had sent a top Pentagon general to Pakistan. However, her pro-democracy rhetoric is considered by most Pakistani commentators to be merely that. People are well aware that Pakistan, which is now the third highest recipient of US aid (after Iraq and Israel), could not get away with the emergency if the US truly did not wish to see it happen. Ultimately, the US will do its best to sound like a magnanimous defender of democracy while being perfectly aware that there are not any better options for it. In other words, do not expect sudden talk about regime change coming out of Washington. There is a segment of Pakistan - which includes the judges, lawyers, and journalists - which wants to take to the streets. They have dominated the news over the past year and they want to make a democratic push, with some people casting the lawyers in the same role as the Burmese monks. However, Musharraf&apos;s shrewd move of setting forth a limited PCO - targeting only the judiciary and leaving the assemblies intact - has neutralised this segment of the population. The illusion of popular participation is retained, while Musharraf&apos;s most vexing political opponents - the judges - get sidelined. If he had gone further and cancelled elections, it would have ignited a firestorm, but in his talk to Pakistani public (discussed below), he assured that he would do no such thing. Disengaged western audiences, pumped full of the current pro-democracy intoxicants, will almost universally decry Musharraf&apos;s behaviour. I decry it too, precisely because I am a disengaged westerner and I have that luxury. However, the story in Pakistan is not so straightforward. What I am being told by bazari merchants, some young professionals, and some industrialists in Karachi and Lahore is that they merely care for stability, whether it comes in the form of the military, or in the form of democracy. Incidentally, many of them believe that it is Musharraf who is more likely to assure that stability. A couple of people, with middle class businesses, suggested to me that Musharraf should behave more like a dictator; a secular version of the previous Islamist dictator, Zia ul Haq, in order to assure stability for business and economic growth. However, that is a minority view. The democratic push in Pakistan is not some sort of romantic affair pitting slaves against a demonic genocidal Stalin. Musharraf made his errors (like the Red Mosque fiasco and the disappearances linked to the War on Terror) but he is not homicidal. Cinema, music, the arts and freedom of press are thriving in Pakistan. The popular satire programme - &quot;We are Expecting&quot; - has a regular character mocking Musharraf, which does nothing more than grunt and proclaim &quot;Yes!&quot; in a loud voice. Musharraf has, in fact, helped the Pakistani economy and business, admitted even by democracy-promoting analysts. Until this year, when the democracy push struck, construction projects were booming and money from Dubai was pouring in. In fact, a study published by the anti-military newspaper, Dawn, showed that: &quot;Nonetheless, in the eight year period since the latest take over by the military, the size of the economy increased by almost 50% and that of income per head of the population by nearly 25%.&quot; Some opportunistic opposition politicians - who have no real interest in saving Pakistan themselves, as their track record demonstrates - will, undoubtedly, make calls for civil disobedience, agitating for strikes at schools and hospitals, and forcibly drafting the poor into their plans so they can install their own cronies in power. Protected by their feudal wealth, and security services, they will send the powerless out to do their bidding. For the time being, though, it appears that Musharraf is committed to the forthcoming parliamentary elections. In his just-concluded speech to the country he outlined his three-step programme for democracy. Stage 1 was from 1999 to 2001 when he ran the government directly. During stage 2, from 2001 to 2007, everyone was elected except for the president, and, in fact, it was the first time that the national, provincial and local bodies were all composed of elected officials. Stage 3 is ongoing now, with the assemblies finishing their tenure on November 15, followed by presidential elections (in which he will run) and then general assembly elections (which are expected to anoint Benazir Bhutto as prime minister). He argued that the judiciary, which had become highly politicised, inefficient, and a hindrance in the fight against the legitimate terrorist threat, needed to be removed. He cited evidence of the fact that supreme court had freed 81 blacklisted terrorists, along with re-opening numerous extremist madrassas. In his speech he compared himself to Abraham Lincoln who, during the American civil war, in order to preserve the constitution, had to violate some parts of the constitution. He concluded by putting an emphasis on jobs, money and taxes, and warned against militants who kill Pakistani Muslims in the name of Islam. Supporters of freedom and democracy in Pakistan are in a difficult position because they are having to rely on the promises of an autocrat. Whether Pakistanis decide to wait it out for a few more months or stand up against Musharraf now, remains to be seen. Editor&apos;s note: This article was written on Saturday.

The action to reassert his flagging authority was, he said, a response to Islamic militancy and to the &apos;paralysis of government by judicial interference&apos;. He said his country&apos;s sovereignty was at stake. Judges and lawyers were arrested, army troops poured on to city streets and television and radio stations were taken off the air. Musharraf also suspended the constitution and fired the chief justice, Muhammad Iftikhar Chaudhry, who spearheaded a powerful mass movement against him earlier this year. Soldiers entered the Supreme Court late this afternoon where Chaudhry and six other judges said Musharraf&apos;s declaration that he would rule under a provisional constitutional order was illegal. Chaudhry was reportedly under house arrest. Police sealed off the main street in central Islamabad and soldiers entered the state television and radio buildings. Private news networks went off the air and mobile-phone coverage was intermittent. Shots were heard in several neighbourhoods of Karachi, where there is strong support for former prime minister and opposition leader Benazir Bhutto who had gone to Dubai on Thursday on a personal visit. She arrived back to Pakistan to a rapturous welcome last night and immediately decried Musharraf&apos;s move as tantamount to dictatorship. &apos;Unless General Musharraf reverses the course, it will be very difficult to have fair elections,&apos; she said. The United States, which sees Musharraf as a crucial ally against al-Qaeda in Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan, had urged Musharraf to avoid taking authoritarian measures and called the move &apos;very disappointing&apos;. This evening Musharraf addressed the nation on state television. He said he decided to impose a state of emergency in response to a rise in extremism and to interference from the courts and judges in the business of government. Pakistan&apos;s internal security has deteriorated sharply in recent months with a wave of suicide attacks by al-Qaeda-inspired militants, including one that killed 139 people. There had been increasing speculation that Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup, might declare an emergency rather than run the risk the Supreme Court would rule against his re-election as president. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she was &apos;deeply dismayed&apos; by the move and Whitehall expressed &apos;grave concern&apos;. &apos;A state of emergency would be a sharp setback for Pakistani democracy and takes Pakistan off the path toward civilian rule,&apos; said a spokesman for the State Department, Sean McCormack. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband urged restraint on all sides. He said he was &apos;gravely concerned&apos; and that the UK would raise concerns &apos;at the highest level&apos;. Britons of Pakistani origin were also urged to use their contacts to press home the message by the Foreign Secretary. &apos;All friends of Pakistan will be concerned by the turn of events today,&apos; he said. &apos;We recognise the threat to peace and security faced by the country, but its future rests on harnessing the power of democracy and the rule of law.&apos; Musharraf had promised to resign as army chief by 15 November, with general elections due by mid-January. Those elections are now in doubt, as is a power-sharing deal with Bhutto. &apos;She is waiting to see if she is going to be arrested or deported,&apos; Wajid Hasan, her spokesman, said after speaking to the former prime minister. Musharraf has faced a series of crises over the past year, including street protests, court challenges and spiralling Islamist violence. Last week troops mounted a major assault on an Islamist rebel cleric who has declared his own Islamic mini-state in Swat, a previously peaceful area popular with tourists. But the greatest threat to Musharraf&apos;s power was the Supreme Court, which was due to rule in the coming weeks on the legality of his controversial 8 October re-election as president. As the result of an opposition boycott, he received 98 per cent of votes. The legal challenge has now been effectively quashed, but emergency rule raises a range of new problems including the possibility of widespread public protest and a further breakdown of Pakistan&apos;s battered state institutions. Today police arrested opposition politicians and senior lawyers including the chief justice&apos;s lawyer, Aitzaz Ahsan and Imran Khan. &apos;Musharraf is acting like a spoiled child, holding the whole country hostage. These are the last days of Pervez Musharraf,&apos; said Ahsan as he was escorted from his home into a police van. Ahsan, who leads the Supreme Court bar association, said that lawyers would launch a series of nationwide protests on Monday. Hardliners in Musharraf&apos;s political party, PML-Q, who fear a power-sharing deal with Bhutto, have been urging him to impose emergency rule for months. But others have opposed today&apos;s move. One senior PML-Q official, who declined to be named, told The Observer that the move was a disaster and predicted it would eventually spell &apos;the end for Musharraf&apos;. Human Rights Watch condemned today&apos;s move as &apos;a brazen attempt at muzzling the judiciary&apos;.", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Pakistan declares state of emergency", "sentences": ["Shots were heard in several neighbourhoods of Karachi, where there is strong support for former prime minister and opposition leader Benazir Bhutto who had gone to Dubai on Thursday on a personal visit."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/03/pakistan.declanwalsh", "publicationDate": "2007-11-03T20:58:07Z"}, {"article": "Dr Michio Kaku is a Japanese-American theoretical physicist with lovely flowing white hair and a voice so soothing and hypnotic that even if he was warning us that Nazi nanobots were about to turn the whole of mankind into slaves, we&apos;d probably feel quite mellow about it. Kaku&apos;s predictions of the future, outlined in a three part BBC4 series Visions Of The Future, are almost this alarming. We are, he claims, at a crossroads in evolution where machines are becoming more human-like and humans are becoming more machine-like. In the first episode he predicts an imminent future where micro chips are inserted into our brains (to cure mental illnesses among other things) while, in tandem, robots are built programmed with emotions. Like many bold predictions of the future Dr Kaku is able to confidently predict what will happen in 20 years time because it&apos;s already happening today. In the first programme we meet a depressed woman magically transformed into a smiling optimist with the aid of a chip inserted into her sad little head and some shy students who spend their entire lives in virtual online worlds as undead priests slaying dragons instead of revising or drinking their age in pints of cider. Then we meet Asimo, a charming four-foot tall robot with impeccable manners whose job is to show Honda HQ reception visitors to a table while making idle small talk and walking in the manner of a three-year-old with a soiled nappy, then fetch them some orange juice. This is all very well but what we&apos;re really interested in is what we can expect to buy from Dixons in 2027. Thankfully Kaku does offer up some more enjoyable predictions such as smart clothing with in built heart monitors, GPS ear-rings, personal fabricators that rearrange molecules to create whatever we want and face-recognition spectacles. As great as these are there is one overarching truth about the scientific prophecies in the series - the future was a lot more fun in the past.  1980s  1980s futurology was obsessed with video - video shades, video watches, video tattoos, robots with VCR slots, video killing radio stars. According to 1980s brainiacs we&apos;d have so much leisure time in the next century (because robots would be doing everything) that we&apos;d have little else to do except lounge around in white bucket chairs and go on holidays - including holidays in space. The 1981 book School, Work And Play does a brilliant job of explaining that our &quot;home videophone computers&quot; will make our travel arrangements for us and that we&apos;ll be suctioned to space terminals in underground vacuum bullet trains, but less plausible is that we&apos;ll be rocketing towards Space Islands made to look like South Sea beaches where we can enjoy &quot;weightless games and experience other such delights that only the Space Islands can offer&quot;. Don&apos;t worry if you&apos;ve booked into a Spanish-speaking Space Island - if you don&apos;t speak the language you can hire a machine that instantly translates every word. In Back To The Future II, made in 1989 Michael J Fox travelled forward in time to 2015. If their inventions materialise, the world&apos;s youth will shortly be riding Hoverboards, wearing self-drying jackets and self-tying trainers, and magnifying pizzas in Black &amp; Decker Rehydraters. What they got right:  Author William Gibson predicted the internet in Neuromancer as well as the popularity of reality TV. 1950s  The future predicted by 1950s futurologists promised a brighter, cleaner push-button tomorrow powered by atomic energy. The cover story of the February 1950 edition of Popular Mechanics promised readers &quot;Miracles you&apos;ll see in the next 50 years&quot;. Sadly we&apos;re yet to see most of them. In their imagined year 2000 suburb of super convenience &quot;soup and milk are delivered in the form of frozen bricks&quot;, &quot;sawdust and wood pulp are converted into sugary foods&quot;, rayon underwear is recycled into candy, men &quot;whisk away whiskers with a chemical solution&quot; and soluble plastic plates are thrown away after eating. Better still there&apos;s none of the usual dusting and vacuuming for the housewife of tomorrow (they weren&apos;t forward thinking enough to imagine house husbands) - because everything in her home is waterproof so she does the cleaning with a hose. Could happen. Cars meanwhile are so old fashioned, the family of the future go everywhere in their teardrop-shaped helicopter that they park on the roof. We&apos;ve all got one of them obviously. What they got right:  Solar power was widely predicted as the energy of the future. 1930s  Ever since the first Ford was produced, people had been claiming that in decades to come we would be commuting to work in flying cars. Early attempts were simply wings and an aircraft engine bolted on to existing cars, but at the 1939 World&apos;s Fair a hybrid aerocar was displayed that had everyone imagining their home of the future would need to come with a runway instead of a drive. This was also the era when they imagined everyone eating steak and kidney pie flavoured pills for tea and personal jetpacks being standard issue alongside our wrist phones - the fabled jetpack was pioneered by the Buck Rogers comic strip and film series featuring the time travelling waging war on the hordes of Mongo with the aid of a nifty &quot;degravity belt&quot;. There were also plenty of robots in the science fiction and future predictions of the 1930s, although they tend to fall into two categories - maids and butlers. Of the latter breed there was a famous metal man called Elektro, who if newspaper cuttings are to be believed, was the toast of New York courtesy of his two abilities - smoking cigars and conducting orchestras. Useful. With the onset of the second world war, however, forward thinkers were quick to imagine less friendly relatives of Elektro, 100 feet tall &quot;controlled by wireless&quot; and fighting against rival machines from other nations. What they got right: HG Wells 1936 book Things To Come predicted among many other future inventions - flat screen TVs and mobile phones. Still waiting for the underground cities though.  1900s  The turn of the century saw a boom in predictions of what life would be like in the year 2000. Among the heady ideas being touted by scientists of the day were weather control machines (giant house sized trumpets used to blow away clouds), roofed cities, combined ship and railway locomotives. However, the best insights into what people of this era expected a hundred years in the future can be found in of the December 1900 issue of the Ladies Home Journal which, despite being wrong about there being no flies or peas, the size of beetroot in the future is surprisingly close with it&apos;s other forecasts such as &quot;ready cooked meals&quot; which will be delivered by pneumatic tubes, &quot;grand opera will be telephoned to private homes&quot; and &quot;wireless telegraph circuits will span the world&quot;. As for their idea that the letters C, Q and X will be abandoned from the alphabet - it&apos;s only a matter of time. What they got right: The Paris Exposition of 1900 demonstrated a fully functional moving sidewalk. Exactly like those we see at airports today, except ladies sat on park benches while they travelled.

But that was the rather more fresh-faced Pervez Musharraf when he seized power in a bloodless coup eight years ago. And it was the same image last night, although the beleaguered military ruler looked emotional and strained as he made a last-ditch attempt to rescue his ailing power base. As the country was plunged into a fresh crisis Musharraf gesticulated into the camera as he blamed his woes on the country&apos;s Islamist extremists, its activist judges and its &apos;negative media&apos;. The country was at a &apos;dangerous juncture&apos; he warned, clenching his fist. &apos;Now is the time for action.&apos; By then his forces were on the move. Soldiers were occupying barbed wire checkposts on Islamabad&apos;s central avenue leading to the supreme court, where chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry had been told his services were &apos;no longer required&apos;. Armed police escorted the judge back to his Islamabad residence, and a replacement, Abdul Hamid Dogar, was hurriedly sworn in by Musharraf. Earlier, as Saturday shoppers rushed home and mobile phone networks shut down, Chaudhry and six of the 16 other supreme court judges rejected the emergency declaration, ordering Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and the military not to comply with it. Television screens across the country went blank as private news channels, who have fuelled this year&apos;s democratic debate, were pulled off the air. Only sports, cartoon and the state television station were operating. Pakistan television showed new head judges being sworn in at the provincial courts with uniformed army officers hovering in the background. Musharraf&apos;s Western allies, who have worked hard to keep him in power while retaining a veneer of democracy in Pakistan, immediately issued condemnations. The move was particularly embarrassing to the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, who had publicly urged Musharraf not to declare martial law late last week. &apos;The US has made clear it does not support extra-constitutional measures because those measures take Pakistan away from the path of democracy and civilian rule,&apos; she told reporters in Turkey. Nuclear power and arch-rival India issued a carefully worded statement regretting the &apos;difficult times that Pakistan is passing through&apos; and hoping that &apos;conditions of normalcy will soon return&apos;. Britain and the US want Musharraf to strike a power-sharing deal with recently returned opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. Her Islamist-fighting credentials were boosted after the Karachi suicide bombing that killed 140 people. Last night she said: &apos;We condemn this martial law. We will protest it,&apos; she told a news conference in Karachi shortly after arriving from Dubai, where she had been visiting her family. Musharraf has lurched from crisis to crisis since 9 March, when a botched attempt to fire Chaudhry, triggered massive public protests. His troubles intensified after the Red Mosque siege in Islamabad, which left more than 100 people dead and triggered a wave of Islamist violence including suicide bombings and attacks on sensitive military targets. Tribal militants and al-Qaeda fighters in Waziristan have engaged in bloody battles with the 90,000 government soldiers sent to fight them. This week another 2,500 police and soldiers struggled to quell a revolt led by an extremist Islamist cleric in Swat, a previously peaceful area in the north. But the greatest threat to Musharraf&apos;s power came from the supreme court, which had been due to rule in the coming weeks on the legality of General Musharraf&apos;s controversial re-election on 8 October. Musharraf had threatened to impose emergency rule if the court found against him. Many analysts expected the court to rule in his favour to prevent further destabilisation of the country. Yesterday Musharraf showed that he wasn&apos;t willing to take a chance. In his television address last night, Musharraf could not hide his dislike for the court. The court&apos;s tough attitude against government officials was &apos;disheartening&apos; and &apos;demoralising&apos; he said. &apos;They are creating hurdles for democracy - I cannot allow this country to commit suicide.&apos; Switching to English from his native Urdu, he appealed to his western allies to have patience. &apos;Please do not expect or demand your level of democracy which you have learned over a number of centuries. We are also trying to learn, please give us time,&apos; he said. Police arrested opposition politicians including former cricketer Imran Khan and the head of the influential Supreme Court Bar Association, Aitzaz Ahsan, who said: &apos;Musharraf has behaved like a bad loser and spoilt child.

Lawyer Asma Jahangir has uploaded details of her 90-day detention order.  Ange on teeth maestro makes some interesting points. &quot;Ironically the President (who has lost his marbles) said that he had to clamp down on the press and the judiciary to curb terrorism. Those he has arrested are progressive, secular minded people while the terrorists are offered negotiations and ceasefires.&quot; 11.05am &quot;It&apos;s a sweep against the intelligensia in Pakistan,&quot; a lawyer under house arrest tells BBC News 24. Every lawyer she knows has been arrested, she says.  Pakistan should release hundreds of judges, lawyers and activists it has detained since the declared state of emergency, Louise Arbour, the UN&apos;s top human rights official has demanded. &quot;A state of emergency should only be used to deal with a dire security threat to the nation, not to undermine the integrity and independence of the judiciary,&quot; Ms Arbour said in a statement, according to Associated Press. My colleague Mark Tran recommends a recent BBC documentary entitled Dinner with the President for an insight into General Musharraf. Here&apos;s a clip.    11.50am US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice has urged Musharraf to hold elections and resign as head of the army.  &quot;We believe that the best path for Pakistan is to quickly return to a constitutional path and then to hold elections,&quot; she told a news conference during a visit to the West Bank. &quot;President Musharraf has said that he will take off his uniform. That would be an important step.&quot;  12noon    More than a 1,500 lawyers have been arrested across Pakistan according to the news agency AKI. &quot;It&apos;s a classic military coup&quot;, even though Musharraf originally came to power on the back of coup an expert tells Sky News. The police have confirmed that 1,500 have been arrested according to the BBC. 12.35pm Ange fears the worst at &quot;Sock it to the Man&quot; protest at the Karachi Press Club, that is currently under way. The latest post on Teeth Maestro says: &quot;The roads around the KPC have been cordoned off and it is predicted that that the police opposition to the protest will be one extremely brutal scene. Protesters have been urged to bring helmets and other personal safety gear to dodge rubber bullets, tear gas and batons with the request to stay peaceful and keep the protest non-violent even if provoked by the police since a non-violent protest sends across a powerful yet effective message.&quot; A new group on Facebook, the Society for the Objection to Emergency Rule in Pakistan is gathering members. It&apos;s up to more than 700 so far. Dr Arwab via a Blackberry tells Ange at Teeth Maestro about the Karachi press club protest. He/she says: &quot;I&apos;m at the protest taking pictures but not going through on email, one journalist severely beaten and about 5 arrested&quot;. 2.10pm The elections in Pakistan will go ahead in Janaury as scheduled, according to prime minister Shaukat Aziz. Geo TV, one of the only Pakistani TV news channels still broadcasting (over the internet via the United Arab Emirates) suggests that the protest outside the Karachi press club has been broken up after a number of arrests. Its English language bulletin says news of the situation across the country is spreading by word of mouth. Since Saturday evening up to 1,800 people have been detained nationwide, an unnamed Interior Ministry official told Associated Press. They include opposition leaders, lawyers and human rights activists, it said.    3pm The National Assembly has been summoned to meet on Wednesday, according the Associated Press of Pakistan.  Shehbaz Sharif, the exiled head of the opposition part Pakistan Muslim League and brother of former prime minister Nawaz , has condemned the response of the western governments.  &quot;What we expect from them is to ensure that if this law is not rolled back, and Musharraf does not step back ... then they must cease to support him,&quot; Mr Sharif told a news conference in London, according to Reuters. 4.15pm The elections will be held by mid-January the attorney general Malik Abdul Qayyum has confirmed. &quot;The election will be held within the next 60 days,&quot; he told Reuters. This is being seen as a sop to the west. Why is Bhutto&apos;s PPP not joining in the protests? BBC News 24 asks.    4.45pm Gen Musharraf says he will honour his commitment to step down from the army, but only after his corrective measures. Speaking on state TV he said: &quot;I&apos;m determined to remove my uniform once we correct these pillars in judiciary and the executive and the parliament.&quot;  Ange on Teeth Maestro suggests there is confusion about whether Musharraf really is in control. He/she points to a report that troops are marching towards to parliament and also highlights conflicting statements today on whether elections will be called.   5pm Hasan Mubarek on Lahore Metblogs says todays protests have been confined to lawyers, journalists and human rights activists. The post says: &quot;How things turn out as we enter the third day under Emergency rule still remains unpredictable as today&apos;s protests may or may not trigger other sections of society to come out and raise public voice against government&apos;s actions.&quot; A spokesman for Nawaz Sharif&apos;s party claimed that that authorities had rounded up around 2,300 of its supporters, according to Associated Press.  Events in the last few days have set back the transition to democracy in Pakistan, Britain&apos;s foreign secretary David Miliband said at a press conference. He called for a reversal of the media black out, and urged Pakistan to hold elections and for Musharraf to stand down from the army.  He conceded that the security situation in Pakistan is testing. But he added: &quot;We need the moderate majority to be rallied, in elections.&quot; Mr Miliband also called for clarity about whether elections will be held.", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan"], "title": "Emergency rule in Pakistan: Monday", "sentences": ["10.40am Did Benzir Bhutto know this was coming when she left for Dubai last week?"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2007/nov/05/emergencyruleinpakistanmon", "publicationDate": "2007-11-05T09:18:59Z"}, {"article": "The prosecution allege that Fallon and fellow riders Fergal Lynch and Darren Williams agreed with others not to permit these horses to run on their merits in these races, and that riding practices would, if necessary, be used which would interfere with the running of these horses.

Actually completely OTT,&quot; said Paul Coombes, Miss Dextrous&apos;s alter ego. She moonlights as an agony aunt with a robust line, offering brutal advice to people whose partners have cooled on them. &quot;I think a lot of people come because they&apos;re just curious - gay weddings are still quite new, they may never have been to a partnership registration ceremony, they&apos;ll just want to see what&apos;s on offer. Straights, too.&quot; Like most wedding fairs the show features firms offering clothes, flowers, catering, musicians, three-tier cakes, matching wedding rings including ones in stainless steel, or \u00a3499 platinum rings inscribed with vows such as &quot;I take you to be my partner for life&quot;, photo albums - the \u00a324.99 one with a folded paper sculpture of identical tuxedos has been a bestseller - cars, honeymoon travel agencies. There were no white meringue dresses, and also a few unusual features: legal advice on making wills, on funeral arrangements, and on how to make provisions for children often of earlier heterosexual relationships, on civil rights and equality legislation. The honeymoon firms do not just feature couples walking arm in arm into the sunset, but advice on where not to go. Jamaica is emphatically not recommended, and several of the island&apos;s luxury resorts will not admit gay couples at all. Dubai, with guaranteed sand and sun, seemed an attractive option to one couple last year: they and eight members of their wedding party ended up in jail. Yesterday was the fourth Gay Wedding Show, and in an ideal world Gino Meriano, co-founder of a firm called Pink Weddings, thinks the fairs he started should not exist. &quot;I don&apos;t want to be doing this, I&apos;d rather be getting on with my gay rights campaigning. I&apos;d stop tomorrow if I thought that society was now fully inclusive, and that gay couples could just go to any firm on the high street and be treated like any other couple - but it isn&apos;t, and they can&apos;t.&quot; Their office, in demure Weybridge in Surrey, no longer has a high street shopfront, after previous premises in London were splattered with paint, potential customers were followed and jeered at or had their cars vandalised, and they themselves received vicious anonymous letters including death threats. His own father only learned of his wedding in the paper, and his partner&apos;s family has not accepted the relationship at all. Pink Weddings&apos; research suggests that up to a quarter of the conventional wedding market actively or tacitly discourages gay custom, anything from calls not returned to dropped jaws or stifled giggles if two men go into a high street jeweller to buy matching rings. &quot;Most people, if they want to organise such a special day, don&apos;t want to have to start explaining their sex life. They just want all that to be taken for granted,&quot; Mr Meriano said. There are some striking exceptions to this depressing rule. The show was sponsored by middle England&apos;s favourite corner shop, the John Lewis Partnership. &quot;We have always catered for civil partnership celebrations,&quot; a spokeswoman said, &quot;and have even noticed a significant increase in the number of same sex gift lists registered at John Lewis since civil partnerships became legal in December 2005.&quot; Moss Bros, the formal dress hire company, has also embraced this market from the start, and the National Trust sought a meeting before the partnership legislation to assure Pink Weddings that it welcomes gay weddings in its properties. Pink Weddings organised Mr Meriano&apos;s own partnership ceremony and celebration with Mike - who has taken his surname - on the day it became law, making them one of the first legally recognised gay couples in the country.  The party was full English breakfast at the Metropole in Brighton, with guests invited to bring Christmas decorations with special inscriptions, to decorate a towering tree. They have organised weddings for others, with two aisles for two women both being given away by their fathers, with no aisle because no member of either family would come, and with beloved pets participating as Best Dog. Most of their couples are older, more assured and confident about what they want, but they&apos;ve had people meekly ask if they&apos;re &quot;allowed&quot; a wedding cake. Amber Dextrous spent the day cajoling, encouraging and reassuring couples towards the double rings and the registration book, but neither she nor Paul Coombes - a valleys boy astonished at how well Amber is received in miners&apos; halls and working men&apos;s clubs in the small towns and villages of his childhood - has quite got there. &quot;I think gay weddings are great, but like any wedding it is a really serious step. It&apos;s got to be the right person, and for me that just hasn&apos;t happened yet.&quot; Trendwatch: Civil partnership ceremonies The theme Moroccan is the most popular.

You judged it wasn&apos;t appropriate to do that. Why did you take that view? ... MK: Well the role of the Bank of England is not to do what banks ask us to do; it\u0131s to do what\u0131s in the interest of the country as a whole. And we took the view that bailing out those banks that have taken the biggest risks will provide no incentive in the future to avoid this happening all over again. And I remember very clearly being telephoned by more than one bank and being told: &quot;We got out of the market in these strange instruments two years ago, and the financial press we said we weren&apos;t very exciting and we weren&apos;t growing as quickly as other banks and we made less profit. Our time has now come \u2014 the other banks that did take the risks are having to accumulate liquidity and cutback on their lending in order to do so. But now, because we were more prudent in the past, now we can expand.&quot;  If you bail out the banks that took the risks then you\u0131ll undermine any incentives that we had to be prudent. And so it is important to give incentives to banks to behave prudently and if they take risks to recognise that they have to bear the consequences of those risks, because they had made the profits in the years leading up to this year. So it is important to ensure the incentives are there for banks to realise that they have to take the consequences of the risks that they undertake. That is what happens in any other industry. RP: A few days after the run on Northern Rock you then did provide a 3-month facility, and say that banks could swap mortgage assets for this money. And you did charge slightly more than the best rate for it, and in the end it wasn\u0131t taken up, but what was your thinking? MK: Well the thinking was that after the run on Northern Rock, and the impact of the television pictures, it became evident that many of the funders of British banks around the world were no longer fund willing to fund British banks, so we felt that, provided the banks were willing to pay the penalty rate, that we should make sure that they did have access to the liquidity. But they weren\u0131t being bailed out because they were having to pay more for the money than if they had taken out the insurance beforehand, so those banks that had behaved prudently were not having to pay as much money for this special liquidity as the banks that really needed it and that facility was there for those banks that really needed the money. As it turned out no one really did need the money, but if they had been willing to borrow they could have had it at the penalty rate. RP: What a number of banks said to me was that it would have looked like desperation to borrow from you, and there would have been a stigma attached to it. Their names would have leaked and much worse consequences would have followed, so they didn&apos;t dare borrow. MK: Well that is one of the consequences of failing to take out insurance beforehand. And if you don\u0131t take out insurance and then you want to be bailed out you really have to be prepared to be visibly as someone who didn\u0131t take out insurance and now needs the facility, but the question of stigma is an important one and its one that we\u0131ll be looking at, over the coming months, to try to ensure that in our operations banks can access our facilities at the rate that we charge without suffering an additional penalty in the form of a stigma. But I don&apos;t believe that actually the banking system as a whole needed that money. And if you look at the position now towards the end of October compared with the position in August all the major banks in this country have very much more liquidity than they did then. There has been a very significant increase in the liquidity position of all our major banks. RP: The chairman of one big bank said to me he was very concerned about the impact of the pictures of the run on Northern Rock. His bank is dependent on overseas funds to an extent. And he said that in the aftermath of the run, well he describes them as 30 year olds with Harvard MBAs in Wall Street or Dubai who control pools of money, these people decided they were not going to place their money with UK banks. I mean how serious do you think it got at that stage? MK: I don&apos;t think it lasted very long at that stage, that was very much an instinctive reaction. But it does show the need to be careful about whose money you depend on. And it&apos;ll be nice to feel that prudently managed banks didn\u0131t feel that their immediate survival depended on the bunch of people who thought no more deeply about the banks to which they lent than looking at pictures on television. Because the balance sheets of the banks had not changed. And I think that the lesson in this is that in recent years a number of banks \u2014 not all banks by any means \u2014 but a number of banks decided to grow quickly on the basis of this wholesale funding, from wherever they could find the money, and they didn\u0131t think clearly about whether the liabilities they had to the people who provided the money could easily be matched by the sales of assets in which the money was invested and they were taking a risk. And if you take risks you need to cover those risks, or take out insurance, and if you don\u0131t then one day that risk will materialise and you\u0131ll pay the price. And it&apos;s not the role of the Central Bank to bail out people who takes unnecessary risks. In just the same way as the government doesn\u0131t bail out manufacturing companies that take risks and their product fails. RP: Northern Rock and members of the Treasury Select Committee have said you weren&apos;t consistent. The weekend before the provision of the lender of the last resort facility, Northern Rock was in negotiations with Lloyds TSB, to sell itself to that bank. But that a condition imposed by the potential buyer was that the Bank of England should guarantee that if certain funds were withdrawn you would replace them. And you refused. Then only a few days later you provided support to Northern Rock. Why wasn&apos;t that an example of double standards? MK: Well that&apos;s not what happened; let me tell you what happened. On the weekend before we granted the facility to Northern Rock, I was asked whether if a certain retail high street bank were to make an offer or a bid for Northern Rock whether we would be prepared to lend that bank \u00a330bn pounds, at the bank rate, for about 2 years. And I think what that did was to demonstrate that our original view that it was not possible to save Northern Rock without a large injection of money on that scale was clearly right and I understand perfectly well why the bank wanted that facility. But I said to the Chancellor: &quot;Well look this is not something which a Central Bank can do, they don&apos;t normally finance takeovers by one company for another let alone to the tune of \u00a330bn, which is rather a large amount of money.&quot; So I said: &quot;This is a matter for government, but you have to recognise that if you were to make available such a facility to one bank, you would have to make it available to any other potential bidder and therefore it will become public.&quot; And I don&apos;t think it took the Chancellor very long to recognise that not only was this something which Central Banks don&apos;t do, it&apos;s also something that governments don\u0131t do. RP: You have thought about depositors&apos; insurance over many years. And some years ago you came to the view that there were risks in not providing certainty to depositors about their money, and also the issue about how quickly depositors can get their money in a crisis. So in the week that you were providing the loan to Northern Rock, presumably you were aware that there was a risk that retail depositors will take fright. Did you say to the government at that stage, I think it\u0131d be a good idea if you\u0131re prepared to provide 100% protection, because of the risk of this run? MK: When we discussed whether or not such a facility should be made, I gave my independent advice to the Chancellor and he thought we should grant the facility. When the bank run started I made very clear my view \u2014 that the only way to stop the bank run was to give a government guarantee and that was the argument that I made and that was the only argument that I wanted to make at that stage. I thought considerations of a takeover bid were irrelevant at that point because it takes many weeks in this country to organise a takeover bid and to get to the point where the shareholders of quoted a company have voted to decide that it&apos;s company A or company B that is going to buy their company. And so the only way to stop the run quickly was to put in place a government guarantee and that was the one point that I made. RP: But did you pre-emptively say to the Chancellor: &quot;Before - or at the same time as \u2014 we announce the lender of last resort facility we also ought to announce a 100% guarantee?&quot; MK: Well I don\u0131t want to go into all the conversations that took place and I think one thing that is worth pointing out is that it was not inevitable that there would be a retail run, it was certainly a risk but there was no easy way of predicting how the retail depositors would react. If they had all reacted in the view that now that the lender of the last resort facility is there, it&apos;s safe to leave the money in, then there wouldn\u0131t have been a retail deposit run. These things are very fragile. Once the run starts it was then rational for other people to join in, but it could have gone either way at the outset, it was not inevitable that depositors would queue up on the street to take their money out. RP: Was it a risk worth taking? MK: Well what was the alternative? The bank had run out of money. RP: Wasn\u0131t the alternative that at the moment that you put the lender of last resort facility in place you also announced 100% protection? MK: That was the alternative yes. RP: But why didn&apos;t that happen until Monday night? MK: Well I think a lot of things were going on very quickly. The facility was agreed on the Thursday, it then was announced early on the Friday morning. The Chancellor and I then went to the ECOFIN meeting. Over the weekend a lot of debates took place about a range of issues: the bid, a guarantee, people had different views to what the right answer might be, as the Chancellor made clear at the Treasury Committee. The view that I expressed to him was that we needed a government guarantee, but of course one of the practical problems of doing this, and the reason why it could not be done in a matter of hours, was to workout what the phrase there is a government guarantee actually meant. And the lawyers had to be consulted and in all of the aspects of this, it\u0131s very natural and understandable that government has to consult their legal advisors before knowing what they&apos;re able to say and what the words actually mean. And it did in fact take quite sometime to workout precisely what, in very detailed terms, the government guarantee actually meant. RP: But did you make a formal recommendation earlier in the week that the Treasury then turned down? Was it the Treasury\u0131s view that you had to suck it and see before giving a guarantee? MK: I think, I think there were a range of possibilities were on the table, which included a government guarantee, but many other possibilities were on the table. They were all being examined and the lawyers had a lot of things to say over the weekend and people were spending a good deal of time trying to work out what form such a guarantee would take that could be made sensibly in a way that didn&apos;t create further problems down the road. And even once the guarantee had been made on the Monday; there were still unresolved questions about precisely what was being guaranteed. And I think its very natural and understandable that the lawyer said, well hang on a minute, make sure you know exactly what it is that you\u0131re guaranteeing before you go on television and tell people. And the chancellor did, I thought, went out and tried very hard by appearing on television to reassure the depositors, without going further than his legal remit, to make a guarantee until it had actually been finally drawn up. RP: So there wasn\u0131t a moment in which on the Monday or Tuesday before the lender of last resort facility was put in that you formally gave advice to the Chancellor that he should provide the 100% guarantee and they said no? MK: No, there was there was never a moment like that at all. There were always a range of options and I think one of the things that it is worth trying to remember, if you look back now certain events appear inevitable, but very few were inevitable. And at the beginning of that week I think we were clear that we would be likely to have to extend lender of last resort support, but it wasn\u0131t inevitable and it was really only on the Thursday, when we actually did it, that we knew that it was inevitable so we had to do it. The timing of it wasn&apos;t decided until that day and a lot of other questions then naturally followed from it. When you&apos;re actually in one of these situations and dealing with it in real time there are always lots of options and nothing seems inevitable \u2014 it\u0131s not easy to predict the future. Looking back certain things seem a lot clearer. RP: In your long and illustrious career is this, in terms of the pressure on you as an individual, one of the most stressful and biggest things you have had to deal with professionally? MK: Well I think the reaction to it has been, yes. I don\u0131t think the events leading up to the decision were the most stressful in my career, no. But I think that the media storm that followed, anyone who\u0131s been through that will tell you that it\u0131s a stressful period, but you learn a lot about yourself and others around you and how to cope with it. But it was certainly a difficult time for everyone concerned. And I think in many ways what was so difficult to predict was the impact which the television pictures sent around the world of people queuing in the street would have on sentiment and opinion. I don&apos;t think that was something which was entirely easy to predict. I\u0131ve said I didn\u0131t think the run itself was inevitable though it was clearly a risk, and had been flagged, but the consequences of the run in terms of what it would mean on television was something that was hard easily to imagine it in advance. And in my judgement, it was the consequences of that which meant that people felt so strongly for a period, but as time goes by I think they&apos;re beginning to see it in perspective.  The British banking system has not collapsed, it&apos;s come through, and we will come out of this with new legislation, which will give the regulators an opportunity to intervene pre-emptively, earlier than we were able to on this occasion, with better deposit insurance arrangements and with a better focus in the future on the regulation and management of liquidity. I believe that by the time we get to the middle of 2008, people overseas will look back at this and say well we learnt ourselves a lot of lessons about our own banking systems from what happened in the UK. And actually, they have now got probably the best fr amework for the management of banks in place because they&apos;ve put in new legislation and the banking system is inherently very strong. RP: Given that you only use the lender of last resort facility where you think that there is the risk of serious damage to the economy, and indeed potentially systemic damage to the banking system, what was the risk that you were pre-empting Northern Rock by providing this facility? MK: What we were worried about was that if the depositors in Northern Rock had suddenly found that all their deposits were frozen for an indefinite period because the bank had literally run out of money and had been put into administration, then depositors in a range of other banks in the UK might have said: &quot;Gosh, could that happen to my bank, are my deposits safe?&quot; And they might well have been a run on a range of smaller to medium sized banks for by people who took their money out and put it in two or three very big banks that they thought were safe. And this was a potential systemic risk that would have caused immense damage to the structure of the banking system, because a range of institutions, a large number, might have found themselves victims of people who felt nervous about whether their deposits were safe because they had seen a bank in which the retail depositors got trapped. RP: How fragile do you think the banking system still is? MK: Things have improved significantly since August, when the crisis began. We\u0131re not back to normal in terms of a number of important financial markets, but things are improving. And I think that most people expect that we have several more months to get through before the banks have revealed all the losses that have occurred, have taken measures to finance their obligations that result from that. But we\u0131re going in the right direction. And so there is always in a period like this the possibility that a shock from outside the UK, one from the world economy, might create further fragilities. To some extent there are always risks, there are always fragilities. What I would say is that the situation now is in my view different from that in August though it&apos;s not without risk. RP: Is it possible do you think to remove the stigma from a rescue operation of this sort given the world in which we live where it\u0131s almost impossible to keep anything secret? MK: Well I think the phrase you used there is it possible to remove the stigma from a rescue operation? And I think the answer has to be that if someone needs rescuing and you can\u0131t keep its secret then, is it better to rescue them or are they going to say: &quot;Please don&apos;t rescue me because I don&apos;t want the stigma of people knowing that I need rescuing&quot;. That is the dilemma and I think the answer to that is pretty clear. If you\u0131re drowning, you\u0131d prefer someone to rescue you than to demonstrate that you can\u0131t swim by drowning. And I suspect that when the problems are serious enough the problem of stigma becomes less important. RP: Is there anything that you could do to modify the way you provided help in order to make it slightly easier ? is the current institutional framework quite right? MK: Well we shall certainly review the way we conduct all our operations, whether it\u0131s normal money market operations, or special auctions, or standing facilities. All of these we will review extremely carefully and maybe we can find improvements which will make it easier to operate in the future. But we will it do both within the Bank of England and also by talking to the market and the banking system about the lessons they\u0131ve drawn from this episode. Because the most important thing in the end is that we all learn the lessons from this episode. RP: Hindsight\u0131s a wonderful thing \u2014 reviewing the events since August the 9th do you think there is anything you or the bank would have done differently? MK: I think there are many things we might have done differently, I think we would have tried much harder to make sure that people understood and took account of the warnings that we made in the years leading up to August this year. I think we would have put much greater weight into our arguments, public weight into our arguments, for the need for banks to take greater account of liquidity and for that to be incorporated into international regulation as well. I think we would have pressed even harder than we did, and we did press pretty hard, to inject some urgency into the need for new legislation to enable there to be a procedure for pre-emptive intervention in banks and the reform of deposit insurance. I think that in terms of the way that we operated in August, I wish I had communicated earlier than I did during the month of August. RP: What do you mean by communicated? MK: I think people probably felt that I was not out there explaining what the Bank of England was doing in the way that some other Central Banks were. I was conscious of the problems that could arise if all Central Banks were crying disaster and I wanted not to exaggerate the position and I think I would have encouraged the earlier setting up of a joint team between the FSA and the Bank to deal with the problems of individual institutions. Now we didn&apos;t do that, because the memorandum of understanding that we were given in 1997 made it very clear that the Bank of England should not get involved with individual institutions. And in some cases that\u0131s right, but when there\u0131s a liquidity problem, I think it\u0131s inevitable that we get involved. RP: And when was that joint team setup over the summer? MK: Well that was later in August. And in the end it was more a question of collaboration among the tripartite authorities. RP: But on the narrow point of the use of your money market facilities and the way that you rescued Northern Rock, you feel that looking back on it, you behaved in a rational way and that that is not something you think you would have done differently in retrospect? MK: That that is right and I&apos;ve thought about it very deeply, I feel that the attitude we adopted towards both our money market operations where we tried to keep the overnight interest rate close to bank rate, and were as successful as that as any other Central Bank and more so than some. I think the way we did our money market operations could not have been changed in a way that would have helped Northern Rock and I think that we did feel strongly that it would not be right to bail out imprudent banks, we didn&apos;t do that. And in the end we had to take an action to protect not the shareholders in Northern Rock, not the managers, but the retail depositors. And so far no retail depositor in this country has lost a penny in this episode. RP: Why didn\u0131t either you or Callum McCarthy appear in public on the Friday, Saturday or Sunday and talk about how you felt that Northern Rock was basically sound? You&apos;ve both got particular authority and insight. MK: For the very simple reason that at that point in the absence of a government guarantee it was actually rational to queue up and take your money out. And it would have been dishonest for us to have pretended otherwise. I thought the Chancellor was extraordinarily successful in giving what reassurance he could given that at that point he didn&apos;t know how far he could go in giving a government guarantee. RP: You couldn&apos;t stand up and say you&apos;ve got nothing to worry about because if you&apos;d have been in their position you would have taken the money out too? MK: Well I wasn&apos;t in their position, but I think it would not have been possible to say to them: &quot;You have complete reassurance, don&apos;t worry, you can go home.&quot; It would it would have been dishonest to have said that.", "tags": ["Business", "Mervyn King"], "title": "Mervyn King transcript - continued ...", "sentences": ["And he said that in the aftermath of the run, well he describes them as 30 year olds with Harvard MBAs in Wall Street or Dubai who control pools of money, these people decided they were not going to place their money with UK banks."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/06/20", "publicationDate": "2007-11-06T12:26:43Z"}, {"article": "The global crunch has been credibly used to explain to why a number of potential stock market deals have collapsed as buyers pulled out. But few are convinced that is the only reason why J Sainsbury is not going to be controlled by investors using Middle East money. The end of the \u00a310.6bn bid for the supermarket group is not only a major upset for Qatari ambitions but could raise questions about the reliability of increasingly active sovereign funds from emerging nations such as Dubai and Singapore. Sovereign funds have been seen by some as the kind of strong and reliable long-term investors needed to add backbone to those parts of a wobbly stock market overdependent on less than transparent hedge funds and private equity firms. The Qataris themselves were keeping a low profile last night but sources familiar with the Qatar Investment Authority insisted it was right to back out of a deal that looked unattractive in current volatile market conditions. &quot;The QIA prides itself on being a disciplined and value-driven investor and that it why it felt unable to proceed at this time,&quot; said the source. Other supporters of the Qataris, who declined to be named, said the QIA, which backed the bid by Delta Two - its investment vehicle - and its head, Paul Taylor, should be praised for not paying over the odds just to save face. They said the QIA would remain a key investor in J Sainsbury and had shown itself to be the kind of shareholder welcomed at the London Stock Exchange, where it bought a 20% holding. But though no one would praise them for overpaying, some critics - and there are many - were questioning how such a long and tortuous run-up to the decision to pull out yesterday could have hinged on whether or not to pay out an extra \u00a3500m. Conspiracy theorists wonder whether the denouement revealed tensions inside Qatar while others wonder why the state-owned fund had got involved with such a relatively inexperienced operator as Mr Taylor and then gone for a trophy asset that would ensure any failure was blasted all over the world&apos;s media. Whatever the reason for abandoning a full takeover of Sainsbury&apos;s, the Qataris&apos; reputation has been badly bruised, leaving them looking like &quot;rookies&quot; in the words of the Financial Times.

That is the romantic view. The reality is that the Wigan chairman would have to be at his persuasive best to convince his former manager to return to the JJB Stadium as Chris Hutchings&apos; successor. Graeme Souness remains the frontrunner to replace Hutchings, who was sacked on Monday only 12 games into his Wigan tenure but with the club slumping into the relegation zone on the back of six consecutive defeats.

Although South African cricket has no official quotas, the government puts pressure on sporting bodies to implement black representation. This is a policy that has led to four top players - Kevin Pietersen, Jacques Rudolph, Ryan McLaren and Martin van Jaarsveld - taking advantage of free trade agreements to join the English county game as non-overseas players, bringing fears that both countries will suffer as a consequence. Confirmation today by South Africa&apos;s sports minister, Makhenseki Stofile, that &quot;quotas are out&quot; - to be replaced by more investment in sports facilities in deprived areas to help black athletes reach the highest level - could now reintroduce selection on merit and begin to slow the exodus of disillusioned whites. Stofile&apos;s announcement was thought to be made with the full approval of the president, Thabo Mbeke, who was moved to reconsider the merits of quotas, official or otherwise, when a virtually all-white South Africa side won the Rugby World Cup and was held to have improved the nation&apos;s sense of unity as a result. The England and Wales Cricket Board is so concerned about the number of South Africans in county cricket under the so-called Kolpak agreement that Giles Clarke, the ECB&apos;s new chairman, discussed the issue at an International Cricket Council meeting in Dubai last week with Norman Arandse, Cricket South Africa&apos;s president. &quot;What South Africa chooses to do is a matter for them, but the ECB has made it clear that we do not encourage county cricket to take the Kolpak route,&quot; said Clarke. &quot;It is healthy for the game that England and South Africa both remain strong.&quot; It will be intriguing to see how Arandse reacts because he is an unapologetic supporter of quotas, saying after recently taking office: &quot;As long as we have an abnormal society, quotas and targets are not only desirable, but also a constitutional imperative.&quot; Now Stofile, previously a staunch supporter of quotas, has condemned the policy as &quot;window dressing&quot; and insisted that sporting development could only be quickened with sufficient funding - although the figure, only \u00a315m a year, is limited. &quot;Quotas were used only for window dressing for international consumption,&quot; he said. &quot;Quotas are out. We are not going to decide who must be on the team. We must kill the myth that black people cannot play certain sporting codes because they are black. Let us put our resources into the development of talent.&quot; Around two thirds of blacks have regularly supported quotas, compared with one in eight whites.

After a week in which two of his most famous players, Colin Montgomerie and Ernie Els, squabbled and aspersions were cast on his management skills, George O&apos;Grady, chief executive of the European Tour, was an agitated man as he cradled his glass of bubbly during a reception celebrating 20 years of the Volvo Masters. The problem this time was a newspaper story suggesting he had fallen out with one of golf&apos;s most powerful agents. &quot;Absolute and complete rubbish,&quot; O&apos;Grady said - an assessment endorsed this week by the agent concerned, Andrew Chandler, the head of International Sports Management and the man who guides the affairs of, among others, Els and Lee Westwood. These are crucial times for the tour, which finds itself caught between the all-powerful PGA Tour in America and the distance between its headquarters in Surrey and the Middle East and Asia, where booming economies and a growing appetite for the game mean vast sums of money are available. &quot;You can either see that as a problem or as an opportunity,&quot; said Chandler. &quot;I see it as an opportunity - an opportunity to establish an alternative to the PGA Tour encompassing all of the other tours, in Europe, Japan, Asia, Australia. The European Tour is well placed to take the lead in establishing that new tour - call it a world tour. If it doesn&apos;t act it might find that someone else will do it, such as a television company.&quot; Or possibly the PGA Tour, which last year appointed Ty Votaw as its vice president of international affairs. That suggests it does not see its future entirely within North America. The PGA Tour will soon stage a world championship event in China, although Votaw insists there are no plans for geographical expansion. For now. &quot;We don&apos;t see Asia as necessarily a place to have a PGA Tour &quot;branded&quot; event - we tried it before in Korea and it wasn&apos;t terribly successful - but we have other divisions that are very interested in the region, such as our television division and retail licensing,&quot; he said. &quot;We are the No1 tour in the world and we will be doing our best to take advantage of that.&quot; O&apos;Grady is aware of the competition facing his organisation but he takes a Trappist approach when it comes to discussing future plans. He does not have to say anything - his intentions are laid out in the tour&apos;s 2008 schedule which will take in 14 events in Asia and the Middle East and only nine in Britain and Ireland. That shift in emphasis will continue in the following year, including a new tournament in Dubai with a \u00a35m prize purse (plus another \u00a35m bonus pool) to climax the 2009 season. &quot;Trying to organise a single tournament requires a big team of people, so you can imagine what it takes to organise an entire schedule - it&apos;s like three-dimension chess,&quot; O&apos;Grady said.&quot;We are trying to create tournaments that will last and aren&apos;t at the mercy of the markets.&quot; That means a raft of changes from the start of 2009, which will see an end to the ridiculous situation that has the 2008 European Tour season starting this week in China. In future the season will begin and end in the same calendar year. Beyond that there is the strong possibility the tour will change its name - a move that meets with the approval of another of the big names in European golf, Guy Kinnings, Montgomerie&apos;s manager and head of IMG&apos;s European golf division. &quot;The name &apos;European Tour&apos; has definitely got some value but in the long term it remains to been seen whether it is really necessary to keep it, especially if the tour is travelling more and more around the globe.&quot; A name change is one thing but of far more immediate concern is the state of relations between Europe and the Asian tour, which has accused it of &quot;invading&quot; its territory by agreeing to stage events in India and Korea next year. In the past the tours have cooperated but for the time being they are at each other&apos;s throats. O&apos;Grady refuses to go into detail on the origin of this antipathy but Kinnings has a view of where it might end if the differences aren&apos;t resolved. &quot;Key to everything is that the European Tour and the other tours outwith the PGA Tour have to cooperate with each other,&quot; he said. &quot;The tour has never been better placed to take advantage of the opportunities created by the game&apos;s image as a clean and honourable sport.

Asked what the point was of putting in a claim now when the legal case between the Office of Fair Trading and the banks means refunds are on ice, a spokesperson said: &quot;I suppose it does not make much difference.&quot; The bureau is not connected to the government, but it may have bought your phone number from a debt collector - you admit you have banking problems. It is run by Paul Evans, whose previous venture, Anderson Marketing Associates, is now nearly one year late in filing accounts at Companies House. eBay scam that now has two victims I have received a registered letter with my correct name and address from a German demanding \u20ac2,500. He says I owe him this for the non-delivery of a quad bike he bought on eBay. A friend talked to him and he seemed normal but angry. Is this a scam?PNLondon Almost certainly. But the German is the victim. Fraudsters get hold of your name and address from sources such as the voting register. They then offer a motorbike or quad bike on eBay, telling the buyer to send the money to their PayPal or similar account, while giving the purchaser your name and address to show their good faith. All the warning signs I paid \u00a33,628.57 for shares in US company MobileStream through broker Marshall Lambert, which promised that the firm would float on the US stock market and the shares would soar.

Definitely wouldn&apos;t be the Bounty Bar ideal. I love the Edinburgh Comedy Festival and I always stay in a beautiful Georgian house there called One Royal Circus - it&apos;s the Rolls-Royce of B&amp;Bs. I try to see two or three comedy shows a day before I do my own show in the evening. I&apos;ve been going every year for the past eight years and the audiences are really savvy - that&apos;s pretty close to paradise. MY FAVOURITE HOTEL IS... The Sandy Lane Hotel in Barbados. The service is fabulous, the food is great and it&apos;s not overcrowded. Oh, and they have electric curtains! The Four Seasons in Hampshire is exemplary too - the service is amazing and it&apos;s in such a beautiful location. MY MOST MEMORABLE MEAL WAS IN... Pink&apos;s Hot Dogs in LA. There&apos;s always a half-hour queue and it&apos;s delicious and kind of perfect. I tend to go for authenticity with food when I&apos;m travelling; I&apos;m not bothered about going to a fancy restaurant. There are so many great restaurants in London that the idea of travelling somewhere else to eat in a fancy restaurant seems a bit pointless. If I&apos;m in Morocco or Thailand, I&apos;d rather have fantastic authentic local food. I&apos;LL NEVER GO BACK TO... Tenerife... on an 18-30s holiday. I&apos;ve been on some rough holidays in my time and I went on some 18-30s holidays when I was younger. I always really enjoyed them. Playa de las Americas was a real dump - you try getting eggs benedict in the morning - but at the time, when you&apos;re 20 and away with your best mates, it&apos;s great. I&apos;m too old to go back. I LIKE... Hanging about on the beach or by the pool, but I&apos;m not interested in getting a tan. I used to do the whole culture thing, but now when I&apos;m on holiday I just need to relax. I don&apos;t see stuff when I&apos;m in London because I&apos;m so busy, so it seems crazy to go away and then see art or go to the theatre.  I NEVER TRAVEL WITHOUT... DVDs and a laptop to play them. If you&apos;re travelling first-class life is easy, but even if you&apos;re not, the day flies by if you&apos;ve got the right entertainment. I particularly enjoy American TV shows such as Deadwood, The Shield and The Wire MY TOP TRAVEL TIP IS... Take melatonin to combat jet lag. It really works. You can get it from any health food store, and as I travel to Los Angeles and Las Vegas quite often I&apos;ll take melatonin when I get back before going to bed. WHEN I&apos;M TRAVELLING I ALWAYS MISS... Not much now, thanks to the joys of Sky Plus. Of course home is home and there&apos;s nothing like your own bed, but I really enjoy spending time on the road in Britain, whether it&apos;s in Brighton, Newcastle, Edinburgh or wherever. TRAVELLING ALONE IS FUN... When I&apos;m just going to and from gigs, but for a holiday it&apos;s a bit much, although I did once go on holiday to the Holy Land on my own to have a look around. It was kind of fun, but there&apos;s nothing quite like travelling with someone you love. ON HOLIDAY I LOVE TO... Watch TV. I find it funny that on holiday people become very different and stop watching TV. My girlfriend Caroline and I will watch a series of something while we&apos;re away. Foreign TV tends to be a bit crap - just CNN telling you about war - so we&apos;ll bring a series of something such as The Wire on DVD and watch an episode each day. TV is a really important part of my life and when I&apos;m on holiday I want to relax and watch a good show. WHEN TRAVELLING TO DO COMEDY SHOWS... I&apos;ve found there&apos;s actually more difference between a Tuesday night and a Friday night than there is between Manchester and New York. I do like performing in New York and Los Angeles, though - they&apos;re almost otherworldly and it&apos;s cool to play there. THE WEIRDEST PLACE I&apos;VE EVER BEEN RECOGNISED WAS... On the log flume at the Wild Wadi water park in Dubai - lots of people were taking pictures of me going down the log flume in my swimming trunks and I was thinking that if ever there was a reason to do sit-ups, it was this.  \u00b7 Jimmy Carr&apos;s new DVD, Comedian, is out now, price \u00a319.99", "tags": ["Travel", "Jimmy Carr"], "title": "Me and my travels", "sentences": ["THE WEIRDEST PLACE I&apos;VE EVER BEEN RECOGNISED WAS...

They will be royally entertained before listening to the announcement of a new addition to the European Tour schedule. Not just another golf tournament, but one that Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and all the world&apos;s top players will not want to miss - the richest in the world. The prize fund is expected to be $20million and appearance money about as much again. But the backers can afford it, just as they can afford all the billions of dollars they pump into racing, football, cricket, tennis, rugby sevens, motor sport, athletics and even ocean racing. The six Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have, after all, done rather well out of the recent oil boom. In the past four years they have made $1.5 trillion - that&apos;s $1,500,000,000,000 - and they have to spend it on something other than hotels and luxury holiday homes. That something is, increasingly often, sport. The new tournament takes to four the number of European Tour events held in the Gulf - the same number as are scheduled for England next year. Tiger Woods has been a regular at Dubai&apos;s current flagship event, the Dubai Desert Classic. His long-standing commercial relationship with Golf in Dubai, the tournament organisers, earns him $2m to turn up, a figure that compares favourably to the total purse of $2.6m. He was paid another $20m to design his first golf course, not in the United States but in Dubai. It is 25 years since the European Tour played an event outside the borders of Europe, the 1982 Tunisian Open. &apos;The Tunisian Tourist Board offered \u00a360,000 provided we would make it an official event,&apos; says Ken Schofield, former chief executive of the Tour, and the architect of the &apos;beyond our boundaries&apos; strategy. The Tour&apos;s decision to expand helped put the emirate Dubai and other parts of the Gulf on the sporting map. They are here to stay unlike the body that brought them into the world. The boundaries of golf have gone way, way beyond Europe and the European Tour as we know it will eventually cease to exist. For Dubai&apos;s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, sport forms part of a multi-billion-dollar charm offensive. Through sport, he reasons, he can improve the region&apos;s image, drive tourism and alleviate its economic dependency on oil and natural gas. The price of oil hit the $100-a-barrel mark for the first time last week and a feature of the 1970s oil boom was the ostentatious spending of a privileged few. The subsequent criticism was that the sheikhs had squandered an opportunity to improve the lot of their people. Analysts expect oil production to fall by nearly 50 per cent over the next 25 years, so this time around there is pressure to spend the money wisely. This is already shaping the sporting landscape. Russia&apos;s new-found riches helped the country secure the 2014 Winter Olympics, which will be staged in the city of Sochi. The IOC&apos;s heads were turned by the promises of President Putin, who pledged $14bn, raised from the country&apos;s natural resources, to turn the Black Sea summer resort into a winter-sports destination. This is a sign of the times. When Russia last hosted the Games, in Moscow in 1980, the country was virtually bankrupt. In the Gulf, oil money is being used to build a sporting and commercial hub, positioned between the old economies of Europe and the nascent promise of India and China. &apos;The Gulf region is a big part of a rapidly changing sports event marketplace,&apos; says Mike Lee, a consultant to bidding cities and prominent member of the winning London 2012 Olympic bid team. The Gulf is &apos;a brilliant opportunity for sport and business&apos;, says Nick Massey, chief executive of the sports marketing agency, Octagon. &apos;I can see sports tourism there really taking off. Sport as a vehicle for change - it makes a lot of sense.&apos; Horse racing has long been a passion, especially of Sheikh Mohammed. The Dubai World Cup meeting has been held annually since 1996 and prize money has grown from $5m in the inaugural race to $22m this year. &apos;Unless I am 100 per cent sure about an idea, I will not implement it,&apos; Sheikh Mohammed once said. &apos;Once I am convinced, I do not hesitate.&apos; So, once he had convinced himself about the need for a new venue for his showcase event he signed off a $1.3bn contract, and by 2010, the meeting will have a new home: the Dubai Maydan racecourse, which will set a new standard in luxury for racegoers. The rulers will expect to see &apos;local&apos; winners, however, and by their own high standards 2007 has been a poor year for Godolphin, the Dubai-backed international racing &apos;team&apos;. As a result they have spent more than $100m on bloodstock this year, including over $10m for Playful Act, a world record for a broodmare. They also bought Europe&apos;s best horse, Manduro, as well as the winner of the Epsom Derby and the first two home in the Kentucky Derby. Godolphin are a global organisation, with centres in Europe, the United States and Japan, which the Sheikh uses to promote his homeland. &apos;We are here to create, to invent and to promote Dubai,&apos; he says. Motorsport has been quick to take the oil dollars on offer. Bahrain has held a grand prix since 2004 and Dubai money is behind the new A1GP series, an alternative to Formula One. Abu Dhabi, which has the greatest oil reserves in the Gulf, is due to host its F1 grand prix in 2009. This was facilitated by the government&apos;s purchase of a five per cent stake in Ferrari. The race will take place on an island in the shadow of a new Ferrari theme park. Qatar has hosted a round of the MotoGP championship since 2004 and next year&apos;s race on 9 March will take place under lights to suit European television viewers. Cricket&apos;s links to the region are strong. Remarkably, Sharjah holds the record for staging the most one-day internationals in a single venue. In 2005 the ICC moved from Lord&apos;s to take up residence in Dubai&apos;s Sports City. A new ground is being built to house the ICC Academy, which will be run by Rod Marsh. Recently, Manchester United were paid $50m to set up a soccer skills academy in Dubai. &apos;There is growing evidence of a joined-up approach to the huge infrastructural investment being made across the region,&apos; says Michael Pask, senior vice-president of IMG, the sports marketing group. &apos;The ruling families have grasped the opportunity to use sport to change elements of peoples&apos; lives on a scale we have not seen before. This is new territory.&apos; But it comes at a price. A huge army of workers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have toiled for long shifts and low wages in Dubai, most living in squalid conditions. &apos;When workers complain they are deported,&apos; said one property man. &apos;It&apos;s feudal.&apos; Sport is but one part of the plan. The Dubai government is equally keen to buy up major cultural properties. To this end it has bought a franchise package from the Louvre in Paris for an estimated $1.3bn, including $520m to use the name and $747m for art and cultural exhibitions over the next 30 years. This forms part of a cultural attraction on Saadiyat Island, a development costing $27bn. Qatar, with a population of fewer than a million, illustrates the unbounded ambition of the Gulf&apos;s rulers. They raised the state&apos;s sporting profile by setting up the Qatar Football League, the Q-League, which is most notable for luring fading big-name internationals with mind-blowing financial incentives. In 2004, Argentina World Cup star Gabriel Batistuta signed a two-year deal worth a reported $9.6m to play for Al Arabi in the new league. He was subsequently joined by veteran Brazil striker Romario, former Chelsea defenders Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf, and German playmaker Stefan Effenberg among others. The state-owned Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) has a fund of $50bn. It is using this money to buy a place at the top table in all spheres of business, including a 14 per cent stake in the London Stock Exchange and a $21.2bn bid for Sainsbury&apos;s. And it is investing heavily in sport. The QIA has paid to stage, from 2008-10, the end-of-season women&apos;s tennis championship, currently being played in Madrid. Emboldened by their staging in Doha, the capital, of the 2006 Asian Games, the world&apos;s second largest multi-sport event, they are now bidding for the World Indoor Athletics Championships in 2010, and will stage football&apos;s Asia Cup in 2011. And then... the big one. Doha has just announced its intention to bid for the Olympic Games in 2016, placing it in competition with some of the iconic world cities such as Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro and Madrid. &apos;We hope people will come to Qatar and see a different Arab world than they perceive it to be,&apos; says Hasan Ali bin Ali, chairman of the Doha 2016 Games bid committee. Not everyone likes what they see, though. The centrepiece of Qatar&apos;s sports strategy is the astonishing multi-sport facility called the Aspire Zone. This is a huge site that houses a large indoor arena, air-conditioned stables and a host of state-of-the-art facilities that allowed 10 of the sports of the Asian Games to be staged under one roof simultaneously. A feature of the coverage was an indoor blimp that flew inside the main arena to film the action. An underground football stadium is being built before the Asian Cup. It is also the home of the Aspire Academy, an organisation that recently drew criticism from Sepp Blatter, head of Fifa, world football&apos;s governing body. This is not good news for Qatar and Dubai, both of whom covet the World Cup - perhaps in 2018 - and have been encouraged by Blatter&apos;s decision to end Fifa&apos;s rotation policy, leaving the field open to bidders from all territories. Neither the Olympics nor the World Cup has ever been held in an Arab state. Blatter believes that Aspire Africa, a scholarship programme for young footballers launched by the Qatar set-up, is exploiting boys in seven countries - Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, South Africa, Kenya and Algeria. Aspire is using 6,000 staff to assess more than half a million boys, all of them born in 1994, in 700 locations in those seven countries. The point? According to Aspire, it is to give the best of those boys a chance to gain an education and top coaching in Doha. To others, it is human trafficking, with the sole intention of providing Qatar with footballers for their future national team - not much different to the way a club, rather than a country, usually operates. In a candid response to a letter sent by five members of the European Parliament, raising concerns over the Aspire project, disclosed to Observer Sport, Blatter acknowledges that &apos;their establishment of recruitment networks in these seven African countries reveals just what Aspire is all about. Aspire offers a good example of... exploitation&apos;. The Aspire Academy cost $1.3billion to build in Doha and the Qatar is bill it as &apos;an incredible opportunity for talented young African boys to reach the heights of international football in the future&apos;. Aspire was launched by Pele and also gained support from, among others, Sven-Goran Eriksson, Zinedine Zidane, Maradona and Glenn Hoddle. The scheme is highly controversial and Jean-Claude M&apos;Bvoumin, president of Culture Foot Solidaire, the Paris-based organisation that campaigns against the trafficking of African footballers, asked Blatter to stop the Aspire project. &apos;Aspire Africa is an illegal project which violates the Fifa rules concerning the protection of minors,&apos; says M&apos;Bvoumin, a former professional footballer in Cameroon. &apos;It&apos;s strictly prohibited under Fifa regulations to recruit young foreign footballers aged less than 13, which is the case here. From an ethical point of view it is a catastrophe. It&apos;s a way for Aspire to say that with money you can do anything you want.&apos; Aspire&apos;s sports director, Dr Andreas Bleicher, insists that their motives for undertaking the project are genuine. &apos;In Qatar, our level is OK but it&apos;s not world-class level. We are convinced that we need to bring the better players in so they can train together with them and they can compete against them. This is the way that our local players can develop.&apos; Qatar has already reaped rewards in athletics by using its wealth to persuade many Kenyan athletes to accept so-called &apos;passports of convenience&apos; and compete for them. Middle-distance runner Stephen Cherono started the trend in 2003 when he swapped his Kenyan passport for Qatari citizenship and took on a new name, Saif Saaeed Shaheen - for a reported salary of $1,000 a month for life. Qatar&apos;s commitment to buying success in sport was first made clear when seven Bulgarian weightlifters defected to the Gulf state in 1999. Kenyan athletics officials say Qatar promised to build a stadium in Eldoret in exchange for runners switching nationality, but complain it has never happened. Meanwhile, back in Dubai, the businessmen may make impressive noises, using words such as &apos;smart&apos;, &apos;quality&apos; and &apos;manufactured&apos;, but one native Qatari commented: &apos;There is a disconnection between the ambitions of the government and the interest of the working people. The best moments happen around the cricket because this is attended by the expat Indian and Pakistani communities, who are fanatical in stark contrast to the native population who couldn&apos;t give a toss. &apos;The same was true at the Asian Games, where the Kabbadi tournament was a big hit. Their apathy is fuelled by the feeling that the big events are primarily for tourists and expats.&apos; There are other problems to overcome. Summer temperatures routinely go beyond 50 degrees, meaning Qatar&apos;s Olympic bid hangs on the premise that the Games be shifted to October. The vast building plans have placed an enormous burden on infrastructure. The new Dubai airport, currently being built, will be the size of Cardiff. Pollution and traffic gridlock are a common complaint of those who live in the area. Questions remain as to the appetite for sport on the part of the indigenous populations: a regular feature of Asian Games coverage from Doha was the backdrop of empty seats. How can you create the hunger required to be a top sports star, asks one expat in Dubai, in a country where workers pay no income tax and which has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world? By chasing petrodollars, governing bodies such as the European Tour have created a new world map.

Kevin Stadler, who had a one-stroke lead after two rounds, slipped to a 73 and fell four behind Mickelson. Five players were in a group seven shots back including Vijay Singh (72), defending Open champion Padraig Harrington (69) and defending tournament champion Yang Yong-eun (70) of South Korea. Mickelson, who finished 16 strokes behind winner Angel Cabrera last weekend at the Singapore Open, is finally producing some good golf at the Sheshan Golf Club. It is Mickelson&apos;s first event in China and his first foray into Asia. A victory would be only his second out of the United States. The other came 13 years ago in France. &apos;I want to play well whether it&apos;s the States, whether it&apos;s here,&apos; Mickelson said. &apos;I want to want to compete and I want to have a chance to win. To me that&apos;s what&apos;s fun. It&apos;s difficult to come this far and not play well.&apos; Mickelson made several testing 5ft putts to save par during the round. However, a 35-footer for birdie at the 15th put him in the lead for good. &apos;I certainly didn&apos;t expect to make it,&apos; he said. &apos;It was such a long putt, you can&apos;t plan on making those and I was fortunate to see that one go in.&apos; Mickelson also missed a 30ft eagle putt on the final hole and settled for an easy birdie to push him two ahead. &apos;Tomorrow I hopefully will have more birdie opportunities, which will be the goal to not have to fight for par as much,&apos; he said. Fisher, who picked up his first victory on the European tour in the Dutch Open earlier this year, looked comfortable playing in the final pairing with Mickelson and Stadler. He was in the final pairing with Tiger Woods earlier in the season in the Dubai Desert Classic. &apos;Tiger was fantastic,&apos; Fisher said. &apos;I was shocked at how open he was. We were chatting like we were best friends. And the same today with Phil. He was very polite, we were chatting most of the way around. It kind of really helped me to relax.&apos; Fisher said the easy camaraderie convinced him of something. &apos;I&apos;m good enough to be out here with these guys, so why not try to show them how good I am.&apos; Paul Casey is confident his strong showing so far is the start of better things to come - starting with the \u00a3400,000 on offer should the Ryder Cup winner overhaul Phil Mickelson&apos;s three-shot lead in today&apos;s final round. Casey began his 2007 campaign with a one-stroke victory at January&apos;s Abu Dhabi Golf Championship but was left disappointed with his overall year after finishing 13th on the European Tour&apos;s Order of Merit. But he is now confident of making his mark in 2008, starting with victory today, which would set him up for another tilt at the Order of Merit crown which narrowly eluded him in 2006. &apos;The win early in 2007 in Abu Dhabi was great, but after that it did go a bit flat,&apos; he said. &apos;I had some tremendous rounds of golf throughout the year but I didn&apos;t manage to put four rounds together as the season went on, which was disappointing. However, I really feel like I have grown as a player. I&apos;m working better with the swing, I am a lot more focused and I&apos;m working very hard in the gym.

The US has faced economic crises before, but it has always bounced back, stronger, leaner and fitter.  That hasn&apos;t stopped respected commentators from predicting again and again that the end was in sight for the greenback: it happened during the inflationary spiral following the 1973 Arab/Israeli war; it happened in the wake of the 1994 bond crash; and, more recently, it happened following the terrorist attacks on the twin towers. Is this just one more occasion? For clues, consider a parallel question linked to the future direction of the dollar, which is the more general one about whether American power is on the wane politically and militarily, as well as economically.  History affords the example of Britain to anyone searching for an answer to this prickly question. Sterling fell off a cliff in the years following the First World War, with British power in slow but inexorable decline. And investors were quick to realise it, dumping the pound on currency markets throughout the developed world. Is America at the point where Britain was in 1918?  There are striking similarities. The US has been holed below the waterline by an expensive, debilitating war in Iraq, with victory as far away as ever. And just as Britain had to deal with the rise of the US in the first half of the last century, so America is being challenged by the astonishing ascent of China, industrialising at breakneck speed. Few would argue that the period following the fall of the Berlin Wall, when America was the only real superpower, is coming to an end.  China, India and a resurgent Russia will challenge America in the years ahead, and that is why the looming slowdown in the US is focusing people&apos;s minds on the new order. The emerging economic giants, as well as the immensely wealthy oil-producing states of the Middle East, have embarked on a slow but structural shift out of the dollar into other assets, in the belief that the shine is coming off American power, or - at the very least - that it will have to share it with others who will become just as powerful in the not too distant future. But investment strategies are driven as much by economics as by geopolitics. Even Ben Bernanke, head of the US Federal Reserve, admits that the sub-prime crisis and liquidity squeeze that hit in the summer will hamper growth. The crisis threatens to spill over into the real economy: if banks are reluctant to lend because they still don&apos;t know the extent of their exposure to dodgy mortgage loans packaged into off-balance sheet vehicles, businesses will find it more difficult to expand. This will ultimately threaten employment, while domestic customers will be denied the easy credit that has fuelled high street spending and inflated house prices to levels that are surely unsustainable. Add in an oil price hovering perilously close to $100 a barrel - prompting fears of renewed inflation - and you have a toxic mix that makes for an extremely uncertain outlook for 2008. But my guess would be that the current crisis will end where it started - with the investment banks. Their risk-management strategies are in tatters following the credit crunch but, as in previous crises, the banks have shown a remarkable ability to adapt to changed circumstances. It is entirely conceivable that the financial system could emerge in better shape once the lessons have been learnt.  There is too much at stake, however, for everything to be left to the banks and the free market. Regulators and governments around the world need to grasp the nettle and play a much larger role in ensuring global financial stability.

I hadn&apos;t expected to find out first-hand. I&apos;d gone to the emirate to carry out what would count in most countries as routine academic research. When the knock on the door came on the last day of Ramadan a year ago, I&apos;d been in Dubai for four months. My project: to do interviews for a book on white-collar expatriate workers. Lots has been written about the exploitation of construction workers in the Gulf region, but I didn&apos;t imagine professionals living the good life would be a touchy topic - especially with Dubai so busy promoting itself as a hub of internationalism, a modern state with modern lifestyles. Come here and buy into the property-and-shopping bonanza, say the big advertising campaigns. Over the weeks, I met and interviewed dozens of Dubai-born and raised foreign professional workers about their experiences growing up and working there. (About 90% of Dubai&apos;s population, and about 98% of its private-sector workforce, is made up of people categorised as expats.) I recorded our interviews in their homes, their workplaces, in cafes and restaurants and shopping malls. I was struck by the fact that being born in Dubai conferred no rights of permanent residence, let alone citizenship, meaning that people who had spent most or all of their lives in the emirate have the same legal status as a worker who has just arrived. I made no secret of what I was doing. I kept an ongoing blog and told everyone I spoke with that I was a Fulbright scholar (the US state department&apos;s best-known scholarship programme) doing book research. Then, just the day before I was scheduled to leave Dubai, five men arrived unannounced with a court order. With them was one woman, the only person in police uniform; the men were wearing ordinary white robes. It was about noon, on October 22. That they showed up at my friend&apos;s place, where I&apos;d been staying for only three days, and timed their arrival right before I was to fly onward to India for a family holiday, meant - as a duty officer at the US consulate said when my wife rang to ask for help - that they&apos;d been keeping tabs on me. For about an hour, they searched the flat, and then made to go: &quot;You must come with us.&quot; My wife, who had arrived from New York just 12 hours earlier, said she and our 14-month-old son would come too. &quot;No. We will bring him back soon.&quot; &quot;Can I leave my mobile phone with my wife?&quot; I asked. &quot;It is not allowed.&quot; &quot;Can I write down some phone numbers, as she doesn&apos;t know anyone here?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; I wrote two numbers, then one of the men huffed, &quot;No more numbers!&quot; I was put into a Toyota Landcruiser, its windows tinted so dark the driver could barely see out, and driven to the immense police headquarters compound, an oasis of bougainvillea and other hanging vines and plants on the north-east side of Dubai Creek. There, we wound up a ramp until we arrived at a one-storey building evidently assigned to the secret police, my escorts. For the next 13 hours or so my interrogators were two Dubai nationals - only nationals work in the State Security Division. One, who looked to be in his late 20s, was thin with jaundiced skin and no top front teeth, the other was in his mid 30s, short and chubby with jowls. The latter played good cop, while the thin one was bad cop. Watching their technique, I wondered if part of their interrogation training had consisted of watching American cop movies. The questioning was mostly about my family&apos;s migration history, my education from nursery school to doctorate, my work history, and so forth. Every now and then they would interject with the real questions: Why did you come to Dubai? Who is funding you? Why are you asking so many questions about locals and non-locals? They never raised their voices. My wife, meanwhile, had immediately gone to a nearby hotel to call the US consulate in Dubai. She told them I had been taken away by the men in white, who had showed no identification. Startled at the detention of a Fulbright researcher, consular staff spent more than nine hours phoning Dubai officials before they located me and arranged for my release. Once I left the country, I also called the British embassy in Dubai, hoping it too would make some sort of protest, as I&apos;m a dual UK-US citizen. The duty officer was unimpressed: &quot;You&apos;ve left Dubai, what do you expect us to do?&quot; That was that, for Foreign Office assistance. By the end of the night, a more senior officer came to wrap things up. Called &quot;chief&quot;, he was all business and in bad-cop mode. He came right to the point: &quot;The research you have been doing is creating divisions in our society and we will not allow it. We will keep your files. Your laptop and iPod [which I used for interviews] we will give you back tomorrow. We will contact you. You will leave on the next available flight. Do not return to Dubai; you are banned and will be arrested if you return.&quot; Good cop put a cheery spin on things. &quot;I hope you have enjoyed Dubai. Well, this is not enjoyable, but I hope the rest of your stay has been productive and enjoyable and that you represent Dubai positively.&quot; What do you say to that? Good cop also came to the nub of what I&apos;d got myself into when he told me he liked me, but had doubts about my funding. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; I asked. &quot;I think it is the Jewish,&quot; he said. &quot;Why would &apos;the Jewish&apos; be funding me, a Muslim American, to ask questions of people in Dubai?&quot; &quot;I do not know, but I think it is them ... and maybe the CIA.&quot; Anyway, they released me, and put me in the back of the Toyota. On the seat were two bottles of water for me. Nice. After 13 hours of talking, I was thirsty. The driver even bought me a vitamin C drink on the way home, and let me cadge a couple of cigarettes before he dropped me at my friend&apos;s apartment building. And so my story was not one of torture or long imprisonment; rather, a glimpse into the everyday workings of an apparatus of control where the insecurities of those in power can still so easily distort the ordinary activities of an ordinary person. The next day, a regular policeman phoned and told me to meet him that evening at a shopping mall, the start of another slightly surreal encounter when I got there and called his mobile. &quot;Where are you?&quot; he asked. &quot;Standing next to the guy dressed like a chicken,&quot; I replied (some sort of mall promotion was going on). Come up the escalator, the unseen policeman told me. Halfway up I thought, Oh, this is bad. At the top I made to turn around but then saw him he summoned me to join him. And so I found myself sitting in Starbucks writing out a receipt under his supervision for equipment received in &quot;best operating condition&quot;, after which he gave me back my laptop - without, I later discovered, the hard drive. The authorities also kept my iPod with all my interviews ... and replaced it with a new 60 GB video iPod! And if ever I came back to Dubai, the officer said hospitably, he would show me around. After a fantastic farewell dinner of kebabs with friends, we finished packing and took ourselves to the airport. Despite the threat I supposedly posed to Dubai society, the secret police who banned me apparently felt no need to escort us. Later, I wrote to the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, via the &quot;royal email&quot; section of his website asking for my hard drive back, and my files. This is the same sheikh, by the way, who launched a $10bn fund for the Middle East recently, amid much fanfare: its objective, to foster education ... and research in the region. I&apos;m still waiting for his reply. Not that it matters in practical terms. I have backups - wouldn&apos;t the secret police have realised this? What did they possibly have to gain? I also complained to Dubai&apos;s police chief, Lieutenant-General Dhahi Khalfan Tamim, via the departmental email and was quite surprised to get a response. He stood by my arrest, but then seemed to turn the whole incident on its head by assuring me that I had not been deported, nor banned: &quot;You are welcome at any time as a visitor to the Emirates, not as an investigator for a police agency or other authority that flies in the face of international legitimacy. Once again I wish to say to you that you are not on lists of persons expelled at all.&quot; Welcome at any time as a visitor. I think I&apos;ll take them up on that.

But her ambitions ultimately still depend on whether the amnesty on her corruption charges, granted to her last month by the national reconciliation ordinance, will be upheld in the new supreme court. Bhutto and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari - nicknamed Mr 10% over alleged extortion - faced eight counts of taking tens of millions of dollars in illegal kickbacks. But whatever decision the court arrives at, the couple also have to contend with money laundering proceedings in Switzerland and Spain, and a civil case in London involving an expensive Surrey mansion. As the president&apos;s ordinance only deals with offences up to 1999, investigations in Pakistan could continue into allegations that the pair paid about $2m in illegal kickbacks to Saddam Hussein under the oil-for-food programme. The controversy surrounding Bhutto&apos;s financial affairs has been compounded by reports showing she and her family have worldwide assets worth about 90bn Pakistan rupees ($1.5bn). Despite voluminous evidence, some from the British government, the Bhuttos deny all the charges. The charges Among the charges in Pakistan are allegations that the Bhuttos skimmed $2m in commissions from a 1990s deal to buy thousands of duty-free Ursus tractors from Poland. The money went into a Swiss bank account. Christine Junod, a Geneva magistrate, says documentary evidence &quot;establishes beyond doubt that these commissions, under the cover of alleged consultancy fees, were meant to remunerate the illicit advantages obtained by Ursus from the Pakistani administration, thanks to the interventions of Asif Zardari&quot;. A second case involves a Dubai-based Pakistani gold bullion dealer who allegedly paid $10m to a Bhutto company in the British Virgin Islands for the exclusive right to import gold, again losing the country millions of dollar in duties. Zardari, who has served six years on corruption charges, is also accused of evading duties on the import of a \u00a355,000 armoured BMW. A fourth case, involving Swiss banks, is moving towards a trial in Geneva. In this the couple are accused of taking kickbacks for the award of contracts to two Swiss firms employed to stop customs fraud. In 2003 a Swiss magistrate found the couple guilty, sentenced them to six months in prison and ordered them to pay $12m back to the Pakistan government. The paper trail connecting Benazir Bhutto to the case started with a moment of extravagance. Five years before, she had bought a \u00a3117,000 diamond necklace in London; part of that was paid for by one of the Swiss firms identified in the investigation. Lawyers for the Bhuttos challenged the judgment, a move that required the case be reopened. Last month the Swiss authorities said they would go ahead. Oil-for-food scandal The authoritative Volker report into the oil-for-food scandal identified the company Petroline FZC as having received oil contracts worth \u00a3145m in return for paying illicit surcharges to Iraq of $2m. Pakistan&apos;s national accountability bureau has produced documents which show that Bhutto was the company chairwoman. Some of the profits went to firms in Spain, where another criminal investigation into money laundering is still active. Rockwood House The Surrey mansion, Rockwood House, was bought in 1995, apparently owned through a chain of firms and trusts, involving addresses in the Isle of Man, Jersey and Liechtenstein. Zardari denied, for eight years, that he was the owner despite instructing a builder with plans for a helipad, nine-hole golf course and polo pony paddock. Crates of valuable artefacts were shipped from Karachi. In 2004, when creditors forced the property into a liquidation sale, the Pakistani government claimed the proceeds. Lawyers for Zardari then appeared, claiming he was the beneficial owner. The money from the sale is still in the liquidators&apos; bank account, though a high court judge said the Pakistani government had a reasonable case, stating the money came via corruption. The case continues through the courts with Zardari repeatedly claiming to be too ill to mount a rebuttal.", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "Benazir Bhutto", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Trail of corruption and kickback charges still in wings for opposition leader", "sentences": ["A second case involves a Dubai-based Pakistani gold bullion dealer who allegedly paid $10m to a Bhutto company in the British Virgin Islands for the exclusive right to import gold, again losing the country millions of dollar in duties."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/12/pakistan.benazirbhutto", "publicationDate": "2007-11-12T09:28:16Z"}, {"article": "The world&apos;s 13th richest man has set a new standard for billionaire opulence with the first VIP order for the A380 superjumbo.  Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who topped the Forbes Arabia rich list last year, has invested a small piece of his estimated $20.3bn (\u00a39.8bn) fortune in an Airbus &quot;Flying Palace&quot;, which is priced out of most tycoons&apos; range with a retail price of $310m.  Airline customers for the mega-jet, which can seat up to 850 people, have managed to win sizeable discounts by placing bulk orders but the Riyadh-based billionaire is expected to have paid the full price - before adding the multimillion pound cost of kitting out the airliner. The passenger version of the A380 has already raised the bar in luxurious air travel, with inaugural customer Singapore Airlines fitting its business class section with double-bed cabins.  However, private buyers will have much more leeway to indulge their whims, because the lack of hundreds of economy class seats leaves ample room for a kitchen, boardroom, cocktail bar, gymnasium, jacuzzi and giant plasma TV screens. Virgin Atlantic, one of the biggest investors in innovative airline products and a prospective A380 buyer, has considered installing a swimming pool and creche in its planes. Prince Alwaleed signed the sale agreement for the A380 in a ceremony at the Dubai Airshow today. David Velupillai, marketing director at Airbus executive aviation, said there were 25 VIP Boeing 747s in service and at least five more orders for large VIP planes are expected over the next few years. He added that the plane will be delivered around 2010 and will take about two years to fit. Asked if the prince had chosen the layout of his new jet, Velupillai said his customer had &quot;not decided yet&quot;. He said: &quot;In general terms, the VIP A380s will have lots of bedrooms, plus lounges where up to 20 people can be seated.&quot;  Velupillai added that the A380 gave Prince Alwaleed considerably more room than his smaller 747-400. &quot;He will get 50% more floor space. What a lot of corporate jet customers want is to trade up to something bigger and better. If you already have a 747, then bigger and better is an A380.&quot; Alwaleed, a cousin of the Saudi King Abdullah, made the bulk of his fortune from a high-risk investment in Citigroup in the 1990s, although the value of his stake has fallen by a third this year after Citigroup was caught in the centre of the sub-prime crisis. His other shareholdings include News Corporation, Time Warner and Canary Wharf. Alwaleed tours his business empire in a custom-made Boeing 747-400, which pales in comparison with the 73m-long A380. &quot;Prince Alwaleed&apos;s order means that Airbus&apos; sales success in the corporate jet market now extends from its smallest aircraft, the A318 Elite, all the way up to its largest, the A380 Flying Palace,&quot; said John Leahy, Airbus chief operating officer.", "tags": ["Business", "World news", "Saudi Arabia", "EADS", "Airbus"], "title": "Saudi prince buys $310m Airbus", "sentences": ["Prince Alwaleed signed the sale agreement for the A380 in a ceremony at the Dubai Airshow today."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/12/theairlineindustry", "publicationDate": "2007-11-12T12:27:18Z"}, {"article": "Companies ranging from an animation studio in Hyderabad to a private jet business based in Hampton Wick, Surrey, are lining up to list on Aim.

However, the man whose relentless energy earned him the nickname of &quot;the mad genius&quot; when he moved to train in the United States in 1987 will remain in the sport as a passionate advocate of artificial racing surfaces, particularly in the US. Dickinson&apos;s racing career in Britain was a story of considerable success as a jockey, immense and historic achievements as a National Hunt trainer, and finally of baffling disappointment and near-humiliation in 1986 when he switched codes to train Flat horses for Robert Sangster at his Manton estate. Steeplechasers were Dickinson&apos;s speciality in the 1980s, when he had horses of the calibre of Wayward Lad, Bregawn, Silver Buck and Badsworth Boy, who won the Queen Mother Champion Chase three years running. He was the champion National Hunt trainer three times, and saddled no fewer than 12 winners in a single day - a world record - on Boxing Day in 1982. However, it was a race rather than any individual horse that secured his place in turf history at the age of just 33. Bregawn was first home in the 1983 Gold Cup with Graham Bradley in the saddle, followed by Captain John, Wayward Lad, Silver Buck and Ashley House. That race confirmed Dickinson&apos;s image as an obsessive perfectionist - he claimed to have lost a stone in weight due to stress in the run-up to the Festival - and a far-sighted genius for whom anything was possible. Yet just four years later, he had left British racing for good, after a disastrous season at Manton in which he trained just four winners, and did not get onto the board at all until October. In typical, idiosyncratic Dickinson style, he then decided to set up his own training establishment in Maryland, called Tapeta Farm, rather than train at a track as is the normal practice in America. He drew heavily on his experiences as an assistant trainer to the great Vincent O&apos;Brien at Ballydoyle in Ireland and enjoyed considerable success, in particular when saddling Da Hoss to two victories in the Breeders&apos; Cup Mile in 1996 and 1998, despite the horse having been injured for much of the intervening time. For much of the last 20 years, though, he has also been developing Tapeta, an artificial racing surface which now appears on the brink of such success that Dickinson has decided to disperse his string. For all his achievements as a trainer, it could yet be his lasting legacy to the sport, as the campaign to replace harsh dirt tracks in American racing gathers pace. Tapeta has already been installed at Golden Gate Fields in California, and perhaps more significantly still at Godolphin&apos;s Al Quoz training facility in Dubai. Tapeta is clearly a leading candidate to be the surface at Meydan racecourse, which is currently under construction and due to open for racing in 2009. &quot;I have always had a passion for surfaces,&quot; Dickinson said yesterday, in an interview with Racing UK. &quot;The first day I went into Vincent O&apos;Brien&apos;s yard was a life-changing day when I saw the different surfaces he worked on. I love racing and horses.

He says &quot;we need an army, navy and airforce of engineers&quot; to realise the engineering projects the country wants. As it happens, I am an engineer, and tremendously proud to be so. But we do not need more engineers. We need better engineers. We need more thinkers, more engineering designers, more people who can conjure up something magical out of a complex world. We need an overhaul of engineering education. I know this flies in the face of conventional wisdom, but engineering is not a numbers game. It is much more important than that. Before asking how many engineers we need, we should first ask: &quot;What will they be doing?&quot; The dominant uncertainty of the 21st-century world is not what happens to the QE2, or even whether we can engineer a new one on the Clyde. The dominant uncertainty of our time is survival on this planet. In response, engineers must stand up and say: &quot;We helped get the world into this mess, and we are going to make it our mission to get it out again.&quot; This need is poorly served by specialised research universities and corporate engineering practice, rooted as it is in the postwar era and a scientific tendency to avoid responsibility. Nowadays, sums are so easy that many engineers try to analyse their way to an answer, diligently solving the wrong problem, rather than think their way to a solution. That is the root of the shortage of engineering expertise. I believe you can halve the engineering time spent on projects just by thinking clearly first. Glancey says that, in our &quot;knowledge-based New British economy&quot;, &quot;making nothing much beyond money ... is somehow clever&quot;. If all we have is knowledge we surely are sunk, but what the world actually needs is understanding, and that&apos;s where real engineers are priceless. You won&apos;t be surprised to hear that, last time I looked, I wasn&apos;t extinct. More than 99.9% of my DNA is shared with Brunel, and with the builders of the QE2, yet I am very different to them. If the fittest survive, thinking engineers will flourish, and commodity-mongers will die (they are already being replaced by computers). Engineering has been lost for about a century, but - just as in Brunel&apos;s time - it is still fundamentally a creative endeavour. Engineering has always been an art, supported by science. That is more relevant today than ever: engineers still have the potential to design the solutions to climate change, population growth, increasing wealth and an ageing population. \u00b7 Chris Wise, the engineering director behind London&apos;s Millennium bridge and engineering designer of the 2012 Olympic velodrome, was professor of creative design at Imperial College until 2005; later this month he becomes master of the RSA&apos;s Royal Designers for Industry  Chris.W@expedition.uk.com", "tags": ["Construction industry"], "title": "Response: We have more than enough engineers.

Not just from flying and the carbon emissions ennui that goes along with it, wondering if I&apos;m depriving future generations of the chance of forgetting their stag do in Riga, but from the mind-control games you have to play with other people when you return. Take Prague: when I dare to suggest Prague isn&apos;t the most beautiful city on the continent, I&apos;m met first with a barrage of confirmation questions (&quot;Did you see the Castle? The Old Town square?&quot;) then puzzlement, as if I might have missed some crucial details (&quot;But you saw the statues on the Charles Bridge, right?&quot; because I might have ignored the direction in which every tourist camera for miles was pointed) and finally, rationalisation (&quot;Ah, but it&apos;s not yet winter/spring/the anniversary of Diana&apos;s death. You should go then. THEN you&apos;ll see&quot;). I like to think of these as the three stages of travel guilt-trips. The interrogation session doesn&apos;t occur for most other cities: shrug and say you thought Zagreb was a bit overrated and no-one demands to know if you went to this particular cafe just past the bridge where the light is right. In travel, as in life, there are known knowns and sacred cows. And Beirut is one of these. There is no city in the Middle East that commands such superlatives as Lebanon&apos;s capital. Dare to suggest that it is something other than the hub of all that is fun and cultural east of the Nile and the guards circle and the three queries wriggle out: &quot;But you went to Gemmayzeh, right?&quot; (Confirmation.) &quot;But at the weekend, not in the week, everyone works in the week. You went at the weekend, right?&quot; (Puzzlement.) A pause and then the train of rationalisation glides in, never late: &quot;Yeah, but these are bad days for the city since the war.&quot; It&apos;s all so very black-and-white. True, these are bad days for the city - on Sunday, the presidential election was postponed for the third time because politicians can&apos;t agree on a candidate to replace the current incumbent Emile Lahoud, and Beirut is jittery, always expecting more bombs, more chaos. But that&apos;s not my point. I don&apos;t dislike Beirut, I actually rather like it, I&apos;m just surprised at the reverence it generates, especially compared to its cousins in Cairo, Istanbul or Dubai. The most puzzling aspect of this awe is that is comes almost exclusively from westerners. The Lebanese want you to like their capital, but most have seen the world and know what else is out there. But foreigners. Geez. It&apos;s as if every European or American who steps into Beirut is given a happy pill at the border. The number of Californian-accented &quot;awesomes&quot; piping up around you on Hamra Street is enough to knock you into an aural stupor. I often wonder if these visitors have so swallowed the terrorism line that when they arrive and are not met by balaclava-clad PFLP-GC supporters, they&apos;re just so relieved it makes them giddy. Am I wrong? Probably. I just don&apos;t like being guilt-tripped into falling for a city. I mentioned this casually in a tapas place in Beirut and people I didn&apos;t know were leaning in to furnish me with reasons why I&apos;ve got to love Lebanon. They hammered me down until I gradually put up my defences and started to backtrack: &quot;Look, look, Beirut is amazing.&quot; And it is amazing. Fascinating culture? Check. Warmth and hospitality? Check. Vibrant social scene? Check. But is it the greatest capital in the whole region?

Twenty million dollars (\u00a310m) at stake over four days on a course in Dubai. Nice work if you can get it, or at least nicer work than the work done by the immigrant labourers in the so-called &quot;world&apos;s greatest tourist destination&quot; who went on strike last week in support of a claim that would see their wages rise from \u00a352 a month to \u00a379. The good news is the labourers got their rise. The bad news they returned to a life - to quote the 2006 Human Rights Watch report Building Towers, Cheating Workers - of &quot;wage exploitation, indebtedness to unscrupulous recruiters and working conditions that are hazardous to the point of being deadly&quot;. No doubt the European tour would object to any suggestion that its willingness to accept the backing of the United Arab Emirates government for a $20m tournament is an endorsement of the kind of practices, unchecked by the very same government, described in the Human Rights Watch report. They might have a (small) point, not least because it is hardly golf&apos;s fault that some Indian immigrants in the Emirates are forced to live in labour compounds - eight people to a 9ft x 12ft room - that could more accurately be described as prison camps. Likewise, it is safe to assume these same workers would continue to be denied the right to unionise whether there were 100 tournaments in Dubai or none at all. Even if direct culpability could be established, it would be unfair to single out the European tour alone for criticism. Only this week Greg Norman turned up in Dubai to launch the Greg Norman Limited Edition Range Rover Sport - given away free to those who purchase one of the 66 luxury homes at the &quot;Fireside by Greg Norman&quot; estate. &quot;Dubai has put itself on the map as the ultimate destination for golf and residence,&quot; declared the Great White Property Shark. Poor Greg, he probably thinks Human Rights Watch is a limited-edition timepiece. The same goes for Manchester United, which runs soccer schools in Dubai; for tennis, which stages one of its premier tournaments in the emirate every year. Horseracing is virtually owned by the family that rules Dubai, while the International Cricket Council, unable to resist the financial incentives on offer, decided to base itself there. Of course there is absolutely no suggestion that any of these foreign visitors mistreat their own employees but could it be that their mere presence endorses Dubai&apos;s PR campaign? We live in commercial times. These are all commercial entities and it would be naive to think they would take so much as a sideways glance at immigrant labour camps while trousering their share of Dubai&apos;s economic boom. But it is even more naive to trouser the cash and then expect people to swallow corporate nonsense, \u00e0 la Greg Norman, without someone pointing out that Dubai&apos;s economic boom has its downside too, especially for those who risk their lives building skyscrapers and are paid a pittance in return. &quot;But politics isn&apos;t our game,&quot; one sports administrator said to me the other week. This is the opposite of the truth. Politics is everybody&apos;s game. It is just a question of whether you want to take part or not. It wasn&apos;t so long ago those involved in sport were willing participants in politics. I&apos;m thinking of Jimmy Hill, who fought to abolish football&apos;s minimum wage, of Tommy Smith and John Carlos, who used their medal ceremony at the Mexico City Olympics to make a civil rights protest, and of the great Muhammad Ali, the most eloquent political athlete of all. Somewhere along the way sport sold its soul and Michael Jordan wrote the epitaph. &quot;Republicans wear sneakers too,&quot; he said, refusing the invitation to criticise a nasty old racist politician called Jesse Helms. And money is money, no doubt, even if comes at the cost of a few thousand exploited labourers in Dubai. Except it is not. It is tainted money. Of course you won&apos;t hear that said by anyone in golf, although the heart lifted momentarily yesterday when Ernie Els was quoted as describing the $20m prize fund as &quot;absurd&quot;. &quot;However, I&apos;ll play. You can&apos;t afford not to play,&quot; he went on. Pity that. A well chosen word from the Big Easy (brilliant golfer and political agitator) would have been the perfect response to the coming fanfare. Only one No10 Brown should worry himself about Gordon Brown may have faults but no one can accuse him of indolence. As if bank crises and trying to keep the earth spinning on its axis while George Bush still roams free wasn&apos;t enough trouble for any man, the prime minister has now embarked on a mission to give British football back to British footballers. This idea will find favour with some, especially those who think Cesc F\u00e1bregas is a blight on a landscape adorned by the artistic brushstrokes of Steve Sidwell and Robbie Savage. Yet even those who argue, mistakenly in my view, that there are too many foreign players in our game must have read reports of Brown&apos;s concerns and wondered how he is going to accomplish his mission. For one thing, the Premier League doesn&apos;t seem keen on quotas and for another, the European Union won&apos;t allow it under existing employment laws. There is always the motivation that comes from necessity, as happened in Scotland, where the clubs were forced to develop home-grown talent when their television money dried up and they could no longer afford to import second-rate Spaniards. Yet it is hard to image that the top-flight English clubs will be similarly broke any time soon. That leaves the voluntary route. A limit on foreign players might be possible but only if the clubs get together and agree that what might be bad for them in the short term will eventually benefit the national sport. Just typing that previous sentence, with its presumption of cooperation between clubs for the greater good, makes one realise how implausible Brown&apos;s mission really is. Perhaps he should stick to the day job. Cocksure Murray growing up in a hurry There is a message in yesterday&apos;s news that Andy Murray has dispensed with the services of Brad Gilbert and it is not that the LTA wasted \u00a3700,000 on a coach for Scot, who ungratefully threw the generosity back in their face. No, the message is that Murray really might be as good as we all hope he is. He is certainly cockier than we thought. Gilbert is one of the world&apos;s best tennis coaches, as he proved by elevating Murray&apos;s game in the time they were together. Still, the teenager felt able to get rid of him. Henceforth, Murray will be paying for his own coaching and that is as it should be. Let&apos;s hope he can find people as good as Gilbert. Robinson makes a bonnie bold return Sitting in the stand at Murrayfield last weekend watching a spirited Edinburgh side go down to Toulouse in the Heineken Cup it was hard to resist the temptation to walk up and shake Andy Robinson&apos;s hand. Even allowing for the fact that the French are notoriously poor travellers it was a stunning performance from a squad that came together under Robinson&apos;s leadership less than two months ago. The former England coach was on the receiving end of terrible criticism, much of it unwarranted, before he was booted out of Twickenham.

Now imagine how enticing it would be, as Birmingham manager, to be offered the plum post of Wigan boss, a team in a slightly worse position then the one you currently helm. Depressing, isn&apos;t it? Certainly Steve Bruce thinks so, he&apos;s flown off to Dubai with his family - possibly with his head in his hands, contemplating the bleakness ahead - while Dave Whelan and Brum big cheeses thrash out a deal somewhere between \u00a31m and \u00a33m for his services. Still it could be worse, he could be Derby manager.

Davies would prefer Portsmouth&apos;s David Nugent but is rumoured not to be against Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Daffy Duck up front who, to be fair, can&apos;t be much worse than Kenny Miller. Here&apos;s a bumper crop of the rest: Michael Carrick thinks Dimitar Berbatov is exactly the sort of player he should be playing alongside at United. Unfortunately for him, Spurs think Carrick&apos;s exactly the sort of player they shouldn&apos;t have sold in the first place and, like Take That, want him back for good. For his next trick Magic Juande will sign Espanyol&apos;s \u00a35m defender Dani Jarque before, in a move possibly only designed to ingratiate himself with the Spurs&apos; support, he&apos;ll beat Arsenal to 19-year-old Diego Capel&apos;s signature. To console himself, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will buy \u00a3500,000 Congo hitman Tresor Mputu - the next Samuel Eto&apos;o, apparently. After rejecting Wigan, Paul Jewell is on the FAI&apos;s list to replace Steve Staunton - alongside George Graham, Graeme Sounness, Terry Venables and, oh dear, G\u00e9rard Houllier. No embellishment needed, really. Big Sam wants Russian midfielder Andrei Arshavin from Zenit St Petersburg and, with hilarious optimism, reckons offloading Shola Ameobi will earn him the requisite \u00a37m. He&apos;ll have to pull it off quick - the transfer, that is - because Alan Shearer wants to swap doling out monosyllabic platitudes on the BBC sofa for a crack at doling out monosyllabic platitudes from the Newcastle dug-out. Or the England one. Or whatever other club the Daily Express&apos; fevered imagination can invent. Oh, and they also reckon Michael Owen&apos;s going to do one, too. Leroy Lita will be unceremoniously put out with the bins round the back of the Madejski unless he starts doing what he&apos;s paid for - scoring goals. Awaiting him there will be a greased-up &apos;Arry Redknapp and Gareth Southgate who will fight it out to the death for his signature. Lawrie Sanchez hopes everyone will be sufficiently distracted by the spectacle to allow him to steal in and swipe Marcus Hahnemann. Stuart Pearce says he wouldn&apos;t want the England job if he was offered it. Similarly, the Mill would like to rule itself out of the running for the job too, along with those of next Pope, head of the UN and Eternal Emperor Of The World. Benjani Mwaruwari will be digging out his Clash records as he wonders whether he should stay at Portsmouth or go to Juventus for \u00a37m.

Is that an odd thing for a bunch of Westminster journos to do considering he wants to wreck the place?  &apos;&apos;An historic moment of decision approaches.... Brilliant tactics... etc etc, &apos;&apos; says editor Matt d&apos;Ancona in a statement. Really ? Does it perhaps reflect more the English-Tory-majority panel&apos;s growing disenchantment with the 300-year-old Union with Scotland? Or am I just being grouchy as a newly-demoted ex-judge?  It&apos;s a slightly star-struck list (sponsors always like that) which includes Tony Blair&apos;s resignation of the year (ho ho), Lady Thatcher as peer of the year (a kindness in her frail circumstances, I suppose) and one for the arch-Unionist Ian Paisley - which I suppose offsets Mr Salmond&apos;s. I can see why George Osborne gets a gong for that conference speech that panicked ministers over the inheritance tax racket.  But I am racking my brains over William Hague&apos;s speech of the year. Which one was that? Surely not on European referendums where he is helping to dig his leader into a very deep hole and should know better.  There again, Labour&apos;s Michael Connarty was made inquisitor of the year over his committee&apos;s &apos;&apos;revelation&apos;&apos; that the EU Reform Treaty&apos;s UK opt-outs may prove worthless, a revelation which may well prove worthless instead.  Do I detect the hairy hand and carpeted head of Andrew Neil? The diehard Eurosceptic is CEO of the Spectator, but he is also a Scot, an anti-devolution Scot, as the Scotsman&apos;s genteel readers discovered to their alarm when he seized the helm there. All in all, puzzling. No surprise really, but you have actually to go to Newcastle to feel the funereal sense of loss at the collapse of the region&apos;s big bank, the Northern Rock. Its logo is everywhere, its board is mainly local (too local), its charitable largesse as well known as the Newcastle Brewery&apos;s was a generation ago. &apos;&apos;But they gave \u00a3100 to the Choral Society,&apos;&apos; one distressed middle-aged woman told a friend of mine. When Clive Anderson gave an after-dinner speech here, he apparently lost his audience with an opening gag about Northern Rock which might have been acceptable in any other city in Britain. The shadow of the crisis - still lengthening as fears grow for a break-up and huge local job losses on top of everything else - gave a slightly mournful edge to the annual North East Economic Forum (known as &apos;&apos;Neef&apos;&apos;) which I chaired again yesterday - as an outsider who tells more tactful jokes.  No one gave Northern Rock more than a passing reference, but it was the elephant in the corner as both David Cameron, Lib Dem frontrunner Nick Clegg (the Spectator&apos;s Newcomer of the Year) and communities minister, Hazel Blears came and did their stuff - as local MP Tony Blair did last year. Cameron and Clegg - Dave is a few months older - made an interesting pair since their speeches - unheard by each other - made many similar points: the need for economic stability as the basis for success; for government to get tax and regulation right (not too much of it, Dave stressed); and to concentrate instead on its role providing infra-structure.  Around here that means transport links. The morning&apos;s Newcastle Journal compares the region&apos;s crowded roads - just 38 miles of motorway - to Lithuania&apos;s. Despite better R&amp;D prospects and school standards, the north-east still does badly on skills and its per capita income is 79% of the UK average. They want to get to 80% by 2016. To a Cornishman - me - much of it sounds very familiar. Speaking in every conference&apos;s doldrums hour - late afternoon - Hazel Blears finds herself telling the audience in the Gateshead Hilton (yes, times change) what they have already discussed. But Clegg and - especially - Cameron impress their audience, including several hard-bitten Labour politicians, except on Europe where Clegg scores strongly. Dave ignores it. The day&apos;s cautious mood does not prevent a feisty defence of the &apos;&apos;demonised&apos;&apos; airline industry&apos;s environmental record - much of it a surprise to me - by Keith Longstaff, a senior official of Emirate Airlines which has just opened a Newcastle-Dubai link.  Such is growing fuel efficiciency that any freight shifting from road to air will cut emissions, I think I heard him claim, along with a plea to governments that proper air traffic control corridors could save huge amounts of fuel. Better than punitive ill-considered EU tax plans which will make matters worse. Even more impressive in its very different way was a stunningly good talk about how to create a diverse global business - making commercial electrical vehicles among other things - with a capital base of \u00a3600m and 1,200 employees in barely a decade.  It came from a passionate 50-something called Roy Stanley, chairman of the Tanfield Group. He chided his audience of business, civic and political leaders - the people who take credit for the region&apos;s 20-year revival - for not doing more to create enough confident, outward-looking and risk-taking business start-ups.  &apos;&apos;Don&apos;t knock tryers,&apos;&apos; he said, accusing Geordies of a tendency to knock success. The region has been &apos;&apos;held hostage to foreign companies for too long.&apos;&apos; And &apos;&apos;create a bridge to the money markets. London is awash with dosh, but how many fund managers do you see in the north-east?&apos;&apos;  Good advice for any region. Best of all, Stanley turned out to be an ex-comprehensive school teacher. He taught the kids business studies. What a star! Who was it said: &quot;Those who can do and those who can&apos;t teach?&apos;&apos;  The King&apos;s Cross train runs on time in both directions, just over three hours. Heading north on a new coach, I find the standard class seats have power points for laptops and there is wifi available for internet connection. On the way south, the older coaches offer no such facilitity and I feel vaguely resentful. How easily we come to take improvements for granted.  Not all improvements are progress, mind you. Like many big stations Newcastle&apos;s now boasts a Cornish pasty shop. It sports a sign saying &apos;&apos;Taste of the East via the South West: New Sweet and Sour Cornish Pasty.&apos;&apos; As a purist, I do not try one and wonder what my seafaring dad would have made of it, let alone his own tin-mining father. But it is always good to see Cornish exports so far from home, especially with the kind of product diversification Roy Stanley was talking about. Adapt and survive. Glad to read in today&apos;s Guardian that assistant commander John Yates of the Yard cleared up any misunderstanding when he told MPs last month that he didn&apos;t think he&apos;d met a lobby journalist in his life, let alone leaked stuff from the loans-for-honours inquiry to them. Sightings had been sighted so eyebrows were raised among the hacks. It seems Yates didn&apos;t realise that TV types like Nick Robinson are lobby journalists, too. There was no &apos;&apos;improper&apos;&apos; disclosure of information, he confirmed. Hmmm.

LSE recorded a 41% jump in operating profit to \u00a3114.7m, beating analysts&apos; predictions of \u00a3111m.  Higher stock and derivatives trading, caused by investors rejigging their portfolios during the volatility, boosted revenues 24% to \u00a3203.1m. Basic earnings per share rocketed by 48% to 35.7p.  TradElect, a new technology platform aimed at faster and more efficient trading, contributed to a 77% increase in Sets (stock exchange trading system) volumes to 555,000 bargains a day.  LSE said its capital return programme was making &quot;good progress&quot; and it had completed \u00a3154m of the \u00a3250m share buyback it announced at the start of the year. It has returned \u00a394m to shareholders and announced a further return of \u00a3500m. Its attraction to overseas customers is also growing; there were 27 international companies among the exchange&apos;s 72 main market new issues, nearly four times more than the same period last year. Clara Furse, chief executive, said the results were &quot;excellent&quot;. She said developments in technology, products and its regulatory integrity meant that the LSE was &quot;well placed to continue to compete successfully and meet the evolving needs of increasingly international market users&quot;. LSE, which merged with Borsa Italiana in October, said a 33% increase in the interim dividend from 6p to 8p reflected the &quot;continued excellent results and confidence in future growth prospects for the enlarged group&quot;. A group of Italian banks is now the exchange&apos;s largest shareholder with 28%; of which Unicredito holds some 6%, while Intesa Sanpaolo has 5.3%. Other LSE shareholders include Qatar Investment Authority and Borse Dubai, which together own 35%. The two Middle Eastern groups are locked in a power struggle over the LSE and eagerly snapped up the 31% stake owned by Nasdaq, the US technology market, in September. Shares in the exchange have risen 24% since. The UK exchange has also faced takeover attempts from Nasdaq, Australia&apos;s Macquarie Bank, Euronext, Germany&apos;s Deutsche B\u00f6rse and the Swedish exchange, OM, but has always maintained that it can expand independently. However, there are doubts as to how long the LSE, which is home to the largest pool of liquidity in Europe and is currently the world&apos;s number-four equity exchange, can sustain its income from share trading and data sales after an EU directive to promote increased competition in financial markets was introduced this month. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which represents the biggest shake-up for the stockmarket in 20 years, seeks to erode barriers to trading, make it more efficient and end bourses&apos; monopolies over share trading throughout the European Union.  Several investment banks have already moved to take advantage of the change, and a consortium including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has set up a trading platform called Turquoise that may threaten LSE&apos;s dominance.", "tags": ["Credit crunch", "Business", "Market turmoil", "London Stock Exchange"], "title": "London Stock Exchange profits from the global market turmoil", "sentences": ["Other LSE shareholders include Qatar Investment Authority and Borse Dubai, which together own 35%."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/16/creditcrunch.marketturmoil", "publicationDate": "2007-11-16T00:00:28Z"}, {"article": "Air passengers based outside south-east England are avoiding London&apos;s congested airports by making greater use of regional airports, according to an industry study. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said growth at Britain&apos;s regional airports has outstripped Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted since the start of the decade. Passenger numbers at smaller airports grew 7% per year between 2000 and 2006, according to the industry regulator, while the capital&apos;s flight hubs have averaged 3%.  Annual passengers at the UK&apos;s regional airports now exceed 100 million, nearly triple the total in 1990. &quot;Regional airports have put themselves firmly on the map as gateways for travel to and from the regions they serve,&quot; said Harry Bush, director of economic regulation at the CAA.  The report&apos;s authors said there was &quot;anecdotal&quot; evidence that Heathrow&apos;s reputation for overcrowding and poor service, exacerbated by last summer&apos;s terror scare, had contributed to the popularity of regional airports. A more significant factor was the growth of low-cost carriers using regional airports such as Liverpool&apos;s John Lennon airport and Glasgow Prestwick as bases. The fastest growing regional airport in Britain is Bristol, followed by Liverpool, East Midlands, Leeds Bradford, Prestwick and Southampton. Heathrow&apos;s attraction as a hub for international flights had been diminished by airlines such as Continental and Emirates, which now fly to destinations including New York and Dubai from Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow, the report said. Domestic flights to Heathrow had fallen sharply in recent years, reflecting concerns that long-haul carriers are squeezing out domestic services. Domestic flights to and from Heathrow could be undermined further by the Open Skies treaty, which liberalises air travel between the US and the EU from April. &quot;The scarcity (and consequent value) of slots at Heathrow continues to be perceived as a threat to more marginal domestic services,&quot; said the report.", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business", "Travel"], "title": "Regional airports growing as passengers avoid London hubs", "sentences": ["Heathrow&apos;s attraction as a hub for international flights had been diminished by airlines such as Continental and Emirates, which now fly to destinations including New York and Dubai from Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow, the report said."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/16/theairlineindustry", "publicationDate": "2007-11-16T09:41:39Z"}, {"article": "Breakfast, west London So the Spectator&apos;s panel of judges have picked Alex Salmond as parliamentarian of the year. Is that an odd thing for a bunch of Westminster journos to do considering he wants to wreck the place?  &apos;&apos;An historic moment of decision approaches.... Brilliant tactics... etc etc, &apos;&apos; says editor Matt d&apos;Ancona in a statement. Really ? Does it perhaps reflect more the English-Tory-majority panel&apos;s growing disenchantment with the 300-year-old Union with Scotland? Or am I just being grouchy as a newly-demoted ex-judge?  It&apos;s a slightly star-struck list (sponsors always like that) which includes Tony Blair&apos;s resignation of the year (ho ho), Lady Thatcher as peer of the year (a kindness in her frail circumstances, I suppose) and one for the arch-Unionist Ian Paisley - which I suppose offsets Mr Salmond&apos;s. I can see why George Osborne gets a gong for that conference speech that panicked ministers over the inheritance tax racket.  But I am racking my brains over William Hague&apos;s speech of the year. Which one was that? Surely not on European referendums where he is helping to dig his leader into a very deep hole and should know better.  There again, Labour&apos;s Michael Connarty was made inquisitor of the year over his committee&apos;s &apos;&apos;revelation&apos;&apos; that the EU Reform Treaty&apos;s UK opt-outs may prove worthless, a revelation which may well prove worthless instead.  Do I detect the hairy hand and carpeted head of Andrew Neil? The diehard Eurosceptic is CEO of the Spectator, but he is also a Scot, an anti-devolution Scot, as the Scotsman&apos;s genteel readers discovered to their alarm when he seized the helm there. All in all, puzzling. No surprise really, but you have actually to go to Newcastle to feel the funereal sense of loss at the collapse of the region&apos;s big bank, the Northern Rock. Its logo is everywhere, its board is mainly local (too local), its charitable largesse as well known as the Newcastle Brewery&apos;s was a generation ago. &apos;&apos;But they gave \u00a3100 to the Choral Society,&apos;&apos; one distressed middle-aged woman told a friend of mine. When Clive Anderson gave an after-dinner speech here, he apparently lost his audience with an opening gag about Northern Rock which might have been acceptable in any other city in Britain. The shadow of the crisis - still lengthening as fears grow for a break-up and huge local job losses on top of everything else - gave a slightly mournful edge to the annual North East Economic Forum (known as &apos;&apos;Neef&apos;&apos;) which I chaired again yesterday - as an outsider who tells more tactful jokes.  No one gave Northern Rock more than a passing reference, but it was the elephant in the corner as both David Cameron, Lib Dem frontrunner Nick Clegg (the Spectator&apos;s Newcomer of the Year) and communities minister, Hazel Blears came and did their stuff - as local MP Tony Blair did last year. Cameron and Clegg - Dave is a few months older - made an interesting pair since their speeches - unheard by each other - made many similar points: the need for economic stability as the basis for success; for government to get tax and regulation right (not too much of it, Dave stressed); and to concentrate instead on its role providing infra-structure.  Around here that means transport links. The morning&apos;s Newcastle Journal compares the region&apos;s crowded roads - just 38 miles of motorway - to Lithuania&apos;s. Despite better R&amp;D prospects and school standards, the north-east still does badly on skills and its per capita income is 79% of the UK average. They want to get to 80% by 2016. To a Cornishman - me - much of it sounds very familiar. Speaking in every conference&apos;s doldrums hour - late afternoon - Hazel Blears finds herself telling the audience in the Gateshead Hilton (yes, times change) what they have already discussed. But Clegg and - especially - Cameron impress their audience, including several hard-bitten Labour politicians, except on Europe where Clegg scores strongly. Dave ignores it. The day&apos;s cautious mood does not prevent a feisty defence of the &apos;&apos;demonised&apos;&apos; airline industry&apos;s environmental record - much of it a surprise to me - by Keith Longstaff, a senior official of Emirate Airlines which has just opened a Newcastle-Dubai link.  Such is growing fuel efficiciency that any freight shifting from road to air will cut emissions, I think I heard him claim, along with a plea to governments that proper air traffic control corridors could save huge amounts of fuel. Better than punitive ill-considered EU tax plans which will make matters worse. Even more impressive in its very different way was a stunningly good talk about how to create a diverse global business - making commercial electrical vehicles among other things - with a capital base of \u00a3600m and 1,200 employees in barely a decade.  It came from a passionate 50-something called Roy Stanley, chairman of the Tanfield Group. He chided his audience of business, civic and political leaders - the people who take credit for the region&apos;s 20-year revival - for not doing more to create enough confident, outward-looking and risk-taking business start-ups.  &apos;&apos;Don&apos;t knock tryers,&apos;&apos; he said, accusing Geordies of a tendency to knock success. The region has been &apos;&apos;held hostage to foreign companies for too long.&apos;&apos; And &apos;&apos;create a bridge to the money markets. London is awash with dosh, but how many fund managers do you see in the north-east?&apos;&apos;  Good advice for any region. Best of all, Stanley turned out to be an ex-comprehensive school teacher. He taught the kids business studies. What a star! Who was it said: &quot;Those who can do and those who can&apos;t teach?&apos;&apos;  The King&apos;s Cross train runs on time in both directions, just over three hours. Heading north on a new coach, I find the standard class seats have power points for laptops and there is wifi available for internet connection. On the way south, the older coaches offer no such facilitity and I feel vaguely resentful. How easily we come to take improvements for granted.  Not all improvements are progress, mind you. Like many big stations Newcastle&apos;s now boasts a Cornish pasty shop. It sports a sign saying &apos;&apos;Taste of the East via the South West: New Sweet and Sour Cornish Pasty.&apos;&apos; As a purist, I do not try one and wonder what my seafaring dad would have made of it, let alone his own tin-mining father. But it is always good to see Cornish exports so far from home, especially with the kind of product diversification Roy Stanley was talking about. Adapt and survive. Glad to read in today&apos;s Guardian that assistant commander John Yates of the Yard cleared up any misunderstanding when he told MPs last month that he didn&apos;t think he&apos;d met a lobby journalist in his life, let alone leaked stuff from the loans-for-honours inquiry to them. Sightings had been sighted so eyebrows were raised among the hacks. It seems Yates didn&apos;t realise that TV types like Nick Robinson are lobby journalists, too. There was no &apos;&apos;improper&apos;&apos; disclosure of information, he confirmed. Hmmm.

She said it didn&apos;t matter, that it had got out of control. She had a point. I was getting through 16 litres of sparkling mineral water a week. Apart from the stupid cost it meant we were piling up plastic bottles whose recycle-ability was dubious. I went cold turkey and, with the support of my loved ones, gave up my domestic mineral water habit. To be honest it wasn&apos;t that tough. I knew I could always get a fix of something cold, wet and bubbly on my tongue if I happened to go out to eat. And as I&apos;m a restaurant critic - whaddya know! - I go out to eat an awful lot. I would no sooner ask for tap water there than order the vegetarian option. My excuse? I believe I genuinely can taste the difference; that there is a cleaner, brighter flavour to a good mineral water than to tap water. Naturally a lot of my friends think this is total bollocks and that I just like stuff with bubbles.  Now the National Consumer Council has declared mineral water in restaurants a total rip-off, and accused restaurateurs of pushing mineral water over tap just to make a quick profit. Well, yes. I&apos;m sure this is true. Restaurants are all about trying to make money. Water is clearly a smart way of doing it.  I will accept that some of it has got very silly indeed. During recent travels for a new book of mine that you&apos;ll get bored of hearing about in months to come, I ate at high-end restaurants in Moscow, Dubai, Tokyo and beyond. Regularly, as well as the wine list, I was shown a ten or even twenty strong water list. Would sir like water from Wales or Fiji? From Scotland or Japan? One water, Chateldon, was always the most expensive. I saw it priced at \u00a312.50 a bottle in one place. They justified the cost by saying it was Louis XIV&apos;s favourite water. But hell, I ain&apos;t taking water recommendations from a dead French guy. Personally I favour San Pellegrino or Badoit. Smaller bubbles. Slightly salty. Very drinkable. But am I - and this is a very technical term - a total arse for doing so? Should I kick my restaurant mineral water habit too, and settle for tap?

Nearly 23 million watched races last year, and the number of women (just under 10m) was far greater than the overall national audience in Britain. When the Force India team race next season, &apos;the figures will skyrocket&apos;, says the team&apos;s billionaire backer, Vijay Mallya. \u00b7 Basketball: In China, 19 television stations, two websites and a mobile phone company pay to broadcast live the NBA match between Houston and Milwaukee, featuring two of the biggest names in Chinese sport, Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian.

The world of sport, as we have been saying, is changing. So fast that we are in the middle - or end, or beginning, depending on your viewpoint - of the most important period of upheaval since the latter decades of the 19th century, when rules were made, leagues formed, players paid to perform and paying spectators turned up in large numbers week after week. Dick Holt, an expert on Victorian sport who teaches at De Montfort University, says one of the biggest changes in the late 19th century was &apos;the emergence of a specialist sports press and a daily sports page for a new mass, urban, readership. Before radio in the 1930s, this was the only way to follow sport if you were not actually present&apos;. The key structural changes were in the Football League (formed in 1888), both codes of rugby and county cricket. &apos;These provided the basis for the 20th-century system of professional, but not commercial sport, largely still run by amateurs. They did not see team games as a commodity subject to the forces of the free market. &apos;In striking contrast to baseball in the United States, which was begun as a business by Spalding, a sports-goods manufacturer, county members subsidised their cricket teams and directors of professional football clubs were limited to small returns on their investments. Most of them lost their money. Profit-maximising never occurred to them. Tickets were cheap, advertising was almost non-existent and no one thought of hiring out the facilities for anything but sport. It was another world and one which lasted more or less unchanged until the advent of television.&apos; Now, we are in the post-television world. Within a few years, and with a lot of help from Asia, the Premier League, or the EPL as outsiders prefer it, could leapfrog the three ahead of it in the world league of leagues, all of them American: the NFL, Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. &apos;We should be able to overtake one or two,&apos; says the League&apos;s chief executive Richard Scudamore, which is strong stuff given that he does not, as he tells Observer Sport time and again, like to make predictions. He will not, for example, predict what the next &apos;live rights&apos; contract may be worth. It used to be the TV contract to you, me and the headline writers, but that would be misleading now, as TV will soon be secondary - already is, in some parts of the world - to internet and mobile phone rights. &apos;Our contracts are hugely complex because of all that definitional stuff, but basically we have sold live as live, on a technologically neutral basis,&apos; he says. &apos;Under technological convergence, you can&apos;t keep it separate because if people are looking at a TV screen what do they care if it has come to them by satellite, cable, two cans and a piece of string, or by fibre or mobile wireless technology?&apos; Precisely the sort of talk that shows how far football has come in 20 years. &apos;From 1986 to now, it has been an unbelievable evolution,&apos; Scudamore says. &apos;There hasn&apos;t been anything to match it since the founding two decades, when you went from kicking around on the fields of Eton and Harrow to setting up a professional league structure,&apos; Holt agrees. Now Scudamore talks of technological divergence. Back in 1986 it was &apos;violence, poor stadia, Heysel and Bradford, Margaret Thatcher&apos;s membership schemes and ID cards. You couldn&apos;t sell football. It was a low point. Has the last 20 years been revolutionary? Yes. And it has definitely come on the back of technological developments.&apos; Unlike others in the business of sport, Scudamore thinks the most radical changes are history already. &apos;Globalisation is with us,&apos; he says. &apos;Yes, there are places to expand and grow, but I don&apos;t see the next 10 years being entirely radical. It&apos;s hard to see how the next 20 years can be as progressive [as the last 20].&apos; Peter Kenyon, the Chelsea chief executive, does not share that view. &apos;We are in a period of great change but I&apos;m pretty sure we will see more in the next 10 years,&apos; he says. &apos;We are yet to understand fully the potential of new media and its global penetration and what will happen to football in India, China and Africa. But one thing is apparent: since the 1880s the fundamentals of the sport have changed very little, and that is the beauty of football.&apos; Another who fundamentally disagrees with Scudamore is Nick Massey, managing director of the global sports marketers and agents, Octagon. Massey, more a basketball man than a football man, also works from London, and his view on the globalisation issue is: &apos;It&apos;s really only just starting.&apos; There are, he says, many more changes ahead. Why? &apos;Because rights owners still haven&apos;t worked out how to monetise their rights.&apos; This leads into an area where British football fans fear the worst and which has been written and talked about extensively since the start of the Observer Sport series - shifting kick-offs to suit viewers in the Far East. &apos;A lot of it has been nonsense,&apos; Scudamore says. &apos;Everyone thinks 12.45pm on a Saturday is to please our audience in the East. Nonsense. It is actually a complete product of trying to protect the domestic situation.&apos; Scudamore explains how some kick-offs have had to be moved from the traditional 3pm on Saturday because of a European Union decision to make more games available for live broadcast than the League wanted. Add in problems caused by European fixtures - the League do not expect clubs to play twice in three days, so Sunday-Tuesday and Thursday-Saturday combinations are to be avoided - and it can, and does, become complicated. &apos;You can&apos;t play early on a Saturday morning, so lunchtime is the earliest you can realistically expect people to go to the game. No police authority will let you go later than 5.15 on a Saturday evening because police forces are managing pubs, clubs and other activities later at night.&apos; The recent Arsenal-Manchester United game was played on a Saturday because, when the fixtures came out, there was a possibility that one or both of them would have a Tuesday Champions League fixture. &apos;All these commentators making out some commercial plan to broadcast that game to prime time in Asia could not be further from the truth. &apos;We fix the domestic TV deal first, which tells the world what they have to buy internationally. I can&apos;t envisage it being the other way round.&apos; Scudamore can foresee Asian money outweighing domestic money, but adds: &apos;Quite frankly we play when we play. We aren&apos;t going to start altering our fixtures for the international broadcasting market. For those [in Asia] that are committed to watching it&apos;s really only our 5.15 game that&apos;s too late. It seems to be a problem they cope with.&apos; Massey, a former Coca-Cola executive, believes that is unrealistic. &apos;Ultimately the consumer decides everything,&apos; he says. &apos;I would imagine the Asian buyers would arrive at the negotiating table to express their views. If there is enough consumer power to demand 12 noon kick-offs, for example [on Saturday and Sunday], then either the Premier League will move their games or somebody else will.&apos; Another point on which Scudamore and Massey disagree is in how the Asian millions will be shared out. Some of the biggest clubs, prompted by American owners, will be happy to share UK income with lesser rivals but will want to keep more of what they make in Asia and elsewhere, according to the experts at Octagon. Scudamore is dismissive, stating that such a change would need the approval of 14 of the 20 clubs. What, then, of the comment by Stan Kroenke, the American investor in Arsenal, that &apos;Arsenal broadband is a very strategic investment&apos;. What did he mean by that? &apos;You will have to ask him!&apos; Kenyon&apos;s view? &apos;The strength of the Premier League as a product lies in its collective selling, at home and abroad. That is what helped to make it so compelling and more competitive than other leagues where there has been individual selling of rights by clubs. &apos;Where I think there is maybe room for some manoeuvre in the future is over new media rights, internet, mobile phones and so on, but at the same time we really need to understand where this technology is going and what the right approach is. It is such a fast-changing world. But the general principles underpinning the League&apos;s approach are the right ones.&apos; Where Scudamore, Massey and Kenyon all agree is that there is no limit to how much sport any one person can take and that more choice is good for consumers. &apos;A fan doesn&apos;t need actually to attend a live game if he or she is time-starved,&apos; says Massey. &apos;You can retain your emotional connection to a team or a sport without actually being there. And through having more choice you can nurture a love of various sports.&apos; When asked about football&apos;s task in India, Kenyon says: &apos;I&apos;m not sure it is about &quot;taking on cricket&quot;. With a population of 1.1billion, India is sufficiently big for more than one sport to prosper.&apos; Scudamore says: &apos;There&apos;s no finite amount of people interested in sport, or time they&apos;ll spend watching it, or money they&apos;ll spend on it. Sport doesn&apos;t work like that. My own interest in football has never decreased, but my interest in other sports has increased. It just means I sleep a bit less as I watch other sports. &apos;It is not our motive to take over the world. We want to see good, healthy football played in its own countries, in its own leagues. If America or India cracks professional football for itself, then that will be good for football as a whole. I have no problem [with the Premier League] being something they want to watch as well. Unless European football ceases to put on a good show, and I can&apos;t see that, there&apos;s plenty of space and scope.&apos; Moving start times is one of the many &apos;challenges to the traditional approaches and attitudes&apos; that will shape the future of sport, Massey believes. &apos;There won&apos;t be one single revolutionary change in sport in the next 10 years, but there will be lots of lesser changes.&apos; Among them, he predicts more sports tourism; more people playing sport, as well as watching it, in emerging markets; a threat to American sports&apos; commercial growth, largely because of the popularity of football; big changes in golf, with a World Tour to challenge the American tour; and attempts by English football clubs to &apos;break&apos; the Indian market, starting with pre-season tours to the subcontinent. Perhaps Chelsea are talking about future tours right now. One man who knows all about potential growth in India is Andrew Wildblood, a top executive at the global sports agency IMG and a specialist on the subcontinent. &apos;If they got the right deal from a promoter I&apos;m sure they [English clubs] would go,&apos; he says. &apos;Whether that&apos;s next year, three years or 10 years away, remains to be seen. &apos;Cricket is way out ahead and the rest are playing catch-up, but the interest in English football was sparked by the TV rights being sold to India from 1999 onwards. Ask anyone in India what happened in the Premier League before 1999 and they haven&apos;t got a clue.&apos; IMG helped with the Manchester United Soccer Schools project in Goa where, says Wildblood, there were &apos;5,000 kids wearing United shirts and all of them pirated - I didn&apos;t see one official replica kit&apos;. He adds: &apos;Manchester United are very open-minded and interested about India. Everybody sees the potential. It&apos;s a huge marketplace.&apos; &apos;A strong Asian football can only be beneficial to European football,&apos; Kenyon says. &apos;We want to help develop football from the grassroots upwards and engage in a meaningful way with the fans - in India, the US and China. It&apos;s not just about touring, taking the money and leaving, so Chelsea will be working with the Asian Football Confederation on their Vision Asia project, and maybe there can be some cross-fertilisation with cricket, too. But it&apos;s very early days.&apos; The Indian billionaire Sunil Bharti Mittal, who owns Bharti Airtel, India&apos;s leading mobile-phone network and is worth more than \u00a36billion, is a man with a mission in Indian football. He is investing in the game with the aim of seeing India compete in the World Cup finals for the first time. &apos;Mittal knows that this is not a \u00a310million investment, it is a \u00a3100million investment and more. He is paying for the initial talent search and then an academy, which will be built in India in the coming months,&apos; Wildblood says. Mallya, the Indian F1 man, is also keen to be involved. &apos;I have always believed that football can be as popular as cricket,&apos; he says. Among all the changes, Octagon&apos;s Massey sees two constants: &apos;The key to everything is getting a kid to kick a ball or bounce a ball&apos; and &apos;The success or failure of any sport or league will be decided by the consumer. If the product isn&apos;t there or isn&apos;t right, the fans won&apos;t connect.&apos; The Premier League clearly has the right product, the one others envy. &apos;Only the American leagues do better on a commercial basis than us, but they have a population of 300million and we are only 60million,&apos; says Scudamore. &apos;They are interested in how we have done so well internationally. We have one big advantage - we play football, the global game. I don&apos;t have to show countries what football is, with exhibition matches to explain the rules. &apos;American sports, basketball apart, are not generally appreciated or understood in the same way. We do sit here planning, thinking and marketing our league strongly. We do it from a base of trying to protect the core product: play as many matches as you can at 3pm on a Saturday, displace those you have to displace, but keep it at 45 minutes each way, 11 v 11, one referee and two assistant referees. Try and keep it so people can absolutely know whenever they pick it up or put it down what they have. &apos;I don&apos;t think anyone would describe me as a Luddite - I dwell in the future. But in that future we are marketing what is a very traditional event. The sport that has grabbed the world is in the same form as 1888 [when the Football League was founded]. &apos;Don&apos;t underestimate how hard it is to keep it as it is. There are always people with schemes that want to change it, like with the European Commission [who ordered the League to televise 32 more matches than they wanted to]. And I sense a worrying debate among those within the football community who would like to peg us back, because we are the most successful. Generally, other leagues, as well as Fifa and Uefa, are a little bit envious of our success.&apos; That envy was clear for all to see last week when Michel Platini, the Uefa president, gave only lukewarm backing to England&apos;s 2018 World Cup bid and spoke disparagingly about English football, its overseas club owners, and the lack of &apos;home&apos; talent at the top clubs. Figures released by the Bundesliga last week also illustrate why other leagues are envious: the German clubs want to sell their own overseas rights from 2010 because they are unhappy with their current \u00a310m-a-year deal. The Premier League can pull in hundreds of millions. Kenyon believes football can make giant strides in the US. &apos;Talking to some of the NFL executives and owners who were in England for the Wembley game, I think they think that soccer can get the National Hockey League in its sights and once it does that, it will send a message about its potential. And if America ever discovered their equivalent of David Beckham the potential is huge, because they love their individual stars.&apos; Scudamore speaks proudly of the increase in localisation, as well as globalisation, among his clubs. &apos;You see a huge amount of effort being put in - the clubs&apos; community schemes, the Creating Chances [working with the disadvantaged], all the stuff they are doing locally is far greater than what they did before. They have to do it, and they want to do it. They are seven-days-a-week, 52-weeks-a-year operations now, rather than opening their gates once a fortnight.&apos; As the pulling power of the big clubs increases, what about localisation beyond the Premier League? What if children in Luton forsake their own club to support Chelsea, or Manchester United are more popular in Northampton than the Cobblers? &apos;Any youngster should go to their local club, have access to their local club,&apos; Scudamore says. &apos;Some are blessed with their home town club, others not. Suppose they support two teams - does it really matter?&apos; Scudamore is also dismissive of those who complain of over-commercialism. &apos;What does it mean when they say, &quot;Sport is sport, not a business&quot;? When people don&apos;t want to do it any more, don&apos;t want to watch it any more, then it will change.&apos; So there you have it. The clear message is that sport has gone global at the top end, stayed local in other respects, and can cope with both - even though the policing of it becomes ever more difficult. More money means more temptation, as we have seen in the past few weeks with headlines about match-fixing and even poisoning of players in tennis, and &apos;bungs&apos; in football. Sport in the 21st century may be unlike anything that has gone before, and in some respects it will become even more unrecognisable. But on the pitch the games are more or less as they were 120 years ago. And above all, one thing has not changed since sport was first invented by humans 30,000 years ago, even to all us cynics at The Observer.

THE BRIEF:  &apos;We are getting married in a month, and are struggling to find a honeymoon with our criteria and budget. We would like 10-14 days in the sun, in relative luxury, preferably on an all-inclusive basis or full-board to keep costs down. The problem is, over the Christmas period most destinations bump up the prices. This is not ideal as most of our savings will be spent on the wedding. We are not afraid to travel a long way. The best holiday we ever had was to Sri Lanka, where we did lots of day-trips and sightseeing.&apos; THE BUDGET: \u00a31,600 THE SOLUTION: David Brice of Global Holidays: &apos;Goa is a great place for a honeymoon. The weather is fantastic in December and the place is a cultural delight, with beautiful beaches, friendly people and all that delicious food. A week all-inclusive with Thomson Holidays (0870 165 0079; thomson.co.uk) departing on 18 December and staying at the excellent three-star Heritage Village Hotel in quiet south Goa costs only \u00a3639pp.&apos; Fraser Russell at Ebookers.com: &apos;Dubai has it all when it comes to honeymoons: sun, sea, shopping and culture. Synonymous with modernism and decadence, Dubai will fill your memories with exotic culture and ensure your honeymoon is never forgotten. We could arrange a trip staying at the Le Meridien Fairway, a beautiful hotel overlooking Dubai Creek, but also close to the luxurious shopping of the city centre. Travelling with Alitalia, this 10-day package comes in under their budget at \u00a3735pp, flying from Heathrow on 17 December.&apos; Mark Robson from Kuoni: &apos;I&apos;d suggest Mombasa, which will be hot, has beautiful beaches and would allow them to do short day safaris from the coast. They could travel out on the 17th, the day after the wedding, fly direct to Mombasa, then have seven nights&apos; half-board in a deluxe room at the Indian Ocean hotel for \u00a3755 each. The only drawback is that the flight back is on Christmas day, but it&apos;s direct, and gets in at 6.30pm, so there&apos;s just time for a turkey sandwich.&apos; Sue Ockwell of the Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO): &apos;This is an unusual suggestion but a surprising number of couples choose to go on a group adventure trip with Explore (0870 333 4001; explore.co.uk) for their honeymoon. There&apos;s plenty of time to go off and do your own thing, but you can enjoy great company too. &apos;The Nile Felucca Sailtrek has limited space on its 22-31 December tour, and comes in just over their budget at \u00a3814pp. It&apos;s a perfect mix - culture, activities and relaxation on board, with amazing views of lush vegetation, riverside villages and temples. The donkey trek through the Valley of the Kings is something they will always remember.&apos; The festive refusenik: &quot;I&apos;m bored of the Christmas routine&quot; Janet Cole, 45, is an IT analyst living in London. THE BRIEF:&apos; &apos;I&apos;d like to get away for Christmas as I&apos;m getting bored with the same routine and expense every year. I&apos;ve not had a holiday in three years and have spent all my annual leave at home pottering around and getting bored in the gym. This year I&apos;d like two or three weeks relaxing on a beach and indulging in a bit of local culture. I&apos;d like to stay in a decent hotel but somewhere quite small. I will be travelling on my own, but I enjoy meeting local people and people from all over the world. I try to keep as far away from British people as possible when I&apos;m on holiday, though.&apos; THE BUDGET: \u00a3400 THE SOLUTION: John Bevan from Lastminute.com: &apos;How about Barcelona - culture, good weather and a city that&apos;s renowned for being friendly. We couldn&apos;t quite get within this budget, but could arrange a 12-night break from \u00a3568 including accommodation in a standard single room on a room-only basis at the cosy three-star Hotel Caledonian and a direct flight from London. The hotel is next to Plaza Universidad and only five minutes from Las Ramblas.&apos; Fiona Reece of I-Escape: &apos;Morocco is a good choice. Fly into Marrakesh on Ryanair (flights start at a little over \u00a3100) but then go on to Essaouira and stay at the Baoussala hotel (i-escape.com/baoussala.php). It&apos;s not bang on the beach so it&apos;s also off the beaten tourist track. It&apos;s small (just six rooms) with exceptional cooking and local musicians will even give impromptu concerts, and is a relative bargain at \u00a342 a night B&amp;B.  &apos;Next, take a trip to the mountains, staying at Douar Samra (i-escape.com/douarsamra.php), a small colourful guesthouse in the mighty Toubkal Massif. It&apos;s owned by a French/Swiss woman who is very much part of the Berber community. It costs \u00a327 a night half-board. &apos;Finally, in Marrakesh, stay at Riad Ariha, (i-escape.com/riadariha.php) a beautifully restored budget riad in the heart of the Medina for \u00a355 a night including breakfast. &apos; David Brice of Global Holidays: &apos;Three weeks at the three-star Serin hotel in Marmaris, Turkey, leaving on 21 December with Holidays4U (0870 444 3843; h4u.co.uk) costs \u00a3435, including flights, transfers and B&amp;B accommodation. Although Marmaris is touristy, there are quiet villages and beaches nearby and lots of opportunities to meet people on boat excursions along the coast.&apos; Joe Bindloss from Lonely Planet: &apos;On a budget this tight, I&apos;d suggest taking a stroll down the high street and seeing what deals are in the travel agents&apos; window that day. This old-fashioned route can work: I found two weeks in Candolim, Goa, over Christmas for \u00a3400. Or buy a cheap charter flight to Florida, Dallas or Houston using the favourable exchange rate to eke out your money when you get there.&apos; The fed-up family: &quot;Can we have a fantasy festive break on our tight budget?&quot; Xenia Horne, 46, runs her own company and lives in Norwich with her 17-year-old son Ben and daughters Georgia, 15, and Hannah, 14. THE BRIEF:  &apos;This could be the last Christmas that my son is living at home as he is off to university next September, so I would love to take us all away somewhere memorable, and somewhere where the sun will be shining.  &apos;It has been a tough year with plenty of ups and downs - being ripped off by a rogue trader, troubles at work - and a real holiday escape would set us all up for an exciting 2008 with regenerated optimism.  &apos;We all love heat, sea, new cultures, sightseeing, snorkelling... but can we do all that for a week this Christmas on our budget, or is this a fantasy too far? We&apos;d like a hotel if possible, but we&apos;d be happy to go self-catering or camping.&apos; THE BUDGET: \u00a31,600 THE SOLUTION: Sue Ockwell from AITO: &apos;Sharm el-Sheikh on Egypt&apos;s Red Sea riviera has plenty of shops and lively bars; visitors can take tours into the fascinating Sinai Desert, go horseriding along the beach or enjoy world-class scuba diving among spinner dolphins.  &apos;Regaldive (01353 659999; regaldive.co.uk) has a week&apos;s B&amp;B over Christmas at the Rosetta Hotel for \u00a31,596 for the family, including flights from London, transfers and a gala Christmas dinner. A Padi learn-to-dive course costs from \u00a3185pp, based on two people participating. But snorkelling amid the many-coloured fish is, of course, free.&apos; David Brice of Global Holidays: &apos;Although \u00a31,600 isn&apos;t enough for a long-haul holiday over Christmas, Tunisia is great for culture, the winter weather is very good and hotel standards are excellent. A week all-inclusive for four people at the four-star Allegro Riviera hotel in Port El Kantoui, Tunisia, departing Gatwick on 19 December with Sunset Holidays (020 8774 7100; sunset.co.uk) costs a total of \u00a31,500.&apos; Giampiero Ambrosi from VirtualTourist: &apos;How about staying in a tree house! Kadir&apos;s Top Tree Houses is a collection of treehouses and wooden chalets in a rural setting in Olympos, Turkey. It also offers an adventure that is reasonably priced: \u00a320pp per night, half board. The kids could share one triple room, while Xenia has a single. Staying here will also put this water-loving family in close proximity to great beaches and adventure opportunities. While mum takes in the sun, the kids can try kayaking and canoeing. You can book the treehouses via IAH holidays (0870 027 2921; iah-holidays.co.uk). The family should be able to pick up a cheap charter flight to Antalya out of Stansted airport for around \u00a3200 each (try cheapflights.co.uk), with a one-hour bus ride from Antalya to Olympos.  John Bevan from Lastminute.com: &apos;We would suggest Tenerife: the weather is hot, the landscapes are amazing and it&apos;s the perfect setting for a real escape. There&apos;s lots for the teenagers to do, from the beaches and resorts to trekking in the mountainous interior.  &apos;The family should be able to get a week in Tenerife for \u00a31,552, including accommodation at the three-star self-catering Green Park Studios in Golf Del Sur. The studio is part of a complex with great facilities including three swimming pools and tennis courts, and the resort has an excellent golf course and a large number of restaurants and bars. The price also includes direct flights from London Luton, departing on 24 December.&apos; The guilty mum: &apos;Unlucky break means I owe my family big time&apos; Sam Thackery, 37, a journalist, and her husband Richard Nicholls, 37, a naval architect, live with their children, Iris, four, and Redvers, two, on the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall. THE BRIEF:  &apos;In September, three days before our three-week InterRail holiday round Europe was due to start, I fell off some stepladders while picking sloes and broke my ankle and leg. To say that my husband and children were disappointed is an understatement, not least because since that day my husband has had to look after all three of us constantly. I owe them big time.  Christmas is the soonest I can conceivably travel, so I have been spending my convalescence trying to think up a trip that would work for all of us - somewhere where I won&apos;t have to be active, where my husband will be thoroughly looked after and pampered (he loves a good massage) and where the children will have lots of fun. Is it Switzerland for spa and snow? South Africa for sun and safari? The Maldives, the Caribbean - who knows, even Disneyland? We would like a four-star hotel - so that none of us has to lift a finger - for between seven and 10 days.&apos; THE BUDGET: \u00a33,000 THE SOLUTION: Kate Shepherd from Alastair Sawday Guides: &apos;The family could stay at the family-run Biohotel Hermitage (00 33 465 441558; biohotelhermitage.it) in the very mountainous Trentino-Alto Adige region of north-west Italy. The children will be thrilled when Santa tips up at Christmas distributing presents, your husband can get his massage in the hotel&apos;s wellbeing centre (with its glass wall looking out over snow-capped peaks) and you can relax on the balcony of your suite (unless you&apos;re tempted by the boutiques a short walk away).  If your ankle and leg are still playing up, you could visit the local hot springs for a soak while your husband and children play in the snow or visit the slopes. Back at the hotel, you can splash around together in the indoor pool or wander in the large natural gardens. Take advantage of the babysitter and feast on the wonderful food and wine Italy has to offer. You could take the train from London to Bolzano to make up for the train journeys you missed earlier. Half-board costs from \u20ac190pp per day. Cots cost \u20ac30 a day (apart from that, children under two stay free). Children aged three to six get a 40 per cent discount.&apos;  Fiona Reece of I-Escape: &apos;Sri Lanka has great weather in December and could more than pay back the debt you owe your family. Talalla Retreat, near Galle, (i-escape.com/talallaretreat.php) has elegant villas by the beach set in landscaped gardens around a large pool. Here you can still your mind and soothe your soul without being too active: there are yoga, tai chi and meditation classes, and visitors can learn to surf or visit surrounding jungles, wildlife parks, temples and the historic town of Galle. Flights for Colombo depart from Heathrow on 25 December for \u00a3401 (\u00a31,604 for four people) from cheapflights.co.uk. Accommodation costs \u00a3120 a night for two rooms (twin or double) including breakfast. This means a total of \u00a32,444 to stay somewhere really special for a week. &apos;  David Brice of Global Holidays: &apos;Lanzarote is a great place to visit over Christmas. The magnificent four-star Papagayo Arena will cost \u00a33,000 for four people in a family room, including flights. The hotel operates on an all-inclusive basis and boasts three swimming pools, a fitness centre with massage and plenty of activities for the children. This is with Thomas Cook Holidays (0870 750 5711; thomascook.com).&apos; Philip Davies of Real Holidays: &apos;The Gambia should just about fit Sam&apos;s budget. It offers such good value, with an interesting mix of great beaches, African culture, stunning wildlife and colonial history. The family could stay at Ocean Bay hotel and resort for \u00a3985 per person with the Gambia Experience (0845 330 2060; gambia.co.uk).

One of those surgical masks they hand out on Japanese airlines. You can pick up a lot of bugs on aircraft and if I have a really important concert, I may wear one on the flight. You feel a bit silly, but I find it makes a difference. MY FAVOURITE HOTEL IS... Tongsai Bay on the Thai island of Koh Samui. The staff are probably the friendliest people I&apos;ve ever met. I never thought I&apos;d be the type to return to a place, but I&apos;ve been twice and I&apos;d go again.  I&apos;VE MADE A LOT OF TRIPS... To entertain troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. You fly in from Kuwait and when you go over the Iraqi border you have to put on your helmet and flak jacket. Someone shot at us with a surface-to-air missile and our helicopter had to drop 2,500 feet in seconds to avoid it. I&apos;LL NEVER GO BACK TO.... Gran Canaria. It was a last-minute trip and the hotel I picked was not what I&apos;d imagined. I&apos;d thought it was on the beach and it was, but up a massive cliff, and every time you wanted to use the beach you had to go down millions of steps. MY TOP TRAVEL TIP IS... When flying don&apos;t rely on water to keep you hydrated. Mix four parts water to one part fruit juice in a bottle. The juice makes your body process the liquid and you stay more hydrated. The difference in my skin when I get off a long-haul flight is really noticeable. I NEVER TRAVEL WITHOUT... My iPod and a good book. I always take my own entertainment - laptop and DVDs. Often I&apos;m in countries where the only English channel is CNN. At least with a laptop you can watch YouTube! WHEN I&apos;M TRAVELLING I ALWAYS MISS... Being able to cook for myself and drive myself. I miss my family, but I keep in touch on email and Skype and send photographs back of wherever I am. I spent the first six months of this year away: I&apos;d go to China for a week, come back and then go straight to France. I will often go to Australia and New Zealand for a month at a time, so it&apos;s important to stay in touch. MY MOST MEMORABLE MEAL WAS...  In Japan. A man came to my concert and told my manager that he owned the best French restaurant in Japan. It only served duck! They dished it up with a certificate of authenticity, giving the number of the duck you were eating. It was one of those really off-the-wall dinners. THE LAST PERSON I SAT NEXT TO ON A PLANE... Woke me up in the middle of the night to ask if he could have his photograph taken with me. It was on a flight from Dubai and I was fast asleep.I couldn&apos;t believe the nerve. THE WEIRDEST PLACE I&apos;VE BEEN RECOGNISED WAS... In the middle of Tiananmen Square. Although I hadn&apos;t done anything in China, my picture was on billboards because I am the face of Mont Blanc.

Pretty much every country on the planet - 202 countries this year - sends a delegation to staff a stand in order to try to court the industry&apos;s key decision-makers to persuade them to send as many tourists as possible their way over the next 12 months. It&apos;s like speed dating - but on a grand scale. For anyone wanting to see where the power lies in what some claim to be the world&apos;s largest industry, they only need to stand on one of the balconies overlooking the main floor and look at how the countries are spaced out. In the centre of the room, boasting stands that have probably cost tens of thousands of pounds to construct, are the industry&apos;s most important destinations - the US, France, the UK, Spain, Dubai etc. On the fringes are those looking, hoping, to join the party. And countries such as Burundi quite literally have little more than a trestle table holding a few leaflets and are positioned far away from the main thoroughfares. As I walked among the stands last year, listening in and watching deals being struck, I couldn&apos;t help but wonder what WTM would look like in a few decades&apos; time. Would the same countries be dominating proceedings? Would WTM still even be operating? The trigger for these thoughts was that the Great Issue of Our Age (TM) - climate change - was a concept that had evidently been blocked from entering the hall by security. If one industry has dragged its heels over confronting climate change it is the tourism industry. This is a very strange response given that it, arguably, has the most to lose. But that was last year. I was pleased to learn earlier this year that up to 100 tourism ministers from across the globe would be meeting at this year&apos;s event to discuss how the tourism industry should address climate change. The UN&apos;s World Tourism Organisation was to meet formally at WTM and discuss how it should approach the forthcoming UN climate summit being held in Bali in December. (Back in October it had drafted the &quot;Davos Declaration&quot;, which sets out the industry&apos;s stance on climate change.) At last, I thought, sleeves are being rolled up. The industry is finally going to work out how to square the fact that it is a significant and fast-growing emitter of greenhouses gases, as well as also being extremely vulnerable to climate change. Sadly, though, all the reports coming out of WTM last week suggest that while there&apos;s been a lot of talk about the issue, there has been very little commitment to act in any meaningful way. For example, this is what Margaret Hodge, the UK&apos;s tourism minister had to say:  &quot;It is not for the government to deny people the right to travel. Or to deny the industry the right to respond to the demand for travel. It is a difficult task to try to square the circle of the desire to travel and the use of aviation and its growth... The tourism industry fuels around 5% of global CO2 emissions. But for every negative there should be a positive. There is a lot being done by tourism and aviation industries to reduce greenhouse emissions. There are strong grounds for us to be optimistic.&quot;  This is little more than a rubber stamp for the industry&apos;s &quot;business as usual&quot; stance, as far as I can tell. One of the major problems, I feel, is that tourism is so poorly represented, if at all, at cabinet level in most of the world&apos;s governments. For example, Margaret Hodge is hardly what we might call at the heart of government, despite the fact that tourism is acknowledged as the capital city&apos;s second largest industry. Just when the tourism industry needs a big prod by governments to move it in the right direction on this issue - yes, I mean far tighter regulation - it knows it will be treated with kid gloves. There were some dissenting voices, however. To his credit, the ebullient and high-pitched CNN business travel reporter and anchor Richard Quest stood up and slammed the attendees for their inaction and mealy words:  &quot;How many of you have a car waiting for you? How many have requested your hotel not to change your sheets and towels tonight? How many of you travelled here economy class? The business class seat is the most environmentally unfriendly on the aircraft. It takes more space, has greater weight and higher fuel burn... I have read the Davos Declaration in detail. I am none the wiser about what&apos;s going to be done. I suggest and respectfully submit that more work needs to be done on changing the mindset rather than producing pamphlets of fine-sounding language... Ultimately, we have to change the mindset of the tourist, whether it is the business traveller or the vacationer. We are in this sinking boat together and we need to offer them realistic possibilities and procedures to help bale us out of it.&quot;  Such an intervention is welcome, but I do wonder how long it will take for this industry to shake off this paralysis. Last week, Greenpeace in Spain released some mocked-up images of how some of the countries most popular resorts might look if sea levels rise as some predict. Each year, ski resorts report ever reduced snow levels. And just this week, the world&apos;s small island states met in the Maldives - one of the UK&apos;s most popular &quot;winter sun&quot; destinations - to discuss the impact of climate change.

Both were broadcasting from Dubai&apos;s much-celebrated Media City. One of them had moved to Dubai from London, to save costs. Ironically, this exhibition of extra-territorial muscle was demonstrated by the Pakistani dictator right at the moment when John Negroponte, the US deputy secretary of state, was landing in Pakistan. Apparently Condoleezza Rice&apos;s second-in-command was on a mission to chastise the &quot;indispensable ally&quot; and to persuade him to lift the emergency and relax restrictions on the media. Before the latest crackdown, Musharraf had accumulated substantial political capital inside and outside his country by lecturing endlessly on media freedom. However the impact of two things were never understood by his admirers or his detractors: one, the earlier romance of freedom associated with the satellite revolution was effectively ended by dependence on cable networks; two, Musharraf created a media regulator staffed by acting police officers that could shut down the cable networks by verbal threats. Musharraf also developed a penchant for issuing ever-new &quot;codes of conduct&quot; for the media, to be enforced through his regulator. Comfortably armed with these modern gadgets of control, he then offered Pakistanis a make-believe world of media freedom. Sensational chat shows where politicians, mullahs and feminists clashed like Mexican cock fights, became the Pakistani equivalent of Westminster democracy. From time to time. whenever a channel transgressed the military man&apos;s limits of democracy, it suddenly disappeared from the TV screens - coming back only after elaborate apologies and fresh vows of good behaviour. With the imposition of martial law, all TV channels suddenly disappeared. The BBC and CNN and Fox all were gone - with the exception of Sky News which, perhaps in an unintended affront to Murdoch, was treated as an entertainment channel by the Pakistani authorities. The media regulator clarified that the cable operators had switched them off in the national interest. This was followed by a new 14-page &quot;code of conduct&quot;, demands to fire some of the leading anchors and an order to support the new interim government. GEO and ARY continued broadcasting via satellite from Dubai but remained unavailable on the cable network. Since almost 99% of their viewership is via cable, so for all practical purposes they were off-screen. But why did Musharraf make his extra-territorial leap to shut off broadcasts from Dubai that were already unavailable in Pakistan? The answer lies in his peculiar mind set; these two channels have the largest viewerships, by demonstrating his reach and influence he is eager to force their managements to a compromise so that his system of sanitised free media can be on display once again - for Pakistanis and for his mentors in London and Washington. Most people here have finally realised that &quot;freedom of the media&quot; was a meaningless buzzword in a country where constitution and courts can be set aside on personal whims. But it remains a fact that in the last few years this carefully created perception of free media helped a military dictator to market himself, among western mentors and even in the unsuspecting media, as a democrat in soul. It also helped to sustain his regime by providing a safety valve for public discontent inside the living rooms rather than the streets. For all those who work on the nexus of media and democracy, it may be the right time to realise that free media without constitutional guarantees and independent courts is as meaningless as democracy without the freedom of expression. The Foreign Office, Dfid and Commonwealth Secretariat need to study these events in Pakistan carefully before all tin-pots across Africa and Central Asia emulate our good general&apos;s sanitised model of free media to win western accolades - and some cash.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), based in Sunnyvale, California, and listed in New York, sold the stake to help finance the building of a new plant and recent acquisitions as it competes with the market leader, Intel.

He said another 2,000 would be released soon.  &quot;The process has started. More are being released today,&quot; he added. &quot;There are some people who have criminal charges against them, and the courts will decide their cases.&quot; In the southern city of Karachi, however, police detained around 150 journalists after clashes during a protest against emergency rule.

Opposition parties greeted the government&apos;s announcement a prisoner release with scepticism. Farhatullah Babar, a spokesman for Benazir Bhutto&apos;s Pakistan People&apos;s party (PPP), said the claims were &quot;lies&quot;, adding that only around 40 PPP supporters had been released in Karachi since yesterday. &quot;It&apos;s an absolute, transparent lie,&quot; Babar said. &quot;I&apos;m amazed that the government can claim it has released people when, on the first day of the caretaker government, they were carrying out fresh arrests.&quot;  The PPP estimates that 17,000 of its supporters have been arrested since emergency rule was imposed on November 3. Human Rights Watch said the releases were &quot;not credible unless independently verified&quot;. Lawyers&apos; representatives and civil society groups were unaware of large-scale releases, the South Asia researcher Ali Dayan Hasan said.  &quot;The crucial fact here is that the Pakistani government has admitted to detaining at least 5,600 political opponents,&quot; he added.  &quot;Not only is the real number of those detained likely to be substantially higher, there is no tangible sign that those the government claims to be releasing have actually been freed.&quot; Karachi lawyer Noor Naz Agha told reporters she had been released from house arrest today. &quot;They came to my door with the release order,&quot; she said. &quot;Most of the lawyers have been released in Sindh and Baluchistan.&quot;  However, lawyers&apos; leader Athar Mianallah said that although 45 lawyers had been granted bail in Lahore yesterday, around 20 were immediately served with new detention orders.  The government has admitted to holding at least 5,400 people in jail. Human rights groups say the real figure could be much higher, although accurate estimates are difficult to obtain.  Announcements of a prisoner release came as the Pakistani president, Pervez Musharraf, left for Saudi Arabia amid speculation that he was on a mission to end his political isolation at home by reaching out to his arch foe, the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. His spokesman said he would hold talks with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia about the political crisis. Musharraf frequently visits Saudi Arabia, a close ally that is now home to Sharif, whom he toppled in a bloodless coup in 1999. Sharif has denied speculation that the two are to meet. The Pakistani president claimed emergency rule would reinforce the nation&apos;s fight against al-Qaida and ensure free and fair elections. However, his decision has provoked widespread alarm among opposition leaders, including Bhutto, who have suggested they will boycott the election. &quot;Polling for the national and provincial assemblies will be held the same day and will be transparent from all aspects,&quot; the chief election commissioner, Chaudhry Mohammad Farooq, said as he announced the election date on state-run television today. Under emergency rule, several independent media outlets - including Geo TV and ARY Digital, which broadcast from Dubai have been shut down, a decision strongly criticised by the US-based Human Rights Watch group. Yesterday, Musharraf&apos;s handpicked supreme court dismissed a string of legal challenges, clearing the way for his resignation as the chief of army staff by the end of this week. The court, packed with Musharraf loyalists, chose to quash five petitions challenging his controversial re-election last month, in which he won 98% of votes cast. Despite the release of prisoners, Imran Khan, the cricketer turned opposition politician, remained in prison on the second day of a hunger strike in protest at the president&apos;s judicial manipulations. Ensuring victory in yesterday&apos;s court cases was at the heart of Musharraf&apos;s decision to impose emergency rule just over two weeks ago. To ensure the decision went his way, he suspended the constitution and fired the chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. Yesterday, Chaudhry and seven other independent-minded judges remained under house arrest, and the replacement bench clearly signalled its loyalties.

Woodward has developed a \u00a3150,000-a-year multi-coach training programme for athletes but the major sports appear to require some convincing of its worth. &quot;At this time we don&apos;t see anything that he has to offer cycling that we are not already getting from UK Sport, and UK Sport would be in serious difficulties if he could offer anything they are not,&quot; said Chris Boardman, the former Olympic cycling champion.

The question was repeatedly raised at yesterday&apos;s select committee hearing, with all the sports agreeing that Sport England should drive the legacy commitment but unclear as to its plans. The quango is currently in negotiations with the government over its funding package from 2009 to 2011 but it remains to be seen whether its primary role going forward will be mass participation to encourage a health and fitness agenda or promoting sport. Fundraising doubts Serious concerns remain at UK Sport about how the government will raise \u00a3100m from the private sector to complete its total pre-London 2012 funding package of \u00a3600m. UK Sport&apos;s chair, Sue Campbell, told the select committee yesterday that she could not confidently predict that the money would be raised. The DCMS is in the process of hiring an agency to help raise the cash but sponsorship has already been ruled out as an option. England look to first base England have narrowed their search for potential Euro 2008 base camps down to two or three options should they qualify for the tournament by avoiding defeat against Croatia at Wembley tonight. The favoured option is understood to be a base in Switzerland close to one of the major cities, with a site on Lac Leman, near Geneva, among the possibilities. With two of the Euro 2008 groups playing all their matches in Austria, however, they will wait until the draw on December 2 before allowing England&apos;s head coach, Steve McClaren, to have the final say. Refreshingly the Football Association has no intention of repeating the World Cup 2006 mistake of selecting a remote base that cuts the players off from media, supporters and, in some cases, reality. Dein under fire The former Arsenal vice chairman David Dein, below, clashed with Andy Walsh, chairman of the Independent Manchester United Supporters&apos; Association, at yesterday&apos;s Future of Football conference in London over the issue of supporter representation on club boards. Dein, who is fronting the Uzbek billionaire Alisher Usmanov&apos;s attempts to take control of Arsenal, said he had never met a board member who was not a fan. Walsh also spoke out against foreign ownership but found no one in the audience of financiers and football club employees to support his view. The flood of foreign cash into the English game shows no sign of slowing, meanwhile, with the Dubai International Capital group, which tried and failed to buy Liverpool, understood to be still eyeing investment opportunities in the Premier League. Coincidental clash It was curious timing yesterday for the launch of the Legacy Trust, a new charitable body whose task is to fund &quot;the sporting and cultural legacy of the 2012 Olympics&quot;. Some 19 months after Tessa Jowell first announced it, the official launch event started just as officials from UK Sport and leading governing bodies were being grilled in parliament on issues including the sporting legacy of London 2012. A spokeswoman for the DCMS said the clash was entirely coincidental.

This week, after a slightly more rigorous appraisal of the city&apos;s restaurants involving a year and a half&apos;s work and five full-time inspectors, the Michelin Guide confirmed what it had taken me half a dinner time to conclude. London&apos;s restaurants have 50 Michelin stars between them. Paris, birthplace of the grand restaurant, has 98. In its first ever guide to Tokyo, the Japanese capital has been awarded 191, spread across eight three-stars, 25 two-stars and a whopping 117 one-stars. It&apos;s official. Tokyo is belly heaven. Having spent a week eating around Tokyo earlier this year - lunch, dinner, lunch, dinner, lunch, lunch, dinner, dinner; I am nothing if not committed - I have only one doubt over this galaxy of Michelin stars: they really haven&apos;t awarded anywhere near enough of them. I went to Tokyo in search of the perfect meal for my new book, The Man Who Ate The World, about the globalisation of high-end restaurants. I had already played poker to win the price of a glass of Ch\u00e2teau d&apos;Yquem at Nobu in Las Vegas. I had cruised the mafia bling of Moscow and been fed Escoffier classics amid the ludicrous desert fantasies of Dubai. And in all of these cities identifying the high-end restaurants to visit had been easy. The list was always relatively short, relatively uncontroversial and generally included the words Gordon and Ramsay. Tokyo was entirely different. There are, according to whom you talk to, either 60,000, 160,00 or 300,000 restaurants there. All we can know for sure is that there are an Awful Lot Of Them. I asked a dozen knowledgeable people for a list of must-do restaurants. I got back a dozen different lists. (None of them included the words Gordon or Ramsay.) But each time I was also given a warning. They could tell me where it would be great to eat, but getting to do so was a different matter entirely. In the west, restaurants are relatively democratic affairs. If you can scrape together the cash, and book far enough in advance, you can go. Japanese high-end restaurants are not like that at all. For a start, many are tiny, seating fewer than a dozen people and sometimes just four or six. Second, they are seriously bloody choosy about who they feed. I approached a foodie friend, a San Francisco-based Thai food-blogger called Pim Techamuanvivit, whose blog, Chez Pim, has become a cult. She is seriously connected. She has eaten her way around Tokyo. How could I go about securing reservations, I asked. She laughed, and not in a good way. &quot;They won&apos;t let you in,&quot; she said. &quot;You&apos;re a round eye.&quot; In short, gaijin are not welcome. Hell, even being Japanese won&apos;t necessarily do it. Many places regard the right to be a customer as a privilege to be bestowed rather than bought for the cost of dinner. The very least you need is a personal introduction by an existing customer, and ideally a blood relationship, a certificate bearing the thumb prints of three European popes, and a winning smile. Oh, and shed loads of cash: \u00a3500 a head for dinner in one of these places is really not extraordinary. For all these reasons I had serious doubts when I heard that Michelin was scouring Tokyo for worthy recipients of its stars. The three French inspectors wouldn&apos;t have a hope in hell of making it inside the serious Japanese places, and the two local inspectors might not fare much better either. Eventually, to secure my bookings, I had to fall on the mercy of the executive chef at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, where I was staying; thank you, Mr Yamamoto. I couldn&apos;t have done it without you. Who was going to make all the introductions for the Michelin crew, who needed to visit anonymously? The results published this week appear to have borne out my concerns. The place where I ate that fabulous crab, Yukimura, a simple unprepossessing dining room on the third floor of a residential apartment block that could seat just nine, has made it into the guide. It has earned a single star for its extraordinary, multi-course set tasting menu of raw scallop with shaved, dried sea cucumber, raw venison the colour of a fresh haemorrhage, tiny white vinegared fish, crab legs and brown meat and a whole bunch of other things besides. The two other high-end Japanese restaurants I visited, which were of an equal quality, are nowhere to be seen. Michelin simply appears not to have found them. And no wonder. The sushi place where I ate, Okei, was the smallest high-end restaurant I visited in the course of researching my book. It served just one person that night (although it can seat six). That person was me. Oh, and the sushi was very, very good indeed. My 32 courses - seared belly tuna, grilled marinated clam, nigiri of sea bream and salmon and sea urchin - cost me \u00a3250. It felt like a bargain. Unsurprisingly, where Tokyo-based western restaurants are concerned, the professional eaters of Michelin appear to be on much more solid ground. One of the things that defines the city is its openness to other culinary traditions. Today, every big-name chef is setting up outposts in any global city with a smattering of spare cash. Tokyo has been at this game for decades, ever since the French uber-chef Paul Bocuse first toured the country in the late 1960s. As far back as the early 1970s, Maxim&apos;s of Paris, one of the first restaurants in the world to win three Michelin stars back in the 1930s, had an outpost on the ground floor of the Sony building in downtown Tokyo. Today, everybody from Alain Ducasse to Wolfgang Puck, Michel Troisgros to Pierre Gagnaire has successful restaurants in Tokyo and all have a few more stars this week than they had last. There is one exception to this list. Gordon Ramsay has a restaurant in Tokyo, at the Conrad Hotel. For the first time since he won his first stars at Aubergine in the mid-90s, Michelin has decided a Ramsay business is worth not even a single star. It is a major slap around the chops for the boy from Glasgow Rangers. The real winner is the Frenchman Joel Robuchon, who suddenly finds himself the proud owner of six more Michelin stars, spread across a three-star, a two-star and a one-star restaurant in Tokyo. It brings his global haul to 17. (Ducasse is just behind with 15.) It would be easy to dismiss this as the impeccably French tyre company looking after its own. Irritatingly, they have probably called it right, not least because Robuchon, once named chef of the century, understands the Japanese aesthetic better than almost any other western chef. Because here is the most interesting thing about the booming, intricate obsessive restaurant scene in Tokyo: it is now having a major impact on high-end gastronomy in the west. Today, any big-name chef worth their Maldon sea salt wouldn&apos;t be seen dead serving a mere starter-main-dessert three-course meal. Instead, it&apos;s about tasting menus of 12 or 20 or even 30 tiny courses. That is a direct lift from the Japanese tradition of multi-course menus. Likewise, the introduction of smaller courses draws chefs back to less intricate plates, pointing up single ingredients, very much a part of the Japanese aesthetic. And the fashion for hot jellies and foams, made popular by the likes of Heston Blumenthal of the Fat Duck in Bray and Ferran Adri\u00e0 of El Bulli in Spain, draws on seaweed extracts which have been known to Japanese chefs for decades. Not that the eaters of Tokyo will give a damn about any of this. Nor, indeed, are they likely to care much what Michelin thinks of their city&apos;s restaurants. They didn&apos;t need the French to come and tell them just how good the eating opportunities are in their town. They&apos;ve always known. This Michelin Guide is for the rest of us, or at least those of us who care just a little too much about our dinner. We can only flick through its pages, read the descriptions of food we are never likely to be able to eat, and dream. Where to eat, what to eat ... and why the food&apos;s so goodJapanese food experts give the lowdown on dining out in Tokyo Kanehiro TakaseHead chef at Matsuri St James&apos;s, London &quot;There are three issues at heart here. The most important thing is the very good quality of the ingredients that you can get hold of in Tokyo if you are prepared to pay the prices. This applies to fish, meat, vegetables and fruit. In addition to this there is an innate awareness of Japanese people with regard to the safe preparation of the ingredients. Finally, the Japanese have a very strong passion for food and do not mind paying high prices to eat it if it&apos;s delicious. &quot;If visitors are looking for something tasty but which is good value for money, they should eat around the famous Tsukiji market. I recommend eating sushi in one of the restaurants there or donburi [rice with a topping such as meat or eel]. If they are happy to pay a lot of money to dine well, then there are lots of very good restaurants in Ginza. I recommend eating tempura at a specialist tempura restaurant, such as Ten-ichi or Tenkuni.&quot; Ichiro Kubota Head chef at Uma, London &quot;Michelin is French and can easily assess French restaurants, but I think their guides to other places in the world are more commercial than authentic. I know two of their judges were Japanese, but even so ... In Japan there is so much diverstity. There are sushi restaurants, tempura restaurants and kaiseki restaurants which, like French restaurants, are based on tasting menus comprised of seven to 10 dishes. Kaiseki is a completely different world from sushi. However, Michelin generalised all the cuisine as &apos;Japanese&apos;. &quot;Japanese cuisine is much more profound than everyone thinks. French food is renowned all over the world and translates very well, whereas kaiseki comes from the beginnings of Japanese culture. You have to understand the philosophies of ancient tea ceremonies to appreciate the service, host, dish and chef. And you have to know about the ingredients. For example, each colour means something: carrot and raddish mean &apos;celebration&apos;, yellow kombu [seaweed] is for new year&apos;s eve because it means &apos;happy&apos;, or &apos;to laugh&apos;. &quot;The best foods to try in Kyoto are simple edo mai-sushi, which is hand-pressed nigiri made with rice and raw fish. Edo mai means &apos;in front of Tokyo Bay&apos; - they use fish freshly caught from the bay. And Kamoseiro is soba noodles made from buckwheat, mixed with soup stock and duck fat - giving it a rich taste - and served warm with duck.&quot; Janina Wolkow Owner of Sumosan restaurant, London &quot;I wish Michelin had written this guide sooner, as it would have helped on my Tokyo trips. The last time I went with my head chef we literally did dinner twice each evening because there were so many places we wanted to try. Be warned, though: if you go to restaurants that aren&apos;t designed for foreigners, no one will speak English, so all you can do is point to things on the menu and hope for the best. &quot;The raw materials in Tokyo are amazing. Even the beef section in a supermarket can be breathtaking and would turn a non-vegetarian into a meat eater. The best things I ate in Tokyo were seafood kimchi (actually a Korean dish made with spicy, fermented cabbage) that was served on a hollowed grapefruit. Through the flavoursome marinade, you could still taste the freshness of the fish. There was a knife stuck through the grapefruit, which they pulled out as they served it, to release dry ice. And the clams on the sushi they serve are still alive. We just don&apos;t get that over here.&quot; Malcolm Simpson General manager of Bincho Yakitori in London&apos;s Oxo Tower &quot;Unlike here, you won&apos;t find different kinds of Japanese food in one restaurant. There, one will serve, for example, yakitori - chicken skewers - and another will do only sushi. There are 80,000 bars and restaurants there and they&apos;re often piled eight stories high on top of each other. You have to look up to find them. &quot;There are two kinds of fine dining there: restaurants for the rich expat market and then the true fine dining aimed at anyone who has money. The Japanese are very much into trying things new and western and they demand everything to be authentic. So Joel Robuchon, who won three stars for his French restaurant there, imports everything. The clientele demands that and don&apos;t mind paying for it. My best Tokyo food experience was at Tsukiji fish market near Tokyo Bay. Some Japanese friends and I paid \u00a350 for two big bricks of tuna, which we chopped up and ate on the spot with some wasabi and soy sauce.&quot; Hiroyuki Saotome Executive chef of Saki, London &quot;The [Michelin] selection is skewed toward more contemporary and creative Japanese restaurants [more appealing to non-Japanese customers] with a wide selection of wine. This is why the list looks kind of surprising for those who are used to appreciating the authentic Japanese eateries. &quot;What makes Tokyo stand out is the ingredients. Restaurateurs and shops only accept the freshest quality and don&apos;t hesitate to return whatever whenever the quality doesn&apos;t satisfy them. &quot;In London, it is a continuous struggle and you have to keep telling your suppliers what our quality standards are. In Japan, it is a completely different game altogether. The particular difference is the fish. For vegetables, I can find great quality [here in Britain], even better than those I find in Japan. However, when it comes to fish, the difference is like heaven and hell. &quot;[As for] one dish to eat in Tokyo, this is a very difficult question. In Tokyo, if you plan to dine in a very good Japanese restaurant, you don&apos;t come to eat a &apos;dish&apos; but the &apos;season&apos;. &quot;But if I had to suggest just one dish to take away from your whole Tokyo experience, there are so many good things to try, but just for the reason that it is is only available in Japan, I would pick fugu [the potentially deadly blowfish].&quot; \u00b7 Interviews by Amy Fleming and Homa Khaleeli  \u00b7 Jay Rayner is the Observer&apos;s restaurant critic.

Honestly, they don&apos;t know they&apos;re born. If these pampered prima donnas had any idea how hard it was to qualify for Euro 2008 they would think twice about throwing their precious freedoms away. Anyway, 20,000 fans are said to have signed the petition so far, as part of a campaign with the slogan &quot;Let&apos;s Not Embarrass Ourselves&quot;. At time of writing it was impossible to know whether England last night won the chance to embarrass themselves next summer or decided to do it immediately with an excruciating home collapse. It would be nice to think that whichever way things went, our own FA did the right thing this morning and Steve McClaren is currently deciding whether to not watch the tournament from a bathroom in Dubai or a bathroom in La Manga. Alas, the chances of that seem slim and the petitioning Austrians would appear even less likely to get their wish. But with such an apparent groundswell of non-support there is still plenty they can do to make their tournament the wash-out they self-flagellatingly crave. The years are littered with dire, mismanaged or simply hapless major sporting events and, even if Johnny al-Qaida does not save them the bother, the Austrians need simply cherry-pick the least edifying aspects of these models to ensure the tournament they believe they deserve. Boycotts The 1980 Moscow Olympics is the obvious inspiration, alongside the boycott-back-atcha that was Los Angeles 1984. Fortunately Austrians are well placed among European nations to be cold-shouldered, having had diplomatic sanctions imposed on them by 14 EU member states in the past decade, on the occasion of one of their enchanting far-right parties forming a coalition government. In the crazy world of proportional representation there is every chance that some extremist could be in the driving seat in time to force a few hands come next June. Appalling weather Wimbledon 2007 would be something to beat. Austrians should cloud-seed so the tournament&apos;s rallying cry becomes that Sound of Music song - not the title track but the whiskers-on-kittens one Julie Andrews comes up with when the kids are scared by the torrential thunderstorm - which, incidentally, always feels like a missed opportunity to offer a Peter Kay-style take on child reassurance. &quot;Rain? It&apos;s not the rain you want to be afraid of, it&apos;s Mr Hitler and his Anschluss!&quot; Match &quot;irregularities&quot; Speaking of Anschlusses, let&apos;s not teach the Austrians to suck eggs, what with the so-called &quot;Anschluss game&quot; against West Germany at the 1982 World Cup in Spain. Two teams &quot;playing&quot; for 80 minutes with the sole aim of preserving West Germany&apos;s 1-0 lead - and therefore ensuring both sides&apos; progression at the expense of Algeria - was an inspiring sight indeed. Rabid commercialism Atlanta 1996 were the Olympics the free market built: Austrians must go one better and schedule ad-break &quot;time outs&quot; into matches or substitute their official mascot for a giant, latex rendering of a third-world sweatshop child labourer. Hopeless infrastructure Atlanta again, where there were so many lost buses the English rowers had to commandeer one. Absent competitors Transport was so bad that one weightlifter missed his event - yes, Atlanta gets its hat-trick. Preposterous conspiracies No contest for this year&apos;s ICC World Cup, where the breakout star was media-friendly copper Mark Shields. Should a backpack be reported stolen, the Austrian police force is advised to work on the theory that the crime is part of a complex plot involving a national team captain, gambling syndicates, Mossad and the Bilderberg Group. Doping Tough to narrow it down but this year&apos;s Tour de France was pretty much the daddy. No drugs in football? Make it happen, Austria. Inter-host bickering The 2002 Japan-Korea World Cup descended into a kind of stadiums arms race as the co-hosts attempted to outdo each other. A schism with Switzerland should top Austria&apos;s to-do list. Abysmal host nation performance Strictly speaking it is a future event but London 2012 has benchmark potential.

So there were no surprises when another forgettable day for England, and one particularly so for Steve Harmison, was judged a positive one by the bowler. Being positive is a great positive for England. For a second successive day, until the storm broke shortly after tea, England suffered at the hands of thrusting Sri Lankan batsmen on behalf of the board president, a declaration finally arriving at 500 for five and, with the thunder already rolling across the city, no prospect of a start for the visitors&apos; innings. Three batsmen made hundreds, with Upal Tharanga&apos;s 112 being augmented by 141 from Chamara Kapugedera, now 20 years old with a Test debut against England at Lord&apos;s two summers ago, and 107 not out from the chunky left-hander Thilina Kandamby completed with a flourish of boundaries shortly before the closure. If the weather persists as it has been, England will be left with only two sessions today in which their batsmen can begin to find their feet. Harmison&apos;s contribution to the day&apos;s play was late arriving, as were his bowling boots, and, when it did come, led him to think that it was a blessing they had not turned up sooner. The boots, with their special orthotic inserts to help guard against the shin-splints and back strains that he has suffered, had been in the kit bag that had not made the onward journey from Dubai with their owner who was en route from South Africa on Tuesday. It was only after lunch that Harmison laced them up, stretched and went out to mark his run-up. By this time 118 overs of the innings, and 58 in the day, had been bowled and the board read 417 for five. It was not to prove an overwhelming success with a four-over burst costing 33 runs, including six no-balls and a wide, and another two after tea conceding a further 15 runs. &quot;It was nice to get a few overs,&quot; said Harmison after his first sessions in an England shirt since the Chester-le-Street Test match back in June. &quot;There were mixed emotions and it was good to get back on because it has been a long time. The conditions were quite tough out there and from my point of view the pitch is slower than in South Africa and with less bounce. But it got better each day in South Africa.&quot; The boots&apos; non-arrival meant he could instead spend a morning in the indoor school at the Colombo Cricket Club. &quot;The boots not turning up was a godsend, to be honest,&quot; he said. &quot;I sent down 15 overs in the indoor school and it didn&apos;t come out too bad. As for all the bowlers, they would be happy with the way things have gone. If you bowl a side out cheaply, you don&apos;t get the overs you need at this stage. I think they got a lot out of the innings.&quot; They were unable to reverse-swing the ball significantly, however, Ryan Sidebottom alone achieving a modicum on the first afternoon. It is something that will be a key component of any England success in the forthcoming series but as yet they have not found the right preparation of the ball, perhaps not helped by the residual moisture in the outfield after the rain: even a hint of dampness will make reverse-swing difficult. Of the seamers Matthew Hoggard can rest a little easier. There was more rhythm to him in his nine overs yesterday and his parsimony, coupled with the sort of versatility he has shown on previous excursions to the subcontinent, will make Moores&apos; selection process a little less exacting. Sidebottom, who bowled only four overs yesterday, should already have done enough to stake his Test claim although the role of third seamer is still in dispute. Harmison, as yet, has done little to elbow aside other contenders, but Stuart Broad has perhaps edged ahead of James Anderson. The most significant aspect of the innings, however, has been the Sri Lankans&apos; demonstration of the ease with which they feel they can play the England spinners. These are early days, of course, and warm-up matches are arranged precisely so that bowlers can understand how to bowl on such pitches as these. But even on a surface offering help if not pace and bounce Graeme Swann, who was successful in the recent one-day series, looked a class below that needed while the batsmen continued to use the occasion to pop away at Monty Panesar too, who also seems unsure of the correct pace to bowl. On a helpful surface the pair&apos;s combined figures of 52-6-229-2 will not send shivers down Sri Lankan spines.", "tags": ["Sport", "Cricket", "England in Sri Lanka 2007-08"], "title": "Cricket: Harmison gets off on wrong foot as storm clouds gather", "sentences": ["The boots, with their special orthotic inserts to help guard against the shin-splints and back strains that he has suffered, had been in the kit bag that had not made the onward journey from Dubai with their owner who was en route from South Africa on Tuesday."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/nov/22/cricket.englandcricketseries1", "publicationDate": "2007-11-22T02:33:40Z"}, {"article": "This posting should be read as somewhat of an antidote to yesterday&apos;s news about the market&apos;s dim view of the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust. The 9% plunge in its share price, after announcing pretty good annual results, was attributed by DMGT&apos;s finance chief, Peter Williams, to the City&apos;s distorted perceptions of the company as newspaper publisher. In fact, half the sales come from its business-to-business divisions. He was, to an extent, echoing last week&apos;s statement by Trinity Mirror&apos;s ceo, Sly Bailey, that the City was taking too gloomy a view of newspapers because the advertising market is showing signs of recovery. Its decline is cyclical rather than structural. What cannot be in any doubt is that one DMGT title is certainly attracting advertising. Metro is on a roll. It is the only free newspaper anywhere in the world that turns a profit. It&apos;s still growing, publishing 16 separate editions. It covers all the major conurbations in England and Scotland, plus the capitals of Wales and Ireland. It has even spawned an edition in Dubai, the world&apos;s fastest-growing media centre.

It is now setting its sights on overtaking the Daily Mirror to gain third place. That could well herald the launch of more editions, as one reporter suggested yesterday. The quantity is one thing. It is the quality of readership - its famous &quot;urbanites&quot; - that appeals to advertisers. Metro is now claiming to have more graduate readers than any other paper. They are also young, with an average of 36, far younger than all the other nationals. Young, classy, educated and high-earning. What more could an advertiser want? That&apos;s fine, of course. But the company is also fighting a debilitating war in London where its London Lite is faced by News Corporation&apos;s evening title, thelondonpaper.

The AAA Auto Club reckons 38.7 million Americans travelled more than 50 miles to Thanksgiving this year. That&apos;s 13% of the population and it beat last year&apos;s record of 38.1 million. About 31.2 million were set to drive, while 4.7 million planned to brave hazardously overcrowded airports. After a summer of delays on the roads and in the skies, there was much anxiety about the transport system&apos;s ability to cope with the strain. Acknowledging the problem, President Bush said Thanksgiving was becoming &quot;a season of dread for too many Americans&quot;. He temporarily threw open military airspace to create an &quot;express lane&quot; for flights passing over the eastern seaboard - a move likened to allowing cars to drive on the hard shoulder during the rush hour. By Wednesday evening - the night before America&apos;s autumnal festival - the cracks were already beginning to show. There were reports of long jams on Pennsylvania&apos;s turnpikes while Newark airport (which boasts an underwhelming punctuality rate of 57%) was suffering delays of 90 minutes due to &quot;low visibility&quot;. In the air, the problem is partly down to virtually unfettered liberalisation. The New York Times reported this week that the number of flights at the Big Apple&apos;s JFK airport has jumped by 20% since caps on peak-time movements were lifted by Congress at the beginning of the year, leading to impractical timetables. On the roads, it seems politically impossible for lawmakers to suggest that Americans should drive less often. Even environmentally aware politicians merely talk of cleaner fuel, rather than urging people onto trains or buses. Paul Tonko, head of New York state&apos;s Energy Research and Development Authority charged with tackling climate change, laughed out loud when I recently asked him if his authority was doing anything to urge people out of their cars. He suggested this was a thoroughly European question: &quot;The difference might be a socialist model rather than a capitalist model.&quot; SEC called to accountWhich American government agency has been rapped on the knuckles for a material weakness in its internal financial controls? Step forward the Securities and Exchange Commission, which isn&apos;t quite practising the accounting perfection which it preaches. The US Government Accountability Office (which is a bit like the UK National Audit Office) says the SEC is using an error-prone manual process to record the money it receives in penalties from errant companies - and for the amount it spends on property, equipment and IT. Internal controls to check the accuracy of these figures were &quot;not effective&quot;. &quot;In GAO&apos;s opinion, the SEC did not have effective internal control over financial reporting,&quot; the official watchdog said. Tut, tut, tut. The SEC&apos;s chairman, Christopher Cox, has promised to put his house in order by the end of 2008. Fox Business Network makes a gaffeAn email from a fellow business pundit appeared in my inbox this week with the subject line: &quot;Why I&apos;m still watching CNBC.&quot; It contained a chillingly embarrassing clip from the breakfast show on Rupert Murdoch&apos;s new Fox Business Network in which an excitable sofa-load of presenters announced some &quot;very significant&quot; breaking news. The computer company Apple, declared presenter Alexis Glick, was buying an 8% stake in global chip manufacturer AMD - a rather startling strategic leap for Steve Jobs&apos; iPods-to-iBooks concern. Fox&apos;s studio analysts weighed in with some off-the-cuff waffle declaring the $622m deal to be a &quot;smart play&quot; by Jobs. Only subsequently did a slight misunderstanding become clear - the buyer wasn&apos;t actually Apple but a company from Abu Dhabi. &quot;Let me just correct ourselves here. It is not Apple. All right, I&apos;m sorry, we got a little ahead of ourselves here on that. Um, Apple Dubai? Abu Dubai,&quot; blathered Glick.  It could happen to anybody, I suppose. But the incident hasn&apos;t enhanced confidence in Fox&apos;s month-old venture, which was supposed to revolutionise financial telly. Fox&apos;s warmth, colour, funky lifestyle segments and humour aren&apos;t quite enough to disguise a lack of depth in genuine news coverage - particularly during a week in which Wall Street has been going to hell in a handcart. CNBC remains the thinking businessperson&apos;s network - and it boasts that Fox&apos;s arrival hasn&apos;t grazed its viewing figures. &quot;We&apos;ve had zero impact,&quot; says CNBC spokesman Brian Steel. &quot;We&apos;re doing as well as we&apos;ve done in more than five years.&quot;", "tags": ["Oil", "US news", "Business"], "title": "Driving the country crazy", "sentences": ["Um, Apple Dubai?", "Abu Dubai,&quot; blathered Glick."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/23/3", "publicationDate": "2007-11-23T11:48:53Z"}, {"article": "Two months ago Sam Allardyce used his regular column in Zoo magazine to, in that publication&apos;s vernacular, &quot;diss&quot; Liverpool&apos;s manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez. &quot;Being a foreigner, Rafa doesn&apos;t understand it&apos;s supposed to be Premier League first and Champions League second,&quot; was the opinion of the Newcastle United manager, whose currently stuttering side are at home to Liverpool this lunchtime. &quot;Only Europe has saved his skin. Rafa would be very lucky to be in a job if he had not got to two Champions League finals.&quot; Putting this mini outburst in context last week, Allardyce explained he was merely &quot;having a little bit of a pop back&quot; at Ben\u00edtez&apos;s repeated criticisms of Bolton Wanderers during his time in charge at The Reebok. Asked to describe his relationship with the Spaniard, Newcastle&apos;s manager replied: &quot;Average, a bad average, he doesn&apos;t like me. That&apos;s because we beat them - and Bolton were not supposed to beat a team like Liverpool.&quot; During three Premier League games at The Reebok Ben\u00edtez&apos;s side lost 1-0, drew 2-2 and lost 2-0. That last defeat, in September 2006, provoked considerable consternation and Liverpool&apos;s manager launched an impassioned post-match deconstruction of Bolton&apos;s working methods. &quot;We played a different game with different rules, apparently,&quot; reflected Newcastle&apos;s manager, whose enduring faith in a sometimes ugly percentage game has largely failed to inspire Tyneside fans, many of whom remain wedded to a purist philosophy. &quot;Rafa criticised Bolton&apos;s style, saying it was outside the rules. I didn&apos;t see any referee&apos;s report saying that, so it was just a bit of self-protection on his part,&quot; said Allardyce. &quot;Rafa is pretty strong-willed but, when you get criticised heavily by one of your fellow managers, you have to take it in the right spirit and I found it a great compliment. I&apos;d just beaten his team and I used his criticism as a big positive; I&apos;d rather he was moaning and groaning about the way I&apos;d beaten them rather than us losing and him saying how attractively we&apos;d played.&quot; Not that Allardyce envisages this rivalry and mutual resentment ruling out the possibility of a post-match drink today. &quot;I don&apos;t see why I won&apos;t be inviting Rafa in for a glass of wine,&quot; he said. &quot;I went in for a glass when Liverpool beat Bolton there last season (2-0 at Anfield on New Year&apos;s Day). He had spoken about me in the papers the day before but I was big enough to walk in and test how good his red wine is.&quot; Perhaps surprisingly the ensuing conversation was not overly awkward. &quot;It was about the pressure of the Christmas period and we agreed we should have a break in January,&quot; recalled Allardyce, who also shares the Ben\u00edtez view on the vexed subject of player rotation. &quot;Rotation is the way forward,&quot; maintained Newcastle&apos;s manager, whose side are facing their first league meeting with a member of England&apos;s &quot;big four&quot; this season. &quot;You can&apos;t ask players to play 60 games a season. Without his rotation policy Rafa wouldn&apos;t have won the European Cup.&quot; With nagging geordie doubts about Allardyce&apos;s suitability for St James&apos; Park having surfaced in earnest after the recent 4-1 home defeat by Portsmouth, he could certainly do with a victory against Liverpool in the the first of a tricky trio of games, subsequently involving a trip to face Blackburn Rovers and a home date with Arsenal. Assorted injuries, most notably afflicting Michael Owen, Steven Taylor and Abdoulaye Faye, dictate that Allardyce does not have much scope for squad-spinning of his own but he hinted that his game plan might annoy Ben\u00edtez again. Though he has only one fit specialist central defender in David Rozehnal, at least he has cover in attack, where last season&apos;s top scorer Obafemi Martins is likely to partner Mark Viduka. Refreshed by a short holiday in Dubai during the international break, a recently stressed Newcastle manager seems cautiously optimistic. &quot;I&apos;ve managed a couple of wins against Liverpool in the last couple of years with Bolton,&quot; he said. &quot;So, if we get it right tactically and do what we need to do, we have a chance.&quot;", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Liverpool", "Newcastle United"], "title": "No regrets as Allardyce prepares a tactics and wine test again", "sentences": ["Refreshed by a short holiday in Dubai during the international break, a recently stressed Newcastle manager seems cautiously optimistic."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/24/newsstory.liverpool1", "publicationDate": "2007-11-24T00:16:18Z"}, {"article": "The vegetarian cottage If you&apos;re a strict vegetarian, it can be difficult to find a self-catering cottage where meat hasn&apos;t been cooked on the premises.

And what will probably do for the man in Number 10 is housing. Brown says his passions are health and education, but what will poison voters against him are roofs - the ones no longer over the heads of the electorate. It&apos;s hard to see a happy way out. In some areas house prices are 20 times average local incomes and ownership seems impossible; yet if prices tumble, as economists increasingly predict, it will be not only Northern Rock customers who are suddenly homeless, with repossessions already trebling in a year. A fall in prices will not even help those crowded out of the market, as many owners will hunker down and refuse to sell. A huge swath of voters will be left feeling decidedly sub-prime, and they will take that out on a sub-standard Prime Minister. You know, the one who as Chancellor vowed upon collecting the seals of office: &apos;I will not allow house prices to get out of control and put at risk the sustainability of the recovery.&apos; Still, this housing crisis is not only about the repo man creeping up on the supposedly comfortable; there are 1.6m families - one in 13 households - on the waiting list for social housing, the Lib Dem housing spokesman Paul Holmes has discovered. This is vast. Yvette Cooper has cobbled together a housing green paper, but privately Labour MPs are scornful. For all the political-media obsession about home ownership, it remains a fantasy for many. Shared-equity schemes, community land trusts and the like could help. But might the 21st century also be crying out for a very old-fashioned solution - the rebirth of the council house? Did you know only 4,000 are built a year - a tenth of what we managed under Margaret Thatcher, who against her friend Gordon suddenly looks like a friend of municipal housing. And for every one built, more are lost with council house sales. And proceeds go to Westminster, not councils, which are thus unable to build replacements. The result? 130,000 children living in squalor. Few want to see the return of vast estates, but small developments that can never be bought, interspersed with private housing? There is no alternative. Labour MPs know that housing is what exercises their constituents. Holmes has held meetings with Cooper and claims the minister privately admits the reason Labour builds so few council houses is because it does not want to borrow and break Brown&apos;s golden rule. Everyone now professes to believe in localism, yet councils are not free to raise and spend the money to provide the housing local people want. Instead, Brown seeks to plaster the countryside in executive houses against the wishes of - and unaffordable to - those who grew up there. These McMansions will be snapped up by the jaded urban middle-class fleeing cities, further contributing to civic decline. This isn&apos;t planning, it&apos;s centrally controlled chaos. And it is the mortar falling out of Brown&apos;s premiership. Some day, quite soon, a large number of us might have to downshift - and that includes Gordon. Haven&apos;t they paid enough? Soldiers back from Iraq and Afghanistan were splashing about as part of their rehabilitation in a public pool in Surrey. Fellow swimmers objected, partly because they found the soldiers unappealing aesthetically - they had been careless enough to lose various limbs - but also because they &apos;hadn&apos;t paid&apos;. The warm reception for the Royal Anglians in Norwich was a welcome, if belated, recognition that if people choose a life of dodging bullets equipped only with dodgy armour, it tells you much about their career options. Soldiers are denied the luxury of the war ennui in which we wallow. Cornered in a cave by Taliban, they too would probably rather be home, happily moaning about whatever it is the good folk of Leatherhead like to moan about. &apos;Not paid&apos;? One hopes the Surrey burghers realise that losing your legs probably counts as payment. No wonder England fail at football - we&apos;d much rather kick a man when he&apos;s down The quiff fielded by Steve McClaren is mighty extravagant for the quantity of hair supporting it. So fans should consider it a relief they won&apos;t have to watch it at the Euro finals, as the stress induced by yet another shambolic performance makes it grow ever further detached from his main landmass of hair, rather reminiscent of one of those artificial islands off Dubai. But the venom raining down on McClaren&apos;s head is making me feel almost sorry for him. Piers Morgan wonders, a little wistfully, why someone hasn&apos;t followed the example of a Colombian football enthusiast who responded to a below-par display by shooting a player dead. We are inept at football because our national sport is no longer kicking a ball along the ground, but kicking a man when he is down. The greatest talents don&apos;t dribble a ball but dribble with fury. So a fairly harmless and hapless bunch of FA officials have their grainy images plastered across the red tops as though they are on the run from Broadmoor. Ian Blair is under pressure to resign, but nothing like as much as Brian &apos;FA&apos; Barwick; well, the Met commissioner is only responsible for the death of an innocent man, not killing &apos;the dreams of a nation&apos;. The grave possibility that Tesco might not sell quite so many BBQ chipolatas is presented as the greatest national humiliation since Khartoum. McClaren wasn&apos;t exposed as a mediocre manager on Wednesday night. His CV had &apos;mediocre&apos; stamped on it when he was appointed. And if the FA hadn&apos;t chosen this mediocrity, they would have chosen another mediocrity such as Sam Allardyce. There aren&apos;t any decent English managers. British football, like Britain&apos;s economy, flourishes thanks to foreigners. We are essentially crap, but thrive by persuading less crap people to come and work for us. We must either get to grips with the underlying problem - a workforce spectacularly devoid of skill and learning - or get over it. Still, at least Sophie is well-heeled So you fear your boss will look you up on YouTube and learn of your youthful enthusiasms on that Club 18-30 holiday? Well, imagine how Sophie Anderton feels. The former face - OK, bust - of Gossard has seemingly been exposed as a &apos;high-class hooker&apos;. It could be worse; she might have been, say, a lower-middle-class hooker. Yet the scandal seems contrived. Just as footballers retire to run pubs, so models have long seen it as a logical career development to branch into, um, other sectors of the glamour business. The best reaction to the clip of Anderton cavorting in little but killer stilettos came in an email from a fashion-writer friend: &apos;Her shoes are a sensation. I&apos;d go on the game for a pair of Christian Louboutins...&apos; Leave my mother out of it, please In our house, we aren&apos;t fearfully waiting for fraudsters to steal our identities from the missing computer discs - they&apos;ve already had ours, thanks to government incompetence. I spent last week fielding calls from police, postal workers and banks after thieves acquired my details from Companies House. As director of a small firm I have to file tax returns, and anyone can gain access to these for a tiny fee. They have, I&apos;m told, been targeting Britain&apos;s burgeoning battalion of company directors. And very sneaky they are, too. They had my post redirected. They even persuaded a bank my security information had changed, including - imaginatively - my mother&apos;s maiden name. They ran up a total of \u00a330,000 on two credit cards, applied for loans and set up trading accounts. And apparently they have been doing this to other folk for months. So why didn&apos;t the government keep tighter control on this data? My question has been met by weary sighs. &apos;We know, we&apos;ve been telling them this...&apos; The response of ministers will, no doubt, be to commission even more expensive computer systems. And these will be failures, as the NHS system demonstrates. There shouldn&apos;t be one national agency dealing with child benefit, tax returns or even health. These organisations should be broken up and run locally; less Big Brother, more Little Brother. The monster of modern government is not merely out of control, it is uncontrollable. \u00b7 A headline yesterday about Princess Beatrice, daughter of Her Ferginess: &apos;Partying with Kate Moss.

The last game, the last minute, the last kick of an epic season; Arsenal&apos;s Michael Thomas scores the goal that takes the First Division title away from Liverpool by securing a 2-0 victory at Anfield. It was, some say, the day that England began to love football again, after an era of hooliganism, tragedy and rough, unattractive football. That same day, in an Edinburgh hospital, Don Revie, the former Leeds and England manager, passed away, aged just 61, his body ravaged by motor neurone disease. &apos;A friend of mine died yesterday, a big lovable bear of a man,&apos; wrote the Daily Mail&apos;s Jeff Powell; other accolades seemed to be lost in the excitement following Arsenal&apos;s victory. Some commentators, in the aftermath of his death, even accused Revie of initiating English football&apos;s decline, by introducing &apos;professionalism&apos; - the bone-crushing, win-at-all-costs football that brought his Leeds teams such success in the Sixties and Seventies and that had been taken up by other clubs. At his funeral a week later, the Leeds players he had managed, now in their forties and fifties - Billy Bremner, Norman Hunter, Johnny Giles, Allan Clarke, Jack Charlton and all the rest of them - were out in force. Kevin Keegan flew in from Spain and Lawrie McMenemy, the former Southampton manager, was there too. But there was no one else from his England days, no one from the Football Association. When the new season began that August, there was no minute&apos;s silence, no black armbands. There was no indication that the man being mourned had been the most innovative manager of his generation. Just as Clive Woodward and Bill Sweetenham have transformed rugby union and swimming with their unconventional approaches, so Revie changed the face of English football. He was a confidant to the players, psychologist, social secretary, kit designer, commercial manager, PR flak, dietitian and all-encompassing &apos;boss&apos; of his team. In an era when pre-match preparation consisted of a 10-minute chat before a game, Revie was a revolutionary. Not until Arsene Wenger was appointed Arsenal boss in 1996, more than two decades after Revie had left Elland Road, would a manager exert such a profound influence on his club - and the English game as a whole. Matt Busby was knighted for his success at Manchester United; Alf Ramsey for his with England. Bill Shankly, who also died relatively young, is quoted like some secular saint. Other managers of the era, such as Joe Mercer, Malcolm Allison and Bill Nicholson, are remembered with fondness and admiration. But although his successes outstrip those of most contemporaries, Revie has never been revered, or regarded with warmth. His reputation has been defined not by his feats at Elland Road, but by allegations of corruption and venality. Those allegations have rarely been challenged. Donald George Revie was born on 10 July 1927 in Depression-stricken Middlesbrough. This was the town of JB Priestley&apos;s English Journey &apos;whose chief passions... were for beer and football&apos;. It was, Priestley wrote, &apos;a dismal town, even with beer and football&apos;. Revie&apos;s father was an unemployed joiner; his mother, a washerwoman, died when he was a child. Poverty and football defined his childhood. &apos;He used to talk about taking baths in the sink,&apos; says Ernest Hecht, a friend and business associate of Revie from the 1960s. &apos;It was a poor upbringing and that left him determined that everything went well later on the monetary side.&apos; At 14, Revie left school and began work as a bricklayer. Growing up under the shadow of Ayresome Park, football was an escape. He idolised Middlesbrough players George Camsell and Wilf Mannion, and fell under the influence of Bill Sanderson, manager of a junior team, Middlesbrough Swifts. A train driver by day, Sanderson was obsessed with the minutiae of the game: in his council house he held team meetings, distributing dossiers on local rivals and showing a tactical nous that would have shamed many First Division clubs. His ideas left a deep impression on the young Revie. Revie&apos;s breakthrough as a footballer came at 16, with Leicester City, initially playing in the wartime leagues. He joined Hull City in 1949 and Manchester City two years later. An intelligent but not especially quick player, he rose to prominence at Maine Road, developing a role as a deep-lying centre-forward, modelled on that of the great Hungarian player Nandor Hidegkuti. Revie won six England caps, the first of which came in late 1954 in the season in which he was named Footballer of the Year. In the next season, using the so-called &apos;Revie Plan&apos;, City won the FA Cup. But he was transferred to Sunderland in November 1956 and two years later, though he may not have recognised it at the time, came the crucial move in his career: a \u00a314,000 transfer to Leeds. Leeds were a mediocre team in the late 1950s: their only honour, the Second Division championship, had been won long ago in 1924 and their ramshackle ground, Elland Road, bore testament to the city&apos;s preference for rugby league. At the end of Revie&apos;s second season they were relegated to Division Two; in his third they neared bankruptcy, with crowds sometimes as low as 8,000. &apos;The club were fifth-rate and the players were undisciplined,&apos; says Eric Smith, who was signed from Celtic in June 1960. &apos;I thought beforehand I was coming to a top club. I found out otherwise in the first three or four days.&apos; In March 1961, the Leeds directors gambled and appointed Revie, their 33-year-old captain, as manager. Revie had previously applied to be Bournemouth manager and asked Harry Reynolds, a Leeds director, to write his reference. While writing it, Reynolds was moved to consider him for the Leeds job - one that no one in their right minds wanted at the time. &apos;Overnight he had to make the transition from being one of the boys to being the boss,&apos; recalled Billy Bremner, years later. &apos;The way he affected the transition is a mark of the man himself.&apos; Revie called the squad together: he said he was no longer &apos;Don&apos;, nor &apos;Mr Revie&apos;, but &apos;Boss&apos;. In the following years he would redefine the term. That season Revie saved Leeds from relegation. The next, he began to transform them. His first task - after changing the colour of the kit from royal blue to all white to emulate Real Madrid, the all-conquering European champions, a comparison considered preposterous at the time - was to purge what he later called &apos;a dead club&apos; of its rotten core. &apos;There were players here who didn&apos;t care whether they played or not,&apos; he recalled in 1968. &apos;I got rid of 27 in two years.&apos; But he stuck with underperformers, such as Bremner, who was unhappy playing in an unfamiliar outside-right role and homesick for his native Scotland, and Jack Charlton, &apos;a one-man awkward squad&apos;, nurturing their previously unrealised potential. Bremner was persuaded to stay, moved to a more central role and eventually became Revie&apos;s captain; the surly and undisciplined Charlton, previously an abysmal trainer, flourished under the new coaching regime, becoming the cornerstone of a young, tenacious defence. His play so improved that he became England&apos;s World Cup-winning centre-half. Revie combined their talents with astute signings such as the veteran inside-forward Bobby Collins, from Everton, and Manchester United&apos;s Johnny Giles. One of his great managerial gifts was an ability to spot and nurture young talent. He inherited several outstanding teenage players, including Bremner, Paul Reaney, Gary Sprake and Norman Hunter, and added other unknowns such as Peter Lorimer and Terry Cooper to the squad. &apos;He was a great man, a father figure really,&apos; says Sprake. Leeds&apos; long-standing goalkeeper, who had never left Wales before joining Leeds, says that he was so homesick that he ran away back to his parents&apos; home after just two weeks. The next morning Revie was on the doorstep, having driven through the night to persuade him to come back. Revie watched more than what was happening at training. &apos;When you had a girlfriend,&apos; Lorimer says, &apos;he&apos;d have her checked out and make sure she was the right sort of person, in his opinion.&apos; But Revie&apos;s loyalty could reach a more sinister level. In 1971 Sprake was involved in a drink-driving accident, seriously injuring a female passenger before fleeing the scene. When police turned up to arrest Sprake shortly after the crash, Revie intervened and the incident was covered up: the goalkeeper&apos;s car was reported stolen and he received a mere police censure instead of more serious charges. At the training ground he introduced a regime that made Leeds the fittest and most technically proficient club in the Football League, including hiring ballet dancers to teach the players about balance and imposing dietary and nutritional standards. &apos;I laugh when I read about these foreign managers bringing in new ideas and new techniques,&apos; says Revie&apos;s son Duncan, who points out that his father&apos;s initiatives predated the 1990s &apos;coaching revolution&apos; by decades. &apos;His training ideas were ahead of their time,&apos; Lorimer agrees. &apos;I know when we mixed with players from other clubs at internationals, none of them were doing the things we were. It was all new. Everything was ahead of its time and that&apos;s probably why we enjoyed it so much.&apos; Revie also created brotherly spirit among the squad. &apos;Our whole ethos was built on loyalty,&apos; Lorimer says. &apos;We all fight for each other, we all work for each other. If someone kicks me, he kicks all 11 of us.&apos; Revie involved the players&apos; families, to heighten the sense of togetherness. He organised social nights for the players, including rounds of carpet bowls, dominos and bingo. &apos;We had 15 years of what no man gets,&apos; Lorimer says. &apos;Every day you&apos;d go to work and it was an absolute pleasure. You couldn&apos;t wait to get in your car and go down to the ground and be amongst the lads.&apos; Having won promotion to the First Division in 1964, Leeds finished runners-up in both the League and the FA Cup in their first season back, and over the next decade never finished lower than fourth. They took the title twice, in 1969 and 1974, and won the League Cup in 1968 and the FA Cup in 1972. In Europe, they won the Inter City Fairs Cup - the forerunner of the Uefa Cup - in 1968. &apos;It was a team that had everything,&apos; Lorimer says. &apos;They had aggression. They had class. They had experience. It was the complete team, it had the perfect blend of players that offered every good part of the game.&apos; But Leeds&apos; brand of football made them hated by many. It was a high-tempo pressing game that suffocated opponents and overwhelmed those that tried to outpass them. If your side tried to kick them, Leeds would kick back twice as hard. They feigned injuries, harassed officials and pinched, kicked and hit opponents. The image of &apos;Dirty Leeds&apos; was reinforced on the terraces, where their supporters earned a reputation for viciousness. George Best claimed that the only time he needed to wear shinpads was when he played Leeds. &apos;I hated playing against them, I really did,&apos; he said. &apos;They also had a hell of a lot of skill, too, but they were still a bloody nightmare.&apos; When Leeds played Everton in the so-called &apos;Battle of Goodison&apos; in November 1964, the referee pulled the teams off for a &apos;cooling-down period&apos; after a chest-high tackle by Willie Bell left Everton&apos;s Derek Temple unconscious (Everton&apos;s captain, Brian Labone, once told me that he and his colleagues initially thought Bell had killed Temple, so brutal was the assault). Leeds players always denied they were a dirty side, or that Revie encouraged gamesmanship. &apos;What was called cynical in this country was called professional when the Italians played it,&apos; Bremner said. Or as Lorimer puts it: &apos;If a team wanted to mix it with us, we could mix it; if a team wanted to play football, we could play.&apos; Revie created an attitude within the club not seen before in English football. At the time it was called &apos;professionalism&apos;, but this was no complimentary term; instead it encapsulated the cynicism, physicality and relentlessness of Leeds. Within a few years, other clubs, unable to cope with them in any other way, would try to copy them. To many, Revie is the man who ended English football&apos;s age of innocence. By the time of their second League title in May 1974, rival fans hated Leeds and their supporters. Revie was widely disliked. &apos;Don Revie&apos;s so-called family had more in keeping with the mafia than Mothercare,&apos; Brian Clough said. But even Clough, who often used his weekly newspaper column to attack Leeds, admitted a grudging respect for Revie&apos;s achievements. With many of the great 1960s managers retired or at the end of their careers, Revie was arguably the finest in the country. He was certainly the most successful. This made him the logical choice for the England manager&apos;s job, which Alf Ramsey had vacated in April, and he was appointed on a five-year contract worth \u00a325,000 a year - three times the salary of his predecessor. On the field, Revie&apos;s England started well, with a 3-0 home success in a European Championship qualifier against Czechoslovakia. There was a resounding victory over world champions West Germany and a 5-1 win against Scotland. But England&apos;s form grew increasingly patchy and there was unease among the players about Revie. He seemed unable to settle on his best XI, changing his starting line-up every game. &apos;Strangely he seemed to go the way the press wanted him to go,&apos; Norman Hunter, who played under Revie for both club and country, once recalled. &apos;He was very strong in his management of Leeds, but with England he seemed to change and I think he tried to pacify the press with his decisions.&apos; Some of his choices were arbitrary: Alan Ball was captain in the last six internationals of the 1974-75 season but was then dropped abruptly and never picked again. Ball told me shortly before his death this April that he was still perplexed about the incident. Nor was the move a success: defeat in Czechoslovakia and a failure to beat Portugal led to qualifying failure. Revie&apos;s team-building exercises - the carpet bowls and indoor golf - were disliked and self-defeating, as half the squad would skulk off to bed rather than sit through another round of bingo. His technical dossiers on opponents were not welcomed either. What was the point, players wondered, of a dozen pages on a Cypriot amateur? Duncan Revie believes there was another, serious, problem. &apos;He didn&apos;t have a Bremner or a Giles and couldn&apos;t come to terms with the fact that he didn&apos;t have two players like that for the England team.&apos; Revie&apos;s relationship with the FA&apos;s volatile chairman, Sir Harold Thompson, had also broken down. &apos;They genuinely hated each other,&apos; Duncan recalls. &apos;Thompson was an old Corinthian who always treated the manager like a serf.&apos; At an official dinner, Revie objected to Sir Harold&apos;s habit of referring to him by his surname. &apos;When I get to know you better Revie, I shall call you Don,&apos; Thompson said. Revie retorted: &apos;When I get to know you better, Thompson, I shall call you Sir Harold.&apos; England were paired with Italy for the 1978 World Cup qualifiers, with just one nation able to progress. A 2-0 defeat in Rome in November 1976 meant hopes were slim almost from the outset. Three months later Holland humiliated England at Wembley, Johan Cruyff and his team-mates at times toying with the home side - the 2-0 friendly loss was likened by the press to the famous 6-3 defeat by Hungary in 1953. On the field, Revie&apos;s regime reached a crisis that summer. After Scotland beat England 2-1 in the annual Home Internationals fixture, many of the visitors&apos; 30,000 followers invaded the Wembley pitch, ripping up turf, dancing around the penalty areas and snapping crossbars. Italy were closing in on World Cup qualification. The nadir of Don Revie&apos;s managerial career had arrived; his disgrace was about to follow. Writing about Revie in The Football Man, his 1968 journey around the English game, Arthur Hopcraft described him as &apos;a big flat-fronted man with an outdoors face as if he lives permanently in a keen wind&apos;. His attitude towards the game, wrote Hopcraft, was like &apos;that of a passionate player&apos;. The impression was that of a typical bluff northerner - loyal, professional, straightforward. His son Duncan, moreover, describes a religious man, attending church each weekend and praying each night, and providing for a wide extended family. He was also, however, known as &apos;Don Readies&apos;. His flirtations with wealthy clubs such as Everton while still at Leeds, and his enormous salary as England manager, enhanced a reputation for greed. While in charge of the national team he once demanded \u00a3200 from journalists wanting to interview Malcolm Macdonald, after he scored five times against Cyprus, supposedly pocketing the money himself while the striker remained ignorant of the affair. Certainly money had always been an issue for Revie. As a child of the Depression, his upbringing was set against a backdrop of the Jarrow march and the north-east&apos;s industrial decline. He was a player in a time of rolling contracts, tied to a statutory maximum wage of around \u00a320 a week, and his boyhood hero, Wilf Mannion, ended up as a tea boy in a Middlesbrough factory. Now, in the summer of 1977, he was convinced that the FA were set on replacing him and that they had lined up the Ipswich manager, Bobby Robson, as his successor. So Revie determined to secure his future. On 11 July 1977, Daily Mail readers read that Revie had left the England manager&apos;s job. They were the first to know: Revie had sold his story to the Mail for \u00a320,000 and his resignation letter arrived after the FA&apos;s Lancaster Gate headquarters had closed the previous night. Revie claimed that the pressures of being in a job when &apos;nearly everyone in the country seems to want me out&apos; were simply too unbearable for him and his family. Being England manager, he said, had brought &apos;too much heartache to those nearest me&apos;. &apos;He didn&apos;t turn down his country,&apos; his lawyer, Gilbert Gray, told me. &apos;He knew very well that his country, represented by a lot of old fogies who had decided to get rid of him, were about to sack him. He knew damn well he was on his way out.&apos; But on 12 July the Mail announced that Revie was leaving the country to take up a six-year contract worth \u00a3340,000, tax-free, to coach the United Arab Emirates national team. To the public, Revie&apos;s crime was not his disloyalty but his greed. It emerged that a month before his &apos;defection&apos; he had offered to resign as England manager - without mention of his offer from Dubai - in exchange for a \u00a350,000 pay-off. He boasted in the Mail of how he would spend his new salary. &apos;I will travel to the great sporting events of the world,&apos; he said. &apos;The major golf tournaments, the Olympics, World Cup finals - whatever takes my fancy.&apos; Sir Harold Thompson exacted his revenge, charging Revie with bringing the game into disrepute and summoning him to a disciplinary hearing at which he acted as judge and prosecutor; Gilbert Gray, who defended Revie, calls the hearing &apos;a kangaroo court, an absolute disgrace&apos;. After the disciplinary committee gave out its inevitable guilty verdict, its punishment was severe: a 10-year ban from English football. Revie appealed to the High Court; the ban was overturned, but the judge expressed reservations about Revie&apos;s integrity and ordered him to pay two-thirds of his costs. &apos;Mr Revie... presented to the public a sensational and notorious example of disloyalty, breach of duty, discourtesy and selfishness,&apos; said Justice Cantley. &apos;His conduct brought English football, at a high level, into disrepute.&apos; Two months after Revie left the England job, the Daily Mirror alleged that a number of Leeds matches had been fixed over the course of the 1960s and 1970s. Previous allegations by the Sunday People in 1972 had claimed that three unnamed Wolves players were offered \u00a31,000 apiece to throw what would have been a title decider with Leeds, but Wolves had won and neither police nor FA investigations found evidence of wrongdoing. &apos;Don Revie planned and schemed and offered bribes, leaving as little as possible to chance,&apos; wrote the Mirror&apos;s lead reporter, Richard Stott. &apos;He relied on the loyalty of those he took into his confidence not to talk, and it nearly worked.&apos; The star witness was Gary Sprake. &apos;I was quite surprised by the amount of information they had,&apos; Sprake says. &apos;Richard Stott asked me to get involved, but everything was already written, really.&apos; Sprake told Stott that there had been attempts to fix the Wolves game - a claim he subsequently retracted - as well as several other matches. Jim Barron, the Nottingham Forest goalkeeper, meanwhile said that Billy Bremner had been sent to the Forest dressing room before a game in the 1971 title race to persuade his opponents to &apos;go easy&apos;. The request was rejected. Alan Ball, meanwhile, revealed clandestine meetings with Revie on Saddleworth Moor in the mid-1960s, when Revie wanted to sign him from Blackpool. Revie also sent weekly \u00a3100 bribes to Ball&apos;s home as part of his attempt to tap him up. The FA fined Ball \u00a33,000, even though he had ended up at Everton, and not Revie&apos;s Leeds. Bob Stokoe, the Sunderland manager who had outwitted Revie in the 1973 FA Cup final, was the most compelling witness. He said that while managing Bury in 1962, when Leeds were battling relegation, Revie offered him \u00a3500 to &apos;go easy&apos;. When he turned him down, Revie further enraged him by asking to speak to his players. The notion that a man who left nothing to chance and whose obsessiveness bordered on paranoia would try to fix title- or relegation-deciders was not implausible. But the evidence against Revie is shaky. Sprake had spoken out only after being paid \u00a314,000. The FA deny the existence of a 300-page dossier of allegations supposedly handed over to them by Stott. No criminal or FA charges came out of the match-fixing allegations and, when the Sunday People repeated them, Billy Bremner sued and won \u00a3100,000. &apos;The people who made these accusations - we didn&apos;t have to bribe them to be able to beat them,&apos; Peter Lorimer says. &apos;I was never aware of it and I don&apos;t think any of our players were ever aware of it happening. You would think you would get to know if that sort of thing was happening, but certainly we never got to know anything.&apos; And yet Stokoe, a well liked and widely respected manager, stood to gain nothing by speaking out. He never profited from the allegation, which he repeated hundreds of times before his death in 2004. The thought of it, he said, made him feel ill. &apos;It always riled me when I see the career Revie has had. At the back of my mind, the bribe is always there. He was always an evil man to me.&apos; Former team-mates have shunned Gary Sprake for his allegations, but the goalkeeper has since made more. He tells me that Revie asked him to &apos;tap up&apos; fellow Wales internationals Colin Green and Terry Hennessey when Leeds played Birmingham on the last day of the 1964-65 season. Sprake refused and Leeds drew 3-3, losing the League title to Manchester United on goal average. Duncan, Revie&apos;s son, remains convinced that the allegations were unfounded. &apos;They must have fixed lots and lots and lots of matches, because they won for at least 10 years,&apos; he says. &apos;It was ludicrous in the extreme.&apos; If Revie did fix football matches, it was not systematic - and done in a way that was uncharacteristically unprofessional. Duncan believes that &apos;not suing has wrongly damaged his reputation&apos;, because his father&apos;s name can never properly be cleared. He had a great time in the Middle East,&apos; Duncan says. &apos;It was probably as happy as I&apos;ve seen my mum and dad. They were relaxed. They enjoyed the sunshine, they enjoyed the golf, they enjoyed Dubai. The friendships that the family made out there still remain to this day.&apos; When Revie&apos;s time in the Middle East came to an end in 1983, he was only in his mid-fifties, but there was no way back into English football. He was, once, mooted as a candidate for the Queens Park Rangers job. In 1986 he moved to his wife&apos;s homeland, Scotland. Then came the muscle-wasting illness that would take his life, motor neurone disease. From 1987, it quickly robbed him of all physical abilities. &apos;Eventually he blinked twice for yes and once for no,&apos; Duncan says. &apos;He went from 17 stone to eight stone in two years.&apos; At a 1988 charity testimonial at Elland Road, Revie, now in a wheelchair, was reunited with some of his former players. It was the last time they saw him; less than a year later he was dead. In The Damned Utd, David Peace&apos;s novel about Brian Clough&apos;s six weeks as Leeds manager, Revie appears as a ghost, stalking out Clough. To many, including Clough, Leeds remained &apos;Revie&apos;s club&apos;, and the disdain towards Leeds, &apos;Dirty Leeds&apos;, persists. Few outside Yorkshire lamented their recent relegation to League One - the old Division Three, from which Revie once saved them - and flirtations with bankruptcy. The club&apos;s followers maintain the spirit of defiance that Revie originated - particularly when it comes to the defence of Revie himself. &apos;For those who know him, have been in his company, and seen what he&apos;s done,&apos; Duncan says, &apos;why should we care what view other people are forming from afar? The people I care about, the family, the Leeds people, the people from Yorkshire, they all know the calibre of the person.&apos; To many Revie remains an enigmatic figure, but the view from Leeds is possibly the truest measure of the man. For no one sums up a manager more accurately than his own supporters, and they are unequivocal in their judgment of Don Revie. To them, quite simply, he was the best.", "tags": ["Sport", "Football"], "title": "James Corbett on Don Revie", "sentences": ["It emerged that a month before his &apos;defection&apos; he had offered to resign as England manager - without mention of his offer from Dubai - in exchange for a \u00a350,000 pay-off.", "They enjoyed the sunshine, they enjoyed the golf, they enjoyed Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/nov/25/football.newsstory", "publicationDate": "2007-11-25T12:12:49Z"}, {"article": "It was while I was watching John Barnes competing on Strictly Come Dancing in the company of Terry Venables (me, not Barnes) that the idea took hold. &apos;Morters,&apos; said the one-eyebrowed one, &apos;you could dance better than that.&apos; Many years ago, Gary Lineker and I shared a penthouse in Barcelona and enjoyed the odd night on the Ramblas. Occasionally, these would end at a lowly karaoke bar on the outskirts of town, where Terence Frederick Venables would don comedy moustache and spectacles (he was manager of Barcelona at the time) and belt out torch songs. The audience being small, Gary and I often found ourselves dancing with each other. Not a winning combination, with my two left feet, and Gary being a right-footed performer who did his best work at close quarters, but it kept Terry happy. I tell you this because it dawned on me that the whole Celebrity circuit is in a mess that in many ways resembles Formula One in the days before Bernie Ecclestone. There is no continuity, no focus: it is every show for itself, as it used to be with the grands prix. What the circuit needs is some genius to bang a few heads together, make it coherent, and be rewarded with a controlling stake in all and every end product. The first thing I would do is establish a Celebrity Championship. Points picked up in the House, on the Ice Rink, on the Island, or, heaven forfend, on the Farm are carried forward to the season-ending Rumble in the Jungle. The next thing to set up is a fair system of qualification for each Celebrity event. At present, it is done on an ad hoc basis with selection dependent on the machinations of disreputable agents. Instead, just like Wimbledon qualifying at Roehampton, it should be open and above board, with some wild card entries for us Brits. Finally, let&apos;s welcome others into the world of Celebrity. There is no reason why the Celebrity Big Brother house shouldn&apos;t be constructed in Dubai, Lagos or Burma if the money is right. Celebrity is about reach, not principle. A whole set of intriguing questions would then be there for the asking: Shilpa Shetty - a wizard around the House, but can she cut it on the Farm? Mark Ramprakash - silky on the Dance Floor (pictured), but will this notoriously poor tourist cope on the Island? Greg Rusedski - does he have the all-round superficiality to be the first cross-genre Celebrity great?

Several Chinese banks have been trying to persuade another state-owned body, the Singaporean investment agency Temasek, to sell them its 17 per cent stake in Standard. The Singaporeans are said to be reluctant sellers, but the teasing question for Standard&apos;s investors is whether the Chinese want only the Singaporean holding, or intend to acquire it to launch a full-scale bid. Even if Temasek won&apos;t sell, there is nothing to stop the Chinese buying a stake from other investors in the market. Robin Down, a banking analyst at HSBC, says: &apos;China has a lot of money and Standard has an enviable franchise in most of the big Asian economies. I am less convinced than I used to be about Standard being able to retain its independence.&apos; Down says it would take years for a competitor to build a bank such as Standard, which is strong in Indonesia, Thailand, Korea, India, Hong Kong and Malaysia. It is also expanding on the Chinese mainland. Throughout much of Asia, the company is among the leaders in areas such as credit cards, corporate lending and trade finance. Lee Goodwin, an analyst with SPK, says: &apos;The Chinese stock market boom means that China&apos;s banks are in a very strong position; their highly valued shares could be used to pay for a Western bank such as Standard. American and UK banks have been badly hit by the credit crunch, so a takeover from a Citigroup or a Barclays is out of the question.&apos; But a Chinese takeover of a British bank? Surely that would go down badly with UK politicians, no matter how much the cash-rich Chinese were prepared to pay Standard&apos;s shareholders? Probably. But would Prime Minister Gordon Brown follow the lead of his French counterpart Nicolas Sarkozy and warn that acquisitive state-owned enterprises from countries such as Russia, China and Dubai need to be stopped in their tracks?  It&apos;s a moot point. Brown, though, is understood to be more protectionist than his predecessor Tony Blair, apparently expressing reservations about a possible takeover of British Gas&apos;s parent company, Centrica, by Russia&apos;s Gazprom last year. Richard Portes, professor of economics at the London Business School, is in no doubt that the battle lines are being drawn for a showdown between protectionists in Europe and America on the one side, and Asian and Middle Eastern investors who are flexing their economic muscle. Portes argues that sovereign wealth funds and other state-owned institutions, set up with the specific intention of investing in Western companies, are &apos;a political hot potato&apos;.  He says: &apos;They will become increasingly important, as long as financial globalisation is not reversed and emerging market countries and oil producers continue to run large balance-of-payments surpluses.&apos; China has a huge trade surplus with the West, particularly the US, leaving Beijing with a stockpile of foreign exchange reserves, mostly dollars. What to do with the money?  Until now, the Chinese have been prepared to fund the yawning US trade deficit by buying US government bonds. But the yield is relatively low, and their value has declined as the dollar has plummeted. China, like other emerging economies, wants to diversify its holdings away from dollar-denominated assets, to reap better returns elsewhere.  That was partly why China Development Bank (CDB) acquired a small stake in Barclays, but there is a subtext: China also wants to tap into Western commercial nous.  Under the terms of an agreement between Barclays Capital, the UK group&apos;s investment banking arm, and CDB, the British will provide Chinese companies with risk management expertise to allow them to trade more effectively in global commodities markets - a lucrative avenue for generating extra revenue at a time when the price of base metals has soared. Analysts said the Chinese were still far behind their Western counterparts in the deployment of risk and hedging strategies. But both sides gain: Barclays will train CDB commodities traders and bankers, but the UK company becomes CDB&apos;s preferred partner in developing future commodities products. That way, Barclays gets extra business and the Chinese learn to become better capitalists. But buying small stakes in foreign banks is one thing; outright takeovers or investing in Western oil and defence companies are quite another. One analyst says: &apos;The Chinese have to act with the sensitivities of Western politicians and public opinion in mind. On the other hand, the Americans and others have to be careful because if protectionism becomes the order of the day, the Chinese can retaliate by refusing to invest in US government bonds, endangering the ability of the US to fund its trade deficit and threatening global financial stability.&apos;  Portes, however, says Russian, Chinese and Middle Eastern companies and sovereign funds are different in that &apos;they do not operate in a transparent way.  &apos;Moreover, there is a political dimension: these state-owned asset managers are on the rise after the West has spent a lot of time privatising firms across the business spectrum. Do we want them to fall back under state control? Another point is that we cannot be sure that they will deploy the same commercial rationale as investors in the developed world. They may have other [geopolitical] interests.&apos; Portes believes that there are two ways to solve the problem posed by emerging economy shareholders. The first is for countries such as the US to &apos;fix&apos; their current account deficits (the weak dollar helps because it makes US exports cheaper). The other is to hammer out rules about transparency and to establish a code of conduct, possibly via the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Portes adds that we could limit sovereign wealth fund acquisitions (presumably, this could be extended to take in other state-controlled bodies and companies) to non-voting shares, in order to avoid political interference in business decisions or strategies.&apos; Ominously, Portes concludes that &apos;the prospects for an easy resolution of the foreseeable conflicts are not good&apos;. But how soon these tensions will burst into the open is difficult to say, although it&apos;s not impossible that Standard Chartered could become a test case, if the Chinese - in defiance of their critics - move in for the kill.

But insiders say he will not last long, once a new government is elected and his army ties fade. They predict the general&apos;s final posting, following a trail into exile blazed by Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, will be duke of Knightsbridge or king of Dubai. Musharraf&apos;s decision to call an election on January 8, his imminent resignation as army chief, his acquiescence in Sharif&apos;s weekend return, and gradual release of political prisoners have all helped put his pre-crisis plan back on track. Officials say he is now under intense American pressure to take the last, crucial step and lift the state of emergency, as demanded by US special envoy John Negroponte last week. Only an end to the emergency can give the coming elections necessary credibility (although few expect them to be entirely free from manipulation), they say. And only this will quell mounting alarm in Washington about the lack of political alternatives to Musharraf and semi-hysterical questions about who &quot;lost&quot; nuclear-armed Muslim Pakistan. Pakistani officials suggest a private understanding that the emergency will end soon explains why President George Bush spoke out so strongly in Musharraf&apos;s support after Negroponte departed. To derisive guffaws from Democrats, Bush said the general &quot;truly is somebody who believes in democracy&quot; and who &quot;hasn&apos;t crossed the line&quot;. But so far Bush is sticking to his hired gun. Despite personal hostility to Musharraf and long lists of preconditions, both Bhutto and Sharif are preparing to participate in the polls. Bhutto said on Sunday her Pakistan People&apos;s party (PPP) would take part &quot;under protest&quot; because &quot;we don&apos;t want to leave the field open for our rivals&quot;. But other calculations are also in play. The Bhutto-Musharraf relationship has deteriorated sharply since her return to Karachi last month. Yet despite everything, the pre-crisis mutual understanding brokered by the US is still salvageable. &quot;Musharraf and Bhutto detest each other. They both think of themselves as saviours. Neither is good at sharing power,&quot; a senior official said. &quot;But this marriage was not made in heaven. It was made in Washington. Benazir does whatever the Americans tell her.&quot; Both leaders were pro-American and relatively secular and liberal in outlook, unlike the conservative Sharif with his strong ties to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan&apos;s religious parties. And again unlike Bhutto, Sharif is adamant he will not work with Musharraf, who he has never forgiven for deposing him in the 1999 coup. The most likely, immediate outcome was a coalition government led by Bhutto as prime minister, the official said, even though the chances of her working successfully with him as civilian president were poor in the longer term. &quot;Benazir will make a bid for greater power as PM. The dynamic will be with her. So there&apos;s going to be a big struggle.&quot; In prospect now is a return to Pakistan&apos;s so-called &quot;troika politics&quot; of the 1990s, when president, prime minister and military fought for the political upper hand, usually in alliances of two-against-one. This ongoing institutionalised power struggle, guaranteeing instability and strife, was also cast as a battle between the &quot;three A&apos;s&quot; - &quot;America, the army, and Allah,&quot; not necessarily in that order. Musharraf&apos;s aim had been to lead Pakistan out of this self-destructive cycle, the senior official said:  &quot;In the first phase, from the coup until 2002, he accumulated power.

The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) sought no role in managing Citi, allowing the world&apos;s wealthiest sovereign fund to invest as a saviour of the largest US bank without the risk of being perceived in the United States as an Arab predator. Investors from Dubai to China could be considering similar deals with cash-strapped US banks, hoping to ride a recovery in their stocks and avoid the political barriers that could have been thrust in their path in better times, analysts said. &quot;There will be more such investments,&quot; said Giyas Gokkent, head of research at the National Bank of Abu Dhabi. &quot;The other buyers will likely play the same white-knight role,&quot; he said of other Gulf Arab investments in Wall Street firms. Citi, which could book $17.8bn in second-half credit-market losses, said ADIA would buy 4.9% of stock, eventually becoming the largest shareholder of a bank that has lost 42.5% of its market value in the past five months. Other Gulf investors, backed by $1.2 trillion in state reserves, say they could follow, depending on when they expect the worst of the crisis triggered by defaults on high-risk home loans to have passed. Investment Corporation of Dubai said on November 20 it was looking to benefit from the U.S. crisis, but judged shares of Citigroup to be too expensive as were those of Merrill Lynch, which reported the biggest credit losses after Citi. DIFC Investments, the Dubai government agency that bought into Deutsche Bank this year, said last week it could invest in banks and property among other US assets. Dubai&apos;s state-owned private equity firm Istithmar said in September it was considering buying into two US companies hit by exposure to sub-prime, or high-risk, mortgages. It did not name them. These investments would likely be minority stakes that offer the buyers no say in how the banks are run, said Gokkent. Sovereign funds such ADIA, with an estimated $650bn in assets, lack the expertise or desire to run a bank, he said. &quot;The idea is to capture growth for their investment portfolio,&quot; Gokkent said. Funds and firms in the world&apos;s biggest oil-exporting region have been snapping up assets from Japan to Africa as their government-owners reap the windfall from a five-fold increase in crude prices since 2002. Gulf investors have spent more than $70bn on foreign acquisitions this year, twice as much as the record set in 2005, to reduce reliance on oil revenue. Increasingly Gulf buyers are running into resistance from governments wary of allowing foreigners to control assets they say could affect their economic interests and national security. Dubai&apos;s DP World relinquished control of U.S. ports after lawmakers threatened to block its 2006 acquisition of British rival P&amp;O on national security grounds. Dubai Aerospace Enterprises&apos; failed attempt to buy New Zealand&apos;s Auckland International Airport and Borse Dubai&apos;s offer to takeover Nordic exchange operator OMX encountered political opposition this year. The growing power of sovereign wealth funds is raising concerns in the West, with the Group of Seven industrial nations calling for greater scrutiny of their role this year. Still, the initial response to the Citi investment was different, even though it came from the largest and most secretive of these funds.U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, who opposed the DP World deal and raised questions about Borse Dubai&apos;s plans to swap stakes with Nasdaq Stock Market Inc, said ADIA was helping New York retain its status as the world&apos;s financial centre. The U.S. mortgage crisis could hold similar opportunities for investors from other emerging markets, especially China, which is still smarting from Washington&apos;s opposition in 2005 to CNOOC&apos;s bid for U.S. oil firm Unocal. &quot;Emerging economies have welcomed Chinese investors with open arms but acquisitions in developed markets have been more problematic for them so far,&quot; Flemming Nielsen, Asia economist at Danske Bank in Copenhagen.&quot;It may still be a problem but my guess is pricing and banks&apos; liquidity problems may make it more possible,&quot; he said.

The share buyback would have been even larger if we had not lost over \u00a3100m on Metronet.&quot; Metronet ran into trouble amid the spiralling cost of repairs to the lines it was modernising under the 30-year public-private partnership.

A PPP arbiter refused to allow \u00a3550m of extra interim funding and Metronet said it could no longer continue. Clarke said Atkins&apos;s involvement had &quot;not been a success&quot; but it did not mean that the government&apos;s whole PPP and private finance initiative was flawed. Atkins would be wary of taking smaller equity stakes in similar schemes but did not completely rule it out. The company said it still had 400 staff employed on Metronet work, compared with the 600 that had been involved when Atkins had a 20% equity stake in the business. Atkins reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a342.7m in the first half and revenues were up 11% to \u00a3633.8m on the back of strong consultancy work, particularly in the Middle East, where staff numbers have risen by a quarter in the past six months. Clarke said the company was well positioned to help businesses reduce their carbon footprints with strong demand for this kind of work in Dubai, where Atkins is helping design light railways and green skyscrapers.

But insiders say he will not last long, once a new government is elected and his army ties fade. They predict the general&apos;s final posting, following a trail into exile blazed by Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, will be duke of Knightsbridge or king of Dubai. Musharraf&apos;s decision to call an election on January 8, his imminent resignation as army chief, acquiescence in Sharif&apos;s weekend return, and gradual release of political prisoners have all helped put his pre-crisis plan back on track. Officials say he is now under intense American pressure to take the last, crucial step and lift the state of emergency, as demanded by US special envoy John Negroponte last week. Only an end to the emergency can give the coming elections necessary credibility (although few expect them to be entirely free from manipulation), they say. And only this will quell mounting alarm in Washington about the lack of political alternatives to Musharraf and semi-hysterical questions about who &quot;lost&quot; nuclear-armed Muslim Pakistan. Pakistani officials suggest a private understanding that the emergency will end soon explains why President George Bush spoke out so strongly in Musharraf&apos;s support after Negroponte departed. To derisive guffaws from Democrats, Bush said the general &quot;truly is somebody who believes in democracy&quot; and who &quot;hasn&apos;t crossed the line&quot;. But so far Bush is sticking to his hired gun. Despite personal hostility to Musharraf and long lists of preconditions, both Bhutto and Sharif are preparing to participate in the polls. Bhutto said on Sunday her Pakistan People&apos;s party would take part &quot;under protest&quot; because &quot;we don&apos;t want to leave the field open for our rivals&quot;. But other calculations are also in play. The Bhutto-Musharraf relationship has deteriorated sharply since her dramatic return to Karachi last month. Yet despite everything, the pre-crisis mutual agreement brokered by the US is still salvageable. &quot;Musharraf and Bhutto detest each other. They both think of themselves as saviours. Neither is good at sharing power,&quot; a senior official said. &quot;But this marriage was not made in heaven. It was made in Washington. Benazir does whatever the Americans tell her.&quot; Both leaders are pro-western and relatively secular and liberal in outlook, unlike the conservative Sharif with his strong ties to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan&apos;s religious parties. And again unlike Bhutto, Sharif is adamant he will not work with Musharraf, who he has never forgiven for deposing him in the 1999 military coup. The most likely immediate outcome was a coalition government led by Bhutto as prime minister, the official said, even though the chances of her working successfully with Musharraf as civilian president were poor in the longer term. &quot;Benazir will make a bid for greater power as PM. The dynamic will be with her. So there&apos;s going to be a big struggle.&quot; In prospect now is a return to Pakistan&apos;s so-called &quot;troika politics&quot; of the 1990s, when president, prime minister and military fought for the political upper hand, usually in alliances of two-against-one. This institutionalised power struggle, guaranteeing only instability and strife, was also cast as a battle between the &quot;three A&apos;s&quot; - &quot;America, the army, and Allah,&quot; not necessarily in that order. Musharraf&apos;s aim since first styling himself the nation&apos;s &quot;chief executive&quot; had been to lead Pakistan out of this self-destructive cycle, the senior official said. &quot;The problem is, he&apos;s paranoid now. He thinks everybody is out to get him - and he&apos;s right.&quot; Musharraf&apos;s legacy in foreign affairs, notably in improved relations with India and in growing the economy, was not inconsiderable, a former supporter said.

No sooner has the sun gone down than a long necklace of golden lights flickers on in the valley below and the improbable sound of an Islamic preacher can be heard calling the faithful to prayer. This Saudi Arabian desert is one of the most isolated places in the world but it is also home to a huge oil production plant and the 700 staff needed to run it. Hussain al-Obaid, a slightly greying petroleum engineer, has been watching the same &quot;son et lumiere&quot; since 1994 when his employer, the state-owned Saudi Aramco, started to pump oil out of the ground. &quot;I can think of no better place to work,&quot; he says and smiles. The Shaybah facility in the south-west corner of the country is not so much oilfield as gold mine. It pumps 500,000 barrels of high quality crude a day, each barrel currently worth not far off $100. That is $50m (\u00a324m) every 24 hours, all produced by al-Obaid and his other &quot;family&quot; members - as he calls his colleagues. They are already helping to drill more wells so they can crank output up to 750,000 barrels a day by the end of next year. If the planners back at headquarters in Dhahran get their way, Shaybah will eventually be producing 1m barrels a day of this top quality Arab crude.  The soaring oil price has meant Saudi export revenues have more than tripled over the past six years. They are expected to reach $165bn this year.  Upgrading this Empty Quarter facility is one of a number of schemes to raise Saudi output from 11m barrels a day, already 13% of the world&apos;s total and 30% of Opec&apos;s, to 12.5m by the end of 2009. The eventual target is 15m barrels a day. Foreign firms, including Shell, France&apos;s Total and China&apos;s Sinopec, have been given unprecedented access to explore for gas in the hope that new supplies will feed industrial production and help conserve the oil. Saudi Aramco has also signed joint ventures with Total and America&apos;s ConocoPhilips to establish refineries on the east and west coasts to boost exports of oil products.  The exact volume of crude that could be tapped in future is a matter of conjecture. Although the country claims to have 260bn barrels of reserves, many western sceptics feel these numbers are unreliable. They are often the same people who fear the world is past &quot;peak production&quot; and on its way to running out. Whether it is because the oil is going to run out soon or because it makes sense to diversify an economy that is based almost entirely on one commodity, the Saudi ruling family is spreading its spending around. Much of the country&apos;s oil windfall is going abroad, with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency investing more than $4bn a month mainly in government bonds issued by the G7 western nations. It owns $265bn of foreign debt. State-owned Saudi companies have also been flexing their muscles abroad this year. Saudi Basic Industries bought General Electric&apos;s plastics business for $11.6bn, Saad Investment Company took a 3% stake in HSBC bank for $6.6bn and Saudi Telecom bought a 25% stake in Malaysia&apos;s mobile phone group Maxis for $3bn. Enormous amounts of Saudi money are to be poured into six new &quot;economic cities&quot; dotted around the country, which will, crucially, create jobs.  Reliable statistics are hard to come by but external political commentators believe the jobless figure could be as high as 20%, potentially leaving the young Saudi jobless susceptible to extremist Islamist agitators. The largest construction project is King Abdullah Economic City, or KAEC, on the coast between the cities of Mecca and Jeddah, which is designed to cover 168 sq km, create 1m new jobs and become home to 2 million residents.  The scheme was envisaged to cost $26bn and take two decades to build. The government has decided to fast-track the project for 2016 and the latest projections for all six city schemes suggest the cost could reach $111bn, driven up by competition for raw materials from construction hotspots such as Dubai and China. The port alone at KAEC will cover 14 sq km and will be the fifth biggest container port in the world. The second of the six schemes is to be Knowledge Economic City in the Madinah area at a cost of $6.7bn and with a target to create 20,000 jobs. There will be an IT institute and a centre for Islamic studies, this being the birthplace of the prophet Muhammad.  A third development, the Prince Abdulaziz Mousaed Economic City in Hail, is to be the Gulf&apos;s biggest agricultural hub. These huge projects seem to echo the 1970s oil price boom, when the industrial cities of Jubail and Yanbu were created out of the desert and rich Arabs bought up swaths of Mayfair. Allegations in London court documents that the Saudi ambassador to Britain spent \u00a33m on an array of luxuries including two top-of-the-range Chevrolet 4x4s, a thermal night vision kit for his Hummer H2, dozens of designer watches and one takeaway meal costing almost \u00a3400 have also brought back memories of excess. The future of such spending depends on whether $100 oil is here to stay and whether Saudi Arabia really has those 260bn barrels of reserves.  Back in the shadows of the Shaybah evening, Al-Obaid is in no doubt there is oil and gas to be found: &quot;We have huge areas that have not been looked at.&quot;", "tags": ["Oil", "Business", "Saudi Arabia", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Boom fuels new Saudi spending spree", "sentences": ["The government has decided to fast-track the project for 2016 and the latest projections for all six city schemes suggest the cost could reach $111bn, driven up by competition for raw materials from construction hotspots such as Dubai and China."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/28/oil", "publicationDate": "2007-11-28T00:58:44Z"}, {"article": "While much attention has focused over the past decade on the rise of China and India as economic giants, much less is said about the Middle East. Until recently there are has been little need to, given that Arab economies are still woefully underdeveloped and heavily reliant on oil revenue. But the rise of Dubai as a centre of trade, finance and tourism may change all that. Will the Middle East follow, where Dubai leads? In many ways I would certainly hope so. The country is no paragon of democracy and human rights, but it is certainly more responsive to these issues than its neighbours as it is anxious to attract tourists. Even Britons, flocking there in increasing numbers, are impressed. Dubai is a city within an emirate of the same name, of which there are seven that constitute the United Arab Emirates. A week ago I arrived at the city for a short trip and two thoughts struck me after a while. First, that Dubai is run by Indians. Around 70-75% of Dubai&apos;s population is expatriate, of which most are South Asian and around half from India. From construction workers to doctors, lawyers, businessmen and CEOs of major corporations, Indians are represented in all walks of economic life. This is in sharp contrast to other parts of the Middle East, where South Asian workers are treated despicably. And, though strike action continues despite being outlawed, it usually pushes the government towards reconciliation rather than confrontation. Indeed, one (Indian) CEO I spoke to said such strikes were &quot;helping the authorities put things in perspective&quot; and laws were &quot;being streamlined with international [labour] laws.&quot; To that extent, Dubai shattered my misconception that Arabs treated Asians with little regard. The second thing I noticed was the smell of money and frenzied opulence that goes with it. Dubai is building its economy at a staggering rate, announcing project after project to make it a leader in, well, pretty much everything. There are mini-cities within Dubai dedicated to sports, media, healthcare, the internet, motors, festivals, exhibitions, flowers, aviation etc. The list is long and growing rapidly. While there, local developers announced the launch of Dubai Lifestyle City, which is planning to sell around 200 high-end residential properties worth nearly $700m. Such is the frenzied atmosphere around real estate that although construction has just started, around a third of the property has reportedly already been sold. They even flew in Maria Sharapova to attract publicity for the launch. The mind boggles. A report in the Guardian last year asked whether Dubai could become &quot;the most important place on the planet&quot;. This is an interesting question for several reasons. Economically, the city is miles ahead of its neighbours in the Gulf. The fact that it sucks in money, people, and talent from across the world, and especially from other parts of the Middle East, could mean that this economic and (relative) social freedom could end up being exported to carefully watching Arab states. While travelling I met Natasha, a former resident of Nottingham who moved there a few years ago to explore opportunities in real estate. She was frequently homesick and loved the vibe of London but said she had no plans to come back soon. I met Rupinder, a British Sikh businesswoman who had moved there with her husband a few years ago and she said she loved it. There weren&apos;t any of the Muslim fanatics she found in England, she said, because the ruling sheikh clamped down on them. Dubai&apos;s first Gurdwara was opening soon too. I know of other British Asian friends who have also moved there for work and see little need to come back. There is a limit to the freedom the city offers, of course. When General Pervez Musharraf recently declared martial law in Pakistan and shut down dissenting television channels, the popular station Geo TV started broadcasting over the internet from Dubai. A request from Musharraf soon forced it to shut down again. The political system still resembles more a monarchy than a democracy and political dissent is not easily tolerated. But Dubai&apos;s enthusiastic embrace of capitalism, which some find disconcerting, is exactly what the city and the Middle East needs as a whole. Developing a prominent and wealthy middle class is the surest path to greater transparency, secularisation of politics and intellectual development. The more Middle Eastern countries depend on tourism for income, as Dubai increasingly plans to, the more incentive they have to prevent religious fanaticism developing. It is investing huge amounts of money in education, technology and learning - all guaranteed to ensure a more politically aware population in the future. In a few years, Dubai will offer exactly what other consumers in the Middle East will want - a brand of capitalism infused with Arab sensibilities and culture. Hopefully they will then follow suit.

Banned play: Four hours before it was due to be staged at a festival in Doha the drama entitled Kholkhal was banned by the ministry of culture and media on the grounds that it did not represent the reality of the local youth.

The company insisted there was nothing contradictory about the moves, saying it had raised profits by 46% in the six months of the year to September 30. &quot;We lost all our investment in Metronet and took our punishment, but at the same time we have managed to develop our wider business successfully,&quot; said the chief executive, Keith Clarke. &quot;There is nothing inconsistent in all this. The share buyback would have been even larger if we had not lost over \u00a3100m on Metronet.&quot; Metronet ran into trouble amid the spiralling cost of repairs to the lines it was modernising under the 30-year public-private partnership. It had expected to spend \u00a317bn on upgrading nine lines but warned in June that there would be an overspend of at least \u00a32bn by 2010. A PPP arbiter refused to allow \u00a3550m of extra interim funding and Metronet said it could no longer continue. Clarke said Atkins&apos;s involvement had &quot;not been a success&quot; but it did not mean that the government&apos;s whole PPP and private finance initiative was flawed. Atkins would be wary of taking smaller equity stakes in similar schemes but did not completely rule it out. The company said it still had 400 staff employed on Metronet work, compared with the 600 that had been involved when Atkins had a 20% equity stake in the business. Atkins reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a342.7m in the first half and revenues were up 11% to \u00a3633.8m on the back of strong consultancy work, particularly in the Middle East, where staff numbers have risen by a quarter in the past six months. Clarke said the company was well positioned to help businesses reduce their carbon footprints with strong demand for this kind of work in Dubai, where Atkins is helping design light railways and green skyscrapers. He said there was much more urgency in some of the Gulf states than the UK commercial building sector. &quot;They want to deal with the issue now and they recognise that climate change is serious and not an add-on for design and construction.&quot;  Jarvis, another group hit hard by its involvement with PFI, reported a first-half loss of \u00a30.6m, \u00a3100,000 worse than in the same period of 2006.

The billionaire is not used to losing, but he got a bloody nose yesterday. In a surprise decision, Donald Trump&apos;s plan to build a \u00a31bn golf resort on a rare and vulnerable stretch of sand dunes on the coast north of Aberdeen was thrown out by councillors. After the project was voted through last week by the council&apos;s Formartine local area committee, yesterday&apos;s meeting of the council&apos;s infrastructure committee was seen as a formality. At the time, George Sorial, Trump&apos;s managing director for international development, had hailed that decision as vindication of the care and thought the Trump Organisation had given to the planning application. But last night, a bitterly disappointed Sorial told the Guardian that Trump was &quot;very shocked&quot; by the decision. &quot;It&apos;s not just a loss for us but for the people of Aberdeen and the shire. The members of the council&apos;s infrastructure committee have chosen to protect a pile of sand.&quot; Concerns over the proposed resort, which included two championship golf courses, a five-star hotel, a golf academy, nearly 1,000 holiday homes and 500 private houses, centred around the fact that part of it would be built on a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) containing sensitive sand dunes. Asked if he might move the golf course from the dunes, Sorial said: &quot;No. We&apos;re not that sort of developer. We have some of the largest residential buildings in the world. We think big.&quot; Sorial defended accusations the Trump team had been &quot;arrogant and patronising&quot; in its approach. &quot;There&apos;s a view we are arrogant. We are not arrogant. We set certain standards. It may be incomprehensible to smaller minds, but we have always set high standards. We presented them with a plan and hoped they could open their minds, but it was too much for them.&quot; Complaints to the council surged this year after a row erupted between the property developer and Michael Forbes, a fisherman who refused to sell his land despite spiralling offers of up to \u00a3373,000. During a press conference, Trump described Forbes&apos;s property as a &quot;disgrace&quot; which was in &quot;total disrepair&quot; and which had damaged his visionary scheme for an award-winning resort. Yesterday&apos;s ruling was close run, with a 7-7 deadlock after two and a half hours of heated debate, but the casting vote by the committee chairman, Martin Ford, ensured Trump&apos;s vision would have to be carried out elsewhere. Mickey Foote, of Sustainable Aberdeenshire, said: &quot;The council has been involved in a very lengthy and contentious debate over the economic benefits versus national heritage. They chose to protect the national heritage, which is what drove Mr Trump to the area in the first place. They have chosen not to indulge an over-ambitious property developer.&quot; Foote said that Trump, who conducted a three-year charm offensive among local business leaders and politicians, was the &quot;architect of his own downfall&quot; with his outspoken views on the locals. &quot;When you move into a neighbourhood, you should seek to get on with your neighbours. But he chose to ridicule the lifestyle of someone who was quietly getting on with his life. People around here don&apos;t like that.&quot; Forbes said: &quot;Hopefully, Trump has now got the message that we&apos;re not a bunch of cabbages up here. We&apos;ve managed fine without him up to now and we&apos;ll get on just as well without him.&quot;  The defeat will come as a blow to many in the business community who supported Trump&apos;s plans.

These days Keane is more interested in another nightclub or rather in how best to prevent his Sunderland players lingering over long in the Glass Spider. Billed as &quot;one of the hottest late bars in town&quot; and boasting &quot;drink prices to make your jaw drop&quot;, it has apparently proved a particular magnet for Anthony Stokes. Within an hour of the 19-year-old&apos;s last-minute winner consigning Paul Jewell to an undeserved defeat in his first game in charge of Derby County, Keane issued the gifted yet erratic Stokes with a thinly veiled warning. &quot;Stokes could be a top, top player in four or five years or he could be playing non-League,&quot; said Sunderland&apos;s manager. &quot;He&apos;ll go one way or the other, I&apos;m sure. The obvious pitfall for him is the Glass Spider. He&apos;s got to be careful, he&apos;s got to work extremely hard and he&apos;s got to listen to the staff here. Stokes has got potential but it&apos;s about producing and maintaining it. It&apos;s important that his family look after him. As his manager, I&apos;ve got a role to play but you can&apos;t follow the modern player 24 hours a day.&quot; The Dublin born, former Arsenal trainee is, like the whole team, a work in progress and Keane, who again introduced him as a second-half substitute, explained: &quot;You never know what you are going to get from Stokes; whether that&apos;s a good or a bad thing I don&apos;t know. He does things in training a lot of players can&apos;t do but unfortunately a lot of players are brilliant in training but don&apos;t do it in matches. Today he tried to take a shot from 45 yards out and I&apos;m scratching my head and thinking &apos;bloody hell&apos; but then he popped up with the winner.&quot; Hooked in at the second attempt after Stephen Bywater had made a double save from Kenwyne Jones then Stokes&apos;s initial effort, that goal, the scorer&apos;s first in the Premier League, not only lifted Sunderland out of the relegation zone but eased the pressure which had been building on Keane in the wake of the previous weekend&apos;s 7-1 thrashing at Everton. Tension had been manifested earlier in the technical area in some unusually agitated gesticulations from the Irishman, who had dropped his \u00a39m goalkeeper, Craig Gordon. Sunderland have been unlucky to lose on several occasions this season but their good fortune against a determined Derby must have had Jewell wondering if curtailing an extended holiday in Dubai in order to succeed Billy Davies at Pride Park was the brightest thing he has done. &quot;It was not a great game on a cold day, not a lot of football was played,&quot; he reflected, his golden suntan seeming somehow out of place in the December Wearside chill. After one Premiership win this season - at home to Newcastle - and having failed to score a single away League goal, Derby&apos;s self-esteem is not high and Jewell admitted: &quot;I&apos;ve taken over a group who&apos;ve got used to losing and I&apos;ve got to change that mentality.&quot; Darren Moore, who marked the awkward Jones impressively, feels that Derby&apos;s new manager is already making an impact. &quot;Paul Jewell instils belief in you,&quot; said the big central defender. &quot;His strength is self-belief, he&apos;s got an inner belief. He believes he&apos;s good enough to compete against all the other mangers at this level and he&apos;s instilling a win- ning spirit.&quot; Meanwhile Stokes - hitherto notorious for being dropped by Keane after missing the team bus en route to a game at Barnsley last season - says he is imbued with a newly professional attitude and pledged to celebrate his goal with &quot;a quiet night in&quot;.

Gillian Gibbons, 54, was released yesterday in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, and taken into the care of British embassy staff after her nine-day ordeal. She is expected to be greeted by her Merseyside family when she arrives in the UK this morning. She was sentenced to 15 days in prison after she allowed her class of seven-year-olds at Unity high school in Khartoum to name a teddy bear Muhammad as part of a class exercise. In a statement, Gibbons said she was &quot;fine&quot; and thanked those who had worked to win her release. She spent the afternoon relaxing with British embassy staff and the deputy ambassador, Hugh Evans, in Khartoum, before boarding a plane for Dubai. She spent most of the flight asleep, telling reporters: &quot;I just want to relax, I don&apos;t want to say any more. I&apos;m too tired.&quot; Yesterday morning as the pardon was issued on the veranda of the Sudanese president&apos;s palace, the mother of two&apos;s apology was issued. &quot;I have encountered nothing but kindness and generosity from the Sudanese people,&quot; she said. &quot;I have a great respect for the Islamic religion and would not knowingly offend anyone and I am sorry if I caused any distress. My class was delightful and were making wonderful progress with their studies. I will miss them terribly and I am very sad to think that they have been distressed by this event.&quot; According to Sudanese officials, it was her insistence that she had inadvertently caused offence which finally persuaded President Omar al-Bashir to release her in the face of public opposition. Others observed that the president had delayed the pardon for a few days to avoid angering his hardline Islamic constituency. Gibbons was locked up in Khartoum&apos;s women&apos;s prison, where the inmates - including murderers and drug dealers - are kept four to a cell. She had to be moved for her own safety after a 1,000-strong mob gathered to demand a tougher sentence, with some calling for her execution by firing squad. The decision to release her came after two days of intense lobbying in Khartoum by the Labour peer Lord Ahmed and Lady Warsi, the Conservative party spokeswoman on community cohesion, who flew to Khartoum on Friday after meetings at the Sudanese embassy in London. After a day of frustration on Sunday when the pair were unable to speak to Bashir and a &quot;hardline mood&quot; developed, they were finally granted a meeting yesterday morning at the presidential palace. News that the president had agreed to a pardon leaked out of the meeting at 11am, and then at 11.20am, a pair of heavy doors opened on to the presidential veranda. Ahmed and Warsi stepped out, flanked by Bashir&apos;s advisers on foreign and religious affairs. &quot;As British Muslim parliamentarians we feel proud we have been able to secure Gillian Gibbons&apos; release,&quot; said Ahmed. &quot;We hope that relations between the two countries are not damaged, in fact it should be a way to strengthen the ties.&quot; Warsi said: &quot;It seems as if we have been in Sudan an eternity. It is in fact only 48 hours.&quot; She described the outcome as &quot;timely and amicable&quot;. The teacher&apos;s son, John Gibbons, 25, said: &quot;Gordon Brown called me himself to give me the good news but we are obviously reserving our complete excitement until she is home.&quot; Embassy staff kept Gibbons&apos; location and travel plans secret yesterday for fear of a repeat of the angry scenes on Friday when a crowd took to Martyrs Square to protest at the leniency of the sentence. Shortly after the pardon was announced 40 members of a Sufi sect approached the ambassador&apos;s house chanting and carrying banners complaining that Gibbons should not have been released. They dispersed peacefully after handing in a petition. &quot;There is tension and this decision will not please some people,&quot; a government minister told the Guardian. &quot;It was definitely politically difficult here in Sudan. Although this pardon is a presidential prerogative, because of the rising feelings and tensions that have been generated, many Muslims will see it as unfair to them and that it might encourage others to do the same.&quot; However, the minister said the decision should improve relations with Britain which have been strained over Darfur and the country&apos;s past role in harbouring international terrorists. &quot;We are trying to take a new track and we call it constructive engagement,&quot; he said.

In a candid briefing before tomorrow night&apos;s home game against Arsenal, Newcastle&apos;s manager also admitted to having differences of opinion with some of his players but insisted he remains the right man finally to bring success to Tyneside. &quot;There&apos;s no point beating about the bush, I&apos;m under the cosh,&quot; said Allardyce, whose side have taken just one point from their past five games. &quot;You&apos;ve got to get results at a club like this, and sooner rather than later. We&apos;re having a bad time at the moment in terms of results but things can turn right as quickly as they&apos;ve got bad.&quot; There are rumours that defeat by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s side tomorrow might trigger his dismissal and Allardyce - whose team are then at home to Birmingham City on Saturday - appeared sanguine about the news that friends of Alan Shearer have suggested the former Newcastle and England captain would be willing to take over at St James&apos; Park. &quot;I know Alan Shearer reasonably well and he&apos;s always said he&apos;s not ready,&quot; said the former Bolton manager. &quot;If that&apos;s the case and somebody wants to employ him down the line, after me or whenever, that&apos;s life.&quot; Previous Newcastle managers have, at times, worked almost in Shearer&apos;s shadow and frequently had to contend with rumours that the local hero was destined to replace them but Allardyce is not fazed by that prospect. &quot;I don&apos;t particularly see that as a burden,&quot; he said. &quot;If you lose your job then someone is going to take it, whether it&apos;s Alan Shearer or whoever. If Alan decides to take my job I hope it will be when I&apos;ve decided I&apos;ve made this club successful and he&apos;ll be taking over a club that I&apos;ve improved significantly, rather like what happened with Sammy Lee and me at Bolton. But, if it&apos;s the other way, then you just have to live with it.&quot; Although Mike Ashley, Newcastle&apos;s owner, and Chris Mort, the chairman, are admirers of Shearer, Allardyce enjoys a decent relationship with both men. After Saturday&apos;s 3-1 defeat at Blackburn Rovers he was seen having an apparently friendly talk with Ashley. &quot;I saw Mike Ashley after Saturday&apos;s game and had a good chat with him,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope that shows the strength of the relationship we have.&quot; Only last month Mort insisted Newcastle would not act in the &quot;short term&quot; and defined short term as the period up to Christmas. The festive period is a bit of a sensitive subject at Newcastle right now as Allardyce&apos;s squad are underwhelmed about his proposed, but as yet unconfirmed, plan not to allow them to spend any time with their families after leaving Tyneside on Christmas Day before the Boxing Day game at Wigan until after their match with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on December 29. &quot;Players are not happy with a lot of the stuff I do,&quot; he said, having given a three-man deputation of Newcastle&apos;s senior professionals who challenged his methods after demanding a meeting with him last week short shrift, seemingly reminding them that they were paid to play and he was paid to manage. &quot;I&apos;m the bad &apos;un but I&apos;m the man who knows what is right for the club and I know it more than they do. That&apos;s why I&apos;m sitting in this chair. I know what&apos;s right to consistently get positive results. At the moment that&apos;s not working for several reasons we can&apos;t point to but you find out who are the men and who are the boys. &quot;It&apos;s easy to have good relationships and team spirit when you&apos;re winning but when it goes bad, you really find out what they&apos;re made of. When you start putting them on the right way forward sometimes the players don&apos;t like it but it&apos;s for the benefit of the team not for one or two individuals who don&apos;t like it. People don&apos;t like it when they&apos;re taken out of their comfort zones so you have to be persistent with them.&quot; Allardyce was encouraged by a much-improved performance during the defeat at Blackburn and stressed: &quot;Based on Saturday&apos;s performance the lads are determined to put it right as quickly as possible. They&apos;re under real, real pressure for the first time this season but they&apos;ve got to accept and overcome it.&quot; Although outwardly relaxed and still sporting a healthy tan from a recent break in Dubai, he admitted to being far from stress-free. &quot;I don&apos;t feel very good because the burden falls on me,&quot; he said. &quot;But I&apos;m old and wise enough not to let it affect my whole life. I&apos;ve just got to keep believing in doing things in what I know are the right ways to get results.&quot;", "tags": ["Sam Allardyce", "Football", "Sport", "Newcastle United"], "title": "Shearer bandwagon puts Allardyce 'under the cosh'", "sentences": ["They&apos;re under real, real pressure for the first time this season but they&apos;ve got to accept and overcome it.&quot; Although outwardly relaxed and still sporting a healthy tan from a recent break in Dubai, he admitted to being far from stress-free."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/dec/04/newsstory.newcastleunited1", "publicationDate": "2007-12-04T09:51:25Z"}, {"article": "THE GUARDIAN BBC1 unveils winter schedule.

One of the hostages identifies himself by his first name in the video clip and says: &quot;Today is November 18. I have been here now 173 days and I feel we&apos;ve been forgotten.&quot; He is flanked by two masked men brandishing assault rifles and in the background a banner with a sign reading &quot;the Islamic Shi&apos;ite Resistance in Iraq&quot; is visible.

The tape then promised to &quot;follow up with their confessions later&quot;. An official at al-Arabiya, a Saudi-owned satellite channel based in Dubai which first broadcast the clip, said staff had received an anonymous call giving the location where the tape could be found.

No matter what the cause, hostage-taking can never be justified. We again call on those holding the men to release them unconditionally.&quot; Four of those abducted were security workers for the Montreal-based firm GardaWorld; the fifth was an employee of BearingPoint, a management consulting firm based in Virginia. They were abducted in an apparently well-planned operation on May 29, in which around 40 heavily armed men stormed the finance ministry in Baghdad, where one of the men, a computing consultant, was training staff, guarded by the four security staff. They were last seen being driven towards Baghdad&apos;s sprawling Shia district, Sadr City. None of the hostages has since been identified, at the request of the Foreign Office, other than one of the security guards, who has been named by local media in south Wales. In a statement issued last September, the hostages&apos; families appealed for their release, saying: &quot;They are sons, fathers and brothers who were working to support us, their families. We appeal from our hearts to those who are holding our loved ones. &quot;These are not men with political views or any authority. They are ordinary family men who have parents, wives and children that love and cherish them - please send them home to us.&quot; General David Petraeus, the US commander in Iraq, has said that he believes the five are being held by a secret cell of the Mahdi army militia that was funded by Iran, but the Iranian government has denied this. The British government has been trying to negotiate their release through intermediaries. There have been reports that their abductors have demanded the release of a group of Iranians detained by American forces in Baghdad last January, but the Foreign Office has refused to comment upon this claim. There have also been claims that the men are being held to secure the release of Qais al-Khazaali, a former chief spokesman for the Mahdi army, who was held by American forces after a raid on a US base in which five solders were killed. Iraqi officials said last month that photographs of the hostages were provided some time ago to prove they were alive. There were also reports last month that the men had been allowed to videotape messages for their families which were then passed to Iraqi government officials.

The BHA now intends to take one more formal look at the site early in the new year when - &quot;depending on progress&quot; - February 24 2008 will be confirmed for the inaugural meeting at Britain&apos;s first new racecourse since 1920. Given the saga that has gone before, it is unlikely that many locals will be queueing up to buy an annual badge for Great Leighs before they have seen horses racing down the home straight with their own eyes. Yesterday&apos;s inspection, meanwhile, also coincided with the formal handing back of six more fixtures to the BHA, which were scheduled to take place between January 28 and February 21. Nonetheless, as many punters find racing diaries from their bookmakers dropping through the letterbox, there is growing optimism that the long series of fixtures scheduled for Great Leighs next year will not prove nearly so redundant as it did in 2007. &quot;Our inspectorate made a formal visit today,&quot; Will Lambe, of the BHA, said yesterday, &quot;and the amount of progress that has been made on the site is very encouraging. The weighing-room complex in particular is now looking very impressive. &quot;Another informal visit has now been scheduled for December 20, with the next formal visit following on January 4. If the current rate of progress at the site can be maintained, it is feasible that on that date, we will be able to agree a formal start date of February 24, which is a Sunday afternoon.&quot; It can also be seen as positive that the February 24 fixture might also have been taken back by the BHA yesterday, but that would have given the track a probable start date of February 28, which is scheduled to be run under floodlights. &quot;The fixtures that have been handed back will be subject to the standard re-auctioning process,&quot; Lambe said. &quot;If and when February is confirmed, there will be a period during which the track will be put through all the necessary testing. This is an entirely new racecourse, so it was not felt that it would be suitable to stage a first meeting under floodlights too. Kempton put down a new all-weather track, but the personnel there already had plenty of experience of running a meeting. With a new site and all the logistics involved, it was felt that an afternoon fixture would be preferable.&quot; The British Horseracing Board - as it was then - first gave its approval for the new track at Great Leighs in June 2003, so the first meeting there will complete a near five-year process. Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s vast and spectacular new development at Meydan in Dubai, by contrast, is expected to be built in little more than two. Rather like the new Wembley stadium, though, which was also dogged by many delays, the operators of Great Leighs will hope that all the waiting will be forgotten when its regular programme finally begins. It will be the first track in Britain designed specifically for all-weather racing, as opposed to previous courses that have been put in around existing turf facilities. It may not be the future of British racing, but Great Leighs intends to be a definite step forward. That step may now be little more than two months away. Ron Cox&apos;s tip of the day Royal Embrace 6.20 Kempton Lightly raced this year with only four outings, Royal Embrace is fancied to follow up his course and distance victory five weeks ago. This four-year-old showed a nice turn of foot that day to seal matters and was unlucky not to score again over the extended mile at Wolverhampton last time when blocked in his run.

Kane will lead a team of 70 journalists on Emirates Business 24-7, a daily tabloid that launches on Sunday with a print run of 60,000.     Kane: targeting affluent audience. Photograph: Catherine Shaw    The new English-language paper is the reincarnation of Emirates Today, a tabloid launched two-and-a-half years ago by the Dubai-based Arab Media Group. Kane - who was appointed director of business media at AMG earlier this year - hopes to reach an under-served business audience across the United Arab Emirates, the federation of seven wealthy, oil-rich states that includes Dubai and Abu Dhabi. &quot;The target audience is English-reading, affluent, aspirational people involved in business here,&quot; he said.  &quot;That&apos;s a huge market - and it&apos;s not a British expat product. The Asian community and Arab community read English - English is the international language.&quot; In his new job, Kane will report to the paper&apos;s editor-in-chief, Riyad Mickdady. Last year, following his departure from the Observer after five years, Kane was involved with former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil in an ill-fated attempt to launch a daily business paper in Dubai.  The project had to be abandoned because the UAE&apos;s government refused to grant publishing company ITP a licence for the paper, which was to be called the Arabian Business Standard. There will be no such problem for Emirates Business 24-7. The paper has inherited Emirates Today&apos;s licence, and the Arab Media Group is a subsidiary of Dubai Holdings, a conglomerate owned by Dubai&apos;s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum. Emirates Business 24-7 will sit alongside AMG&apos;s two Arabic-language newspapers, eight radio stations and two TV channels. The newspaper - which will be a 48-page tabloid, with plans to expand to 56 pages - will cost 2 dirhams (30p) and will be accompanied by a website, emiratesbusiness24-7.com. Along the lines of the Financial Times, it will cover regional and international news from a business perspective, before detailed coverage of companies and markets in the Middle East.  Emirates Business 24-7 will be published seven days a week, with more lifestyle-oriented editions at the weekend. Although there are no plans to expand the title beyond the UAE, if successful the model could be rolled out to other Middle Eastern countries such as Kuwait and Qatar. The booming UAE market is already being targeted by western newspaper groups. The Financial Times distributes its European edition there, an international version of the Times is also on sale, while the Wall Street Journal circulates a digitised edition.

The bank admitted yesterday that its profits were being dented by three factors - one of which is the $46m write-down caused by its investment in a sophisticated debt product known as a structured investment vehicle (SIV). Although its shares are listed in London and it is based in the capital, Standard Chartered generates its profits outside the UK, largely in emerging markets. While other London-listed banks have been knocked by the US sub-prime mortgage crisis, it has been largely unaffected. Richard Meddings, finance director, said: &quot;We are having an excellent year. It&apos;s a tale of two worlds. When we travel to Hong Kong, Shanghai, Dubai or Beijing the world feels a very different place from where we are sitting in London or New York.&quot; More usually regarded as a bet on risky emerging markets, Standard Chartered&apos;s shares are up on the year, against the 20% slump experienced by the rest of the banking sector, where confidence has been knocked by the near-collapse of Northern Rock. Standard Chartered&apos;s shares rose 46p to \u00a318.93 yesterday, although some analysts questioned the bank&apos;s ability to control costs. In a trading update, the bank said it was &quot;broadly comfortable&quot; with analysts&apos; forecasts for 2007 pre-tax operating profits of about $3.96bn, up from $3.18bn in 2006. Asian markets are yet to feel the chill caused by the sub-prime crisis but Meddings admitted a recession in the US could quickly spread to Asia. The impact on Standard Chartered so far is largely indirect. Its SIV, Whistlejacket, has fallen in value to $10.8bn from $18.2bn since the credit markets seized up in August. SIVs borrow short-term money and then invest it in longer term assets. The downturn in the debt markets means it can no longer borrow money on the same terms as in the past but is still sitting on assets.  Its rival bank HSBC admitted last month to problems with its SIVs and put $45bn of assets once held by the vehicles on to its own balance sheet. Standard Chartered has taken a slightly different approach and regards the $46m write-down as &quot;temporary&quot;. Meddings said income would be generated back to the group over the next three and a half years but that it also expected to take another hit, of a similar size, before the end of the year, when it takes more of its assets on to its books. The assets are largely loans issued to other major financial institutions although 5% are in risky CDOs - the collateralised debt obligations often created to hold sub-prime mortgages at the heart of the current market crisis. Another factor affecting Standard Chartered&apos;s 2007 profits is its operations in Korea, where it has conducted a number of securitisations of mortgages. Accounting policies mean that the bank will need to take a hit to income of $133m even though the deals are economically profitable. The third factor hitting profits is the delay in the sale of its Indian asset management business to UBS, which means $120m will not be included in this year&apos;s figures. The City is scrutinising trading statements from the major banks for evidence of the market turmoil&apos;s impact. Today the Royal Bank of Scotland is to update investors and could admit to a \u00a31.5bn-\u00a32bn write-off of sub-prime losses. Lloyds TSB and HBOS statements are due next week. Bank shares recovered some of the losses suffered on Tuesday when the Financial Services Authority warned the sector that conditions were likely to get worse. The regulator also acknowledged that market conditions may never return to those enjoyed before August.

A typical family now pays an average of \u00a3186,032 to raise a child from birth to the age of 21 - which amounts to \u00a38,859 a year, \u00a3738 a month or \u00a324.30 a day - according to the UK&apos;s largest friendly society, Liverpool Victoria.  Childcare remains by far the largest cost faced by parents, with the average family spending \u00a350,538 on childminders, nursery care, nannies and after-school clubs through their son or daughter&apos;s formative years. But education comes a close second, accounting for a further \u00a347,310 - even assuming a state education at primary and secondary school - covering the cost of uniform and other clothing, school lunches, books and extras such as school trips. It also includes the tuition fees for a typical three-year university degree course and the associated living expenses of being away from home. A private education would hugely inflate that figure.  Childcare charities called on the government to be more generous with its childcare subsidy.  Alison Garnham, joint chief executive of the Daycare Trust, said: &quot;Parents in Britain pay through the nose for childcare and can pay over \u00a37,000 a year for a nursery place - an expense second only to the mortgage. We need to follow the example of some of our European neighbours who typically pay a lower proportion of childcare costs as there is more public funding available to help families.&quot;  Nigel Snell, communications director at Liverpool Victoria, said: &quot;As a parent of three, I know from experience that sacrifices have to be made in the early years, and many parents will have had to put some plans on hold to manage the costs associated with raising a family.&quot; The group found that the expenses associated with having children had increased by 33% since it began the research in 2003, and forecast that costs could rise by a further 42% between now and 2012 to an average of \u00a3265,577 - more than \u00a312,500 a year for each child. New parents can expect to shell out as much as \u00a38,184 in the first year of their baby&apos;s life, once they have paid for nursery equipment, toys and clothing.  The costs are much higher in central London, where families typically pay \u00a3199,860 a child, and are cheapest in Wales, at \u00a3179,317 a child. Those who choose to educate their child privately face an additional bill of \u00a372,957 for a day pupil and \u00a3130,557 for a boarder. Overall the group estimated the total cost of raising all the children born in the UK during 2006 at \u00a3140bn, excluding inflation.  A spokesman for the Department for Children, Schools and Families said: &quot;What parents spend their money on in terms of their children is a matter of personal choice but as far as childcare is concerned, we pay for twelve and a half hours a week for every three- and four-year-old, which will rise to 15 hours by 2010.&quot; What \u00a3186k buys Property A detached bungalow within the rural community of Melvaig on the west coast of the Scottish Highlands; a one-bed flat in luxury 82-floor Dubai Marina development  Motor1925 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost Hooper Sports Tourer in excellent condition (\u00a3185,000) Boat A 12-metre six-berth Sunseeker Portofino motorboat Art/book A first edition of Carl Linnaeus&apos;s 1735 masterpiece, Systema Naturae (\u00a3180,500); Galileo&apos;s Sidereus Nuncius, published in 1610 (\u00a3180,000) BusinessAn established painting and decorating business in Scotland with high net profits (\u00a3190,000); a public house in Penzance, Cornwall", "tags": ["Family finances", "Childcare", "Children", "Society", "Money"], "title": "Lifetime cost of bringing up child \u00a3186,000 - and rising", "sentences": ["A spokesman for the Department for Children, Schools and Families said: &quot;What parents spend their money on in terms of their children is a matter of personal choice but as far as childcare is concerned, we pay for twelve and a half hours a week for every three- and four-year-old, which will rise to 15 hours by 2010.&quot; What \u00a3186k buys Property A detached bungalow within the rural community of Melvaig on the west coast of the Scottish Highlands; a one-bed flat in luxury 82-floor Dubai Marina development  Motor1925 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost Hooper Sports Tourer in excellent condition (\u00a3185,000) Boat A 12-metre six-berth Sunseeker Portofino motorboat Art/book A first edition of Carl Linnaeus&apos;s 1735 masterpiece, Systema Naturae (\u00a3180,500); Galileo&apos;s Sidereus Nuncius, published in 1610 (\u00a3180,000) BusinessAn established painting and decorating business in Scotland with high net profits (\u00a3190,000); a public house in Penzance, Cornwall"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/dec/07/parenting", "publicationDate": "2007-12-07T08:54:54Z"}, {"article": "Berlin has announced it is planning to build a giant ferris wheel, becoming the latest in a spate of cities keen to define their power, status and prosperity with a grandiose amusement ride. The German capital is preparing to erect Europe&apos;s largest wheel with a height of 185 metres at a cost of slightly over \u00a385m, creating what Berlin&apos;s mayor, Klaus Wowereit, has insisted will become &quot;the city&apos;s trademark&quot;. Forget the Brandenburg Gate, the remnants of the Berlin Wall, Norman Foster&apos;s glass-dome topped Reichstag building or the imposing socialist-era television tower. It is, city officials hope, the 6,500 ton steel wheel which will help put Berlin - a city still struggling to shake off its Cold War yoke and realise its regained status as a capital - on the map. Concerns of animal experts that the lights of the wheel will disturb the sleeping patterns of nearby Berlin zoo&apos;s rhinoceros community, or of the Greens, who fear it will shift the city centre&apos;s focus too far westwards, have fallen on deaf ears. Made up of 36 gondolas, the wheel will take 1,500 people on a 35-minute round trip high above the rooftops of Berlin and is expected to attract two million visitors a year when it opens in the autumn of 2009. Berlin&apos;s project shows the extent to which the ferris wheel has rediscovered its place in the imagination as the new status symbol of cities across the globe. The frenzy is not dissimilar to that sparked by Pennsylvania bridge engineer George Ferris&apos;s 80 metre wheel, built for the World Exhibition of Chicago in 1893, which triggered a spate of copycat constructions, generally planned under the premise that bigger must mean better. The Great Berlin Wheel will be 50 metres higher than the London Eye, built in 1999, and will even tower over China&apos;s impressive Star of Nanchang by 25 metres. But despite German hopes that Berlin would boast the biggest wheel in the world, it faces the humiliating prospect of being dwarfed by a parallel project in Beijing, a 208 metre construction set to be ready in time for next year&apos;s Olympics. Other big wheel projects are planned or currently being built in six Chinese cities, as well as Singapore, Dubai, Mumbai, Moscow and Orlando. Berlin&apos;s project was inspired by the London Eye, which was originally built to stand for just five years but has become one of the city&apos;s leading tourist attractions. In an age in which speed, technology and sophistication are increasingly revered, the old fashioned metal wheel that does little more than turn slowly has done well to keep its place. &quot;The wheel is the perfect symbol for the 21st century,&quot; Gereon Asmuth wrote in a commentary for the German daily newspaper, Taz, in praise of the Berlin project. &quot;It is completely superficial ... a luxury, symbolising nothing and at the same time, embodying the very intoxication of being momentarily raised above this nothingness.&quot;", "tags": ["World news", "Germany", "Europe"], "title": "Berlin follows London Eye with plans for giant ferris wheel", "sentences": ["Other big wheel projects are planned or currently being built in six Chinese cities, as well as Singapore, Dubai, Mumbai, Moscow and Orlando."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/07/germany.kateconnolly", "publicationDate": "2007-12-07T13:07:54Z"}, {"article": "Taking stock of my life, I am somewhat surprised  By what I have achieved in what is a short time Sub specie aeternitatis By the age of forty-five I was a millionaire Twice over and now at sixty-five Here I am, an ordinary Dublin man, With my own five-bedroom apartment in Dubai As a bolt-hole from my Edwardian mansion in Dublin.

This, give or take, is the dollar amount he will earn out of the Emirates for designing his first golf course there. And then there is a bit on top, at least three million, for turning up each year to play in the Desert Classic even if the desert bit is now somewhat overwhelmed by the Manhattan-lookalike skyline that frames much of the course. Significantly, he has confirmed that although his 2008 schedule is still a work in progress - as is Dubai - he will again be in the Middle East when this tournament is staged at the beginning of February. &apos;I always enjoy visiting Dubai,&apos; he has reportedly said. &apos;It&apos;s an extremely hospitable place.&apos; No question about that if your name is Tiger. No, the really intriguing question is whether he will also pitch up in 2009 when the first Dubai World Championship (although this title may have to change) takes place, with \u00a310million on offer but available only to card-carrying European Tour players (which is why it may have to change). A quick trawl around the higher echelons of the European scene over the past few days revealed the usual shedload of ifs, buts and maybes. Nobody of any significance, however, was prepared to rule it out. What indeed is likely to decide things is the decision-making players&apos; committee when they meet early next year. High on their agenda will be a review of the number of official European events a player must turn up to in order to remain a member. At present this is an easy-peasy 11. Easy because for the big boys in the top 50 of the world rankings seven of these are taken care of by the four majors and the existing three World Golf Championship events. Cherry-picking the other four from a 50-week season is hardly a chore. If it stayed at 11 then Woods would have to find only three more European events. This would not present an insurmountable problem, especially as the season-ending extravaganza in Dubai would in itself count as one of them. Throw in, say, the Tour&apos;s flagship PGA Championship at Wentworth plus the Deutsche Bank Players&apos; Championship - Woods has a commercial tie-in here - and the special one would be all but home and dry. Except that the word in the clubhouse is that the players&apos; committee seem likely to want to hoist the requirement to a minimum of 13. Their reasoning is sound enough. Stung, among other things, by the fact that Justin Rose won the 2007 Order of Merit by playing in only five events outside the Big Seven, a core group of European stalwarts feel the Tour is being short-changed. This harder-nosed attitude is understandable and has several sympathetic ears within the European headquarters. The conundrum, however, is that if they raise the minimum qualification to 13 then Woods is almost certain to turn away from the prospect of becoming a European Tour golfer as well as an American one. Unless someone - say, for argument&apos;s sake, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum - laid a friendly hand on Tiger&apos;s shoulder and suggested it really would be very nice to have him in town that week. We shall see. Just as we shall see how the newly forged relationship between the European Tour and Dubai&apos;s biggest property developers helps them grow into a genuine alternative to the US circuit that entices so many stars to concentrate on the dollar rather than the euro simply because until now there have been a lot more dollars. The Dubai dosh that will begin to flow into the Tour&apos;s war chest over the next five years is estimated to be \u00a3100m with a further \u00a3150m available if a follow-on five-year option is taken up. This is serious money by their standards and on top of a promised new international office based in the Emirates it is clear that a tectonic shift of emphasis is occurring and almost everything is heading east. It is logical to suppose that only the very best European tournaments will survive in this new world and that only a smaller elite group of players will be able to play a European circuit global in all but name. The rest presumably will have to try to fight their way up via an enhanced second-tier circuit that concentrates on this continent. What, if they consider it at all, the players&apos; committee make of this will be interesting. As ever, the rich are about to get richer. Will this include Tiger? The smart money would suggest there really is every chance. When the US Tour chief, Tim Finchem, and his gang came up with their big Fedex Cup idea they knew they would be leaving themselves exposed over the last three months of the year. They knew also that Finchem&apos;s European oppo, George O&apos;Grady, just might try to capitalise on this gap in their calendar.

She remembers, too, the distinctive clattering sound each time a guard would doze off in the midday heat, relax his grip and let his machine gun fall to the tiled floor. She can recall the dirt, the sweat, the heat and, through it all, the sheer sense of terror and incomprehension. &apos;It&apos;s hard to describe really, quite what it&apos;s like. I was just terrified, absolutely terrified.&apos; Until last week Gillian Gibbons was an ordinary schoolteacher from Liverpool; a 54-year-old mother of two whose closest brush with the law had been a parking ticket 20 years ago. But when, in August, she took up a job teaching primary school children in Sudan, she set in motion an extraordinary chain of events. Within months she became the focus of hatred for a machete-wielding mob demanding her execution, while government officials pursued high-level diplomatic negotiations to secure her release from jail. Her crime? To call a teddy bear Mohammed. It would, perhaps, be easy to dismiss the whole episode as an absurd mis-understanding, an overblown skirmish soon to be rewritten as a series of banal jokes, circulated by email between bored office-workers. But for Gibbons, incarcerated for eight days in a filthy Khartoum cell with no idea when, or if, she would ever be released, it was no laughing matter. &apos;You start imagining all sorts,&apos; she says. &apos;You start imagining that maybe some of the guards will come in and teach the blaspheming white woman a lesson.&apos; Asked if she was referring to the fear of being raped she said, &apos; Yes, but I had no justification for thinking that. I was never mistreated.&apos; The naming of a stuffed toy by a classroom of six-year-olds seemed an unlikely tinderbox for an explosion of religious extremism. In October the bear was named Mohammed in a vote taken by Gibbons&apos;s class of 23 pupils at Unity High School in Khartoum. Sharia law, introduced in Sudan in 1991, states that any physical depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous. And yet for two months, no one complained - not a single child, parent or the Muslim classroom assistant, Dahlia. &apos;For the children it wasn&apos;t an animal, it was a member of the class,&apos; says Gibbons. &apos;To encourage them to write, I thought it would be really nice if the bear could have a diary and could go home with the children at the weekend. But the parents had to ask, so they&apos;d write and say &quot;Can we borrow Mohammed?&quot;, and they&apos;re Muslim parents, so you can imagine that I had no idea at all that I&apos;d done something wrong because none of the parents said anything. That&apos;s why I didn&apos;t twig, you see.&apos; It was personal animosity that was to prove Gibbons&apos;s undoing. Two months after the bear had been named, Sara Khawad, a school secretary who by her own admission bore a grudge against the headteacher, complained to the authorities. &apos;I was used by the secretary to get at the school,&apos; Gibbons says. &apos;Otherwise I think I would have been let off with a quiet reprimand. I wouldn&apos;t want to offend anybody. It was just a complete misunderstanding, a mistake.&apos; The school&apos;s director, Robert Boulos, called Gibbons into his office. He accepted her immediate apology and her explanation that it had not been deliberate. But the situation had already acquired its own unstoppable momentum. Soon someone tipped off the Ministry of Education, then the police were informed and the school quickly shut down for fear of reprisal. Gibbons, caught up in circumstantial quicksands, was arrested on the morning of 25 November by five armed guards and driven to a nearby police station in a truck with blacked-out windows. &apos;I had nothing at all,&apos; she says. &apos;I was wearing a long blue skirt and a blouse and I took a wrap with me to cover my arms.&apos; After several hours of interrogation, Gibbons was locked up with no explanation, unable to understand the guards&apos; rapid-fire Arabic. &apos;I&apos;d only had three Arabic lessons and we hadn&apos;t got to the bit about &quot;What to do if you&apos;re arrested&quot;,&apos; she says. The open-air cell had three grey-tiled walls, a basic squat toilet in a corner and steel bars running across the facade and ceiling. &apos;I just stood there for three hours, thinking I was going home. It was filthy, there were ants all over the floor and in the corner there were rat droppings. There was a light shining into my yard that attracted all the mosquitoes, so I stood there and got bitten to death. &apos;It started to get dark about 6.30 and it got quite cold and all I had was my wrap, I didn&apos;t even have a handbag because I only thought I was going for an hour.&apos; At eight in the evening, a guard brought her some cheese-and-tomato sandwiches left for her by staff at the school. &apos;Nobody actually came to tell me that I wasn&apos;t going home, so I just guessed at that point. I was panicking and I was crying. I didn&apos;t actually sleep all night. I was so distressed, so uncomfortable and so cold, that at four in the morning I just paced round and round trying to keep warm. It felt like this was happening to someone else. It was just mad, just surreal.&apos; Gillian Gibbons makes an unlikely felon. A gentle, quietly spoken woman, she is dressed in a baggy black jacket and sensible flat shoes. Her dark brown hair, normally a mass of uncontrollable curls, has been straightened for the occasion and hangs lankly below her ears. Born in Sheffield, she still speaks in a slight Yorkshire accent, with the slow, precise diction of someone accustomed to communicating with children. When, last year, her 32-year marriage broke down and her much-loved older brother Stephen died from pancreatic cancer, she started to re-evaluate her life as a deputy headteacher at Dovecot Primary School in Liverpool. &apos;It suddenly dawned on me that I could go anywhere and do anything.&apos; She applied to an agency that placed English teachers in foreign schools and was offered a position in Khartoum. Her two children - John, 25, and Jessica, 27 - were both living independent lives. With nothing to hold her back, Gibbons gave up her job in July and flew to Sudan the following week to take up a post teaching the English curriculum in Unity High School, a fee-paying institution in Khartoum that caters for a mixture of Christian and Muslim middle-class families. Gibbons was given free accommodation in a school apartment and paid around \u00a3450 a month. &apos;People have this image of Sudan, and yes, there is a lot of famine in Africa, a lot of war, but Khartoum is a city just like Liverpool. It&apos;s dirty, it&apos;s smelly, it&apos;s a mess, but it&apos;s a wonderful place. It&apos;s exciting. It&apos;s like being in a Michael Palin film. I had a Bradt travel book and I looked on the internet [before going]. I did know a little bit about the Muslim faith because I used to teach it,&apos; she says, freely admitting that she has never read the Koran. &apos;When I got there I realised it was the best thing I&apos;d ever done and I was so happy. I&apos;d made some really good friends, I was just settling down, I&apos;d decorated my room, I&apos;d bought some things from the market and hung them on the wall and it was feeling very homely, and then suddenly...&apos; She trails off and looks blankly out of the window into the grey Liverpool drizzle. &apos;My head can&apos;t cope with it at all - how we got from a teddy bear named Mohammed to people saying they should send the SAS in to rescue me.&apos; After five days&apos; incarceration, with regular visits from Russell Phillips, the British consul, Gibbons was put on trial at the Khartoum North Criminal Court on 29 November. &apos;I went into court and I saw one of the parents of one of my children and she was smiling at me and people don&apos;t understand how much something like that means to you when you&apos;re in such a desperate state because I was terrified.&apos; Gibbons was allowed to make a brief statement through an interpreter. &apos;I admitted what I&apos;d done. I told them I was really sorry, I tried to convince them I hadn&apos;t meant it. How can a book full of smiling, happy faces, of a photograph of a bear at a birthday party with all the candles, how could anyone construe that as being intentionally insulting?&apos; At times, Gibbons found herself both terrified by her situation and simultaneously bemused by its absurdity. In a moment of almost farcical surreality, the teddy bear itself made a courtroom appearance. &apos;This clerk of the court got this carrier bag and produced this bear with a flourish, like a rabbit out of the hat,&apos; Gibbons recalls. &apos;He put it down on the table in front of us and it flopped over, and the prosecution [lawyer] sat him up. And then he pointed at this bear in a dead aggressive manner and he said &quot;Is this the bear?&quot; It was Exhibit A, you see. You could almost see the bear shivering, as if he was on trial as well, still in his little school shirt, sitting there looking terrified. It made me laugh, but it wasn&apos;t funny, you know what I mean?&apos; After 10 hours of deliberation and witness statements, the judge, Mohammed Youssef, sentenced her to 15 days in jail. Gibbons was taken back to her cell by guards. It was, she says, her lowest point. &apos;I wouldn&apos;t speak to any of the guards. I wouldn&apos;t even look at them because I was just in shock. I just felt that I&apos;d been run over by 10 juggernauts. &apos;Sometimes the guards would come in and say &quot;Why are you crying?&quot;, and there were some moments in that week where I would actually find that really funny, because it was the most ridiculous question you could ask. &quot;Well, I&apos;ve lost my job, I&apos;ve lost my home, there&apos;s a baying mob outside wanting to kill me, I&apos;m in prison and I&apos;m going to get deported and you ask me why I&apos;m crying&quot;? &apos; But with the arrival at the beginning of December of two British Muslim peers, Lord Ahmed and Baroness Warsi, to negotiate for her release, Gibbons&apos;s treatment gradually improved and she was even given a bed for her last two nights in jail. &apos;And a loo with a seat!&apos; she adds. &apos;It&apos;s amazing how luxurious a proper loo with a seat can be.&apos; She was never subjected to the harsh regimes of Omdurman women&apos;s prison. For her own safety she was moved to three different holding cells in various police stations around the city. Slowly, the negotiations continued around her. After eight long days in captivity, the British consul came to tell her she had been pardoned by the Sudanese President, Omar al-Bashir. She was told that a TV press conference confirming her release would be given at 11am. The guards agreed to switch on a television set in an adjoining room but, with maddening timing, the electricity suddenly cut out just before it was due to air. &apos;Then there was a phone call from my headteacher [to the consul], but she didn&apos;t know I didn&apos;t know, she was just saying &quot;Isn&apos;t it wonderful?&quot; We were elated.&apos; Gibbons was driven to the airport, where she boarded a plane to Dubai with the peers who had secured her release. In the plush surroundings of the first-class cabin, she ate a meal of lobster tails and potatoes, toasting her release with a vodka and orange. &apos;I&apos;m not a drinker but I felt obliged to have an alcoholic drink even though I was with Lord Ahmed and Baroness Warsi, who are Muslims. I was a bit embarrassed about it, but I thought I&apos;d earned that vodka.&apos; At Dubai she was transferred to another plane, touching down at Heathrow airport at 7am last Tuesday. Her children met her as she came through the arrivals lounge. &apos;My daughter burst into tears and we had lots of hugs.

I had a wonderful time. It was fabulous.&apos; Does she blame anyone for what she went through? She pauses. &apos;I blame myself because I shouldn&apos;t have done it,&apos; she says finally. &apos;Ignorance of the law is no defence.&apos;", "tags": ["UK news", "World news", "Sudan", "Education", "Freedom of speech", "Africa"], "title": "Interview: Gillian Gibbons on her eight days of fear in a Sudan cell", "sentences": ["&apos;Then there was a phone call from my headteacher [to the consul], but she didn&apos;t know I didn&apos;t know, she was just saying &quot;Isn&apos;t it wonderful?&quot; We were elated.&apos; Gibbons was driven to the airport, where she boarded a plane to Dubai with the peers who had secured her release.", "I was a bit embarrassed about it, but I thought I&apos;d earned that vodka.&apos; At Dubai she was transferred to another plane, touching down at Heathrow airport at 7am last Tuesday."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/09/world.schoolsworldwide", "publicationDate": "2007-12-09T09:05:17Z"}, {"article": "After a year that began with a bomb in the Israeli resort of Eilat, saw increased tensions with Iran and internal turmoil in Lebanon, Britain&apos;s tour operators have come up with a surprising suggestion to be 2008&apos;s hottest destination - the Middle East. Cox and Kings says bookings to Egypt and Jordan have risen by 200 per cent compared with last year, while Black Tomato has seen a 65 per cent surge in bookings to Syria. Upmarket tour company Audley says it was surprised by the &apos;huge&apos; response to its new trips to Iran, and, despite the kidnapped Royal Navy sailors fiasco, Explore has seen sales of its trips to the country grow by 38 per cent.  &apos;Ironically, all the recent problems in the Middle East have actually made people more aware of the region, and rather than putting them off, they have become fascinated,&apos; said Tom Barber, founding director of Original Travel, whose most popular destination is now Oman. &apos;We see it kind of spreading out - people started in Dubai, then they looked over and got interested in Oman, then Jordan, then Syria, and so on.&apos; Others put the surge in interest down to the blockbuster Tutankhamun exhibition in London and the unveiling of the pharoah&apos;s mummified body at the Valley of the Kings. &apos;Without a doubt these things have fired people&apos;s interest and they come away wanting to see the places for themselves,&apos; said Jim Millward, marketing manager at Audley.  Demand is also being driven by the swathe of luxury hotels opening in the region for the first time. In February, for example, the latest property in the Six Senses Hideaway portfolio opens at Zighy Bay in northern Oman&apos;s remote Musandam Peninsula. Guests will choose whether to arrive by speedboat, a 4x4 trip through the Hajar Mountains, or as a passenger in a paraglider. In August, Gordon Campbell Gray, founder of the iconic London boutique hotel One Aldwych, and of Carlisle Bay in Antigua, will open his new hotel, Le Gray, in Lebanon. Rejecting offers to open hotels in New York, Paris or Rome, Gray chose the Solidere district of Beirut for his new property, which will boast 85 rooms, a piano bar and a roof-top swimming pool. &apos;I never wavered about continuing with the project, even when the bombs were dropping,&apos; he says. &apos;Beirut oozes glitz and glamour.&apos; Alongside the Musandam Peninsula, which Original Travel predicts will be &apos;enormous&apos; in 2008, Syria is emerging as the most fashionable Middle Eastern destination. It was branded a &apos;rogue state&apos; by the US as recently as 2002, but travellers are now attracted by its boutique hotels, history and desert scenery, many flying into Aleppo and out of Damascus on new British Midland flights.  &apos;Damascus is becoming a huge destination,&apos; said Tom Marchant, managing director of Black Tomato. &apos;The feedback we&apos;re getting is that people are seeing it as a less discovered, more authentic alternative to Marrakesh.&apos;", "tags": ["Travel", "Middle East holidays", "Syria holidays", "Oman holidays", "Jordan holidays"], "title": "What will be the hottest destination for 2008?", "sentences": ["&apos;We see it kind of spreading out - people started in Dubai, then they looked over and got interested in Oman, then Jordan, then Syria, and so on.&apos; Others put the surge in interest down to the blockbuster Tutankhamun exhibition in London and the unveiling of the pharoah&apos;s mummified body at the Valley of the Kings."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/dec/09/middleeast", "publicationDate": "2007-12-09T16:31:47Z"}, {"article": "Tom Enders, the normally unflappable chief executive of troubled European aerospace giant Airbus, was getting exasperated. At the company&apos;s headquarters outside Toulouse in October, he was hosting a glitzy ceremony to celebrate the long-delayed delivery of the first superjumbo Airbus, the A380. But the assembled media circus was far more interested in the chronic financial turbulence at Airbus - and in the investigation into alleged insider trading at its loss-making parent EADS - than the new plane on the tarmac outside. &apos;Ask me about all that tomorrow,&apos; he said perched uncomfortably on a stool, microphone in hand. &apos;Today is the day we want to celebrate. Have a look around - is it spoiling the party?&apos; Today, the thought of celebrating is the last thing on the minds of Airbus management and its 57,000 workers, with about 10,000 in the UK. On Friday morning, Enders, EADS boss Louis Gallois and other senior executives gathered for a sombre board meeting in Amsterdam. While the rain lashed down outside, they debated the proposed sale of nine plants in Europe, including the wing-component manufacturing facility at Filton, near Bristol, which employs about 4,000 people. Part of the Power8 restructuring plan announced in February, these sales will save \u20ac2.1bn annually and cut 10,000 jobs by 2010. But also on the agenda were ideas to make even deeper, more painful cuts than those originally planned. EADS said last month that as a result of the weakening dollar, an extra \u20ac1bn in annual savings would have to be found. Analysts say that the UK wing-assembly plant in Broughton, North Wales, which employs 6,000 people, could be next on the block. Tom Williams, executive vice president for programmes and former head of Airbus in the UK, refused to rule out the possibility it could be sold or closed down. &apos;There are no guarantees,&apos; he told The Observer. &apos;No one has any God-given right to any particular work share or programme of work in the future. We are in the situation where we are looking at everything.&apos; He said this could include cutting R&amp;D spending or aircraft development programmes. &apos;Is there anything we should do which is more radical?&apos; he added. &apos;Are there some programmes we can&apos;t afford to do?&apos; The euro&apos;s strength against the dollar is taking a massive bite out of Airbus&apos;s profits. Airbus&apos;s costs are largely in euros. And like oil, the planes it sells are priced in the greenback. Airbus says that every 10 per cent rise in the euro against the dollar costs it more than \u20ac1bn in operating profits. Two years ago, the euro was worth around $1.20. On Friday it closed at almost $1.47, yet Power8&apos;s cost-cutting plans were based on an anticipated euro exchange rate of $1.35. To add insult to injury, US-based Boeing&apos;s costs are all in dollars, giving Airbus&apos;s arch-rival a crucial advantage in an already cut-throat industry. In recent days, the howls of pain from EADS executives have become louder. Analysts say this is one way of softening up workers for more cuts. Enders has said that the weakening dollar is &apos;life-threatening&apos; for Airbus. &apos;It has gone beyond the pain barrier,&apos; he added last month. Last weekend it was the turn of Gallois. The EADS chief executive, who had previously labelled the sickly dollar as &apos;unbearable&apos;, said it posed an &apos;existential&apos; threat to the company. Williams, who was born in Glasgow, speaks more plainly. &apos;It&apos;s a bloody battle,&apos; he said. Last year Airbus made pre-tax losses of \u20ac572m. But this can&apos;t all be attributed to a weakening dollar. Its superjumbo is two years late, costing it an estimated \u20ac6.8bn in late delivery penalties and lost sales. There are also delays over its A400M military transport plane and countless redesigns of its wide-body version of the mid-range A350 jet have put its delivery further behind that of Boeing&apos;s rival 787 Dreamliner. Airbus is moving more production overseas and into dollar-denominated areas such as China, and possibly the US, Japan and Russia. But this isn&apos;t just to limit currency costs. Its assembly plant in China which will open by 2009 is part of a joint venture which Airbus hopes will help it sell more planes to Chinese airlines, a huge growth market. Manufacturing costs in China are also lower than in Europe. As John Scholle, aviation analyst from Global Insight, said: &apos;The weak dollar is a big problem for Airbus. But expansion outside of Europe is probably going to happen anyway to cut costs.&apos; Williams admitted currency factors are not the only consideration for Airbus. &apos;We need to be strategic. We need to think &quot;How do we do business in these countries? and how can we be local there?&quot;&apos; He added that the push overseas must not be driven by currency concerns alone: &apos;It&apos;s a bit like kids playing football - they all rush off in one direction onto one side of the field. We mustn&apos;t do something that three or four years later we wish we came to another conclusion.&apos; British defence company BAE Systems sold its stake in EADS last year. About 40 per cent of the company&apos;s shares are listed, with about half of the remainder owned by the French government and German state and private banks. Russian bank VTB, a Spanish state holding company and Dubai-based investors own the rest. German and French ministers have a history of powerful lobbying against job cuts in their own countries. Scholle from Global Insight said this makes the UK&apos;s highly efficient Broughton plant more vulnerable: &apos;Airbus becomes a point of national pride for French and German governments and it&apos;s a source of jobs, so there&apos;s always the potential for politicians to meddle. The UK government has less influence over the company.&apos; Williams insisted that secretary of state for business, John Hutton, and other ministers regularly lobby Enders and Gallois: &apos;I don&apos;t think it makes a big difference. There is no lack of pressure.&apos;  Airbus is the result of a 40-year-old vision for European aerospace firms to collaborate, largely to compete against US firms including Boeing. But globalisation means the world is much bigger than the US and Europe. Markets such as China are emerging. Howard Wheeldon, from BGC Partners, said: &apos;What we are seeing through the momentum of dollar collapse and the devastating effect that it is having on EADS probably marks the end of the great European dream for Airbus. Of course, it doesn&apos;t mean the end of Airbus - far from it. But as Boeing has already done, it requires Airbus to become a truly global company.&apos; And in the long run, that could spell bad news for Broughton, soon to be the UK&apos;s remaining Airbus plant.", "tags": ["Business", "Airline industry", "EADS", "Airbus"], "title": "Please fasten your seatbelts, Airbus is in for a bumpy ride", "sentences": ["Russian bank VTB, a Spanish state holding company and Dubai-based investors own the rest."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/09/theairlineindustry1", "publicationDate": "2007-12-09T23:33:57Z"}, {"article": "The cinema at the Grand Abu Dhabi Mall, in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, offers a choice of eight films. Six of them are Hollywood blockbusters such as Ridley Scott&apos;s American Gangster. The city&apos;s large Indian expatriate community may be tempted to see a Bollywood musical called Aaja Nachle. The only Arab-language film showing is Khiyana Mashrooa, a crime thriller out of Cairo. None of these films can be said to reflect the sensibilities of the UAE. That&apos;s because the UAE has no indigenous film culture to speak of. That is about to change. In 2004, Hani Al-Shaibani&apos;s Dream was the first major feature film to come out of the Emirates. The story, in which frustrated writers, actors and directors head outside the city to make a film about themselves before losing themselves within it, serves as a metaphor for the difficulties facing the country. The endeavour, however, is advancing at a remarkable speed. Started in 2004, and launching its fourth event today, the Dubai International Film Festival has already become one of the most prestigious film festivals in the Arab world. Just 75 miles down the coast, Abu Dhabi inaugurated its own fest in October, the Middle East International Film Festival. Dubai and Abu Dhabi are vying to become cinema hubs of the Middle East. Both, in recent years, have attracted big US productions: Syriana (2005), shot on location in Dubai, and this year&apos;s The Kingdom, starring Jamie Foxx, in which Abu Dhabi stood in for Riyadh. Both are now luring American media giants to help jump start their own industries. Every week appears to bring new announcements of eye-popping investments coming from the oil-rich Emirates. But few have been as comprehensive as an alliance made in September between Abu Dhabi and Warner Brothers to co-produce both Hollywood and local films. Dubai has followed suit. Tecom Investments, controlled by the emirate&apos;s ruler Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, is signing deals for co-productions with Paramount Pictures, a theme park with Universal Studios, and local versions of MTV and Comedy Central. And while Abu Dhabi maps out its own &apos;media zone&apos; - complete with post-production facilities and sound stages sponsored in part by Warner, and a film school partnered with New York Film Academy - Dubai has already begun construction on Dubai Studio City, including, yes, a film school. These developments have been welcomed by budding film-makers. Nayla Al Khaja, 29, is at the forefront of Emirati film pioneers, having overcome a lack of funding - as well as traditional gender roles - to finance her own projects. &apos;Infrastructure is not ready,&apos; she says. &apos;There&apos;s an awareness... That&apos;s what&apos;s really happening.&apos; Al Khaja went to film school abroad, in Toronto, on a UAE government grant. &apos;But they also warned me: &quot;When you come back you won&apos;t find a job.&quot; Yet she is one of the only film-makers in the Emirates to make a successful living, which she has done by producing promotional videos for Dubai&apos;s corporate world and redirecting the profits into her own films. Over the past decade, Dubai, with its dwindling oil reserves, has been spending lavishly to rebrand itself as an international pleasure destination, attracting attention with such projects as the $3.5bn Palm Islands. Although Abu Dhabi has diversified into tourism as well, its oil reserves have given it a cushion to grow in a controlled manner. The city has attracted the first outpost of Paris&apos;s Louvre museum, as well as another branch of the Guggenheim. Abu Dhabi has announced the creation of an English-language newspaper, and there are plans to build a new foreign campus of New York University, with a focus on film and the arts, by 2010. &apos;All we&apos;re doing is putting elements into the capital city that other capital cities take for granted,&apos; says Ron Barrott, chief executive of Aldar, the publicly owned developer involved on almost every front of Abu Dhabi&apos;s dizzying growth, including the deal with Warner. At the heart of the arrangement is the creation of two $500m funds, financed jointly by Warner and the newly formed Abu Dhabi Media Company, to produce movies and video games. Warner will also aid in the construction of film studios and multiplex cinemas as well as a themed hotel and amusement park. Veteran producer Hunt Lowry will head the new film company. &apos;It&apos;s a very exciting place,&apos; he says of the emirate. &apos;It&apos;s the fastest growing country in the world. It&apos;s neat.&apos; Lowry originally approached Abu Dhabi to raise money for a new film fund after his last venture, Gaylord Films, wound down, but soon saw the region&apos;s potential. Backed by Abu Dhabi cash, Lowry&apos;s company will produce &apos;mutually agreed upon, broad-based&apos; English-language Hollywood fare. The first film to be developed through the company, a teen comedy called You Wish about a genie trying to fit in at a high school, is set to start production soon. The only proviso is that the movies must be able to play in Abu Dhabi, which has stipulations against scenes of overt nudity or drug use. &apos;That makes it very easy for me,&apos; says Lowry. &apos;Those are not themes that are attractive to me either.&apos; The Persian Gulf has long been host to pan-Arab media. But until recently, its cinematic voice was virtually non-existent. In the past few years, however, as oil and gas prices have soared, several countries on the Arabian peninsula have begun to invest heavily in film, with Oman, Qatar and Bahrain each producing their first feature-length movies, and Kuwait financing a series of controversial documentaries. Last year, Saudi Arabia came out with its first two feature films - Abdullah Moheisin&apos;s Shadow of Silence and Izzadore Mussalem&apos;s How Are Things? - despite a 30-year-old ban on cinemas in the Islamic kingdom. (Some are now reportedly under construction.) &apos;It&apos;s early days yet,&apos; says Ali Jafaar, of the Hollywood trade paper Variety, &apos;and [Gulf directors] are nowhere near challenging the established film-makers in Egypt, Lebanon or Palestine in terms of cultural impact and international exposure, but it does point towards a potentially exciting future.&apos; Apart from a few notable exceptions, such as the Algerian war epic Days of Glory (2006) or this year&apos;s Caramel, a heart-warming chick flick out of Jordan, Arab movies rarely travel outside the Middle East. But they are finding wider audiences today through a growing circuit of festivals, from the well-established competitions in Cairo and Marrakech to events in Haifa, Beirut, Antalya, Damascus and even war-ravaged Baghdad. In its four-year history, the Dubai International Film Festival has been accused of focusing more on celebrity photo ops than celebrating local artists. This year, the DIFF has scheduled a much higher number of Arab and world films. The challenge facing the UAE&apos;s fledgling film industry is to attract foreign resources while emphasising the promotion of indigenous voices. Abu Dhabi&apos;s Middle East International Film Festival (MEIFF) has been surprisingly successful in meeting that challenge, lining up a slate of Oscar contenders - including Paul Haggis&apos;s Iraq war drama In the Valley of Elah - and gathering an impressive group of film-makers, agents and studio executives to discuss the investment opportunities of Abu Dhabi in a Film Financing Circle hosted by Harvey Weinstein, while Haggis was invited to teach a master class in screenwriting. On the other hand, the festival paid special attention to local film-makers, offering a wide range of grants and cash prizes, and showcasing the work of Arab women directors. It is something of a paradox that the UAE is relying on Hollywood know-how to establish its own cinematic voice, given the way in which the Middle East is depicted in American movies. US studios will have released no fewer than eight major films about the conflicts in the region between last summer and next. The Kingdom is currently the most popular film in Saudi Arabia, despite only being available on pirated DVDs. &apos;We [all] know how Arabs are portrayed through the media,&apos; says Ali Mostafa, a 26-year-old Dubai-based director. &apos;These are huge misconceptions. There are a minority of people who are doing these [terrorist] acts. At least we have a chance by this medium to tell our story, our side.&apos; Mostafa is trying to raise an unprecedented $10m-$15m for his first feature, a story of cross-culturalism in Dubai. Nevertheless, film-making in the UAE remains a daunting enterprise, one undertaken almost exclusively by young talent. Mustafa Abbas, 22, is also in pre-production with a feature-length crime thriller he wrote called Gun. Abbas has found Emirati investors unwilling to devote money to an industry they know very little about. &apos;It will definitely change,&apos; he says. &apos;We just need one or two movies to properly release so people can see that OK, this can work.&apos; For Nayla al Khaja, a central obstacle is the lack of good screenwriting. &apos;Forget about the [Hollywood] writers&apos; strike,&apos; she says, &apos;we don&apos;t have writers.&apos; And freedom of expression is another issue. &apos;For me that&apos;s the struggle,&apos; says Al Khaja. &apos;When I&apos;m writing, I&apos;m always thinking of red lights. I can just see them saying, &quot;No, this is not allowed.&quot;&apos; (Three female winners at last year&apos;s Emirates Film Competition were unable to pick up their prizes because the ceremony took place after a curfew imposed on them by their own families.) Political issues manifest themselves in other ways. Dubai was set to host Ridley Scott&apos;s latest project, Body of Lies. But after the UAE&apos;s National Media Council got skittish over the al-Qaeda subject matter, production moved to Morocco. At this year&apos;s MEIFF, meanwhile, The Band&apos;s Visit, an acclaimed Israeli film, was dropped from the festival&apos;s line-up - allegedly under pressure from an actor&apos;s union in Egypt, which continues to boycott the country&apos;s films. Warner&apos;s Richard Fox says: &apos;If you&apos;re talking about the C word, censorship, we have to deal with that whether we&apos;re in China [or] any country there&apos;s a level of censorship. In that region, you could say almost that the UAE is the most progressive.&apos; Though the Warner Brothers/Abu Dhabi deal has yet to produce a local, Arab-language film, Fox is optimistic. &apos;I think we have a shot - some of these films, they&apos;ll definitely go to Cannes.&apos; &apos;We&apos;re trying to catch up,&apos; says Ali Mostafa of the speed with which this page seems to be turning in the Gulf&apos;s history. &apos;We have an amazing culture, and a lot of issues that we could really share with the rest of the world.&apos;", "tags": ["Film", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Culture"], "title": "Julian Sancton on the Arab film industry", "sentences": ["Started in 2004, and launching its fourth event today, the Dubai International Film Festival has already become one of the most prestigious film festivals in the Arab world.", "Dubai and Abu Dhabi are vying to become cinema hubs of the Middle East.", "Both, in recent years, have attracted big US productions: Syriana (2005), shot on location in Dubai, and this year&apos;s The Kingdom, starring Jamie Foxx, in which Abu Dhabi stood in for Riyadh.", "Dubai has followed suit.", "And while Abu Dhabi maps out its own &apos;media zone&apos; - complete with post-production facilities and sound stages sponsored in part by Warner, and a film school partnered with New York Film Academy - Dubai has already begun construction on Dubai Studio City, including, yes, a film school.", "&apos;But they also warned me: &quot;When you come back you won&apos;t find a job.&quot; Yet she is one of the only film-makers in the Emirates to make a successful living, which she has done by producing promotional videos for Dubai&apos;s corporate world and redirecting the profits into her own films.", "Over the past decade, Dubai, with its dwindling oil reserves, has been spending lavishly to rebrand itself as an international pleasure destination, attracting attention with such projects as the $3.5bn Palm Islands.", "In its four-year history, the Dubai International Film Festival has been accused of focusing more on celebrity photo ops than celebrating local artists.", "&apos;We [all] know how Arabs are portrayed through the media,&apos; says Ali Mostafa, a 26-year-old Dubai-based director.", "At least we have a chance by this medium to tell our story, our side.&apos; Mostafa is trying to raise an unprecedented $10m-$15m for his first feature, a story of cross-culturalism in Dubai.", "Dubai was set to host Ridley Scott&apos;s latest project, Body of Lies."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/09/features.israelandthepalestinians", "publicationDate": "2007-12-09T23:45:00Z"}, {"article": "A huge exhalation of collective disappointment rolled down from the towering stands of Sha Tin racecourse and drifted out onto the South China Sea. The single word &quot;Overruled&quot; had appeared on the massive screen opposite, and Viva Pataca, the local hero so rabidly supported by the 51,000-strong crowd, had definitely been beaten by Frankie Dettori on Ramonti in the Hong Kong Cup, the richest race on a hugely valuable card here yesterday. Less than 20 minutes earlier, Mick Kinane and Viva Pataca had narrowly failed to peg back the Godolphin five-year-old, sent on by a frenetic Dettori early in the straight, for the \u00a3750,000 first prize. But then came the ding-dong chime indicating a stewards&apos; enquiry and objection. Dettori and Kinane disappeared into the stewards&apos; room. Minute after minute ticked by, and the nearest to quiet you&apos;ll ever experience at a Hong Kong racetrack descended - only to be shattered by that communal groan. Ramonti was winning a Group One race for the fourth time this year, following victories chiselled out in the St James&apos;s Palace Stakes, Sussex Stakes and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. No surprise, then, that Dettori named him &quot;one of the bravest horses I&apos;ve ever ridden&quot;. The Hong Kong Cup was his first win over 10 furlongs, and he now seems the natural Godolphin flag-bearer for the Dubai World Cup in March. Godolphin, formally representing the United Arab Emirates rather than its summer home in Britain, missed out on a sensational double by the width of a noodle when Creachadoir was pipped by Good Ba Ba, trained in Hong Kong by Andreas Schutz, after a thrombotic finish to the Mile. But the Dubai operation&apos;s big rival Coolmore had a dire afternoon, with Excellent Art never firing in the Mile, and King George and Arc hero Dylan Thomas putting in such a flat effort when seventh in the Vase that jockey Johnny Murtagh summed up the performance with a distinctly unpoetic &quot;No gas!&quot; The Vase went to Champion Stakes third Doctor Dino, ridden by Olivier Peslier and trained at Chantilly by English-born Richard Gibson, who declared: &quot;Running in events like this are the reason one gets up in the morning.&quot; Dettori and Red Rocks finished ninth. Aidan O&apos;Brien reported that Dylan Thomas had been &quot;way overweight&quot; after his stay in quarantine during his abortive trip to the Japan Cup - &quot;as big as a bull&quot; - and it had simply been impossible to prepare him properly for the race. Dylan Thomas now retires to stud, with his trainer calling him &quot;the best horse we&apos;ve ever had&quot;. In the Hong Kong Sprint, Sacred Kingdom powered home under Gerald Moss\u00e9 to proclaim himself the natural successor to the now-retired Silent Witness, the most popular horse in Hong Kong racing history. Britain&apos;s challengers, Desert Lord and Benbaun, came ninth and last, respectively. So Hong Kong versus the Rest of the World ended in an honourable score-draw, but that was little comfort to the hordes of Viva Pataca supporters who made their idol one of the shortest-priced favourites in the decade of this bonanza of international racing.

Phillip Inman Investors train sights on &apos;undervalued&apos; Rank Rank, the casino and bingo operator in which the Malaysian casino group Genting has built up a 9.4% stake, will update shareholders on trading this week amid further stakebuilding in the company. Richardsons Capital, a property and haulage business, was reported yesterday to have been investing on value grounds. Lee Richardson, a director of the company, told the Sunday Times: &quot;The assets of the company are undervalued. Rank has 45 casino licences - those licences are no longer being dished out like candy so they are a valuable commodity.&quot; Rank declined to comment.

The German capital is preparing to erect Europe&apos;s largest ferris wheel with a height of 185 metres (607ft) - 50 metres greater than the London Eye - and at a cost of \u20ac120m (\u00a387m). Berlin&apos;s mayor, Klaus Wowereit, has insisted it will become &quot;the city&apos;s trademark&quot;. It is, say experts, the 6,500-tonne steel wheel which will help Berlin - a city still struggling to shake off its cold war yoke - realise its status as a capital. Concerns of animal experts that the lights of the wheel will disturb the sleeping patterns of nearby Berlin zoo&apos;s rhinoceroses, or of the Greens who fear it will shift the city centre&apos;s focus too far westwards, have fallen on closed ears. Containing 36 gondolas the wheel will take up to 1,500 people on a 35-minute round trip over the rooftops of the city and is expected to attract two million visitors a year when it opens in 2009. The project demonstrates the extent to which the ferris wheel has firmly rediscovered its place in the imagination as the must-have status symbol of cities across the globe. The current frenzy is not dissimilar to that experienced when the first big wheel (80 metres) - was built by Pennsylvania bridge engineer George Ferris for the World&apos;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. This triggered a spate of copycat constructions. The Great Berlin Wheel will even lord it over China&apos;s impressive Star of Nanchang by 25 metres. But despite German hopes that Berlin would boast the biggest wheel in the world, it faces the rather humbling prospect: the Great Beijing Wheel. The 208 metre-high structure is to be unveiled in time for next year&apos;s Olympics. Other big wheel projects are planned or are being built in six Chinese cities, as well as Singapore, Dubai, Mumbai, Moscow and Orlando. Berlin&apos;s project was inspired by the London Eye, the future of which is unclear. Although built to stand for just five years, it has now been turning for eight, attracting four million visitors a year. In an age in which speed, technology and sophistication are revered, not to mention the fears about the environmental impact and the high cost of steel, the wheel has done well to keep its place. &quot;The wheel is the perfect symbol for the 21st century,&quot; Gereon Asmuth wrote in a commentary for Berlin&apos;s TAZ newspaper. &quot;It is completely superficial ... a luxury, symbolising nothing and at the same time, embodying the very intoxication of being momentarily raised above this nothingness.&quot; When it comes to the big wheel, size and speed are not everything. The modest 65-metre, slow-moving, 110-year-old Riesenrad in Vienna&apos;s Prater amusement park remains the most famous in the world thanks to the 1949 film, The Third Man, in which it is immortalised as the revolving stage at the foot of which Orson Welles&apos; character, Harry Lime, makes his cynical proclamation about culture, democracy and cuckoo clocks.", "tags": ["World news", "Germany", "Architecture", "Art", "Travel", "Berlin holidays", "Culture", "Art and design", "Cultural trips", "Europe"], "title": "Berlin plans wheel to take crown from London Eye", "sentences": ["Other big wheel projects are planned or are being built in six Chinese cities, as well as Singapore, Dubai, Mumbai, Moscow and Orlando."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/10/germany.artnews", "publicationDate": "2007-12-10T10:16:18Z"}, {"article": "CNN has increased its news-gathering operations in the United Arab Emirates by opening a bureau in Abu Dhabi&apos;s media zone and expanding its presence in Dubai.

The planned PlayStation network, which will eventually make content available not only to consoles but on other Sony devices, including mobile phones, will put the firm &quot;directly in the firing line&quot; of Apple and Microsoft, he told a group of reporters.  &quot;We&apos;ve some catching up to do, but at least we have the opportunity to connect the PS3 with the PlayStation Portable and beyond.&quot; After a year spent in the shadow of Nintendo&apos;s rival Wii console, Sony has cause for seasonal cheer as the gaming industry prepares for the most lucrative sales period of the year. Last month, the PS3 outsold the Wii in Japan for the first time. Sony sold 183,217 PS3s in November, while Nintendo sold 159,193 Wii machines, according to the market researcher Enterbrain. &quot;I&apos;m glad that the last few weeks have generated excitement about PlayStation 3,&quot; Stringer said. Everyone&apos;s stopped talking about it the way they were six months ago. &quot;I&apos;m happy that the Wii seems to be running a bit short of hardware ... the PlayStation 3 will come into its own because its [high-end games] are infinitely more fun and demanding and exciting. &quot;The question people quite rightly asked was if the PS3 was going to get through this early cycle ... I feel much more confident about that now.&quot; He said Sony remained on course to achieve an operating margin of 5% \u2013 earnings of 5 cents from operations for every dollar in sales \u2013 by the end of next March. So far the US sub-prime mortgage woes had not affected consumer electronics sales, he said. Sony is expecting its operating profit to increase six-fold this year on the back of healthy sales of digital cameras and flat-panel TVs.  It has successfully floated its financial arm as part of Stringer&apos;s vision of a streamlined electronics and entertainment powerhouse, and earlier this month received a &quot;substantial&quot; sum from a Dubai investment fund.  Stringer said Sony would start selling its new range of organic ultra-thin TVs in the US next year. The PS3 initially took the sheen off the other gains made under the Welsh-born CEO&apos;s reign, when it was launched a year ago. The console arrived late after production glitches and received a lukewarm reception from gamers, who deemed it too expensive and short on software.  Some commentators wrote off the PS3, with its powerful Cell chip and high-definition Blu-ray DVD format, as a reckless indulgence that could deal Sony its second &quot;shock&quot; following the 2003 meltdown in its share price. But with the recent rise in sales and new games on the horizon, analysts agree that Sony has turned a corner.  &quot;Things do look a lot better than they did 12 months ago,&quot; said Hiroshi Kamide of KBC Securities. &quot;My feeling is that they will continue to have a better time of it, but there is still a mountain to climb.&quot; Standing atop that mountain is Nintendo&apos;s Wii, which has racked up astonishing sales since its launch a year ago and opened up gaming to a vast new customer base. In the Wii, technophobes, their parents and grandparents have found a console that is fun, easy to use and affordable. In Japan, Sony responded by cutting the price of the 20GB PS3 by about 10%.  But it still has some catching up to do. Nintendo, which had shipped 13.2m Wii consoles by October, expects the total to rise to 17.5m units by the end of March. Sony, by contrast, had sold 5.6m PS3s worldwide as of the end of September, behind Microsoft, which has sold 13.4m Xbox 360 consoles since its launch two years ago. The shifting profile of the typical gamer appears to favour Nintendo, which is expecting to profit from seasonal overindulgence with its Wii Fit, a home fitness game featuring a &quot;balance board&quot; that can sense players&apos; movements, allowing them to &quot;head&quot; footballs, tackle a ski jump and perform yoga and aerobics. Yet it is clear that Sony has the bit between its teeth. Games such as Pro-Evolution Soccer and Dynasty Warriors are driving renewed demand for the PS3, with new titles such as Metal Gear Solid 4 and Future: Tools of Destruction, and another installment of the hugely popular Final Fantasy series, waiting in the wings. In Britain, the firm is hoping to cash in on the &quot;Clarkson effect&quot; with the upcoming Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, which will allow players to download episodes of Top Gear through the PS3&apos;s online network, as well as take a virtual drive around the test circuit used in the show. Kamide, however, says it is too soon to talk of a Sony renaissance as long as the Wii continues to captivate new and inexperienced gamers. &quot;It has its faults \u2013 it&apos;s technologically inferior to the PS3 \u2013 but it offers something the others can&apos;t,&quot; he said. &quot;If you are the kind of person who plays once in a while, the bells and whistles that come with a PS3 don&apos;t mean much. It is a more powerful version of its predecessor, but in terms of games there&apos;s nothing really new. People do want Sony to do well, but it&apos;s not a case of flicking a switch and setting off a dramatic comeback.&quot; Inevitably, all eyes are on the crucial US market, where sales of the PS3 have improved dramatically since the Thanksgiving holidays, following a $100 price cut and the launch of a low-end model. Stringer recently conceded that Sony had taken a battering because of the PS3, but described the recent boost in sales as a turning point. &quot;It&apos;s the breakthrough we&apos;ve been anticipating,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ve been holding our breath.&quot; With the Christmas shopping frenzy about to reach its peak, it may be the turn of Sony&apos;s rivals to hold theirs.", "tags": ["Business", "Sony", "Nintendo"], "title": "Sony hits back in console battle with Nintendo", "sentences": ["It has successfully floated its financial arm as part of Stringer&apos;s vision of a streamlined electronics and entertainment powerhouse, and earlier this month received a &quot;substantial&quot; sum from a Dubai investment fund."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/11/sony.nintendo", "publicationDate": "2007-12-11T14:19:29Z"}, {"article": "&apos;I could have bought four of these with what I made selling my semi in London,&quot; says Jim Parton, midway through a tour of the 50-room stately home he bought earlier this year in Piotrowice Nyskie, a tiny Polish village near the Czech border. Only five of the unheated rooms are currently even halfway habitable for Jim, his Polish wife Anna and their daughters Jozefina, two, and Henryka, one. There is a basic kitchen with a woodburning stove, a toilet, shower room, bedroom and living room, where Jozefina is camping out in a tent until there is time to buy her a bed. Anna, 33, is pregnant again, this time with twins, and it is not yet clear who will sleep where when they arrive in March. Not that any of this fazes 48-year-old Jim, the kind of charmingly ramshackle character who, when you see a gigantic crack in the bell tower of his mansion and gently ask why he didn&apos;t get a survey done before buying the dilapidated property, says with a grin: &quot;Because that would be no fun!&quot; Jim&apos;s chutzpah may be unusual, but his recent decision to swap life in the UK for an adventure in Poland is not. According to official figures from the British embassy in Warsaw, around 2,500 Britons are currently living and working in Poland, but officials say the real figure is probably much higher - many incomers don&apos;t bother registering with the authorities when they arrive. And anecdotal evidence suggests there has been a huge surge of Brits moving to Poland over the past year or two. &quot;Just look at how many bars, restaurants and cafes in Warsaw are stuffed with expats,&quot; says Mike Judge, a property broker who is based in the city. &quot;Go to any upmarket hotel lobby at 9am and you can&apos;t get a seat in the coffee bars for all the businessmen speaking English with architectural blueprints spread out on the table.&quot; Of course, this reverse migration is still a relative trickle, and doesn&apos;t go far towards plugging the gap left by the estimated two million Poles who have abandoned Poland since it joined the European Union in 2004 - up to a million of them to the UK - but this reverse flow is interesting none the less. After all, why move to a country deemed by so many of its own to be inadequate? And isn&apos;t it, well, a bit grim? The answer to the second question is yes - and no. There is no doubt that communist town planning was not kind to many Polish cities, where the only green you will see is at traffic lights. But leave behind the big conurbations, with their monolithic tower blocks and multiple lane roads, and there are delightful villages and stunning landscapes. Some 28% of Poland is covered by forest, and there are almost 10,000 lakes, dozens of mountains and 23 national parks. And don&apos;t forget the dune-sheltered beaches on the northern coast. In fact, few people move to Poland for the scenery. Like many of the Poles who have pitched up in the UK and Ireland in the past three years, a good number of the Brits who have moved to Poland are primarily motivated by money. This might sound a little odd when you consider that the average monthly wage in Poland is just \u00a3595, but start your own business, or arrange to be paid in sterling, and you can be rich in Poland - something that looks set to continue with the new, enterprise-friendly government led by Donald Tusk. The first influx of fortune-seeking Brits arrived shortly after communism collapsed. Then, high-earning, experienced business people were flown in to head up the outposts of western firms, to teach Poles how to make money in a capitalist country. Some 18 years later, many of these British bosses have gone home, having passed the capitalist baton on to Poles, but there is still serious cash to be made, particularly for entrepreneurs such as Richard Walker, 27, from Chester, who moved to Warsaw in March 2006 to work for the commercial property developer Jones Lang Sasalle. After six months, Walker set up his own rival company, Ethel Austin Poland. He was soon joined by a former colleague, Theo Michell, 34, originally from south London, who moved to Warsaw earlier this year. The business has been going for only a year, but already the pair have amassed a property portfolio worth \u20ac30million (\u00a321.6m). You only need to visit the gelled-back duo at their swish new headquarters to see how well they are doing: they occupy a small but impressive office at Warsaw&apos;s flashiest address, the Norman Foster-designed Metropolitan building on Pilsudski Square. They have no qualms about foreigners snapping up property and claim Poles don&apos;t either. &quot;They are overwhelmingly positive about it,&quot; says Walker. &quot;Warsaw is changing so quickly and everyone is out to do well here. There isn&apos;t the discrepancy between locals and expats that you get in places like Dubai.&quot; One wonders if all the families in the grim blocks of flats on the outskirts of the city, living on subsistence wages, would agree with Walker. But certainly all the Poles the Guardian spoke to for this article seemed remarkably generous about the British invasion, such as it is. For our interview, Walker and Michell suggest a sleek coffee bar on the ground floor of the glittering glass building, which the Polish photographer later tells me is a well-known haunt for young women looking to catch the eye of rich foreign businessmen. Not that Walker or Michell are in the market for any of that: both persuaded their girlfriends to up sticks and join them when they moved. Warsaw was not, both admit, an easy sell. Michell&apos;s fiancee, Brid Carr, a 33-year-old architect from Donegal, says her reaction on hearing her beloved&apos;s business plan was: &quot;If only it was somewhere like Barcelona.&quot; This is a common theme: most Brits in Poland admit that it was far from their dream destination. &quot;I came here nine years ago purely for the job,&quot; says Jo Raskin, 40, the Warsaw-based director of Bell English Language Teaching, which has six schools in Poland. &quot;I became an English teacher to work in sunny places in southern Europe, and I had this vision of Poland as being grey and cold.&quot; Warsaw, with its bitter winters and traffic-choked streets remains cold and grey - Phil Jones, a 30-year-old IT worker, recalls an occasion when he blew his nose and ice came out during the winter of 2005. But over time, Raskin has fallen for Poland. And she is not the only one. She reports an increase in applications from Brits who want to teach English. &quot;There is a steady stream of people wanting to work here. We pay more than English teachers would get in many other European countries. I know for sure that they earn more than some schools pay in London, pound for pound,&quot; she says. Her colleague, Sue Holmes, a 42-year-old from Crewe, agrees that an English teacher can live handsomely even on the basic Bell salary of the equivalent in zloty of \u00a3500 net per month. &quot;You can afford to live right in the centre of town,&quot; she says. &quot;And get a cleaner,&quot; Raskin chips in, &quot;and really enjoy yourself. Warsaw is very cultured - you can go to the opera for \u00a315.&quot; But both agree that life has got more expensive as the zloty has strengthened - there are currently around 4.96 zloty in a pound; when Poland joined the EU in 2004, the exchange rate was 7.13 zloty to the pound. The days of 50p pints are over: half a litre of lager in Warsaw now costs around 10 zloty, or \u00a32. The Ethel Austin duo say a new flat in Warsaw now costs the same as one in Liverpool, putting it well out of reach for any Pole on an average wage. Ray Bridgeford, 47, an Edinburgh-born businessman, runs Sense, one of Warsaw&apos;s trendiest restaurants. He says prices have rocketed since it opened five years ago. &quot;Salaries have trebled and the cost of food has doubled,&quot; he says. Plus he is having a nightmare recruiting. &quot;All the best waiting staff have gone to the UK,&quot; he says. &quot;When we advertised for staff five years ago, we received 600 applications. I am currently looking for waiting staff and have only had six people interested.&quot; Raskin thinks that Poland has a lot to offer Brits however. &quot;Poland is one of those countries where being a foreigner is a good thing,&quot; she says. &quot;Particularly if you are male, you get a lot of attention. I have seen so many average blokes come over here and get a nice Polish girl with almost no effort at all.&quot; The not-at-all-average Jim Parton met his Polish wife, Anna, at his London tennis club almost six years ago. Anna, who comes from near Katowice in south-west Poland, had come to the country to learn English and have an adventure. Stockbroker-turned-writer Jim was looking for something new after writing a few books &quot;but not as many as I should have&quot; and after waging a long campaign to win access to his eldest son, now grown up. They fell in love, married and around two years ago started thinking about buying a place in Anna&apos;s homeland. &quot;Originally we were looking to buy a three-bedroom place in Poland for investment purposes,&quot; says Jim, as he makes a pot of the nearest Poland gets to proper tea. &quot;Then one day we saw a stately home and got hooked on the idea of buying one.&quot; At first Anna wasn&apos;t desperately keen to return home when so many of her compatriots were getting a Ryanair plane in the other direction. The reaction of her new neighbours in Piotrowice Nyskie was one of bemusement, she says. But for the Partons, the prime motivation for moving was for their children. &quot;Small children can have a free-range childhood here,&quot; says Jim. &quot;They can run around and see cows and pigs. Plus I can&apos;t afford to engage in the education arms race in London, and all the state schools in my area are crap.&quot; Jozefina and Henryka already understand Polish and English, and will attend the local primary, along with the as yet unborn twins when they are old enough. Jim says he hasn&apos;t sensed any animosity from locals. He can&apos;t speak Polish yet, but he says: &quot;People from the village keep popping round to see if there is anything they can do to help.&quot; He has no regrets, he adds, about moving, though like many emigres he misses certain things about the UK. He has managed to get broadband installed - Radio 4 streams from his laptop throughout our interview - and there is a jar of Bovril on the kitchen shelf. He really pines for the rugby, though. &quot;Is there a team in Wroclaw?&quot; he asks the photographer. He misses the variety of food you can buy and eat in Britain too. There do not appear to be any restaurants or shops in Piotrowice Nyskie, let alone one that sells Heinz baked beans or Marmite, though in Warsaw many expats admit guilty trips to the city-centre Marks &amp; Spencer to buy horseradish sauce or chicken tikka curry paste. Over in Wroclaw, Nick Blunt, a 24-year-old English teacher from Weymouth, says he misses &quot;gravy powder and real ale&quot;. Blunt moved to Poland in April to be with his Polish fiancee, Ania Rudawska, 27, a Wroclaw native whom he met a few years ago when she was working in a bowling alley in Britain. &quot;Nick was the first English guy I met who I could have an intelligent conversation with,&quot; says Rudawska. She says Polish people are happy when the British come to her country - just so long as they are not on a stag night. &quot;We don&apos;t like people coming here, getting absolutely drunk and screaming in the street,&quot; she says. In fact, you will rarely hear Poles trotting out any kind of &quot;they come over here, they take all our jobs&quot; line - perhaps partly because unemployment is at its lowest level in years (thanks in no small part to so many jobless Poles seeking work elsewhere in the EU). Blunt and Rudawska are currently living with her parents, but are planning to move out when they get married next August. It is not necessarily easy to live well on a Polish salary, says Blunt, who earns \u00a3400-\u00a3500 a month teaching English to Polish business people. &quot;Food and drink is cheaper, but some things, such as clothes and electronics, are much more expensive,&quot; he says. But the food is one of the things Blunt loves about his new homeland. &quot;It&apos;s great that you can still buy traditional produce that actually tastes of something. The meat is particularly good. In England all you can buy is Tesco plastic ham.&quot; Stephen Riley, a Glaswegian, moved to Warsaw a year ago, originally to do marketing for Celtic football club, which has two Polish players. &quot;I love bigos,&quot; he says - bigos being the ubiquitous cabbage and meat stew that is one of Poland&apos;s national dishes. That, along with &quot;being paid in pounds and being able to live well&quot; is Riley&apos;s favourite thing about Warsaw. He doesn&apos;t feel too cut off from his friends and family - he can generally get a return flight to Glasgow Prestwick for \u00a350, which is a lot less than it cost to get the train from London when he worked there. Later on in the evening, in the Irish pub Bar Below in Warsaw&apos;s central Srodmiescie district, a gang of Brits have gathered to watch Arsenal v Tottenham Hotspur. Steve Whittle, 47, came to Poland 10 years ago to work for the advertising agency WPP and has never gone back. &quot;Things are better here,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s cleaner, it&apos;s cheaper, people have better manners. It&apos;s safer - you see more policemen around central Warsaw than you ever do around central London.&quot; Plus Poland is much a much better place to indulge in his great hobby: carp fishing. Helen Maguire, 37, who moved to Warsaw six years ago with her property-developer husband, says Poland has so much to offer. &quot;You don&apos;t realise it until you get here - but it&apos;s the expat&apos;s best-kept secret&quot;.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe"], "title": "The Brits who moved to Poland", "sentences": ["There isn&apos;t the discrepancy between locals and expats that you get in places like Dubai.&quot; One wonders if all the families in the grim blocks of flats on the outskirts of the city, living on subsistence wages, would agree with Walker."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/12/poland.helenpidd", "publicationDate": "2007-12-12T03:06:34Z"}, {"article": "Sony&apos;s chairman, Sir Howard Stringer, was confident yesterday that the PlayStation 3 console would bolster sales as the electronics firm moves into the next phase of its recovery.

Six weeks later, however, he found himself drafted by the US Army to serve in the Vietnam War. On his return, Stringer fought his way through the ranks at CBS - as journalist, producer, news executive and president of the network. After two years running an ill-fated entertainment company, he joined Sony to reform its music business and was made head of the company&apos;s US division a year later. In 2003 he capped his rise by being anointed Sony&apos;s first non-Japanese chief executive. Stringer&apos;s charm masks a cut-throat reputation: not only has he presided over serious job cuts, he also has a history of knocking competitors aside.Bobbie Johnson", "tags": ["Business", "Technology", "PlayStation", "Sony", "Nintendo", "Digital media", "Media", "Games", "Japan", "PS3", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Playstation battles back against arch-rival", "sentences": ["It successfully floated its financial arm as part of Stringer&apos;s vision of a streamlined electronics and entertainment powerhouse, and this month received a &quot;substantial&quot; sum from a Dubai investment fund."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/12/playstation.sony", "publicationDate": "2007-12-12T07:14:12Z"}, {"article": "Apparently, Led Zeppelin played a huge, stadium-filling reunion gig on Monday night.

And she managed to lose her Blackberry and allegedly accused Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl of nicking it, but he couldn&apos;t have nicked it because he was too busy winding up Liam Gallagher by whistling. And then, Sir Paul McCartney was caught smoking something a little whiffy while having a drink in the VIP area. &quot;The Beatles legend was spotted with what seemed to be a, er, herbal roll-up,&quot; wheeze the girls. All that and pop rocker Pink was there, and so was Arctic Monkeys bassist Nick O&apos;Malley, and Bob Geldof, and Robert Plant, whoever he is.

You&apos;ll be pleased, but no doubt unsurprised that Bizarre Gordon kept the promise he made to his constituents in the manifesto he laid out upon assuming the role of Minister of Kewl just weeks ago. In this manifesto, you may recall (but probably don&apos;t, so we&apos;ll remind you), Gordon said he &quot;held wrinkly rockers in high esteem&quot; and after witnessing the Led Zep on Monday, we&apos;re pleased to report that high esteem is still in evidence. &quot;I said in my Bizarre manifesto I held wrinkly rockers in high esteem [you see: proof] and Led Zep&apos;s first show in 19 years didn&apos;t disappoint.&quot; So undisappointing was the show, in fact, that Bizarre Gordon goes on to claim that the band are considering rolling out their one-off reunion show and doing another one-off at Madison Square Garden. Claims a source: &quot;One of the guys started talking about their three [legendary 1973] concerts at the Garden. There was a consensus of, &apos;why not?&apos; I have no doubt after their reaction back-stage that they will be there next year playing to a sell-out crowd.&quot; Who knows, maybe there might be another unique one-off gig after that too, in Dubai or something. Anyway, here&apos;s Liam Gallagher&apos;s thoughts on the evening: &quot;Mega.&quot; Moving on... What do you get when you cross feminist icon Germaine Greer with Labour MP Ed Balls? Erm, the president of the Spice Girls fan club? &quot;We had a whole generation of girls who discovered that power was cool because of the Spice Girls,&quot; says Greer in today&apos;s Express. That&apos;s right, not from their mothers and fathers, who were more than likely schooled on the notion of female empowerment in the 60s from the likes of Greer. Nope, they learned it from Geri &quot;feminism is bra-burning lesbianism&quot; Halliwell. &quot;My generation of women wouldn&apos;t have known what power was. They thought it was something you squirted under the rim of the toilet.&quot; We can empathise with that - we&apos;re always mixing up our power with our Toilet Duck. But as for the Spice Girls as icons for young women? To that we say: Balls.

Operation Stairway has started targeting suspected freight agencies and the gangs involved, some of which have been stealing millions of pounds worth of cars. While overall car theft in the UK has fallen in recent years, the theft and smuggling of vehicles abroad is thriving. Up to 20,000 high-value cars a year are now removed from the streets of Britain and sold on through secondhand car markets in Africa and countries such as Cyprus, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Spain. Some gangs, like the one sentenced at Southwark crown court today for smuggling cars to Dubai, target high-performance luxury cars. The vehicles smuggled to Africa, however, are often more modest and reliable, making the parts easier to find. Operation Stairway was initiated after a series of criminal teams in the south-east of England were convicted of sending hundreds of top of the range Mercedes and BMWs to Nigeria and Kenya. The operation is being run by the Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (AVCIS), a specialist unit within the Association of Chief Police Officers. The precise scale of the problem is unknown, according to Superintendent John Wake, the head of the AVCIS, but is large enough to have generated a secondary profession of &quot;bounty hunters&quot; who earn their income repatriating stolen cars. Police are also investigating whether they need more powers to monitor ports and combat the gangs, and the results of an inquiry are due to be published in December. One concern is whether the regulations governing what is written on the cargo manifest accompanying each container are adequate. Requiring more information on car registration plates or chassis numbers might strengthen controls. In an increasingly globalised economy the problem is becoming more acute. In September, a combined investigation by Hertfordshire, Essex and Kent police resulted in a dozen-strong gang receiving total sentences of more than 50 years for carjacking and theft. Most of the crimes involved burglary of keys from homes, enabling \u00a34m worth of vehicles to be driven off. Officers seized 92 cars from containers bound for Mombasa in Kenya at Felixstowe port. A London-based gang arrested last year was found to have been stealing 120 prestige cars a month, mostly Mercedes&apos;, stripping them down to spare parts, packing them into containers and dispatching them to Nigeria. One policeman compared their methods to &quot;an industrial production line&quot; adding that: &quot;they were incredibly professional, like a Formula one pit crew but in reverse&quot;. Operation Stairway involves officers from AVCIS and local forces. &quot;There are thousands of containers going out on ships every day, let alone vehicles on Ro-Ro ferries,&quot; Wake told The Guardian. &quot;We are trying to gather data about how many [stolen cars] are going out.&quot; Some coastal forces are reluctant to monitor exports, he explained, because stolen vehicles recovered from other forces&apos; areas do not improve their own crime statistics. &quot;We now have officers in a number of ports gathering data for a strategic document [to show] there&apos;s some benefit to joining together and tackling it,&quot; Wake said. Holding up a container ship to search for suspect vehicles is a punitively expensive business. &quot;So we are targeting containers where the freight forwarder had been involved before or where scanning equipment picked up something on the manifest as wrong,&quot; he said. Wake is talking to Customs to see whether there are &quot;weaknesses&quot; in export control regulations. &quot;We are trying to identify whether there is stringent enough ... action at the ports.&quot; What is needed, he added, is a &quot;robust system that would prevent vehicles being exported from the UK without full identification of the vehicle&quot;. Of 180,000 vehicles stolen in the UK overall last year, 48% were recovered. The rest were scrapped for spare parts, &quot;cloned&quot; - given a false identity - or shipped abroad. &quot;There&apos;s clear evidence of a significant number of vehicles leaving the UK,&quot; Wake said. Repatriation agencies, collecting rewards for stolen cars, brought about 1,000 vehicles back to Britain from overseas last year. They employ spotters in places like Cyprus, Dubai and Spain looking for suspicious UK-registered cars. They watch out for luxury cars parked in docks where thieves often leave them for days to see if they are protected by tracking devices. Rewards of \u00a3500 or \u00a31,000 are offered by insurance companies for valuable vehicles. &quot;They are effectively bounty hunters for cars,&quot; Wake said. &quot;Not a bad little earner.&quot; The use of electronic immobilisers has stopped cars being hot-wired and driven off but has started a technological arms race between thieves and manufacturers. In some cases, criminals have learned to disable tracking devices, although some have anti-tamper mechanisms. Tracking devices can work on either GSM (mobile phone) networks or GPS satellite systems. Another potential security weakness lies in the fact that some electronic doorbells use the same frequency as remote car key locks. It is technically possible to jam a car key signal with a doorbell push, preventing the car being locked. Wake believes this method has been used in a handful of cases. Drivers should always double-check that doors have been locked, he added. There is currently a dispute in the EU about whether the manufacturer or the individual driver should own the key codes that unlock each car. &quot;There has been talk that car security should be improved using keys that work on biometrics,&quot; Supt Wake said. &quot;That sounds fantastic but that increases the risk of, for example, lone females [being taken too]. One result of improved security has been an increase in violent carjackings, where drivers were pulled out of their vehicles at gun or knife-point.&quot; A Department of Transport spokesman said that its port documentation only required that the car type on the manifest matched the vehicle inside the container. &quot;Chasing number-plates is not us,&quot; he added. A spokesman for Customs said: &quot;We have arrangements in place where we work with police if we suspect a vehicle has been stolen.&quot; The British Freight Forwarding Association said that neither licence plate nor chassis numbers had to be recorded on the customs declaration form. &quot;There&apos;s nothing in the [manifest] code or the supporting documentation that could lead Customs to suspect a vehicle is stolen,&quot; said a spokesman for the association. &quot;Because so many trans-shipments go through Antwerp, the Belgian authorities were last year looking at the problem and whether more information is required on documents, particularly for vehicles.&quot;", "tags": ["UK news", "Crime"], "title": "'They're incredibly professional, like a Formula 1 pit crew'", "sentences": ["Some gangs, like the one sentenced at Southwark crown court today for smuggling cars to Dubai, target high-performance luxury cars.", "They employ spotters in places like Cyprus, Dubai and Spain looking for suspicious UK-registered cars."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/14/ukcrime.owenbowcott", "publicationDate": "2007-12-14T17:08:43Z"}, {"article": "Europe&apos;s largest casino complex, second in the world behind Las Vegas, is to be built in one of the driest regions of Spain, with the project&apos;s investors saying they hope to attract 25 million visitors a year. Gran Scala will eventually contain 32 casinos, 70 hotels, 232 restaurants and 500 shops, alongside replicas of Egyptian pyramids and Roman temples. There will even be a copy of the Pentagon - which will serve as a hotel in Spyland, a theme park dedicated to all things 007. And, because this is Spain, there will be a bullring. The complex will be built on 2,000 hectares (4,943 acres) of steppe in Los Monegros, Arag\u00f3n. Developers say it will open by 2015. The British-based consortium, International Leisure Development (ILD), settled on east Spain after plans to build in Dubai and France fell through. Millions of euros are being spent on nearby Zaragoza, improving its transport connections in time for next year&apos;s World Expo, making it the ideal location, according to ILD. The regional government gave the go-ahead to the \u20ac17bn (\u00a312.1bn) Gran Scala, arguing that the site is desert, where nothing grows, and that it is ripe for construction. But Greenpeace disagrees. It accuses the Arag\u00f3n government of dishonesty in the way it has presented the project, arguing that the land is a rich nature reserve that should be protected, not built upon. &quot;Los Monegros is a place of great natural biodiversity, with a huge range of species from Africa and Asia that have been very well conserved over the last five million years,&quot; said Julio Barea of Greenpeace. &quot;In the last five years alone, 200 new species have been discovered there. &quot;In any other country, it would be a national park, strictly protected. What the politicians in Arag\u00f3n are doing is shameful - telling voters that there is nothing there worth protecting, when it is in fact a zone rich in animal and plant life.&quot; The comparison with Las Vegas is more apt than the developers realise, said Barea. The demands of the casinos, hotels and houses in Las Vegas are causing the Colorado river to run dry. &quot;Over here, in one of the driest regions of Spain, where will we get all the water to supply Gran Scala?&quot; ILD and the local government deny the complex will cause environmental damage. At the launch of the project in Zaragoza this week, the vice-president of the region, Jos\u00e9 Angel Biel, said: &quot;This is a very important day for Arag\u00f3n. Gran Scala is a great hope ... We couldn&apos;t let the opportunity pass.&quot; It believes that the projected 25 million visitors a year, 80% of whom are expected to come from outside Spain, will bring in \u20ac600m in taxes annually for the region. Central government could also receive around \u20ac1bn in tax a year thanks to a relaxing of gambling regulations this year. Zaragoza airport is a hub in the low-cost air network, and only two-hours&apos; flight from Stansted airport, north of London. ILD hopes to attract millions of Britons each year, particularly as the prime minister, Gordon Brown, has put plans for a super-casino in Manchester on hold. But many believe the projected number of visitors for Gran Scala is wildly exaggerated, representing half of the total number of people who visit Spain each year. In Arag\u00f3n, the leftwing party Izquierda Unida (IU) is leading the opposition to the casino complex, worried not just by the potential environmental damage but also the glorification of mass consumerism and Las Vegas-style gambling. &quot;I do not understand what is happening,&quot; said Adolfo Barrena, the general coordinator of IU in Arag\u00f3n. &quot;We appear to be the spoilsports but we believe this plan is a disaster.&quot; ILD is unable to give the exact location of Gran Scala as the land has yet to be bought.", "tags": ["World news", "Spain", "Travel", "Europe"], "title": "In the Spanish desert, a rival to Las Vegas", "sentences": ["The British-based consortium, International Leisure Development (ILD), settled on east Spain after plans to build in Dubai and France fell through."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/15/spain.paulhamilos", "publicationDate": "2007-12-15T00:16:13Z"}, {"article": "A gang targeting diplomats and wealthy individuals - including socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson - exported more than \u00a31.5m worth of stolen cars to the Middle East in a &quot;highly sophisticated&quot; ringing operation.

Not the final. &apos;It was disappointing,&apos; says the player to whom understatement seems to come naturally. &apos;To go from number one to third-choice in 80 minutes was tough. The England camp did their bit to keep my spirits up. But you need to keep yourself going. Or seek out others experiencing the same thing. Like Steve Borthwick and Lee Mears.&apos; So, Bath played their part in keeping a Bristol player going. Not an overplayed role in the history of West Country rugby. Another, older Bath boy helped, too. Richard Hill was a scrum-half of noted contrasts - sweet hands, spicy temper - who had a few up and down rides of his own with England. &apos;Mad Dog&apos; has evolved into a coach of Bristol with a sympathetic line in pastoral care. &apos;Hilly phoned me in France quite a few times,&apos; says Perry. &apos;When I came home we had a really good chat. He made me captain of Bristol a couple of times. I&apos;m back, playing 80 minutes of rugby. I&apos;m a level-headed person. That&apos;s all I want. To be playing.&apos; Keeping Perry happy is probably not as easy as he makes it sound. On the other hand, this is the bloke who four years ago was more a spot-welder in a Midlands factory than a professional rugby player with Bristol and England. He can probably ride out a career glitch or two with greater equanimity than most. The point is that he has come home from his disappointing World Cup and instantly rediscovered the domestic form that made him a contender for international honours in the first place. He is a right handful on the burst. Bristol as a unit are going well in Europe. Defeat at Cardiff in the first round was offset by a resounding victory at home against Stade Francais. &apos;Nilling Stade was amazing. I know the weather was against them - they left Paris in sunshine and walked into us in a swamp - but the Bristol boys were really dogged that day.&apos; That 17-0 win was followed by victory at Harlequins, whom they play again today. &apos;I think this will be the fourth time we&apos;ve played Quins this year. I know David Strettle and James Percival as mates. We know them as a team pretty well. Is playing them in Europe any different from meeting them in the Premiership? Not really.&apos; A win would set them up for the final two rounds in January, when they travel to Paris and receive the Cardiff Blues at home. By then, they might be a touch more bullish about Europe: &apos;We didn&apos;t set ourselves any goals for Europe. It&apos;s, what, only our third season back in the English Premiership, our first back in the Heineken Cup. Last year we said we wanted to gain qualification for it. Having achieved that, we set off, feeling our way, rather than saying we were going to do this or that.&apos; But he recognises how important today&apos;s game now is. &apos;We&apos;ve had a couple of good results. This weekend could change everything for us. The stakes are higher.&apos; It is slightly strange having two clubs from one country in the same pool. Bristol are stressing that they have heard the word from Harlequins. How the side coached by Dean Richards are smarting after defeat last week; how they are coming down the M4 in mean mood. It is one of those exercises in nipping complacency in the bud. In keeping the Bristol roll going. Like everyone who flogged themselves through the mud of the previous couple of rounds, they have a few injury problems. Wing-forward Joe El Abd comes in for Alfie To&apos;oala, who turned an ankle in the first encounter with Harlequins. Lee Robinson and Tom Arscott are also injured. So, it is a chance to blood someone new and exciting. Bristol are introducing Anthony Elliott, who has been on England Sevens duty in Dubai and South Africa, to the right wing. He is big and fast. Dan Ward-Smith, who might have gone to the World Cup with England and Perry had it not been for a knee injury, continues his comeback, selected at No 8 instead of bug-victim Andrew Blowers. It is funny looking down the list of Bristol players who are missing or starting. Compare them with the names at the Parisian club who were going, it was assumed, to dominate Pool 3. Juan Martin Hernandez injured. Swoon. Fear not, David Skrela to stand in. Or could it be Lionel Beauxis? It is called strength in depth. Or maybe just rugby without a salary cap. At Bristol it is all a bit more down to earth. A bit less intergalactic. Full of character, sure, but not starry. Crazy old Mark &apos;Ronnie&apos; Regan is back from his awol appointment with the Barbarians. At 35, though, the hooker is nowhere near the oldest. On the bench today is second-row Gareth Llewellyn, 38 years and 10 months young. Bristol are certainly not as pink as Stade. They do not even have a drop of magenta like Harlequins. They are plain old Bristol in blue. With a level-headed, shaven-headed scrum-half who just likes playing rugby in dollops of 80 minutes.

The decision was greeted with joy by the Liberal Democrat council, whose leaders saw it as vivid confirmation that a city once a byword for decline had sufficiently recovered after a \u00a3900m injection of EU cash to be trusted to deliver a prestigious international event. The news sparked a surge in development. The neo-classical St George&apos;s concert hall was spectacularly restored for \u00a323m and opened by the Prince of Wales in April. A new 10,000-capacity arena and a major convention centre will open next month with the City of Culture official launch. Bookings, which include the MTV Europe Music Awards, have outstripped budget projections by 40 per cent. This, together with a \u00a31bn city centre retail and leisure scheme funded by the Duke of Westminster, appears to set the seal on resurgence and economic vibrancy where once there was industrial decline, unemployment and defiant militancy. But a series of embarrassing scandals and financial problems associated with the Capital of Culture project threatens to taint the feelgood factor and this in turn may claim the scalp of Lib Dem council leader Warren Bradley.  Although the official opening is not for another four weeks, The Observer has established that Liverpool council has a black hole of \u00a329m, some \u00a320m of which is attributed to the festival. Appeals to Chancellor Alistair Darling to fund the shortfall by borrowing money against city property may not come off because such &apos;capitalisation&apos; schemes do not normally apply to arts and festival funding. The council is considering refinancing an asset or dipping into its reserves - its least preferred option. If a solution is not found soon, England&apos;s third-biggest city faces a serious cash crisis. Furthermore, wages at the organisation charged with delivering the event - the Liverpool Culture Company, whose board includes Tom Bloxham, the man behind loft apartments in central Manchester, and Phil Redmond, the Grange Hill and Brookside creator - have rocketed to \u00a34.22m - an average of \u00a336,000.  Most embarrassing was an 11th-hour cancellation of last August&apos;s Mathew Street festival - seen as a precursor to the Capital of Culture event - because of security and licensing issues. An inquiry appeared to exonerate council leaders and senior Capital of Culture organisers. But leaked emails written after the report&apos;s publication by Bradley appear to show he wanted to blame Culture Company directors for the cancellation.  Labour leader Joe Anderson is furious: &apos;As Jim Royle might say: &quot;Culture? My arse.&quot; The Lib Dems are proving themselves incapable of handling this major project. The City of Culture may fail to benefit the people of Liverpool.&apos; But Phil Redmond, in charge of the entire programme and talked about as a future Liverpool mayor, says the event is &apos;a catalyst which will see a 19th-century cobble and sandstone city transformed with steel and glass. That&apos;s what we&apos;re doing.&apos; He adds that lessons have been learnt and that next year will see a resurgence of Mersey pride and creativity. Concern at the council&apos;s ability to keep a lid on the finances comes as the Duke of Westminster nears completion on one of his most ambitious and costly developments. Liverpool One is a \u00a31bn retail and leisure scheme due to open next May after a 10-year tussle. That the Duke, through his property vehicle Grosvenor Estates, has risked a fortune on a 43-acre site by the Mersey is seen as a vote of confidence. But with just five months until opening, 30 per cent of the retail units are unlet and many of the 600 homes unsold. There is a fear that the Duke will be opening an upmarket retail, restaurant, residential and entertainment scheme designed to tempt Liverpool&apos;s shoppers away from Manchester in the teeth of severe economic downturn. Joanne Jennings, chief executive of the Grosvenor subsidiary overseeing Liverpool One, acknowledges that the timing of the opening is not perfect. &apos;But much research reveals a demand for better retail and, being hard-nosed, we&apos;re in Liverpool for the long haul,&apos; she says. The Duke is not the only property magnate thinking big in the city. Isle of Man-based tycoon John Whittaker, who owns the Trafford shopping centre in Manchester and Liverpool&apos;s John Lennon airport, and is behind the Salford development to which the BBC will be moving, outlined his vision for a huge tract of land he bought through his acquisition of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company. He wants the site, adjacent to the Mersey, to help Liverpool become a waterside destination to rival Dubai and New York. Liverpool Waters is a \u00a35.5bn investment designed to develop 21 million sq ft and 50 buildings, many more than 50 storeys high, each designed by a leading architect.

There was Angela Hartnett who, back then, was just one of Gordon Ramsay&apos;s backroom girls, but who now has fronted her own TV shows and won a Michelin star in her own right. It&apos;s the same story with Marcus Wareing who, in 2001, was the quiet man at the stove of Petrus. Today he has two Michelin stars. In 2001 Jason Atherton was toiling in Dubai for the Ramsay organisation. Today he is renowned as the man who came up with the concept - and the all-important grazing menus of precisely calibrated food - for Maze, a brand that is being rolled out around the world. There was John Campbell, who also went on to win his second star; Michael Caines, who has become a regular on TV; and Hywel Jones, who has won award after award. So what of the new crop? Being picked by Observer Food Monthly guarantees nothing, of course. They&apos;re the ones who will have to do all the hard work. Interestingly, though, the restaurant world has moved on from 2001. Back then a number of our picks were deputies to other people. This lot all hold, or have held, Michelin stars in their own right. Only one - also the only woman - is working for somebody else, though that somebody else is Gordon Ramsay and the restaurant is his flagship 44-seater on Royal Hospital Road in Chelsea. Clare Smyth, from Northern Ireland has, at the age of 29, become his head chef overseeing the most important kitchen in his empire. &apos;Clare has an instinctive palate and a self-determined level of focus, a tunnel vision for perfection that is very rare in any chef today - male or female,&apos; says Ramsay of his head chef. &apos;A talent like Clare Smyth comes through the kitchen maybe once every 10 years.&apos; The other four - Tom Kitchin, Robert Thompson, James Sommerin and Tristan Mason - are as focused and self-confident a bunch as you could hope to meet. When we showed them the checked chefs&apos; trousers we wanted them to wear for our shoot, they weren&apos;t happy. Those were the kinds of trousers worn by burger flippers, they said, and they were not burger flippers. The best that could be said, announced another, was that Gary Rhodes once wore a pair like that. And they weren&apos;t like him either. They wanted us to know that they are the new guard: the future, not the past. And so let us place on record that these chefs are not the sort to flip burgers and they are certainly not Gary Rhodes. They are the new breed of young, eager and hungry cooks, who are willing to put on trousers they hate, if that&apos;s what it takes to make the picture work. For that - and for their blistering talent - we salute them. 1Claire Smyth, 29 Gordon Ramsay, London Satisfied by nothing less than perfection, Smyth, at just 29, has landed one of the industry&apos;s most desirable jobs, head chef at Gordon Ramsay&apos;s flagship restaurant. 2 Robert Thompson, 25 Waldo&apos;s, Cliveden House, Berks Few chefs have had as blistering a start as Thompson. At 19 he joined the famed Michelin two-star restaurant Winteringham Fields in North Lincolnshire. At 22 he was installed as its head chef by chef de cuisine and owner Germain Schwab. &apos;It took about a month for the scale of the responsibility to strike home,&apos; he says. &apos;But Germain was there to guide me.&apos; Schwab, he says, has been a huge influence. &apos;He was always interested in flavour first and that&apos;s what I take from him.&apos; When the Schwabs sold up Thompson stayed on as head chef and, though Winteringham lost one of its stars, Thompson regards the one that remained as his, no mean feat for a man still in his early 20s. A few weeks ago he returned to the Thames Valley, where he grew up and went to college, to take over the kitchen at Cliveden, the grandest of stately-home hotels. For now his ambitions are simple. &apos;I want to win back my first star and then go for two,&apos; he says. &apos;I want to build my reputation, not on TV, but solely for my food.&apos; When asked to name his signature dish he was modest. &apos;I&apos;m only 25 so it&apos;s going to take a while for that to emerge. But if you asked me to choose it would have to be a hare royale that I learnt from Germain. It&apos;s unembarrassed in its luxuriousness.&apos; As is so much of his cooking. Signature dish: Hare royale, with rosti, hare sauce and foie gras Mentor: Germain Schwab What they say: &apos;Do not shy from the six-course gourmet menu or the \u00e0 la carte because it is at the top end that Thompson soars, sending out extraordinary dishes that are deeply complex.&apos; Good Food Guide. Cliveden, Taplow, Berks, 01628 668561, clivedenhouse.co.uk 3 Tom Kitchin, 30 The Kitchin, Leith, Edinburgh Tom Kitchin is not afraid of hard work if he thinks it will benefit his career. After years working at a senior level with the great Pierre Koffman at La Tante Claire in London, as well as with Guy Savoy in Paris, Kitchin took a job with Alain Ducasse in Monte Carlo. And it was like starting all over again. After having risen to be a senior sous chef, all of a sudden he was back to third commis, the lowliest of the low. &apos;I was willing to swallow my pride,&apos; he says now, &apos;because I knew it was the right thing to do.&apos; The decision paid off. Today he has his own restaurant back in his native Scotland where, earlier this year at the age of 29, he became the youngest-ever Scottish chef to win a Michelin star. His food, he says, has been defined by his experience with Koffman. &apos;He&apos;s still my mentor. In fact all the plates, cutlery and glassware are from La Tante Claire,&apos; he says. &apos;What really matters with Pierre, though, is his food. There&apos;s no ponciness. It&apos;s all about flavour and that&apos;s what I try to concentrate on too.&apos; What&apos;s important, he says, is to focus on simplicity and the seasons, not necessarily on luxury ingredients. &apos;That&apos;s something else I learnt from Pierre.&apos; It seems to be working. Weekend tables in the restaurant that he runs with his wife Michaela - she handles the front of house - are now booked out six weeks in advance and all the other services are fully booked too. That&apos;s how he likes it. Indeed, ask him about his ambitions and he doesn&apos;t talk about stars or accolades. He says, &apos;I want my restaurant fully booked for lunch and dinner every day. There&apos;s no better buzz.&apos; Signature dish: Boned and rolled pig&apos;s head, roasted langoustine tails and a crispy pig&apos;s-ear salad Mentor: Pierre Koffman What they say: The pig&apos;s head dish is &apos;an extraordinary combination and not one for the faint-hearted... there&apos;s no denying the technical brilliance.&apos; Daily Telegraph The Kitchin, Leith, Edinburgh, 0131 555 1755, thekitchin.com 4 James Sommerin, 29 The Crown, Whitebrook, Wales James Sommerin&apos;s achievements are all the more impressive because, unlike our other rising stars, he cannot claim the tutelage of one of the greats of modern gastronomy like Germain Schwab or Pierre Koffman. He cites the influence of one Richard Lyth, head chef at the little known Farleyer House Hotel in Scotland, where he undertook almost all his training. &apos;He taught me everything, cooking methods, butchery, the lot.&apos; But James is just as likely to cite the influence of his grandmother back in Wales, and the baking they did together on Saturday mornings when he was a kid, or the pocket money job he did prepping ingredients in an Italian restaurant. In his early 20s James moved back to Wales and the Crown at Whitebrook. He became head chef in 2003 and this year won his first Michelin star. &apos;That was mind-blowing,&apos; he says. &apos;I really wasn&apos;t expecting it.&apos; He was simply concentrating on his food. &apos;Gordon Ramsay&apos;s a big influence on me because of his pure passion, and I&apos;m interested in the new wave of cookery though I think a lot of it gets out of control,&apos; he says. &apos;My food has a French influence. It&apos;s not obscure, but it is modern. When I cook I try to keep honest. I don&apos;t like to overshadow the ingredients.&apos; And Wales, he says, is a great place for that. &apos;We&apos;ve got some of the best game, lamb and beef.&apos; Which is why he&apos;s determined to stay there. For James achieving his ambition - another star - does not mean moving away. &apos;I want to be the first Michelin two-star in Wales,&apos; he says. Signature dish: Lamb three ways: 24-hour cooked shoulder, roast loin, sweetbreads with truffled pommes puree Mentor: Richard Lyth, Farleyer House Hotel, Scotland What they say: &apos;The matter-of-fact menu description of my starter - &quot;salad of new potatoes, wild mushrooms and truffle&quot; - didn&apos;t do justice to a dish that was far more than the sum of its parts ... perfection.&apos; Guardian The Crown at Whitebrook, nr Monmouth, 01600 860254, crownatwhitebrook.co.uk 5 Tristan Mason, 31 The Orrery, London Talk to Tristan Mason and you might assume he had chosen a life in the kitchen while still in his pram. He oozes certainty and commitment, and a rare intensity about his food which seems to come from deep within. Not so. &apos;I was doing a graphic-design course when I caught the bug,&apos; he says. &apos;I was washing pots at Brocket Hall and that&apos;s what got me interested in cooking.&apos; It is, he says, another way to channel his creativity, which he has in abundance. Mason cooked at the Mirabelle, learning the classics, and describes Marco Pierre White, who then owned the restaurant, as a big influence. &apos;He was the chef everybody wanted to be.&apos; That was followed by a stint at the Greenhouse under Paul Merritt who, he says, taught him to loosen up after all that time cooking Mirabelle classics. Finally he went to a pub called the Hare in Hungerford where, aged 29 and with just one other cook in the kitchen, he achieved his first Michelin star. He calls his food &apos;eclectic modern French&apos;, which is as good a title as any for dishes like cider-marinated salmon with crispy pork belly and grain-mustard ice cream, or roast teal with confit duck, red-cabbage puree and caramelised chestnuts. This year, he brought that food back into London, when he took over as head chef at the Orrery, generally regarded as the star in what was until recently the Conran Restaurant Group. He has big shoes to fill. The Orrery was where major names like Chris Galvin and Andre Garrett made their reputations. Mason accepts it&apos;s a big job. &apos;It&apos;s a serious jump but I wanted to get back into London,&apos; he says. &apos;There are 12 cooks in the kitchen, but I&apos;ve got complete autonomy. Of course you&apos;ve got to cook for the clientele but you&apos;ve also got to move it forward.&apos; No one should doubt his ability to do just that. Signature dish: Lobster with roast root vegetables and beef consomm\u00e9 Mentor: Paul Merritt What they say: &apos;Mason&apos;s food has the sophistication of someone in tune with handling quality ingredients to produce excitingly original dishes.&apos; BBC Food website.

While the big banks are suffering from the effects of the over-investment in risky mortgage backed debt, outsiders are jumping at the chance to own a stake in the financial heart of America. A $7.5bn chunk of Citigroup has been sold to an investment vehicle controlled by the United Arab Emirates, while UBS, the Swiss banking group, has accepted a cash injection from the government of Singapore and an unnamed Middle Eastern fund worth more than $11.5bn, through the sale of convertible bonds. UBS plans to sell another $2bn-worth of shares, with the same Asian and Middle Eastern investors likely buyers. So far UBS and Citigroup have been hardest hit by the sub-prime and credit crises, and their balance sheets have become severely undercapitalised. In an effort to put the mess behind them, they have declared billions upon billions of dollars of asset write-downs in the hope that no more shocks will crop up in the coming months.  To move on from the crises effectively, however, the banks need financial support from institutions that have the means to dig in for the long haul - and that means giving away ownership. Most big investors in the west - such as mutual funds and local governments - are also feeling the pain of the credit crunch and so are unable to commit to the scale of rescue package needed by the likes of UBS and Citigroup. Therefore, sovereign funds in the oil-rich Middle East - and their equivalents in Asia, where the sub-prime crisis has failed to penetrate - are the only option. Wall Street analysts now believe that other big banks and brokerages are also looking to outsiders to help shore up their balance sheets. &apos;If the crisis continues or gets worse, banks will probably seek more investment in this form,&apos; said Frank Braden, banking analyst at Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s in New York. While the ownership of big stakes in financial institutions by foreign or sovereign investors alters nothing in the way that banks are run, it has the potential to create diplomatic tension. &apos;There is a danger that too much foreign interest in American banks and Wall Street in general could generate negative sentiment in Washington,&apos; Braden said. Indeed, when Dubai Ports World - one of the world&apos;s largest ports operators, and controlled by the government of Dubai - attempted to acquire P&amp;O and a handful of strategic US ports, nationalistic feelings ran high in Washington.  Meanwhile, other US banks are also seeking help from outside investors. Washington Mutual, one of the biggest high street banking groups, is seeking a $2.5bn cash injection to stay afloat, and bond insurer MBIA had to go cap in hand to private equity firm Warburg Pincus for $1bn to help it stay afloat.", "tags": ["Business", "US housing and sub-prime crisis", "Credit crunch", "Banking", "US economy", "US news"], "title": "Foreign bidders pounce on suffering Wall Street", "sentences": ["Indeed, when Dubai Ports World - one of the world&apos;s largest ports operators, and controlled by the government of Dubai - attempted to acquire P&amp;O and a handful of strategic US ports, nationalistic feelings ran high in Washington."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/16/subprimecrisis.creditcrunch", "publicationDate": "2007-12-16T23:38:35Z"}, {"article": "England&apos;s Laura Davies had to settle for a tie for second place as the former world No1 Annika Sorenstam retained the Dubai Ladies Masters at the Emirates Club.

Milestone Resources - an investment group headed by Micky Jagtiani, the boss of Dubai retailer Landmark - has built up a 7.37% stake in the struggling retailer. That seems to have set the cat among the pigeons, with traders trying to fathom Milestone&apos;s intentions. Icelandic group Baugur also has a chunk of Debs and optimists have long been hoping for a bid from this quarter. In July Baugur ruled itself out of any offer for six months. Kaupthing analysts commented this morning: &quot;A recently announced 7% stake in Debenhams, under the name of Milestone Resources, is thought to be Landmark Group - a multinational, multibrand retailer from the Middle East. They were recently involved in the bidding process for New Look which ultimately failed. Landmark will be very familiar with the Debenhams name and the format not least as Debenhams trades in the Middle East with its franchise operations. &quot;Current trading at Debenhams is thought to be tough, as it is for the rest of the clothing industry in particular, albeit taking market share. Whether or not Landmark&apos;s positioning in Debenhams is backed by greater intent at this stage remains to be seen. However, with deep pockets and a global retail vision, they would be well positioned to take advantage should debt start to get in the way at Debenhams. This news should provide some much needed relief to the recent negative sentiment/ speculation on trading.&quot; So it has proved and Debenhams is now 12.5% higher at 85.25p. Overall the mood is a bit more upbeat today. Inflation is lower than expected, Northern Rock is boosted by news the government has stepped in to guarantee more of its liabilities, the Bank of England is injecting \u00a310bn and the ECB up to $500bn into the markets to improve liquidity and there is even a bit of bid news. With Northern Rock up around 4%, the FTSE 100 is now sitting 49.4 points higher at 6327.2. The takeover news involves internet auction firm Tradus (formerly QXL Ricardo), which is being bought for \u00a318 a share in cash - \u00a3946m in all - by South African media group Naspers.

But did the 27 leaders discuss the financial turmoil taking place outside - the extraordinary central bank intervention that Brown said pointed the way to greater global co-ordination, the $10bn write-downs at UBS that saw a Singaporean sovereign wealth fund become the Swiss bank&apos;s biggest shareholder, the biggest housing market collapse in the US in two decades and fears it would spread here? &quot;Non,&quot; said Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, in an adjoining briefing room. &quot;Gordon Brown, Angela Merkel and I took initiatives a few weeks ago to demand greater transparency and we are thinking about other initiatives.&quot;  And that, mesdames et messieurs, was that. No reassuring - or warning - words to homeowners, employees, investors, the very citizens with whom the EU, collectively the world&apos;s biggest economy, wants to re-connect. In the final communiqu\u00e9, towards the end and drafted by senior officials weeks ago, there was, after all, a nodding reference. It spoke of &quot;improving transparency for investors, markets and regulators, improving valuation standards, improving the prudential framework, risk management and supervision in the financial sector as well as reviewing the functioning of financial markets, including the role of credit agencies&quot;. In other words, what we said two months ago.  And, then, the ultimate giveaway of aloofness from the genuine fears and anxieties of the 500 million citizens: the summit &quot;will come back to these issues at its Spring 2008 meeting on the basis of a progress report&quot;. Come back in three months and we may have something to say - or simply call for a further progress report. Nobody expects definitive conclusions on how to recalibrate and refine financial markets supervision within a few weeks when these have to be debated and agreed with regulators and administrators across the global economy. But these mandarin phrases underline how much the EU&apos;s political life is set by a pre-determined agenda drafted within and for the benefit of the institutions that make it up. The European economy may prove robust enough to withstand the credit crunch in the coming months - though opinions on that differ sharply - but the 27 heads of state and government might have awakened public attention if they had broken out of their institutional cocoon and addressed the most pressing issue for their voters: how real is the threat that the current and burgeoning turmoil poses to people&apos;s jobs and prosperity? Some things don&apos;t change - at least on the surface The Singaporean investment in UBS, accompanied by a smaller participation from an unnamed, probably Gulf-based investor, is not unique in mainland Europe where Kuwait holds 7% of car-maker Daimler and Dubai 2.2% of Deutsche Bank.  Fascinating research this week from Handelsblatt, the German financial daily, shows that overseas investors now own 53% of Germany&apos;s top 30 firms listed in the Dax - compared with a third just five years ago. This, German commentators say, finally nails the myth - or goal - of Deutschland AG (Germany plc): the complex web of cross-holdings by banks and industrial groups in each other, designed to protect the country&apos;s corporate base from foreign takeover. It also illustrates how Germany has seized the opportunities of globalisation in a manner unmatched by its eurozone partners. The research shows that non-Germans own 84% of Deutsche B\u00f6rse, 79% of Adidas and 78% of Bayer while the Dax companies are achieving 68% of their sales overseas compared with just 30% two decades ago.  Foreign investors, the authors say, are attracted by record corporate earnings - up more than in the rest of Europe and the US - and the export performance of German companies, especially in the capital goods sector. But some things don&apos;t change - at least on the surface. Germany&apos;s regional banks, the publicly-owned Landesbanken, are fighting for survival and turning to the shelter of each other&apos;s arms. Last week the biggest, LBBW (of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg), finally agreed the terms of its takeover of SachsenLB, the only east German one, based in Leipzig, and overstretched to the point of near-bankruptcy by the sub-prime crisis. (Its exposure is \u20ac43bn). At the same time, WestLB, suffering from a scandal at its proprietary trading desk, spurned LBBW&apos;s advances and instead opened the prospect of a merger with Helaba, the Hessen and Thuringia version. The merger with LBBW would have created Germany&apos;s second-biggest bank, by balance sheet, after Deutsche. The alternative deal not only preserves D\u00fcsseldorf as an important banking centre alongside Frankfurt but is seen as opening the way to attracting business from medium-sized firms and to widening the customer base.  It is, of course, an all-German solution but WestLB says that shareholders - government and savings banks - are open to financial investors. But who might be interested given the ferocity with which the so-called Landesf\u00fcrsten (state princes or premiers) defend the &quot;interests&quot; of their home state from the clutches of foreigners? New York grill Peter L\u00f6scher, the Austrian brought in to revitalise (and cleanse) Siemens, Europe&apos;s biggest technology group, is having a torrid time. This week he, Gerhard von Cromme, supervisory board chairman, and Peter Solmssen, head of compliance, went to New York for a grilling by the market regulator, SEC, over Siemens&apos; corruption scandal. The scandal, that has cost Siemens \u20ac1.5bn so far, according to Der Spiegel, simply won&apos;t go away despite L\u00f6scher&apos;s efforts to make a fresh, clean start. Nigeria, that beacon of anti-corruption, has banned the group from bidding for public contracts because of previous bribes and Norway, a genuine oasis of Nordic uprightness, has reacted similarly because its defence ministry was overcharged in the past. And a report in the S\u00fcd-deutsche Zeitung claims that auditors KPMG have told Munich prosecutors investigating the worldwide scandal that dubious payments made via a Swiss subsidiary last year were hushed up by the group. L\u00f6scher must be praying over Christmas and new year that he and his colleagues succeeded in persuading the SEC of their genuine efforts to expurgate the past, renew management, pursue recidivists and be squeaky clean in future. Otherwise, the NYC regulator could impose the heaviest fine in its history - and one that runs into billions of euros, eating into Siemens&apos;s record earnings and improved margins.

Police and officials from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) have searched the home of Atif Amin for evidence that he passed classified information to the American authors of a book about the worldwide nuclear proliferation network. Amin was in charge of Operation Akin, an investigation into links between British companies and the illegal network run by Abdul Qadeer Khan, a Pakistani scientist who helped build that country&apos;s nuclear arsenal. The investigation is the subject of a book recently published in the US, America and the Islamic Bomb: The Deadly Compromise. Its authors, David Armstrong and Joseph Trento, contend that in 2000 Amin uncovered evidence in Dubai of the Khan network&apos;s involvement in establishing Libya&apos;s nuclear programme but was ordered to drop his inquiries and return home, at the request of the CIA and MI6. The Libyan programme and the Khan network were not exposed and halted until 2003. The book argues that in the intervening three years the network continued to sell nuclear technology and possibly weapons designs to Iran, North Korea and possibly other countries, under the noses of US and British intelligence. It quotes a frustrated Amin as telling colleagues: &quot;They knew exactly what was going on all the time. If they&apos;d wanted to, they could have blown the whistle on this long ago.&quot; On December 5 Amin&apos;s house was searched by investigators from the IPCC and Hampshire police. Amin could not be contacted yesterday and his lawyer said he could not comment on an ongoing investigation. The Guardian has learned that the search was intended to uncover evidence that Amin had cooperated in the writing of the book and had leaked customs reports from Operation Akin to the authors. Armstrong said Amin and his work were the subject of the book rather than the source. &quot;The most obvious answer to why they&apos;re going after him is that this is potentially embarrassing to US and British intelligence sources,&quot; he said. &quot;Their failure to let Amin&apos;s investigation go forward in 2000 allowed the Khan network to continue proliferating unnecessarily for three years and the bomb programmes of Libya, Iran and North Korea to make additional headway.&quot; A US national intelligence estimate published earlier this month said Iran probably halted its nuclear weapons programme in 2003, but did not say how much progress Tehran had made towards building a bomb by that time. Intelligence officials on both sides of the Atlantic have said they waited until 2003 to strike against the Khan network in order to gather evidence on all its activities and all its customers. &quot;But what did they achieve?&quot; Armstrong asked. &quot;Where are all the people connected to the Khan network? There were at least 50 people in this thing, and there are only a handful of people under house arrest.

The repercussions were instant and long lasting. Since then, the 5-0 whitewash, offset only to a degree by England&apos;s unexpected success in the subsequent one-day series, was followed by a hapless World Cup campaign. The fallout saw the resignation of the England coach, Duncan Fletcher, with the appointment of the former Academy director, Peter Moores, in his place. There has been a restructuring of the management of the game. The appointment of the board chairman, David Morgan, to the presidency of the International Cricket Council invoked a ballot to find his replacement and, after a deadlock first time round, it was the astringent Somerset chairman, Giles Clarke, rather than Surrey&apos;s more avuncular Mike Soper, who was appointed. Much of the restructuring, including the appointment of Hugh Morris as the managing director of England cricket, was in response to recommendations made in a special report into England cricket over recent years, commissioned at the start of 2007, headed by Ken Schofield and including former Test cricketers such as Nasser Hussain, Angus Fraser, and Nick Knight. Last week in Colombo the Guardian gathered together two eminent commentators on the game and the new power broker. Others do lunch, but we gathered instead for a power breakfast: lunch, as Gordon Gekko observed, is for wimps. Over fruit, pastries, toast and, in Clarke&apos;s case, Marmite, we talked about the upheavals that had occurred and some of the changes to come. Mike Selvey: Can we begin with you Giles? There has been a massive upheaval post-Ashes and post-World Cup with a change in coaches, administration at various levels and chairman. Shortly there is to be appointed a full-time national selector. All of this emanated from the Schofield report, which was instigated very quickly was it not? When was it? Giles Clarke: I can tell you precisely. It was instigated in the Sheraton on the Park hotel in Sydney, before the Sydney Test in the New Year. David Lloyd: I was staying there and I remember everyone who was anyone in England cricket administration walking into the hotel. I also remember it vividly because Paris Hilton was also in the hotel and Brian Lara was chasing her. MS: Nice one Bumble! DL: No, he&apos;ll be OK, will Brian. I&apos;m not sure how far he got though. Anyway we were told they were all there in Sydney for the match and it was just an ideal time to get together and chew over a few things. MS: With hindsight, Giles, was it overreaction to a public clamour or a necessary PR exercise in which the board had to be seen to be doing something? GC: I apologise for going into business management speak, but it is something I understand best. When you have an activity which has been the focus and concentration of your specialist skills for a year and a half, your fundamental reason for existence, when you have done nothing but talk and prepare for it, ensured that everybody had all the things they wanted, and subsequently it has been so cataclysmically unsuccessful, you do not hang around. You say &quot;we have got to do something&quot;. You provoke that by having a proper meeting, and getting a reaction from people saying where do we go from here. That was before the Sydney Test and what I liked about it was that there was a very clear conclusion that action was required. Ten days later I was on a conference call from Hong Kong and the investigation was set up. There had been no hanging around, contrary to some of the things that have been written. Jonathan Agnew: Was Duncan Fletcher told about this? He claims in his book that the first he knew of it was when questioned by Mike Atherton for television after the Sydney Test. GC: It had been discussed to death by David Collier (ECB chief executive) and David Morgan with Duncan before the board had reached a final conclusion. MS: So Duncan has been economical with the truth on that? GC: David Collier had actually discussed with Duncan, I think in Melbourne, the fact that it was very obvious that a number of us were very unhappy with the situation, that it was obvious that there was a very ... come on, you gentlemen had observed the mood, body language, and so forth. JA (who knows Fletcher well from time spent playing in Zimbabwe): It was down to one person who totally misread the situation and that was Duncan Fletcher. Certainly he didn&apos;t get the preparation right, the players&apos; mind-set was wrong, there was that shambles of a game in Sydney early on, and yet they seemed genuinely surprised that we got hit by a runaway truck. They didn&apos;t seem to be focussed or prepared mentally or physically for it and there is no doubt about it, he had to go. However, having said that, there are one or two things that have come out of Schofield that I think are unnecessary. I certainly don&apos;t see the need for a national selector. I think by and large the selection process has worked pretty well. I think David Graveney had a pretty tough time with Duncan. I mean, he got kicked off the team bus on the way back from the ground, for goodness sake. There is a different feel to the camp now, it is a lot more open. I think that there have been a few things to emerge from Schofield that were knee-jerk, of which the national selector is one, and that we will be talking in two or three years&apos; time about what this bloke is doing sitting around twiddling his thumbs on tour in order to attend a handful of selection meetings. MS: Well this is an old argument. You always have had the situation where on the one hand you say &apos;who needs a selector, let the coach do it&apos; and on the other that the coach may be biased. You&apos;ve been coach, Bumble, did you want to pick the side? DL: No, I thought differently, that the soccer style was the one for me, with a manager who picks the team and who has a coaching staff who works the players. The manager picks the team. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Alex Ferguson pick their sides but they don&apos;t coach them. They have a coaching staff underneath who deal with everything. Ferguson watches everything that goes on. He picks the team. He doesn&apos;t sit round the table with four or five and do it that way, and it is a nonsense to do it now. I have sat round a table, like this, for not too long selecting an England side and it&apos;s a complete nonsense because nine or 10 pick themselves and you are only talking about a couple of spots. You then get, &quot;show of hands, how many want him, how many want another&quot; and ok, he&apos;s in. MS: If you are manager of the national cricket team, when are you going to see a Ryan Sidebottom, for example? DL: He has his scouts. MS: Then we are only talking semantics aren&apos;t we, because that&apos;s what your selectors do? DL: But they are all having a say in selection. I&apos;m still sure it ought to be the captain&apos;s team and that is given away in Duncan&apos;s book when he says he rang Michael Vaughan and said &quot;I am going to drop this individual&quot;. If I had rung Mike Atherton when I was coach and said &quot;I&apos;m dropping so and so&quot;, he&apos; d say &quot;what&apos;s it got to do with you?&quot;. MS: Most changes in a side occur through happenstance - Strauss, for example, through injury to Michael Vaughan, Monty Panesar, from Simon Jones&apos;s knee going, and Alastair Cook, from Trescothick going home from India, all came in through chance. So does a selector actually ever use intuition or judgement? Well, yes, because actually the very fact that these have come in and done well shows that they have made good succession judgements and have ensured that those who came in did so seamlessly. DL: I like the communication and the advice. But I think a selector should be a scout. GC: Let us understand what this is, the national selector, and I&apos;ll argue with you. This is a recommendation of a group of men who played a lot of Test cricket, from Mickey Stewart, from Nasser Hussain, Nick Knight, Brian Rose and Angus Fraser. There are two things that are relevant here. You say, &quot;who watches the county games?&quot;. Well one thing is for sure, it is not Peter Moores, who has not a hope in hell. So he needs advice. We were having dinner last night, for example, and he was asking me about James Hilditch, one of our Somerset lads. I can tell him what he is like as an individual and I&apos;m prepared to make a judgement on that, but I&apos;m not qualified otherwise. As I see it, the responsibility of the national selector is to provide Peter Moores with a squad who he believes are good enough and capable enough of playing for England. Peter then has to make a decision with the captain who is going to play. Peter needs all the information he can get because you will all say what about an atmosphere, what about the dressing room, who is contributing to that, who is going to pick them up when they have done two straight days in the field and are knackered. JA: But is the perceived need for a national selector exclusively because of one man&apos;s, Duncan&apos;s, inability to look outside the bubble? GC: I would put to you that this complete structure is about ensuring that that situation doesn&apos;t happen again, that what we have here is Hugh Morris responsible for the whole thing. He makes a report to the board every meeting now, and believe it or not, cricket was not a regular obligatory board topic before. When we came to any conversation it was instigated by John Carr, but it didn&apos;t always happen. Now we have Hugh who talks about the national side, Mike Gatting from his new role with counties and recreation, and when you hear the two separated reports, what they have done, where they are going, you realise what had not gone on before. So from my point of view at the ECB, these reforms have pushed cricket where it should be, which is right up the top of the board&apos;s agenda, the top issue. Gatt and Hugh now dominate the main part of the board meeting. Then we have an individual county in to talk about what they are doing and where they are going. And we have a proper discussion about the recreational game, which historically we have not had. DL: Going back to Duncan, if he had said after 2005, &quot;I have done everything I set out to do, we have won the Ashes&quot;, in my view he would be that supremo now, because he would have had time out, recharged his batteries, come back, and here he would be, the messiah returned. JA: The trouble was that the Ashes in 2005 was not a spring-board but an apex. GC: Do you feel that, from the stress and strain of the crescendo to that Ashes series, what is demanded of an international coach gives him only a limited period of time? MS: I think that we believed, and certainly who could blame Duncan for thinking this, that whereas the Australian team was past its peak and would have players dropping off, we would only get better for the next two or three years - they would all improve together and everything would be hunky dory. The reality is that there are just three or four left in the side now. That&apos;s it. DL: The Australians had a quick review, stuck with [Ricky] Ponting and [John] Buchanan, both of whom could have gone. MS: It&apos;s slightly unfair because we thought we would have a side that kicked on. Is it heading the right way now? I think it is a refreshing environment. The communication is excellent. DL: I think Peter Moores is the best England coach we have had. Enthusiastic, good organiser, and I can tell you that his job is to give them the environment in which to perform. This is how you run up to bowl, Steve Harmison, so make it work. You don&apos;t change all this, you are never going to be side-on Fred Trueman orthodox, but this is what you are. &quot;Bowl me three yorkers,&quot; Moores will say. &quot;Yeah I can do that.&quot; &quot;Well show me.&quot; Yorker, yorker, full toss. Nearly. Now go away and come back when you can do it. He is challenging them. And whoever appointed Andy Flower as batting coach is a genius. I know Peter has worked with him at the academy. MS: So here is a question, Giles. Andy and Ottis Gibson - who I think is excellent, brilliant, talks common sense - are so good that you are going to get people sniffing around. So are you, Giles, going to be able to make sure that Andy and Ottis, if we think they are that good, are hung on to in a way that we were not able to do with Troy Cooley? GC: Troy was a special case because of his nationality and family issues. But there are no two ways about it, I personally find Peter Moores an enormously impressive man, so obviously a manager of men, with a clear idea of what he wants to do. And a confident man is an open man, while one lacking in confidence becomes secretive and creates an atmosphere in the dressing room. Peter will have the resources he wants, whoever he wants, in the positions he wants - whatever he needs, no one is going to stop him having those resources and those men. He has a whole load of exciting ideas about how we improve. Just take fielding as an example. What are the skills and strengths we need to catch the ball, collecting the ball at speed if you are a tall man, throwing off balance, all those things. To me I come back to the idea that he needs to be given the resources he wants until such time as it becomes clear that he is not the right man to run things. Otherwise how can he do his job properly? He needs to do that. He has an excellent working relationship with Hugh, who has made a fantastic start, incidentally, and is way ahead of what people may have expected at this stage. MS: Kolpaks. Can we do Kolpaks? DL: How long have we got! MS: It is only going to get worse with Australians and New Zealanders coming on. What can the ECB do beyond incentivising the counties? Legally is there anything? GC: If you want a clear situation, at their request we have been having a number of conversations with the South African board. The current legal position is that the parliamentary select committee, culture, media and sport, has asked for submissions on the European white paper on sport. England losing to Croatia at football has really woken people up. We have to do that by the middle of January and be supported by a paper from Cricket SA because the issue they face is of young South Africans coming over and abandoning their own country. That will then go to the EU for further discussion for their report. We then intend to go to the EU with the European cricket union, because we can&apos;t go as a national body, to explain the issues (rugby is equally concerned, by the way). What we are looking for is the right to decide for ourselves what is good for our game. If we are going to have two overseas players, then there are going to be two unqualified players. Whatever it is. That is the legal side, so we want the right to make decisions. Then we can have a debate within the game to decide on the right number. But we are not in a position to make our own decisions and that is wrong. MS: That&apos;s what I&apos;m getting at because it seems to me bizarre that a Slovakian handball player can have this incredible impact on a sport that is played nowhere else at that level in Europe. GC: The prospect of this happening has really concerned Cricket Australia. I spent an hour and a half in Dubai airport on a conference call to [Cricket Australia chief executive] James Sutherland there. Because if you have a 19-year-old Australian who thought his career path into the national side was barred, and his earning capacity in spending a few years in England may be quite substantial, what is he going to do? JA: It is caused by a desire for instant success. Let us get back to one division. Otherwise there will always be the drive for instant success. It has led to an unhealthy atmosphere, with spiralling wages, simply to get people out of the second division. DL: But it is still down to the counties. No one from the EU has come in and said &quot;buy this boy&quot;. So why do counties do it? We have just signed a bloke called [Francois] du Plessis at Lancashire and, if you read the blurb, he is going to play in the second team. Why? Why have they signed him? Why not just scrap the academy? Countless players want to play in the side, so why does a 24-year-old want to sign for Lancashire? If he can&apos;t play in South Africa and wants to learn the game, why does he not go and play in Pakistan? The simple answer is that he gets paid in England. The counties sign these bloody people. Why? JA: Because they don&apos;t get paid as much elsewhere. DL: Don&apos;t sign him! Use your academy! You spend so much time on the academy, so use it. It will get worse and worse. The young lad from Wigan or Preston, where&apos;s the incentive? JA: It is seen as a cheap means of quick success, convenient. They are of a reasonable standard, and cheap and cheerful. DL: It is a complete and utter nonsense for English cricket. They give nothing, absolutely nothing. They are not great players, they have a burning ambition to earn money. If you want to further your career, son, go to Sri Lanka where it&apos;s hot and it&apos;s spinning. Just like Bumble&apos;s head. The tape runs out. The toast is cold. 2007: that was the year that was Moment of the year GC: Somerset gaining promotion in the County Championship. MS: India&apos;s Anil Kumble finally getting a Test century.

Clegg first. He said yesterday in reply to a question on Radio Five Live that he is an unbeliever. Later on he issued a statement in true Lib Dem style saying that he was at the agnostic end of the atheist spectrum and that he had &quot;enormous respect&quot; for those who do believe. He could hardly have said he had no respect for people with faith, remarked one colleague. It would have been political suicide. He also said that his children would be attending a Catholic school, prompting another colleague to quote Richard Dawkins, who said sending children to religious schools was a form of child abuse. We were reminded from another corner of the room that Dawkins has since revised this view and now thinks exposure to such ideas will broaden the mind. But the consensus was that Nick Clegg is probably the only modern politician to publicly admit to his non-believing views. Will it affect his standing? Probably not. Even the Blair/Campbell &quot;we don&apos;t do God&quot; was an admission that being too closely identified with a faith would be a likely handicap in the political stakes. One colleague wondered, though, if there is any recent research that would confirm that view. A New York Times survey in the 1970s asked whether being Jewish, black, female, gay, or atheist would affect a presidential candidate&apos;s chances. All except atheist got a 90-odd percent rejection, while being a non-believer only influenced 40% of those interviewed. Would those figures stand up today? The conversation then moved on to Morgan Stanley and the news that the state-owned China Investment Corp is investing $5bn in the cash-strapped bank in return for a stake of around 10%. It recently made another $3bn investment in a Wall Street private equity firm. Apart from the ever-changing estimates of bank losses -- Morgan Stanley disclosed a credit crunch write-off of $3.7bn in October and this rose to $9.4bn yesterday -- will the Americans be worried about major institutions being eaten into by the Chinese? There seems to be a profound difference between this acceptance of cash in times of trouble and the hoo-ha over the attempt by Dubai Ports to take over management of six US seaports in February last year. One colleague thought that the injection of Chinese funds didn&apos;t matter a whit and argued that when any company goes public the shares are freely traded and will, in time change hands again. It&apos;s the logic of the system and if China hits recession then the shares will be sold off. However, another colleague thought that a currency trade-off might be a consequence of this and other deals. The Chinese renminbi is seriously undervalued against the dollar and the Americans don&apos;t like that. Already the US treasury department is calling for a revaluation to rebalance the terms of trade between the two countries.", "tags": [], "title": "God, China and politics", "sentences": ["There seems to be a profound difference between this acceptance of cash in times of trouble and the hoo-ha over the attempt by Dubai Ports to take over management of six US seaports in February last year."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/20/godchinaandpolitics1", "publicationDate": "2007-12-20T11:32:34Z"}, {"article": "High petrol prices and the lure of foreign beaches may give a helping hand to Britain&apos;s transport network as the annual Christmas getaway begins.

A survey by the RAC suggests that 49% of Christmas drivers intend to cut the number of journeys they make compared to last year, although 18m cars are expected to hit the road tomorrow. &quot;Every litre is costing motorists an average of 10p more than it did last Christmas,&quot; said Neil Thompson, of the RAC.

Manchester airport alone expects to process 270,000 travellers between now and Christmas Eve, with Tenerife the most-booked destination, followed by Alicante and Malaga. The number of people with second homes in Spain has weighted the &quot;predictable British tendency to head for the Costas&quot;, according to the Travel Trust Association, which expects a record 3 million Britons to spend Christmas overseas. Keith Betton, a spokesman for the trust, said: &quot;The way Christmas falls this year gives the chance for a really good break, because next week will not exist for many businesses. &quot;Offices will turn the lights off at the end of Friday and nobody will be back until at least January 2.

John Bevan, the managing director of lastminute.com, said: &quot;It would appear that Britons are opting out of the pressures of a family Christmas - ie having to visit both your own parents and the in-laws.

The junior minister responsible for roads, Tom Harris, said: &quot;The Highways Agency is taking all possible steps to allow drivers to use the roads safely and without delays. But it will be busy, so we urge people to plan their journeys and allow extra time.&quot; The biggest problem on the rail network is likely to be the closure of the West Coast main line, which runs between London, the north-west and Scotland, from December 27 to New Year&apos;s Eve.

Except that it is happening. The China Investment Corporation - a newly-formed fund which helps control \u00a3100bn of China&apos;s foreign exchange reserves - yesterday ploughed $5bn into Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street firm. It has also taken stakes in US private equity firm Blackstone - owner in the UK of Cafe Rouge restaurants, Madame Tussauds and Center Parcs. Closer to home, the Chinese Development Bank, controlled by the Chinese state, owns 3% of Barclays. The Chinese involvement in Wall Street is even more surprising given the protectionist stance of the Americans towards their own businesses until recently. When Dubai Ports World took over strategically important US ports last year, it caused a political furore. It was not enough to stop the deal, but it did require the bidder to sell off the US ports. Until recently, it has been more common for Wall Street firms to take stakes in Chinese banks, in a search for exposure to the fast-growing economy and the burgeoning wealth of the Chinese population. How times change, though. The involvement of the Chinese and other so-called sovereign wealth funds in US banks could well prove to be critical to their survival in the short term. Wall Street is suffering a painful hangover from the excesses of easy credit. The subprime mortgage crisis is causing huge dents in the financial sector&apos;s profits. The size of the problem is awesome. One bad bet by a group of traders caused Morgan Stanley to drop $8bn, and left the bank with a $3.6bn loss in the fourth quarter of the year. Such holes are difficult to fill; hence Morgan Stanley welcomed the $5bn in cash from CIC with open arms. In return, it is handing over an estimated 9.9% stake to the Chinese investor. The deal comes hot the heels of the move by Citigroup to sell a \u00a33.5bn stake to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and a step by Bear Stearns also to take investments off the Chinese from Citic Securities, another state-owned investment fund. These are unlikely to be the last investments in a big US business, given that China has the world&apos;s biggest foreign exchange reserves, worth $1.3trillion and growing by $1m a minute. And neither should it be. When shares trade freely on stock markets, anyone is allowed to buy them - whatever their politics and whatever their nationality. While its economy continues to remain unscathed by the current credit crisis, the Chinese may well take the chance to flash their cash and extend their influence.

The era of cheap flights has liberated us from having to spend a tense and dreary few days with the in-laws. Now we can escape it all and spend the time away, on our own terms. This is just one of the many reasons why more and more people choose to fly, not just in the UK but across the world, and why politicians are so hesitant to reign in this growth, despite the considerable - and fast growing - climate-change impact of aviation. On Thursday, EU ministers finally agreed to the terms and conditions of how aviation will enter the European carbon emissions trading scheme. But under considerable pressure from the aviation lobby, the original proposals were predictably watered down. Instead of entering the scheme in 2011, aviation will now enter in 2012. Airlines will only have to buy 10% of the permits at auction, meaning that they are gifted the rest which, in theory, will enable them to make a considerable profit by passing on the cost to passengers. And the cap is based on 2004-6 emissions rather than the 1990 norm applied to most other sectors. With the US threatening a trade war if the EU actually proceeds with this scheme - it still needs approval from MEPs - it seems that aviation will forever be treated as the favourite child, getting far more generous and larger presents than any of its siblings. Whereas most of the other major sectors responsible for considerable emissions - steel, concrete, power stations, car manufacturers, mining etc - are having to face up to a future of deep cuts in emissions, aviation is being treated with kid gloves, as it has always been when you consider its laughable tax liability. The aviation industry is often heard asking why it is being singled out for attention by climate change campaigners. The reason is simple: it is the fastest-growing source of emissions and is displaying little attempt, like most other sectors, to tackle its emissions. It is also a source of emissions that can be classified as &quot;non essential&quot; - two-thirds of passengers passing through UK airports are leisure travellers, as opposed to business travellers or what the industry refers to as VFRs (visiting friends and relatives). We don&apos;t need to go on cheap shopping trips to Dubai, whereas we do need power to heat our homes and cook our food. With that in mind, aviation would come quite far down a list of necessary emissions. But no one is saying let&apos;s lock up all the planes in hangars somewhere and throw away the keys. Aviation is clearly an important industry and we will continue to &quot;need&quot; to fly in some circumstances. But we, as a society, urgently need to have a debate about whether it deserves its current special status over and above all other sectors that makes flying so cheap that we can go shopping in Dubai for Christmas bargains. Surely it should be the same rules for all? And if any sector is going to be given special dispensation to pollute, it should be one that meets more of humanity&apos;s essential needs than aviation? The simple and unpalatable truth is that aviation will have to become more proportionately expensive in coming years - whether emissions trading or oil price rises causes this first is open to debate - so that the kind of binge flying that is becoming habitual among many now is curtailed. If aviation is to be kept within the strait jacket proposed by the EU emissions trading scheme then flying can&apos;t be an impulsive act of whimsy any longer, but that of need. It is not the people who go on holiday to the Mediterranean once a year, or only fly to see a relative at Christmas, who are largest source of the problem. It is the still relatively small, but growing, percentage of flyers who take multiple flights a year - often to visit their second-homes, incidentally, but that&apos;s a debate for another time perhaps - because they can afford to due to such cheap deals. If we are serious about managing emissions, we just can&apos;t afford to let flying off to grab a few days of cheap winter sun become yet another Christmas ritual.", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Religion", "Transport", "UK news", "Environment"], "title": "Getting burnt by the winter sun", "sentences": ["&quot;Many are also beating the Christmas sales rush by heading off to Dubai for cheap prices, great shopping and five-star luxury.&quot; It says that city breaks are also very popular at this time of year, too, with Paris, Amsterdam, Dublin and New York among the most visited cities by Britons.", "We don&apos;t need to go on cheap shopping trips to Dubai, whereas we do need power to heat our homes and cook our food.", "But we, as a society, urgently need to have a debate about whether it deserves its current special status over and above all other sectors that makes flying so cheap that we can go shopping in Dubai for Christmas bargains."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/21/gettingburntbythewintersun", "publicationDate": "2007-12-21T13:00:00Z"}, {"article": "Alistair Darling take heart: nationalisation is becoming rather fashionable. State bailouts of banks are all the rage too. There is just one snag: western institutions are not getting their cash from ministers in London or Washington, but from functionaries in Beijing. While Britain&apos;s chancellor still balks at taking Northern Rock into public ownership, his counterparts in China have no qualms about investing state money in the private sector. This week Beijing bought a 10% stake in the Wall Street blue chip Morgan Stanley; in May it took a slab of the private-equity giant Blackstone. Those two deals, worth just over \u00a34bn, were made by the China Investment Corporation (CIC), a fund set up and run by the government. With over \u00a3100bn to burn, it is bound to make more big deals - and big headlines - over the coming year. CIC is one of a new breed of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) created by nations awash with excess cash from exporting goods or oil. Most oil-producing Arab countries have one, as do Russia, Korea and Singapore, and the funds are estimated to be worth a total of a trillion pounds. The logic behind them is simple: if energy-rich Russia is earning around \u00a3425m from exports every day, it naturally wants to invest those dollars for a higher return. But the impact of these new vehicles is far less straightforward, and it has largely been left to economics wonks to worry about them (even now, a Google search for &quot;SWFs&quot; brings up page after page about some graphic-design software). At last, however, they are entering political debate. The IMF is working on a code of conduct for the funds, while the rich nations&apos; club, the OECD, is coming up with guidelines for recipients. Such users&apos; manuals have their place, but on their own they are not an adequate answer to the issues raised by SWFs. At their most basic level, these funds (which are projected to be worth \u00a37.5 trillion within a decade) embody a shift of economic power from Europe and America to China, Russia and elsewhere. They sum up one of the global economy&apos;s problems too: the west is consuming far more than it is producing. SWFs are also a new and very different kind of investor. &quot;Cross-border nationalisations&quot; is how Larry Summers refers to them; a strong phrase from someone who, when Democrat treasury secretary, was full of the joys of globalisation. What worries him and many others is that these investments may not be made for financial returns, but for political ends. After all, commercial considerations are unlikely to be paramount for totalitarian regimes. If Moscow is willing to play politics with an art exhibition supposedly heading to the Royal Academy, what could it do with a chunk of a British energy company? Free marketeers argue that this is all hypothetical and that sovereign funds have been around for a few decades without causing a fuss. Right on both counts, but Norway and others have typically squirrelled them away in a variety of investments - a few shares here, a bunch of bonds there. China, Abu Dhabi and these new SWFs are taking large, powerful positions in a few companies. This is a new kind of capitalism, and the difficulty for the west in responding to it is avoiding kneejerk jingoism. American politicians have already fallen into that trap, by kicking up such a fuss over a Chinese computer firm buying parts of IBM or Dubai taking over US ports. But governments should not be shy about marking certain industries (such as energy) as being of national importance, and off limits to other states. What about the investor countries? Beijing&apos;s surplus cash would be better employed within China. Sorting out basic national problems such as pollution and sanitation would surely be a far better use of state funds than buying stakes in private-equity firms. A sovereign wealth fund may be further demonstration that Beijing has arrived as a major world power, but it does very little for the rank-and-file Chinese.", "tags": ["China", "Politics", "Economic policy", "World news", "UK news", "Banking", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Leader: When Beijing goes buying", "sentences": ["American politicians have already fallen into that trap, by kicking up such a fuss over a Chinese computer firm buying parts of IBM or Dubai taking over US ports."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/21/leadersandreply.mainsection", "publicationDate": "2007-12-21T15:15:16Z"}, {"article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday January 3 2008  Newcastle airport is not owned by BAA and so would not have been affected by strikes planned for this month as we suggested in the article below. The seven UK airports operated by BAA are Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Southampton and Aberdeen. This has been corrected.   More than 1 million air passengers face a miserable start to the new year after staff at Britain&apos;s largest airport owner voted for a wave of strikes next month. BAA runs Heathrow and Gatwick plus five other UK airports, which it will shut if unions go ahead with planned 24-hour walkouts from 6am on January 7 and 14, followed by a 48-hour strike on January 17. The industrial action will affect at least 1.3 million passengers, who will either have to book flights from alternative airports or journey by other means, while travel from BAA airports will also be disrupted on the days immediately after the strikes. Unite represents 5,800 BAA staff, and the union called the strikes because the airport group closed its final salary pension scheme to new entrants. Brendan Gold, Unite&apos;s national aviation secretary, said: &quot;Without doubt, in my view, it will result in the closure of those seven airports during that timeframe [and cause] a huge amount of disruption.&quot; BAA was holding out for an amicable solution to the dispute yesterday and asked for the &quot;understanding of passengers&quot; as it continued talks with union representatives. British Airways, BAA&apos;s largest airline, told travellers not to cancel bookings: &quot;We are speaking to BAA to understand its operational contingency plans if industrial action goes ahead. We have not cancelled any flights at this stage, and therefore we aim to operate as normal.&quot; However, the world&apos;s busiest international airport, Heathrow, will close if the strikes take place. The majority of staff who voted to strike are deployed on security checkpoints, plus firefighters whose presence is mandatory in an airport. It is expected BAA will be unable to recruit auxiliary guards or firefighters from the army - an idea mooted during the airport security crackdown in 2006 - because they are not trained to use x-ray machines or to handle civilian aircraft. BAA&apos;s other UK airports are: Stansted, Southampton, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh. Its terminals account for nearly two-thirds of all airport arrivals and departures in the UK. The Association of British Travel Agents said that it would work with airlines to ensure that holidaymakers got to their destinations. An ABTA spokeswoman said: &quot;Other non-BAA airports such as Luton, Birmingham and Manchester may be able to help out.&quot; A January walkout will be the latest in a list of setbacks for BAA. It has struggled to recover from the disruption of the alleged liquid bomb plot in August last year, which cause a security clampdown which brought its biggest airports, including Heathrow, to a standstill. Unite blamed BAA&apos;s Spanish owner, Ferrovial, for the dispute yesterday. Gold said BAA executives wanted to avoid strikes but were &quot;dictated to&quot; by Ferrovial chairman Rafael del Pino, who oversaw the \u00a310.3bn takeover of BAA last year and is attempting to refinance the company&apos;s \u00a39bn debts. &quot;They have bought the business and they are trying to screw the money out of it,&quot; said Gold. BAA has assured government ministers that the decision to close the final salary pension scheme to newcomers was arrived at independently by its board, which includes three Ferrovial representatives. A Ferrovial spokesman said that the pension move was a &quot;BAA decision&quot;. Gold said BAA could easily afford to finance its pension scheme and defended the size of its strike mandate, which saw a third of BAA&apos;s Unite staff backing a strike on a 53% turnout. The British Chamber of Commerce said the strikes would be a dreadful start for the economy in 2008, and cost millions of pounds at a time when the UK needed to &quot;pull together&quot; to avert an economic downturn. &quot;The reputation of our airports in the eyes of international travellers will be further diminished when travellers get to the UK and are met by chaos,&quot; said David Frost, BCC director general. Staff will be joined on strike by members of the PCS union, which represents managerial staff at BAA. Cabin crew at Virgin Atlantic are staging separate 48-hour walkouts on January 9 and January 16, which will ground 10% of the airline&apos;s flights. Other options Airports not affected by the strike include: East Midlands Flights to Acapulco, Gambia, Bratislava, Jersey, Norway, Tunisia as well as many European cities.

Liverpool European destinations including Cologne, Madrid, Geneva. London City Direct to a large range of business destinations in Europe and Scandinavia.

The several thousand deaths have baffled scientists who are probing toxins, antibiotic pollution, viruses and even climate change as possible causes. In Saudi Arabia alone, between 2,000 and 5,000 perished inexplicably, it was revealed in Science last week. The ships of the desert are being sunk in unusual, and worrying, numbers, the journal warned. &apos;The numbers of deaths we are seeing at present are unprecedented,&apos; said camel researcher Bernard Faye, who is based at the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (Cirad). &apos;A great many animals are dying and it is not at all obvious what is the cause. The problem is that there is a real lack of good epidemiological evidence, and until we can get that we will struggle to find the causes of these deaths and to find ways of stopping them.&apos;  There were several outbreaks of sudden deaths among camels - which are exploited for their milk and meat and as beasts of burden in North Africa and Asia - in many countries last year. However, the worst occurred in Saudi Arabia. At least 2,000 dromedaries perished in a region south of Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Unofficial estimates put the death toll as closer to 5,000. Initial reports blamed infectious disease, but after Saudi vets sent blood samples to international laboratories it was announced that the animals had been killed by contaminants in their fodder. Two particular contaminants were pinpointed: the antibiotic salinomycin, a supplement used in chicken feed that is toxic to camels, and a fungal species with mycotoxins that can cause nerve damage. However, the Saudi government has shared little information about its investigation and evidence pinpointing fodder contaminants is disputed by experts. &apos;Neither mycotoxins nor any known disease could have killed 5,000 camels in that short span of time,&apos; said Ulrich Wernery, scientific director of Dubai&apos;s Central Veterinary Research Laboratory.  Camels are associated with hardiness, their ability to survive on small amounts of drinking water and blood-cooling systems that let them work in intense heat. But recently reports of camel deaths across the region have increased dramatically - on top of the Saudi outbreak. Changes in types of fodder may be linked to immune problems, it is suggested. Other scientists argue that climate change may be increasing numbers of disease-bearing insects, while others argue that changes in the use of camels, which are exploited less for transport and more for milk and meat today, may be making them more susceptible to disease. &apos;It is a puzzle, and until we get more information we are not going to get close to finding an answer,&apos; said Faye.", "tags": ["Animal behaviour", "Climate change", "World news", "Science", "Zoology"], "title": "Camel 'plague' puzzles scientists", "sentences": ["&apos;Neither mycotoxins nor any known disease could have killed 5,000 camels in that short span of time,&apos; said Ulrich Wernery, scientific director of Dubai&apos;s Central Veterinary Research Laboratory."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/dec/23/animalbehaviour.scienceofclimatechange", "publicationDate": "2007-12-23T01:49:54Z"}, {"article": "Martin Newland is on time, tired and in a dark suit and shoes which are still more Fleet Street newsroom than Rotana Beach, the glimmering five-star Abu Dhabi hotel where we meet. The former Daily Telegraph editor is not revealing the name of the Abu Dhabi newspaper he is creating from scratch, nor expectations of circulation. However, in his first interview about the project, he talks about everything else: its size - 175 journalists including 40 home news reporters and 25 foreign correspondents; the quality and diversity of the staff - recruited from Fleet Street, the New Yorker, Wall Street Journal and Canada&apos;s National Post (which he launched 10 years ago); and his ambitions for the new publication. He is also talking about the conviction and disgrace of his former proprietor Conrad Black, his time on British newspapers, Islam and the West, censorship and democracy in the Arab world and what is wrong with Britain and modern British journalism. Newland, 46, says he is surprised by the interest the new paper has provoked in the UK: &apos;I think there is a certain amount of wistfulness. Fleet Street is in a state of flux, with hacks being thrown out in the cold, and it&apos;s rare to see a paper of this size being launched.&apos;  Then there is the growing interest in the Gulf region, he explains, ordering a lime soda. &apos;You just get snatches of the things that are happening here... but when a senior expat arrives people really start to look... In fact, the region has been booming for a while, since oil prices started shooting up, but only now have people got a peg.&apos; His newspaper is one of a series of English-language publications being launched in the Gulf by British journalists. Two weeks ago, Dubai saw Frank Kane, former Sunday Times and Observer business editor, launch Business 24/7 there. Its advertising posters asking &apos;Are you a bull or a bear?&apos; line the desert highway between the city and Abu Dhabi. Others are in the pipeline. But Newland&apos;s paper is by far the biggest venture with the grandest aims. The paper&apos;s job is to &apos;join the dots&apos;, Newland says, for those outside the United Arab Emirates, a federation of hereditary princedoms squashed into an oil- and gas-rich peninsula on the Gulf. &apos;People know a bit about the UAE but don&apos;t know that it&apos;s a free society. OK, it is not a one-man, one-vote democracy, but the rulers are very accountable, women have equal access to jobs, no one gets beaten for drinking alcohol. It is a society of immense sophistication with a huge, emerging middle class who have decided to make their lives here. &apos;There is a huge tendency to stereotype in the West about the Middle East but it is nuanced, very complex. Part of the idea is to build a media institution that reflects what is happening, to show that Abu Dhabi is not just about getting richer but is a good place to live.&apos; Internally - and here Newland says he is drawing on his experience with the National Post in Canada - the aim is to create a &apos;national conversation&apos;, particularly with the &apos;below-the-fold... water-cooler stories&apos; that establish a sense of collective identity. This time the aim is to help turn the UAE into a new, booming, diverse nation. This is no easy task in a country where the permanent population of approximately 1.5 million - it will double in the next 30 years, according to some estimates - is composed of a small number of extraordinarily wealthy locals and a huge number of expats from elsewhere in the Middle East, South Asia, the Far East, the UK and Europe. This is where the new paper&apos;s market is. &apos;There are 160 nationalities in this country, but all are bound together by some kind of proficiency in English,&apos; Newland says. In three areas he is sensitive, even defensive. The first is his launch of the National Post. Several times he emphasises he has launched a newspaper &apos;in a G8 nation&apos;, clearly bothered by London&apos;s snottiness towards his success across the Atlantic. The second is his decision to take the Abu Dhabi job. &apos;One stereotype is that only jaded or half-arsed journalists would go to the Middle East to do newspapers and we have contradicted it,&apos; he says. Newland stresses repeatedly how happy he is to bring over his wife and four young children; how, like others, he sees Abu Dhabi as a good place to live and raise a family - &apos;Every stereotype I had about the Middle East was just wrong.&apos; Yet, though he is far from bitter, his enthusiasm for his new job appears inseparable from his equally evident personal and professional disillusionment with the UK.  The fallow 18 months after leaving the Telegraph, during which he said he did not receive a single decent job offer, were the &apos;worst period of my life&apos;, he says. Recent changes on Fleet Street worry him. Colin Randall, the Telegraph&apos;s former chief reporter and Paris correspondent, has joined Newland as executive news editor and is writing the paper&apos;s style book (following UK, not US usage). &apos;Colin is one of the best technical reporters in the business. Why was he on a freelance contract when I hired him?&apos; One reason is apparently &apos;convergence&apos;.  &apos;Fleet Street panicked too early and good journalists are being thrown out. A minister is still far more worried about a headline in a newspaper than a five-second splodge on Yahoo.&apos;  Newland insists he is not &apos;a Luddite&apos; but says convergence can be an excuse to slash costs rather than promote new forms of reporting and publishing. &apos;Badly done, it hits journalism, shuts down bureaux, reduces public interest and sells out in the long term to a short attention span. You create a wider but shallower content pool and your core brand suffers. Convergence has to happen, but there is a need to protect journalism. Quality journalism has been rendered a speciality channel.&apos;  One of the things that depresses him about British newspapers, Newland says, is &apos;the rush to the mid market&apos;. &apos;Why take on the Daily Mail? Your brand is your news pages and there is no higher calling than writing straight news.&apos; The decision to leave Britain was not too hard. Newland, a practising Catholic, says he misses little other than &apos;walks in the Weald&apos;. &apos;I am a religious person and England is undergoing a crisis of values. Forget about home prices, we have the highest levels of obesity, divorce and drug abuse, the lowest literacy of any developed nation. It&apos;s a country tired and unsure of itself. I am not here just for a wodge of tax-free income but because I have young children... here you can buy time. Life isn&apos;t just a rush of trying to earn enough to pay twice over for schooling. The values here are about family and fundamental dignity of humans.&apos;  The third area about which Newland is sensitive is editorial independence. He talks about the recently convicted Black, for whom he launched the National Post. &apos;I am a loyalist. My relationship with Conrad was as a friend,&apos; he says. &apos;He was a great proprietor who really understood newspapers and his removal from the scene... is bad for journalism.&apos; Newland&apos;s new paper is owned by the Abu Dhabi Media Company, recently set up by Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, ruler of the Emirate, and wholly government-owned. Other states in the region are operating similar models. Business 24/7 in Dubai is owned by the Arab Media Company, which also belongs eventually to the ruling family. Abdulattif Al Sayegh, its CEO, told me the government welcomed &apos;reasonable and constructive criticism&apos;.  For Abu Dhabi, Newland&apos;s newspaper is &apos;the first shot&apos; of a new strategy which is &apos;a hundred times bigger than what we are about&apos;, he says, adding that concerns about media freedom are overblown. &apos;My experience revolves around three national newspapers under six proprietors on three continents. Have I ever been totally free? Of course not. There is always a proprietor or a majority shareholder who has a vision and you are there [as an editor] to put it into place.&apos;  In Abu Dhabi, Newland says, that vision &apos;has been much less clear than with anyone else&apos;. The implication is that he feels his freedom commensurately greater. &apos;In my career I have been told to pull stories from the business section, not to print pieces about a poor economic situation for fear of causing the very situation we were writing about, and not to run pieces that are critical of Israel. I don&apos;t expect to encounter that [latter] sort of opposition here.&apos;  In any case, Newland says, the UAE are looking for a new language. The newspaper is supposed to make money - though with a sovereign wealth fund of $850bn and vast oil reserves, Abu Dhabi is hardly short of cash - but has greater ambitions, nationally, regionally, globally, of which Newland says he is excited to be a part.  &apos;A lot of people call me naive, but there is something here that is perhaps an answer,&apos; he says. &apos;All the polarities in the world can be reconciled here. Abu Dhabi can be a literal and metaphoric mid-point between secular atheism and Islamic fundamentalism, between unrestrained capitalism and totalitarian Marxism. It is about finding the right model for globalisation.&apos;  Few editors can say that about their newspapers - neither, perhaps would they dare to.", "tags": ["Newspapers & magazines", "Media"], "title": "Bridging the Gulf with grand aims and a huge budget", "sentences": ["Two weeks ago, Dubai saw Frank Kane, former Sunday Times and Observer business editor, launch Business 24/7 there.", "Business 24/7 in Dubai is owned by the Arab Media Company, which also belongs eventually to the ruling family."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/dec/23/1", "publicationDate": "2007-12-23T09:43:59Z"}, {"article": "Airports were struggling to recover from the effects of heavy fog yesterday, the busiest travel day of the Christmas holiday. Thousands of passengers had been stranded on Friday by a &apos;white out&apos; that prevented planes from flying at either Gatwick or Southampton airports and caused diversions away from London&apos;s easterly terminals, Stansted and City. More fog was predicted to move in last night, and there were warnings of dangerous driving conditions. A record 3.5 million people plan to fly abroad, many heading for sunny destinations such as the Canary Islands, Egypt, Goa and Dubai. Heathrow airport is predicting it will handle 1.2 million departing passengers by the new year, while Gatwick is preparing for 600,000. In addition 270,000 should take off from Manchester, 170,000 from Luton and 130,000 from Birmingham. About 2,000 people were affected by 16 flight cancellations at Gatwick on Friday. At Southampton all planes were grounded from 5pm and arrivals were diverted to Bournemouth and Birmingham. The bad weather that started last weekend initially threatened the kind of fog blanket that brought planes to a standstill across the country last Christmas, so at Gatwick yesterday morning outbound passengers were relieved to find normality restored. Sue White, a 38-year-old estate agent from Hertford, flying to Gran Canaria with her husband and two sons, had to wait only 10 minutes: &apos;We arrived and were ushered straight through. The service is good and we&apos;re looking forward to our holiday.&apos; Sue Rhodes, a 43-year-old teacher from Littlehampton, said: &apos;We&apos;ve only been here five minutes and they&apos;ve moved us through nearly to the front. We left an hour early as we expected it to be busy but our spirits are high and we&apos;re looking forward to Verona.&apos;  But the future is not cloud-free for those travelling early in the new year. A series of strikes is likely at some of Britain&apos;s busiest airports - including Heathrow, Gatwick and Glasgow - as a row over owner BAA&apos;s pension scheme has provoked union bosses to call for three one-day strikes.  Firefighters, security, clerical and maintenance staff at seven airports operated by BAA will walk out for 24 hours from 6am on 7 January and 14 January, and for 48 hours from 6am on 17 January, in protest at the closure of the final salary pension scheme for new workers.  The collapse of the holiday company Travelscope Holidays is also expected to have an impact. About 10,000 people have had to make new plans for their journeys after the company went into administration on Friday. Yesterday the Association of British Travel Agents said future holidays booked through the Gloucester-based company have been cancelled too.  Trains are to take a large share of the load this Christmas, with Eurostar expecting to carry 150,000 passengers to the continent. Meanwhile, Britain&apos;s roads were operating better than predicted yesterday in the wake of the day often dubbed &apos;Black Friday&apos; because of the pressure put on road networks by the sheer number of people visiting relatives or going on holiday. Traffic flow should be eased this weekend as an embargo on major roadworks comes into play. All but emergency works have been suspended until the new year. The forecasted fog last night was expected to concentrate in southern and central England and Wales as rain cleared through the evening. The Met Office also issued severe weather warnings for north-west England and most of Scotland yesterday, warning of freezing rain and icy roads. There is thought to be little chance of a white Christmas, however, as the weather should turn milder on Christmas Eve, with temperatures as high as 9C (48F) on Christmas Day.

In a similar vein, Soviet Bus Stops by Christopher Herwig (\u00a38.27, stores.lulu.com/chris1042) concentrates on one of the few occasions on which Soviet architecture shed its functionality, plumping instead for a jaunty riot of domes, columns and towers, Islamic detailing and abstract fantasy. Bus stops as yurts, hats, doves - even, in one case, what looks like the office from Being John Malkovich. Perhaps it will catch on here. Architectures of Waiting by Ursula Schulz-Dornburg (Walther Konig \u00a39) poignantly fills out these stage sets with gently humorous portraits of people waiting at bus stops in a remote part of Armenia, alongside shots of the Hejaz railway between Damascus and Medina that has been slowly sinking back into the desert since the Bedouins and TE Lawrence destroyed it in 1917. Finnish film-maker Aki Kaurismaki is an obvious reference, but there&apos;s something of &apos;Ozymandias&apos;, too, in these photos&apos; still, quiet poetry. Meanwhile, back in the metropolis, in a fit of inspiration, Ancient Rome on Five Denarii a Day by Philip Matyszak (Thames and Hudson \u00a312.95) uses the travel guide form - &apos;Getting There&apos;, &apos;Entertainment&apos;, &apos;Law and Order&apos; etc - to bring ancient history to life. From the moment you see the miles of aqueducts racing towards the world&apos;s largest city, the smoke rising from its millions of hearths and forges, the tombs lining the Appian Way, AD200 Rome has you spellbound. The scams people used to get citizenship, Roman attitudes to the countryside, the ingredients of &apos;Trojan pig&apos; - Matyszak imparts so much information so imaginatively that it would be a great thing if his success inspires an entire Thames and Hudson series on similar lines. The Redstone City Diary 2008 (Redstone, \u00a314.95) stylishly sashays through the 20th century, combining images and quotes such as this from Frank O&apos;Hara: &apos;One need never leave the confines of New York to get all the greenery one wishes - I can&apos;t enjoy a blade of grass unless I know there&apos;s a subway handy or a record store or some other sign that people do not totally regret life.&apos; (It&apos;s enough to make you nostalgic.) Elsewhere, With/Without, edited by Shumon Basar, Antonia Carver and Markus Miessen (Bidoun and Moutamarat \u00a312.99), approaches the 21st century from a Middle Eastern perspective. Its articles and photo-essays are refreshingly wide-ranging - illuminating pieces about al-Azhar, Cairo&apos;s first public park, the rebuilding of Martyrs&apos; Square in Beirut, the unlabelled treasures in Syria&apos;s National Museum and the Iraqi National Library, whose director&apos;s incredible blog can be read at bl.uk/iraqdiary - but overall the book is dominated by Dubai. The world&apos;s tallest skyscraper, largest shopping mall, biggest theme park comprising all the world&apos;s major theme parks - Dubai&apos;s fusion of Las Vegas and China&apos;s special economic zones continues to boom at a spectacular rate. Rem Koolhaas, the book&apos;s eminence grise, is clearly right in saying that, as a model for other high-tech cities, Dubai has to be taken seriously. After this, XS Green: Big Ideas, Small Buildings, by Phyllis Richardson (Thames and Hudson \u00a314.95), like a good indie film, is a tonic. &apos;Rucksack houses&apos; - extensions that clip on to the backs of houses - tree houses, buildings made from fridges or barbed wire and sandbags, inflatable abodes you can carry in your pocket - XS Green testifies to a ferment of creativity among architects who are trying to work out how to build in a &apos;humane, sustainable, efficient&apos; way and who share an infectious delight in experimenting and being able to make mistakes while learning. &apos;Small but optimistic&apos; characterises A Year in the Life of an English Meadow by Andy Garnett and Polly Devlin (Frances Lincoln, \u00a320). Having chanced to buy a meadow in Somerset untreated by fertiliser or pesticide, the authors immediately realised what to do. It is now a site of special scientific interest and home to a Manhattan of butterflies, moths and insects. This beautiful, action-packed account of its yearly progress makes one understand, as Devlin says, &apos;that the great tapestries of the Middle Ages are not an artist&apos;s dazzling inspiration of the celestial fields, but an accurate representation of what people saw around them&apos;. The business of restoring land to this state takes generations, but somehow seeing these orchids, enchanter&apos;s nightshades, meadowsweets, sedges, vetches, Yorkshire fogs and corky-fruited water dropworts creates a sense of possibility. Like Raymond Depardon&apos;s memorable autobiography of growing up on a farm in the Saone Valley and becoming a Magnum photographer, Our Farm (Actes Sud, \u00a319.95), there are photos here of the countryside in May that would make anyone happy wherever they are.

A spokesman for Gatwick said fog was no longer affecting the airport, but six flights were cancelled this morning as planes had not arrived on incoming flights. Many passengers flying from Stansted this morning had minor delays but there are currently no cancelled flights there. Airports in Scotland were returning to normal after 25 planes were grounded during the weekend. Five flights in total were to be cancelled today at Edinburgh and Glasgow. Heathrow was forced to cancel more than 80 flights yesterday as the fog refused to clear. By 8pm, 88 outbound flights had been scrapped, along with a similar number of arrivals.

Bhutto was declared dead at 6.16pm (1.16pm GMT) after an attack on a rally by her Pakistan People&apos;s party, ahead of scheduled parliamentary elections in January. Another attempt on her life killed 140 people in October, as supporters took to the streets on her return from exile. Her death has sparked panic among Pakistani bloggers, worried at what will happen next. The Pakistani Spectator says there are already reports that the elections will be postponed. 2.30pm  Dawn News, Pakistan&apos;s only English language news station, reports that Nawaz Sharif, another former Pakistani PM and long time political rival of Bhutto, addressed mourners outside the hospital. He told them Bhutto&apos;s death was an &quot;act of terror&quot; and promised it would not be in vain. &quot;We will not give in to violence,&quot; he is quoted as saying.  Dawn News is also reporting violence in Lahore, where it says posters advertising the election have been torn down, and Hyderabad, where cars are being set on fire. People have been advised to stay indoors. 2.50pm People have flocked to the Rawalpindi General hospital and have been chanting anti-Musharraf slogans, including describing him as a &quot;dog&quot;. The violence also seems to be spreading, with reports of trouble in Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Karachi, Peshawar, Multan, and Quetta.  3.05pm UK foreign secretary David Miliband said he was &quot;deeply shocked&quot; by the events of today. US officials have said they are looking into reports of Bhutto&apos;s death and the White House has not released a statement yet. But US presidential candidates have already been adding their words to the international condemnation. 3.25pm US president George Bush will speak about Bhutto&apos;s death in 40 minutes, according to the BBC. Police officials have confirmed that she was shot in the neck before her attacker blew himself up.  The grief caused by her death and concerns about its implications for the future of Pakistan have not been limited to PPP supporters.  3.40pm President Pervez Musharraf has condemned the attack in the &quot;strongest possible terms&quot;, reports Pakistan&apos;s state news agency. He has convened an emergency meeting. The UN security council is also holding an emergency session at 5pm GMT to discuss the assassination.  3.55pm The Afghanistan president, Hamed Karzai, just held a press conference in which he said he spoke to Bhutto today. He described the attack as one of &quot;cowardice and immense brutality&quot; and said Bhutto had &quot;sacrificed her life for the sake of Pakistan and for the sake of this region&quot;. 4.10pm A full statement from Bush is expected shortly but he has just told reporters: &quot;The United States strongly condemns this cowardly act by murderous extremists who are trying to undermine Pakistan&apos;s democracy. Those who committed this crime must be brought to justice.&quot; A statement from Gordon Brown is also said to be imminent. 4.20pm Bhutto&apos;s husband Asif Ali Zadari spoke briefly to GEO TV, as he made his way from Dubai to Karachi. &quot;We will see what has happened,&quot; he said. We don&apos;t believe all of what&apos;s been said. We will see then we will believe it.&quot; Bush has made a statement. He repeated his previous comments to reporters and urged Pakistanis to &quot;honour&quot; Bhutto&apos;s memory by continuing with elections. &quot;We stand with the people in Pakistan in the struggle against the forces of terror and extremism,&quot; he said. 4.25pm Musharraf has announced three days of mourning in Pakistan and has been in contact with Bhutto&apos;s husband regarding funeral arrangements according to the country&apos;s official news agency. UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon called the assassination an &quot;assault on stability&quot; in Pakistan. 4.35pm British prime minister Gordon Brown has just described Bhutto as &quot;a woman of immense political courage and bravery&quot;. &quot;She risked everything in an attempt to win democracy in Pakistan,&quot; he said. &quot;She has been assassinated by cowards, afraid of democracy.&quot; He adds that terrorists &quot;must not win here, there or anywhere in the world&quot;. 4.50pm President Musharraf said on Pakistani TV that the attack was &quot;the work of those terrorists with whom we are engaged in war&quot;. &quot;I have been saying that the nation faces the greatest threats from these terrorists. Today after this tragic incident, I want to express my firm resolve. I express my resolve that -- and I also seek solidarity from the nation and cooperation and help -- we will not rest until we eliminate these terrorists and root them out,&quot; he said.

Even before Bhutto returned to Pakistan in October after eight years of self-imposed exile, there had been open threats against her. A pro-Taliban militant leader, Baitullah Masood, said he would target her with suicide attacks. Masood, probably the most prominent militant leader in the north-western region bordering Afghanistan, has also been accused of carrying out attacks on Pakistani soldiers. Bhutto&apos;s pro-western attitude would have made her a natural target for militant Islamists. Another militant commander, Haji Omar, said before her return: &quot;She has an agreement with America. We will carry out attacks on Benazir Bhutto as we did on General Pervez Musharraf [the Pakistani president].&quot; Authorities had warned Bhutto that extremists sympathetic to the Taliban and al-Qaida would target her. Who else is in the frame? After the October assassination attempt, Bhutto&apos;s husband, Asif Ali Zardari, who is in Dubai where the couple had been living in exile, accused members of the Pakistani security services, the ISI. &quot;I blame government for these blasts,&quot; he said. &quot;It is the work of the intelligence agencies.&quot; Elements of the ISI sympathise with the Taliban and it was a possibility that &quot;rogue elements&quot; in the intelligence services were involved in the two attacks. The ISI became one of Pakistan&apos;s most powerful institutions under General Zia-ul-Haq, the man who launched an Islamisation campaign and who overthrew Bhutto&apos;s father and had him hung. After Gen Zia&apos;s death in a mysterious plane crash in 1988, the ISI actively campaigned against Bhutto when she entered politics. Has there been other violence? Hours before Bhutto&apos;s death, four people were killed and three wounded in a clash just outside Islamabad between pro-government supporters and backers of the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Last week, more than 50 people were killed when a suicide attacker detonated a bomb at a crowded mosque near the home of Pakistan&apos;s former interior minister on one of Islam&apos;s major holidays.

She was only 35. People magazine included her among its Fifty Most Beautiful People. A decade later she was mired in corruption scandals, and left friendless. As she recalled from exile this year: &quot;There were days when no one wanted to see us or talk to us.&quot; Then, in another dramatic twist in her volatile career, she was nurtured in Washington and London as the best hope for a restoration of democracy, to bring an element of legitimacy to President Musharraf&apos;s &quot;war on terror&quot;. Mistrusted by the army and the powerful intelligence services, and reviled by Pakistan&apos;s Islamist clerics and parties, she knew the dangers she faced when she returned in October to broker a controversial deal which might have seen her elected as prime minister in the new year, for the third time. After Pakistani security forces stormed the Red Mosque in Islamabad in July, killing more than 100 militant students, she remarked: &quot;There will be a backlash, but some time we have to stop appeasing the militants.&quot; Just before her return from her exile in Dubai she clearly foresaw her own fate, telling the pan-Arab Asharq al-Awsat newspaper: &quot;They might try and assassinate me. I have prepared my family and my loved ones for any possibility.&quot; The backlash, threatened by Islamist elements, started sooner than she anticipated. On the day she landed, her celebration convoy was attacked by suicide bombers leaving nearly 150 dead and hundreds injured. Yesterday was, for many observers, a tragedy waiting in the wings. Bhutto was born in Karachi in 1953, into a wealthy landowning family which became one of the world&apos;s most recognisable political dynasties. Her father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto became the country&apos;s first democratically elected leader. The eldest of four children, she was educated at Roman Catholic mission schools in Karachi before going on to Harvard University and Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford where she completed a course in international law and diplomacy. In 1976, amid intense media interest, she was elected president of the Oxford Union, becoming the first Asian woman to head the debating society. Her gilded youth was soon to be marked by the first of several family traumas. Overthrown in a coup by the army chief General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, her father was executed in 1979 after a dubious trial on charges of conspiracy to murder a political dissident. In 1980 her brother Shahnawaz was killed in mysterious circumstances in his apartment on the French Riviera. For five years, she and her mother were in and out of prison, much of the time in solitary confinement, until she was allowed to go abroad for medical treatment in 1984. She returned in 1986 to an ecstatic reception from her followers to launch a campaign against military rule. In 1988, Zia was killed in an air crash and in the elections that year her party, the Pakistan People&apos;s party, won the largest bloc of seats in the national assembly. With power came allegations that she and her husband had stolen millions. After only 20 months in office she was dismissed by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan on charges of corruption. In 1993 she was re-elected and again dismissed three years later, this time by President Farooq Leghari, on similar charges. Just before she was ousted the family suffered a further violent blow. Bhutto&apos;s other brother, Murtaza, who had returned to Pakistan after 15 years in exile building up a militant group to avenge his father&apos;s death, was killed in an encounter with the police. Critics have argued that Bhutto&apos;s two administrations were long on rhetoric and short on delivery. Although her election campaigns were full of promises about the role and welfare of women, there was little legislative action, partly because of entrenched opposition from religious and feudal forces, particularly the ultra rightwing party, Jamaat-e-Islami. One American historian described her as &quot;one of the most incompetent leaders in the history of south Asia&quot;. During her second tenure the Taliban took power in Afghanistan with considerable sympathy and support from the dark forces of Pakistan&apos;s body politic - the Army&apos;s Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence. But it was the allegations of corruption that left an indelible stain. She claimed they were politically motivated. They began at the beginning of her political career in 1987 when she married the businessman Asif Ali Zardari. He played a prominent role in both her administrations and won himself a reputation as Mr 10 Percent for a variety of imaginative kickback enterprises that led to still-ongoing money laundering proceedings in Switzerland and Spain. In 1999, Bhutto and her husband were sentenced to five years in jail and fined $8.6m (\u00a34.3m) on charges of taking kickbacks from a Swiss company hired to fight customs fraud. A higher court later overturned the conviction as biased. Bhutto was abroad at the time of her conviction and chose not to return to Pakistan. Asif spent eight years in prison before being released on bail in 2004. Bhutto stayed in self-imposed exile in Dubai with her three children - Bilawal, Bakhtwar and Aseefa - and her mother who is suffering from Alzheimer&apos;s disease. These were the years of isolation. Largely snubbed by senior politicians, she was a regular visitor to western capitals where her elegant and charismatic presence still had purchase with the university and thinktank speaking circuit. In 2006 her road to rehabilitation began. She joined the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy with her arch-rival Nawaz Sharif, then living in Saudi Arabia. On January 27 2007 she was invited by the United States to speak to President Bush and congressional and state department officials. Washington was concerned that Musharraf&apos;s insistence on holding presidential elections while remaining as commander-in-chief would make a mockery of his claim to have a democratic mandate. With American blessing, a deal was hatched. Bhutto was given immunity from prosecution on the corruption charges and Musharraf would relinquish his uniform - but only after kicking out the senior judges and chief justice who tried to block him standing for election again. The expectation was that he would remain as civilian president and she would be prime minister. Just like in 1986, her return in October was greeted by her supporters like the second coming. After the carnage of the first day she took to the campaign trail with gusto, but knowing all the time that there were those close at hand plotting her final elimination. Tributes &quot;The United States strongly condemns this cowardly act by murderous extremists who are trying to undermine Pakistan&apos;s democracy. Ms Bhutto served her nation twice as prime minister, and she knew that her return to Pakistan put her life at risk. Yet she refused to allow assassins to dictate the course of her country. We stand with the people of Pakistan. We urge them to honour Benazir Bhutto&apos;s memory by continuing with the democratic process for which she so bravely gave her life.&quot;President George Bush &quot;Benazir Bhutto was a woman of immense personal courage and bravery. Knowing as she did the threats to her life, and the previous attempt at assassination, she risked everything in her attempt to win democracy in Pakistan.

Her murder by extremists is a body blow for freedom and democracy in Pakistan. My prayers are for her husband, children and family, that they will be comforted at this time of grief.&quot;Rt Rev Dr Michael Nazir-Ali, Bishop of Rochester &quot;She was fiery, determined and a whirlwind of energy.

Angry scenes erupted in cities across the country, where enraged supporters torched businesses and trains, attacked police and blocked roads with burning tyres. Gunfire rang out on the streets of Karachi, the port city where Bhutto spent much of her life. Two months after her triumphant return from exile, a gunman fired several shots at Bhutto as she left an election rally in Rawalpindi, hitting her in the neck and chest. Seconds later a fireball caused by a suicide bomb engulfed her bulletproof car and killed at least 20 supporters. The former prime minister was rushed to a nearby hospital where distraught supporters burst through doors, smashed windows and tried to storm into the operating theatre where surgeons struggled to save her life. She was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. Supporters wept and crumpled to the ground outside the hospital. Cries of &quot;Musharraf is a murderer&quot; and &quot;Long Live Bhutto&quot; rang out. Initial suspicions for the attack fell on Islamist militants who had previously threatened to kill the 54-year-old scion of Pakistan&apos;s greatest political dynasty. Late last night there were unconfirmed reports that al-Qaida had claimed responsibility on an Islamist website. In October, Bhutto survived a suicide attack on her homecoming parade in Karachi that killed 140. The assassination is the climax of an extraordinary chain of crises to have rocked Pakistan in the past nine months as President Pervez Musharraf sought to consolidate his grip on power amid sieges, suicide bombings, high political drama and a surge in Islamist violence. In a brief televised address Musharraf declared three days of mourning. &quot;This is the work of those terrorists with whom we are engaged in war,&quot; he said. &quot;We will not rest until we eliminate these terrorists.&quot; Analysts said Musharraf might seize on the turmoil to postpone the January poll and possibly reimpose the emergency rule he established on November 3 but lifted shortly before Christmas. Riaz Malik, of the opposition Pakistan Movement for Justice party said many fingers would be pointed at the Musharraf regime. He said: &quot;The impact will be that Pakistan is in more turmoil - it will be the start of civil war in Pakistan. There is a very real danger of civil war.&quot; The UN security council held an emergency session to discuss the assassination in the nuclear-armed country, which it described as a threat to international peace and stability. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said he was &quot;shocked and outraged&quot;. In a statement urging countries to cooperate with the Pakistani authorities, the security council &quot;underlined the need to bring perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism to justice&quot;. Pakistan&apos;s alarmed western allies mixed condemnation and tributes with calls for restraint and a continuation of the fragile political process. In Britain, Gordon Brown hailed Bhutto as &quot;a woman of immense personal courage and bravery&quot;. The prime minister said: &quot;She risked everything in her attempt to win democracy in Pakistan. Benazir Bhutto may have been killed by terrorists, but the terrorists must not be allowed to kill democracy in Pakistan.&quot; A sombre President George Bush, speaking near his ranch in Crawford, Texas, condemned the killing as a &quot;cowardly act by murderous extremists who are trying to undermine Pakistan&apos;s democracy&quot;. In Moscow, President Vladimir Putin sent a telegram to Musharraf saying Bhutto&apos;s murder was &quot;a challenge thrown down by forces of terrorism, not only to Pakistan but also to the entire international community,&quot; Russian news reports said. The Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, said the subcontinent had &quot;lost an outstanding leader&quot;. The murder is the latest catastrophe to befall the Bhutto family. Benazir Bhutto&apos;s father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was deposed by a military dictator in 1977 and hanged two years later. Her two brothers were killed in murky circumstances in following decades. Bhutto became the Muslim world&apos;s first female prime minister in 1988, but a second term of office ended amid corruption allegations in 1996. She returned from exile last October in the garb of a democratic champion but was criticised for holding power-sharing talks with Musharraf. Yesterday her killer struck as she left Liaqat Bagh, a public park in Rawalpindi where she addressed thousands of supporters at an election rally. As she was driven out of the park - standing from the sunroof of her bulletproof vehicle wearing her trademark white headscarf and waving to supporters - a young man leapt forward brandishing a gun. Several gunshots rang out and Bhutto fell back inside. Seconds later a blast rocked the vehicle, showering it with shrapnel. Rescuers found Bhutto lying in pool of blood on the back seat. A senior party official, Amin Fahim, who had been sitting beside her, said he heard &quot;between three and five shots&quot;. Amir Qureshi, a bodyguard from Bhutto&apos;s youth wing who had been jogging alongside her vehicle, said she was shot first in the neck, then in the head. &quot;This is a black day not only for Pakistan but also the rest of the world,&quot; he told the Guardian from his hospital bed, where he was being treated for leg wounds. Doctors administered open heart massage but Bhutto died from a bullet that severed her spinal cord, one medic at the Rawalpindi hospital said. The opposition leader Nawaz Sharif, also recently returned from exile, arrived at the hospital and sat by Bhutto&apos;s body. &quot;Benazir Bhutto was also my sister, and I will be with you to take the revenge for her death,&quot; he said later. &quot;Don&apos;t feel alone. I am with you. We will take the revenge on the rulers.&quot; Earlier, a Sharif rally in Rawalpindi had come under fire from a gunman, who killed at least four people and wounded several more. Sharif told the BBC: &quot;I think perhaps none of us is inclined to take up the elections. We&apos;ll have to sit down and take a very serious look at the current situation.&quot; Late last night Bhutto&apos;s body, in a plain wooden coffin, was flown to her home province of Sindh accompanied by her husband Asif Zardari and their three children, who had flown in from Dubai. She may be buried as early as today near her ancestral village in Larkana. Bhutto&apos;s resting place will be inside a mausoleum built in recent years to house her father and two brothers. Now, in the latest chapter of Pakistan&apos;s most cursed political dynasty, she will join them.

She was back in the country after spending more than eight years in exile to avoid corruption charges. She was born in the southern port of Karachi, the daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, an ambitious minor landowner in the province of Sindh who founded one of Pakistan&apos;s two major political parties and went on to become the country&apos;s prime minister. His daughter was never destined for an easy or uneventful life. One of her abiding memories, described in her memoirs, Daughter of the East, was saying goodbye to her father in a prison cell hours before his execution in 1979 by the military dictator Zia ul-Haq. Subsequently, Bhutto herself spent long periods under house arrest or in solitary confinement before her exile. Yet much of her youth was happy. Educated at elite English-language Pakistani schools, several run by nuns, she lived the life of an indulged and adored wealthy child and teenager. Like many of her social class, she was sent overseas for her further education. From 1969 to 1973 she attended Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and then Harvard University, where she obtained a degree in comparative government before, from 1973 to 1977, studying philosophy, politics and economics at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where as a natural speaker, she was elected president of the Oxford Union. Those who spent time with her over the years became used to her lengthy, eloquent and sometimes well-informed monologues. Bhutto was also known for driving around Oxford in an open-top sports car. But the innocent days of youthful political activism did not last long. Her father was dismissed as prime minister in 1975, sentenced to death two years later and hanged by Zia despite international outrage on April 4 1979. A year later, Bhutto&apos;s brother Shahnawaz died in suspicious circumstances in the south of France. After a long period under house arrest in Pakistan, she managed to leave for Britain, basing herself in a flat at the Barbican in the City of London. In exile, she took on the leadership of the Pakistan People&apos;s Party (PPP), the party her father had founded, and on December 18 1987 married, in an arranged match that surprised many, another young southern Pakistani aristocrat, Asif Ali Zardari, who had a reputation of being something of a playboy. They went on to have three children: Bilawal, Bakhtwar, and Aseefa. When Zia was killed in a plane crash in 1988, the way was open for a return to democratic rule in Pakistan. Bhutto, still only 35, returned to her homeland to lead the PPP to victory in elections. Around the world she was feted as young, charismatic, moderate and one of the first democratically-elected woman leaders of a major Muslim nation. Her perfect English, her undoubted good looks and her charm helped too. People Magazine included her in its list of the 50 most beautiful people in the world. But celebrations were short-lived. Political opponents and elements within Islamist parties and the military worked hard to destabilise her inexperienced administration, and within two years, her first government had been dismissed amid allegations of corruption and incompetence. She had had little time to enact any of her campaign promises of social, economic and political reform. Though the accusations did not necessarily involve Bhutto personally, her husband earned the nickname Mr Ten Percent. Zardari denied all allegations against him. Three years later, Bhutto&apos;s PPP was returned to power again - with the same opposition, the same manipulation, and the same results. In 1996, the then president once again dismissed her administration, again citing allegations of corruption and gross incompetence. Bhutto&apos;s opponents spent millions investigating her business affairs, one mystery in particular - that of the exact ownership of a large manor house in southern England, purchased for millions of pounds to which crates of Bhutto family heirlooms were shipped. Controversy also focused on the exact role of the Bhutto government in the formation and success of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, which formed in 1994 and took Kabul in 1996, a few days after the dismissal of Bhutto&apos;s second administration. She maintained that no military or logistic assistance was offered to the movement, though there was continual &quot;political engagement&quot;. This, she said in one of her last interviews, was &quot;logical and reasonable&quot; as it was important to try and moderate the movement and use it to stabilise Afghanistan. Out of power from 1996, Bhutto was vulnerable to moves to convict her on the outstanding corruption charges. A conviction in 1999 for failing to appear in court was later overturned after audiotapes revealed heavy political pressure placed on the principal judge by top aides of then prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Increasingly isolated, she left Pakistan in 1999 to live in Dubai and London. The military coup that autumn made any immediate return difficult. General Pervez Musharraf, who took charge, made little secret of his contempt for the civilian politicians whom he believed had nearly ruined Pakistan. However, the PPP organisation remained intact with a strong power base in its heartland of the southern rural Sindh province along with more rural parts of the Punjab where the Bhutto family name lost little of its prestige. During her years outside Pakistan, Bhutto lived with her three children in Dubai, where she was joined by her husband after he was freed in 2004. She gave frequent interviews, continued to organise the PPP and was a regular visitor to western capitals, delivering lectures at universities and meeting government officials. Relations with the press were carefully maintained, with large sums devoted to a major lobbying effort in Washington and the hire of a top-ranking public relations firm. Journalists who referred to the outstanding corruption allegations against her would receive polite emails reminding them that the charges had never been proven and that they were politically motivated. The political climate began to change during 2007 as Musharraf made a series of major political errors, rapidly losing support after clumsy confrontations with the judiciary. A consummate political operator to the last, Bhutto saw a chance to make a glorious return to Pakistan and win power once again. Negotiations with the president and head of the armed forces lasted through the summer, blessed by Washington and London. A deal was done that saw Bhutto&apos;s members of the national assembly effectively acquiesce to Musharraf&apos;s re-election as president in return for an amnesty preserving her and much of her entourage from investigation for past misdeeds. However, her triumphal return was marred by the suicide bombing that narrowly missed her and killed scores of her supporters in Karachi on October 18. Following the attack, Bhutto, who was convinced that a shadowy cabal of retired army officers and Islamic militant sympathisers was behind the strike, told close associates that the deal with Musharraf was off. Winning power at the elections to be held next month was all the more vital. Campaigning with customary verve and energy, inveighing continually against the failure to provide her with sufficient security, she started touring the country two weeks ago. One aim was to reacquaint herself with the people of Pakistan after her long exile. But her performances, hectoring local workers not to allow the government to rig the poll, calling for an end to militancy, and invoking the legacy of her late father, were vintage Bhutto. She is survived by her husband, son and two daughters. \u00b7 Benazir Bhutto, politician, born June 21 1953; died December 27 2007", "tags": ["Pakistan", "World news", "Benazir Bhutto", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Obituary: Benazir Bhutto", "sentences": ["Increasingly isolated, she left Pakistan in 1999 to live in Dubai and London.", "During her years outside Pakistan, Bhutto lived with her three children in Dubai, where she was joined by her husband after he was freed in 2004."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/28/pakistan.obituaries", "publicationDate": "2007-12-28T02:16:07Z"}, {"article": "The assassination of Benazir Bhutto has led many to declare the end of the Bhutto political dynasty, but such predictions could be premature. Bhutto&apos;s husband, Asif Ali Zardari - who was jailed for corruption and is known as Mr 10% in Pakistan - is surely too discredited to take up the mantle of leading the Pakistan People&apos;s party, but the couple have three children. While the horrific manner in which their mother died may strike some as the strongest possible deterrent to any involvement in Pakistani politics, it should be remembered that it was the death of her father that propelled Bhutto - who had initially considered a career in diplomacy - into the political arena. She was 25 when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was hanged, two years after he had been removed as prime minister in a military coup orchestrated by General Zia ul-Haq. Her brothers, Murtaza and Shahnawaz, became involved in organising opposition to Zia before both died in mysterious circumstances. There is also precedent for the offspring of a murdered former leader taking up the political baton in neighbouring India. Indira Gandhi, the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, was assassinated by two of her bodyguards in 1984. Her younger son, Sanjay, followed her into politics, attracting controversy and hatred over a programme to clear the slums of Delhi. He died in a plane crash in 1980, and his brother, Rajiv - an airline pilot - showed little interest in politics until his mother was killed. On her death, he was persuaded by the Congress party that he was the only feasible successor to her. He became prime minister but was murdered by a suicide bomber believed to be linked to Sri Lanka&apos;s Tamil Tigers in 1991. The difference with Bhutto is that her children are all still in their teens. Her son, Bilawal, is the eldest child at 19, and her two daughters, Bakhtawar and Aseefa, are 17 and 14 respectively. All currently live in Dubai with Zardari. Bhutto&apos;s estranged niece, Fatima - who opposed her aunt&apos;s return to Pakistan from exile in October - is one possibility. The 25-year-old has been hailed in some quarters as a possible PPP leader of the future. Before Bhutto&apos;s assassination, Fatima said that she would not be entering the political scene at any time soon. The fact that she opposed her aunt - a fact unlikely to be looked on kindly by PPP supporters still grieving their leader&apos;s death - is perhaps even more of an obstacle. That leaves Bilawal as the most likely heir. He is already following in his mother&apos;s footsteps by studying at Oxford. At the age of 16, he gave an interview to Dawn News in which he condemned the treatment of his family. When the Taekwondo black belt was asked whether he would pursue a career in politics, he left the door ajar. &quot;We will see, I don&apos;t know,&quot; he replied. &quot;I would like to help the people of Pakistan, so I will decide when I finish my studies.&quot; Perhaps yesterday&apos;s events will have made the decision for him.", "tags": ["Pakistan", "World news", "Benazir Bhutto", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "The end of a political dynasty?", "sentences": ["All currently live in Dubai with Zardari."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/28/pakistan.benazirbhutto2", "publicationDate": "2007-12-28T17:24:28Z"}, {"article": "Even without the ill-fated Iktitaf, Irish trainer Noel Meade should have a strong hand in the Champion Hurdle. Responsible for three of the top 10 in the betting, Meade sends out Jazz Messenger to further his claim in the bewleyhotels December Festival Hurdle at Leopardstown today. Harchibald, touched off in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton this week, and Aitmatov, who has beaten Ebaziyan and Farmer Brown this season, were both entered for today&apos;s Grade One event. But Meade relies on Jazz Messenger (1.55), who is an improved performer this season. The trainer puts that down to the gelding&apos;s slicker jumping. Jazz Messenger pounced late under Paul Carberry when beating the tough Sweet Kiln at Navan last time, and at Punchestown before that he readily accounted for Farmer Brown, Clopf and Ebaziyan. Hardy Eustace beat Jazz Messenger 10 lengths into fifth spot in last season&apos;s AIG Champion Hurdle, but Meade&apos;s runner has done enough this term to suggest he can turn tables on Hardy Eustace, who may find it tough dropping back from three miles plus at Ascot last week. Bangor 1.45 Though best known as a staying chaser, Joaaci showed form over hurdles last year, notably when beating Blue Splash at Hereford, which entitles him to go close off a mark of 135. Newbury 2.05 Helens Vision stole a march on her rivals at the start and was never challenged on her hurdles debut. She might not find things so easy under a penalty, and it is worth recalling that Theatre Girl finished a long way clear of Helens Vision when they were second and fourth, respectively, behind Turbo Linn in a Listed Aintree bumper last season. Musselburgh 2.20 Kalahari King finished an eye-catching third on his hurdling debut here. This half-mile shorter trip should not be a problem. Newbury 2.40 Elusive Dream is the selected of a strong Paul Nicholls entry but he tired badly in similar conditions when a distant fourth to Razor Royale at Cheltenham and it can pay to stick with the latter, who was unlucky not to follow up at the same course next time. No four-year-old has won this in the past 10 years, which suggests Lighting Strike will do well to complete his hat-trick. Musselburgh 2.55 This looks straightforward for Some Touch, who was taking on stronger opposition when finishing second behind Roman Ark at Haydock. Newbury 3.10 Colin Tizzard is enjoying a great run, with seven winners and a near 50% strike-rate in the past fortnight, and the trainer can take this with Nougat De L&apos;Isle. Third behind Lead On and subsequent scorer Verasi at Exeter last time, the six-year-old looks sure to benefit from this test of stamina. Musselburgh 3.25 A 7lb penalty barely gets close to covering the improvement Palomar showed to hack up by six lengths at Kempton on Thursday. Provided this does not come too soon for him, he will surely follow up. Horse sense My Way De Solzen apart, the Alan King stable has been in good form over Christmas and at Newbury today big things are expected of Theatre Girl (2.05). This highly regarded filly has had a slight foot problem but is said to be in tremendous form again. Ben de Haan did this column a good turn with Uffa Fox at Ascot last week, but his runners in today&apos;s bumper at Newbury will do well to keep up with Strategic Approach (3.40), who is one of Carl Llewellyn&apos;s nicest young prospects. Celestial Halo (1.00) is rated Triumph Hurdle material in the Paul Nicholls yard, and we hear Ruby Walsh was greatly taken by the French import Tatenen when runner-up to Franchoek in Thursday&apos;s Finale Hurdle. Moon Over Miami (12.30), not seen at his best last time, will be more effective round today&apos;s left-hand Newbury circuit. There were excuses for Air Force One (1.35) on his chasing debut here, and he can fare better this afternoon. Trainer Charlie Mann can also go close at Bangor with Sullumo (2.15), who will be suited by the step up to three miles. Nicky Henderson&apos;s newcomer Khyber Kim will be worth noting at Newbury today, but for future reference it is Dave&apos;s Dream and The Polomoche who are rated particularly smart hurdling prospects. The stable has rarely had a novice jump better than The Polomoche, who beat Calgary Bay in a Ludlow bumper on his only run last season. Afsoun (3.20) is reckoned worth another chance at Cheltenham on Tuesday. Alan King can land the bumper here with Awesome George (3.55), and stable companion Sassanias (4.05) goes to Exeter the same day with a big chance. At Lingfield&apos;s all-weather meeting today we have a good mark for Kingsgate Castle (2.00), while at Taunton tomorrow Johnny Bissett (2.25) is thought capable of a bold bid. Seen and heard If you go racing at Southwell, it&apos;s fair to assume the Flat is your preference. But a large crowd for Thursday&apos;s meeting were shocked when close-circuit TV coverage of the Welsh National disappeared from the screens at the third-last fence to make way for the start of Southwell&apos;s mile and a half handicap. While no one wants to see fallers, it is clear that Haydock&apos;s portable fences are not providing a true test of jumping - one jockey has described them as &quot;big hurdles&quot; that an unschooled horse could go round. Gone are the days when the course was a preparation for Grand National horses. The narrowness of the shared chase/hurdles course has also irked some riders, with one commenting that you have to go &quot;eight-wide&quot; down the back straight to find decent ground. For budding jockey Jack Mitchell, 2008 could be a breakthrough year. The son of Epsom trainer Philip Mitchell, who recently temporarily relinquished his licence, Jack is now apprentice to Newmarket trainer Chris Wall, for whom he won on Ace Of Hearts at Goodwood last summer. He rides Master Pegasus for his new stable at Lingfield tomorrow, and another door opens for Mitchell at Southwell on Tuesday when he has his first ride for Sir Mark Prescott on Wicked Daze at Southwell. Hamdan Al Maktoum&apos;s continued success in America this year may have sent a few shivers down the spines of his trainers in Britain, particularly as he was quoted in Daily Racing Form that he had sent two horses to be trained in the US as he &quot;wasn&apos;t satisfied with the philosophy of their trainers [in Europe]&quot;. Hamdan generally has around 100 yearlings in Dubai in readiness for a European campaign; this time we gather the number is fewer than 40. Ron Cox&apos;s tip of the day Killard Point 3.45 Bangor After a successful spell of summer jumping, Killard Point has come back from a rest in good shape. Although beaten off this mark on his last two starts, he has been facing stiffer tasks. He ran into the revitalised Alfadora at Sandown last time, having previously finished third to good sorts over this course and distance.

That conviction, which led Bhutto to anoint herself the party&apos;s lifetime leader, now leaves the PPP scrambling to regroup. It may also mean that Bhutto&apos;s party could die with her. &quot;She would talk about democracy but what she meant is the connection with the people that her father passed on to her,&quot; said Thomas Simons, who was US ambassador to Islamabad during Bhutto&apos;s first prime ministership in the early 90s. &quot;Institutions were not very important. The PPP was really the engine for her personal mission.&quot; Though the PPP has cadres and organisations in all Pakistan&apos;s provinces, Bhutto - and a personal clique - maintained a firm hand on decision-making. That prevented the emergence of a secondary tier of leadership. It also alienated liberal and progressive Pakistanis who should have been the PPP&apos;s natural supporters. &quot;They were all dwarfed by Bhutto. They were all middle-ranking people who never really developed into frontline leaders,&quot; said Azmat Hassan, a former Pakistani diplomat who was an adviser to Bhutto. However, the last eight years of exile forced Bhutto to cede some control over events in Pakistan to Makhdoom Amin Fahim, who headed the party in the national assembly. Fahim was mentioned repeatedly yesterday as a possible interim leader for the PPP. Like Bhutto, Fahim, who is 68, is a product of a feudal land-owning family from southern Sindh province. He also carries a certain cultural authority as the descendant of a family of Sufi spiritual leaders, or pirs. Fahim describes himself as a social moderate, and has acknowledged drinking alcohol. His sisters, however, have led much more circumscribed lives. He is the second generation of his family to align its fortunes with the Bhuttos; his father was one of the original founders of the PPP in 1969. Other names in circulation include Aitzaz Ahsan, 62, a charismatic lawyer and human rights activist from Lahore. Ahsan served in Bhutto&apos;s first cabinet as interior minister, but later broke with the PPP leader. He was a leader of the movement that fought General Musharraf&apos;s attempts to tame Pakistan&apos;s judiciary. However, the prospects of any of those candidates have to be weighed against the wishes of Pakistan&apos;s military establishment. It is unlikely Pakistan&apos;s generals would mourn the demise of the PPP; the party had been its most consistent opponent over the last half century of rotating dictatorships. The military especially would be uneasy at the prospect of having so independent an operator as Ahsan as PPP leader. It is also unclear whether Fahim, from Sindh, or Ahsan, from Punjab, would be able to transcend the faultlines in Pakistani politics, which leave the country bitterly divided by region, class and ethnicity. Though Fahim and Ahsan were the main names in contention yesterday, it is also too early to rule out an attempt by Bhutto&apos;s husband, Asif Ali Zardari, to take over, even though he is widely reviled in Pakistan, where he is seen as corrupt. Other prospects of a Bhutto heir are more remote. Her elderly mother, Nusrat, who was living with her in Dubai, has been in failing health following a stroke and the onset of Alzheimer&apos;s disease. Bhutto&apos;s sister, Sanam, the last surviving member of her generation, has long shunned politics. Bhutto&apos;s children are still in their teens. Maintaining the party&apos;s relevance in all of Pakistan&apos;s provinces in the absence of the star power that Bhutto provided could prove beyond the power of even the most able successor. &quot;In my view, the party will not survive,&quot; said Peter Galbraith, a former US diplomat and a friend of Bhutto from their college days. &quot;It was the last national party in Pakistan, and she was the last Pakistani politician, the last national politician.&quot; Election Poll still set for January The January 8 elections were still on schedule last night but it remained uncertain how many of the 16 opposition parties in the national assembly would take part. Nawaz Sharif of the Pakistan Muslim League-N, with 19 seats in the assembly, has said his party would boycott the vote and he has been banned from contesting a seat because of convictions for terrorism and hijacking. Sharif, who was deposed as prime minister by Musharraf in the 1999 coup, has denied that he could gain political capital out of the assassination. Bhutto&apos;s Pakistan People&apos;s party, which held 81 seats, has decided to wait until the end of the three days of mourning before making a decision. With the leader gone there is no obvious successor. The Pakistan Muslim League Quaid-e-Azam is the largest party, with 126 seats, and has offered unconditional support to Musharraf. It is led by Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, whose family has backed every military dictator since General Ayub Khan in the 50s. The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal is a group of six religious parties which holds 63 seats and campaigns on an anti-US platform. Musharraf made them the official opposition in what critics saw as an attempt to show that Islamist forces were about the take over the country.David Pallister", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "A leader's legacy to her followers: the movement's fight for survival", "sentences": ["Her elderly mother, Nusrat, who was living with her in Dubai, has been in failing health following a stroke and the onset of Alzheimer&apos;s disease."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/29/pakistan.topstories31", "publicationDate": "2007-12-29T23:07:41Z"}, {"article": "The first time Benazir Bhutto was thrown out of power, she told her daughter Bakhtawar: &quot;If anybody teases you at school, just tell them, &apos;But your mother was never prime minister of Pakistan.&apos; &quot; Or so the story goes. In Pakistan, where the lives of the Bhutto family have been so closely entwined with the history of the country, it does seems like a credible anecdote. Bhutto&apos;s assassination begins a possibly even more bitter and bloodstained chapter of her family saga. Her death leaves no obvious heir for now. Her three children, son Bilawal, and daughters Bakhtawar and Aseefa are all still in their teens. Her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, is a discredited and reviled figure in Pakistan, where he is associated with the corruption charges that sank both her governments. The next in the line of succession would face rivals, and typically for large and landed Pakistani families, some of the most determined of these are also blood relatives - the would-be heirs of Bhutto&apos;s brother, Murtaza. After his death, his widow, Ghinwa, whom he met during exile in Syria, took up the leadership of his breakaway faction of the PPP. Murtaza&apos;s daughter by his first wife, Fatima Bhutto, has also emerged as a harsh critic of her estranged aunt. Bhutto&apos;s father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was hanged in 1979 by the dictator of the day in Pakistan, General Muhammad Zia ul-Haq. His death plunged Bhutto, then a cosseted daughter who had spent her youth at Harvard and Oxford, into the tumult of Pakistani politics. In 1987, at an advanced age in Pakistan for a bride, she consented to an arranged marriage with the son of a Karachi cinema hall owner, Asif Ali Zardari. The match between the intelligent, worldy Bhutto and the son of a traditional feudal family mystified her western friends. But within a year, she became prime minister, wrote a book, and had her first child. &quot;In politics she carried her father&apos;s legacy, but in her personal life she was her own self. I don&apos;t think that she was thinking [that] her son or daughter ought to pick up the banner of the PPP,&quot; said Peter Galbraith, a former US diplomat who befriended Bhutto during their second year at Harvard. &quot;I don&apos;t think she has laid on her children the same expectations that were laid on her, or that she created for herself.&quot; Bhutto was the mainstay of her children&apos;s life in recent years as her husband served several years in prison in Pakistan on suspicion of murder and corruption and sought medical treatment for a heart condition in the US. She and her children lived in Dubai. Galbraith said Bhutto delayed her return from self-exile precisely because she was worried about the toll on her family.

The travel industry loves labelling &quot;new&quot; destinations and so Gabon became the &quot;Costa Rica of Africa&quot; in recognition of the large percentage of the land designated a national park and the extraordinary variety of wildlife. But the similarities end there. With few tourists, you&apos;re more likely to come across one of the 35,000 western lowland gorillas than another foreign visitor. Cox &amp; Kings and Explore both introduced Gabon this year. It&apos;s surely only a matter of time before other tour operators cotton on to its potential.  Must-do city break  With the critical acclaim that accompanied the 10th international Biennial, 2007 was the year Istanbul finally shrugged off its cliched, antique &quot;east meets west&quot; tagline. The exhibits at the Istanbul Modern gallery showed that this is a thoroughly modern city indeed. Beyond the arty stuff, cool hotels, restaurants and bars flourished. The district of Beyoglu is riddled with trendy spots ... the all-glass exterior of the 360 Istanbul restaurant sits on the top floor of a 19th-century apartment building, while Indigo, on the bottom floor, is one of the rowdiest electro clubs of any city.  Thought we&apos;d hate, but loved  A capsule hotel with no windows designed by the man who brought conveyor-belt sushi to Britain did not look good on paper. But the new Yotel (yotel.com) at Gatwick airport turned out to be an inspired concept, and it was love at first sight for Travel&apos;s hotel reviewer. A British firm of architects, the Manser Practice, had put the fun into functionality. A luxurious bed that converted into a sofa, a techno-wall for DVD, music and menu selection (no sushi!), plus a pod bathroom so slick we wanted to take it home.  Shameless publicity stunt  Long gone is the stewardesses&apos; glitzy 1950s heyday, when Frank Sinatra sang Fly Me to the Moon and they got to marry a millionaire and live in a five-bedroom house in Guildford. Just how far removed we are from that more refined era of travel was illustrated by Michael O&apos;Leary this month with the launch of his most tasteless piece of propaganda yet - a calendar with near-naked stewardesses posing in airline-themed scenarios. Nicola (Miss April, from London) is nude, apart from a thong and life jacket, which we hope Ryanair won&apos;t recirculate because she is sucking on the toggle. Miss January, from Dusseldorf - all split ends and pneumatic breasts - is draped over the cockpit. And poor Miss October, from Dublin, has drawn the shortest of these short straws - in a scene culled from a thousand porno shoots, she is actually soaping down the plane.  Most trumpeted opening With designs on becoming the London equivalent of the iconic balcony bar at Grand Central Terminal, New York, the new Champagne Bar at St Pancras is, the PR people still haven&apos;t tired of telling us, the longest in Europe. (Question: which is the second longest?) In reality this means two rows of snugly heated, boothed banquettes, enough to sit 120 people, laid out passenger-compartment style, totalling 95.8 metres. Top exhibition  &quot;El Siglo XIX in El Prado&quot;, which opened at the Museo del Prado in Madrid on October 30, was one of the best art shows of the year. You can&apos;t really go wrong when you display more than a hundred 19th-century Spanish masterpieces hitherto stacked in the vaults, and the fact that Goya&apos;s paintings kick off the display helps too. But the really enjoyable thing about this show, housed in the Prado&apos;s new space created as part of the massive expansion project, is seeing Madrid&apos;s greatest neoclassical, romanticist and realist artworks all together while in the Spanish capital (the opposite sensation of visiting, say the &quot;British&quot; Museum) and so the history bits connect to what you are seeing outside the gallery. The other good thing is you can still see it, until April 20. museodelprado.es New Arctic experience  It&apos;s not flash, it doesn&apos;t have a branded vodka bar, but the Aurora Sky Station in Abisko, which opened in February, will give you one of the biggest and chilliest thrills in Lapland. Sitting on top of Mount Njulla, where it is reached by Sweden&apos;s longest cable car ride, Abisko claims to be the best place on earth to view the Northern Lights, due to its huge number of clear nights - known as &quot;the Abisko Blue Hole&quot;. The station is now planning to introduce sleepovers. Don&apos;t forget your thermals. Station visits, \u00a330. Stay at the nearby Abisko Tourist, where doubles cost from \u00a365 (0046 980 402 00, abisko.nu).  Strangest hotel experience  Going for a dip in the outdoor pool of the new Moroccan outpost of Paris OTT boutique hotel the Murano Urban Resort, the Murano Oriental (muranoresort.com). This came with a trippy and slightly macabre twist: the white on white interior has been offset by the blood-red-tiled pool. Elsewhere, the new Peninsula Hotel in Tokyo (tokyo.peninsula.com) installed Toto toilets that flip their lid automatically as you approach (as well as, ahem, wash, massage and dry you) while the Rome Cavalieri Hilton (cavalieri-hilton.it) offered guests gladiator lessons. Best way to cross the States  The dollar hit rock bottom, so the US was more appealing than ever, but the manners of the airport security (see below) hit new lows too. To minimise the hassle, smart travellers travelled by land once they got there. The most stylish and romantic way to travel between cities was on the recently launched Grandluxe (americanorientexpress.com) rail coaches added to the back of Amtrak&apos;s regular carriages on scheduled routes. From $789 for a three-day trip you get gourmet grub, a glass-domed lounge car, cocktails, crisp white linen and a classically elegant sleeping compartment; more of a five-star hotel on tracks than the rail alternative to Route 66. We&apos;re still waiting for ...  Train companies to get their act together. \u00a3219 for a standard open London-Manchester return, anyone? Full marks for being the green alternative to flying, but what&apos;s that about? And while we shouldn&apos;t expect to get to Venice and back for a tenner, the cheapest book-months-in-advance-and-don&apos;t-even-think-about-a-refund rail ticket costs more than 10 times that. That&apos;s if you can negotiate the fist-biting complexities involved in buying a ticket beyond the Eurostar destinations.  Best festival  It wasn&apos;t the rain and mud that spoiled this year&apos;s Glastonbury. It was the draconian security measures and the overall feeling that punters were being treated like cash-rich cattle. The Green Man was equally muddy, and it was a joy. In a valley deep in the Brecon Beacons 10,000 people came to hear Joanna Newsom, Robert Plant and hundreds of lesser-known, mostly folk-tinged acts. The Green Man took the British festival back to its hippy roots, albeit this time with a decent cappuccino machine. Victim of the boutique virus Remember when a &quot;boutique&quot; was just a shop? Or even when &quot;boutique hotel&quot; was a new concept? No? Well fair enough, that was a zillion years ago. Since then we&apos;ve had boutique camping, boutique caravanning and, this year, boutique bothies, boutique treehouses and boutique YHA-ing. Goddamnit, we even got boutique drain pipe accommodation at the dasparkhotel in Austria. dasparkhotel.net &apos;New Prague&apos;- ism Tallin, Budapest, Riga ... no Eastern European city has escaped being labelled with the lazy travel writer&apos;s favourite banner. But overuse of the phrase reached a new level of ridiculousness when Prague was declared to be &quot;the new Prague&quot; by various travel publications. Yes, stag parties may be deserting the once overrun city, cultured city-breakers are regaining control, a renaissance is nigh ... but that still doesn&apos;t justify it.  Eco heroes  One of the first things announced by Ibiza&apos;s new regional government, which came into power in May, was that all large-scale construction projects along the most delicate parts of coastlines and around towns were to be halted immediately. In 2006 one fifth of the island&apos;s population had marched against the building of a four-lane highway between San Antonio and Ibiza Town. This anger tapped into similar concerns on the mainland about the tourism-fuelled construction boom that has scarred the Costas. Eco villain  Want to see the world? Well, you could have stumped up \u00a34,499 and jumped aboard the Airtours plane that left Manchester airport back in February for the UK&apos;s first-ever round-the-world package holiday. Over 23 days, you and 238 other passengers would have flown westward, taking in New York, Las Vegas, Hawaii, Sydney, Borneo, Beijing, Agra, Dubai, Cape Town and Cairo, with an average stay of just two nights in each destination.  What Airtours didn&apos;t include in the brochure was that the plane was in the air for 73 hours and, according to Friends of the Earth, emitted 2,289 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Tick-list tourism at its very worst. Tastiest foodie trip  The inaugral Masters of Food and Wine Festival in Argentina (mfandw.com.ar) in February saw some of the world&apos;s best chefs and sommeliers flying in for a variety of banquets in and around South America&apos;s most renowned and stylish vineyards. The 2008 event (February 12-17) includes visits from chefs Michelle Bernstein from Miami, Craig James from Conran in the UK and Andrew Ormsby from Australia. Roadtrip of the year  The bus - and sometimes the passengers - may have broken down but Oz Bus made the 15,000-mile journey from London to Sydney on time. After 12 weeks and 20 countries, the remaining OzBusers celebrated Christmas on the beach in Sydney this week.  Most overhyped website  2007 was the year that Facebook well and truly entered the backpacker vernacular. But its new travel application failed to capture travellers&apos; imaginations. The Facebook Platform was launched in May to much fanfare. It could have made the website a one-stop shop for travel ... compare flights on one application, hotel reviews on another, plan your trip with buddies on another. But, so far, it&apos;s a bit rubbish. As with the non-travel applications, the Platform has facilitated a lot of fun (you can now throw sheep at your mates, draw genitalia on their graffiti wall etc) but not much utility.  Most expensive kip  \u00a326,450 for a single night at the President Wilson in Geneva? That&apos;s 1,392 nights in a Travelodge. In the year that saw the rise of the hotel mega-suite, this topped the pile. Utter wallet-shrivelling, head-spinning, decadent lunacy. Rudest airport staff  LAX&apos;s staff give you no clue about the complex set of rules you must follow as you pass through security, such as holding your passport and ticket at a certain angle. The only way to find out is to inadvertently break the rules and get shouted at or, worse, pulled over for a search in a not particularly private booth and do exactly as you are told, lest you want the experience to get much, much worse.  Best exotic escape Madagascar, particularly its remote north-western coastline wins our vote this year for its sheer, glorious diversity. Wildlife and beach are on hand, the saucer-sized butterflies, gurning chameleons and show-offy humpback whales are captivating, and watching the lemurs&apos; extraordinary acrobatics as you dangle in a hammock overlooking the beach is a joy. Easily the most bizarre site is the graveyard just for pirates; yep it&apos;s for real, although it looks so bourgeois you&apos;d be forgiven for imagining accountants rather than corsairs were buried there. With its recycling and reforestation programmes and local employment initiatives, the Anjajavy Hotel is the place to stay.  Wildest campsite  Dawn. A misty sun rises over the marsh. A Zimbabwean game ranger signals coffee and the start of a morning safari on the look-out for elephants, giraffe, possibly a black rhino. Not the sort of holiday you expect in Kent, just a few miles from the M20, but full marks to Port Lympne Wild Animal Park for creating a safari-style camping experience in the garden of England. The nine luxury tents at Livingstone Safari Lodge are kitted out with a bed, feather duvet and even a fluffy white gown. Expect to see a trend for safari-style campsites like those at Featherdown Farms (featherdown.co.uk) and bushcamp sites (bushcraftadventures.com) over the next few years. \u00a3150pp, \u00a380 kids (no kids under 9) BB&amp;D. Most over-hyped travel show  He&apos;s our most amiable travel buddy, the man the nation loves when he spins ripping yarns of life on the road. So why was Michael Palin&apos;s New Europe such a flat, lukewarm journey? Humour and energy seemed thin on the ground. It became a trip to be endured as much as enjoyed. Perhaps the once sparky, energetic Palin is just showing his years, or perhaps we&apos;d been spoilt by the excellent Bruce Parry, for whom travel meant more than dropping in for an embarrassing belly dance or chat. Experiment of the year Take a twentysomething entrepreneur, a paradise island in the South Pacific, a troupe of adventurers tuning in from offices across the world, then add a pinch of internet pseudo-democracy, and you&apos;ve got Tribewanted. Each member of the &quot;tribe&quot; pays a yearly fee, which entitles them to a week on Vorovoro, a tiny outcrop just off Fiji&apos;s second biggest island, where the group has its own village, and also an ongoing vote on all tribal decisions. Sound like a documentary waiting to happen? It is: the BBC series airs in January.  tribewanted.com. Turnaround: Kazakhstan  At the start of the year, the knock-on effects of the Borat film - which depicted Kazakhstan as a backward land of goat-milking, sister-shagging peasants - meant it wasn&apos;t exactly on the hot list. By November the hip Hedonist Guides had produced a book on Almaty and Astana, describing the former as the cultural and party capital of central Asia. High five to that, Borat.  End of an era  Bell-bottom jeans, granny glasses and the shoestring guidebook. First no one used them. Then we all did. Lonely Planet taught a generation to move through the world alone and with confidence. Its early guides were opinionated, irreverent and chancy. This year Tony and Maureen Wheeler sold their majority stake in Lonely Planet to BBC World, as Hilary Bradt retired and Mark Ellingham stepped down from Rough Guides.

A huge, sprawling white bungalow within a walled compound, surrounded by lawns and dotted with trees, it is here that the Bhutto clan has gathered after its many losses. To one side of the villa is the town of Nau Dero itself; to the other, the family&apos;s expansive estates, mirroring the separation between Pakistan&apos;s political elite and the country&apos;s teeming millions. Today, under the portraits of her hanged father and dead brothers, her testament will be read by Bilawal, her grieving 19-year-old son. The family&apos;s franchise on political leadership will be handed on. The will&apos;s contents will determine the future not simply of her party, the Pakistan People&apos;s Party, but of Pakistan. But whether it contains enough to stop the violence is, perhaps, out of the Bhutto family&apos;s hands as the nation teeters on the edge of perhaps the worst bloodletting since Partition in 1947. In Rawalpindi, the northern city where Bhutto was assassinated on Thursday, thousands have rioted. In the usually bustling southern port city of Karachi, streets were deserted, patrolled by soldiers and paramilitaries. In Islamabad, the capital, police stood guard behind barbed-wire barriers on the roads leading to the President&apos;s residence and Parliament. And in the heart of Sindh province, in the villages around Nau Dero, grief and shock was turning to anger. It was here that Bhutto&apos;s bereaved husband, Asif Ali Zardari, revealed that the 54-year-old former Prime Minister and mother-of-three had left a will and a statement to be read in the event of her death. &apos;My son will read his mother&apos;s will,&apos; he announced yesterday outside the family home. So across the nation today, crowds will gather, as they have done for the past three days, in front of tea shops, cafes, in hotels, wherever there is a television - hungry for news, for reassurance, for any hint of what this troubled country&apos;s future will hold in the fraught months ahead. And the sense of what has descended on Pakistan was not overstated by the man closest to Bhutto who described the murder of his wife as a personal and national &apos;catastrophe&apos;. &apos;Who knows what this country has done to deserve such misfortunes,&apos; Farruqh Saleem, a respected newspaper columnist in Islamabad, said. &apos;Pray for us.&apos; It is a misfortune that has been measured over the past few days by a body count, a death toll that has been climbing since Thursday evening and the news of the assassination. It now stands at nearly 40. Some have been victims of criminal mobs exploiting the unrest; others shot by hitmen who shouted &apos;Long live Bhutto&apos;; others killed in seemingly random acts of violence or revenge. There has been no organised wave of violence, as some had feared, but no one feels sure that the worst has yet arrived. The violence has been bloodiest in the southern provinces where Bhutto had her power base, not least her home city of Larkana, where businesses were put to the torch and weapons stores looted yesterday. &apos;It looks more like Beirut than Pakistan,&apos; remarked a local aid worker. With the violence has come the conspiracy theories. Many blame the army for her death. Old regional and ethnic rivalries are surfacing to pit the people of the predominantly rural province of Sindh against those of the wealthier and more urbanised western Punjab, exacerbating faultlines in an already divided country. &apos;Musharraf is to blame for this and we will revenge ourselves,&apos; said Hammed Baksh, a chicken seller in the city of Nawabshah. &apos;Benazir was a very good leader. She fought for democracy. Long live the Bhuttos.&apos; Further fissures are splitting the political landscape: between those who want to protest, sometimes violently, and those who do not. &apos;Bhutto was my sister and Bhutto was like my mother and we will avenge her death,&apos; said Ghuam Shah, a farmer in Sukkur, near to where Bhutto was buried in the mausoleum she had built for her father, hanged by the dictator Zia ul-Haq in 1979, and her brothers. &apos;We will protest and we will fight the oppressors and the tyrants.&apos; Yet others called for an end to protests and &apos;the ransacking of public property&apos;. Muhammad Bashir, a taxi driver in Islamabad, said protests should immediately be banned as they were &apos;dangerous both for the country and the nation&apos;. The sense of crisis has not been limited to Pakistan. Washington and London, which invested considerable time and political capital in a strategy based largely on Bhutto&apos;s return to power, have been left without any clear road map. And urgent questions remain unanswered, among them: who was behind the killing? Can Pakistan hold together without widespread violence? Will the 8 January elections be held? And how far will Bhutto&apos;s murder affect the war on terror and international relations in the region and beyond? One hundred and fifty miles west of Rawalpindi and 500 miles from the rice fields and banana groves of Nau Dero lie the dusty hills that run along the Afghan frontier. Here is the hideout of 34-year-old Baitullah Mahsud, whom the Pakistan government insists is the prime suspect behind the assassination. In truth, even before being named by the Pakistani interior ministry on Friday, Mahsud&apos;s name would have been in the frame. The young militant chief, who commands a militia of several hundred men from his base in south Waziristan, had made no secret of his desire to kill Bhutto. &apos;She was secularised and westernised and stood for everything the extremists don&apos;t want,&apos; said Imtiaz Ali, a well-informed reporter based in the frontier city of Peshawar. &apos;Her vocal support for operations by Western troops even within Pakistan, and her offer of allowing Western intelligence services to interview Abdul Qadeer Khan [the disgraced head of Pakistan&apos;s nuclear procurement programme] made her very unpopular around here.&apos; And Mahsud, who held 300 Pakistani soldiers hostage for weeks earlier this autumn and signed - and then broke - a truce with the government in 2005, is known to have the means as well as the motive for the killing; he has frequently boasted of running camps where suicide bombers are trained. But Mahsud yesterday denied any involvement in Benazir&apos;s assassination. &apos;Tribal people have their own customs. We don&apos;t strike women,&apos; his newly appointed spokesman, Maulvi Omar, told a news agency by telephone from an undisclosed location in western Pakistan. It is a view endorsed by some of Bhutto&apos;s supporters, who yesterday insisted that there had been a &apos;cover-up&apos; about the circumstances of her murder. &apos;The story that al-Qaeda or Mahsud did it appears to us to be a planted story, an incorrect story, because they want to divert the attention,&apos; said Farhatullah Babar, a spokesman for the PPP. Local analysts in the North West Frontier Province with direct knowledge of, and contacts with, radical groups were also sceptical of the government&apos;s claims. Brigadier Mehmood Shah, who until last year ran security on the Afghan-Pakistan frontier, said it &apos;was too early to speculate&apos; and that the government &apos;should have waited&apos; before pointing the finger at the militant leader. &apos;Mahsud is not a regular member of al-Qaeda. He shares an ideological core with them and has connections, but the Pakistan Taliban has not been amalgamated by al-Qaeda,&apos; Shah added. &apos;This could be a combination of different elements,&apos; said one intelligence source. &apos;Al-Qaeda providing the strategic direction and motivating people, cash from somewhere else, gunmen and a suicide bomber from other groups, logistics provided by someone else. It&apos;s not a neat set-up, but can be very effective.&apos; But amid the accusations of Bhutto&apos;s supporters, the hunt for those behind the killing also has become necessarily political. Bhutto was convinced that a shadowy network of opponents within the Pakistani establishment was determined to destroy her, an accusation that she made repeatedly. &apos;There are a few hundred people who are running a state within a state,&apos; she told The Observer two weeks ago. These were the people whom she claimed were behind the first attempt on her life in October, when, she insisted, street lights in Karachi went out just before a double bomb blast targeted at her on her return to Pakistan from exile. Then, she said, she had received extensive intelligence from a &apos;friendly country&apos; about plots directed by radical Islamist sympathisers within the powerful intelligence services. Names and telephone numbers had been forwarded by letter to President Peervez Musharraf. &apos;I told him that, if something should happen to me, the government should know certain things,&apos; she said pointedly. The 10 weeks between Bhutto&apos;s triumphant return from exile and her murder at the Liaqat Bagh gardens - site of the 1951 assassination of Pakistan&apos;s first Prime Minister, Liaqat Ali Khan, and close to where her father was hanged - have drawn up the faultlines that now threaten Pakistan today. And although Bhutto had good reason to plan for an early death, few expected it to come so soon. The grim tableau of teary supporters and charred vehicles in Larkana yesterday was a far cry from the bright scenes just over two months ago, when she stood at the door of her aircraft in Karachi, breathing in the warm Pakistani air for the first time in eight years. Her return had followed a controversial deal sponsored by the West -one long months in negotiation - with Musharraf, the army chief who had seized power in a coup in 1999 and pursued a rocky and deeply uncertain progress towards restoring democracy in Pakistan. On that day, Bhutto had paused briefly before descending from the plane, her eyes gleaming with joy, expectation and a tinge of apprehension. Ecstatic supporters waited at the bottom of the steps, holding flower garlands and ornately drawn copies of the Koran. Behind them on the tarmac stood a clutch of heavily armed police. Bhutto adjusted the gauzy white headscarf that had become her icon, took her first step down the stairs, and embarked on her final journey through her home country. Not everyone was happy, however. Bhutto&apos;s return was made possible only by the talks with Musharraf over the previous 10 months. There had been no formal agreement, but the outlines had been established. Critics, including many of her supporters, called it a dirty deal. After all, tooth-and-nail opposition to military rule was the central pillar of the Bhutto political creed. Almost 30 years earlier, one ruthless general had executed the father she idolised, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Now his daughter was doing a deal with another power-hungry man in uniform. &apos;I am really humbled,&apos; she told The Observer from her perch, shouting to be heard, enraptured by the adulation. She swept her hand across the crowd. &apos;I think this is the moderate middle of Pakistan that doesn&apos;t want extremism.&apos; But someone - something extremist, by any definition - wanted her dead. For while she may have survived that first attack in Karachi, which took the lives of scores of her supporters, the threat of death was never far away. Even as her new-found arrangement with Musharraf unravelled in the midst of a political crisis that saw him put her under house arrest, the threat was a constant one. Speaking again to this newspaper not long before her death - this time by phone from Dubai - Bhutto had voiced her concerns. They were not with the militants but with those inside the security establishment - the same people whom her husband blamed for the Karachi attack. &apos;I&apos;m not worried about Mahsud,&apos; said Bhutto. &apos;I&apos;m worried about the threat within the government. People like Mahsud are just pawns. It is the forces behind them that have presided over the rise of extremism and militancy in my country. They feel threatened now that their infrastructure will be rolled back when democracy is restored.&apos; The reality was that Bhutto&apos;s return was deeply threatening to powerful interests in a Pakistani establishment increasingly dominated under Musharraf&apos;s rule by the army and the intelligence agencies. It was marked by a hatred towards the Bhuttos within a core section of Pakistan&apos;s military - one that runs back to the coup against Bhutto&apos;s father in the late 1970s. This group were less threatened by her threat to roll up the extremists than her promise to give western countries access to the disgraced scientist Khan, who operated a nuclear weapons supermarket from Pakistan for much of the 1990s. The fear was that Khan might implicate powerful figures in the army who had supported his illegal activities. Deep down, Bhutto considered these people the real enemy: &apos;I&apos;m talking about the retired military officers who fought the jihad, who created the Afghan mujahideen, and later morphed into al-Qaeda and the Taliban. The real threat comes from them; it doesn&apos;t come from their puppets or their pawns. They have a lot of supporters within the echelons of administration and intelligence.&apos; And although some of her supporters have blamed the President, it is not clear that Musharraf benefits in any way from her killing. What is true - what has fired so much of the anger - is that little was ever done to establish who tried to kill Bhutto before. After the Karachi bomb attack, even Bhutto accused Musharraf of a cover-up. &apos;Some people,&apos; she pronounced bitterly, &apos;are being protected.&apos; But while that accusation might have strained relations between the pair to breaking point, by that stage the deal that allowed the two-time Prime Minister to end eight years of exile in Dubai and London and return to her homeland was in place. In return for an amnesty on corruption allegations dating from her time in power - which she and her aides insisted were politically motivated - Bhutto loyalists in the National Assembly acquiesced to the re-election of Musharraf, then still head of the military forces, in October. The next stage of the plan was to have Bhutto in Parliament and, eventually, following constitutional amendments, secure her a third term as Prime Minister. &apos;Bhutto was part of Musharraf&apos;s calculations and planning. She was not necessarily a problem for him,&apos; said one Islamabad-based analyst. &apos;He needed her to give his rule a friendly face for the West. They needed one another.&apos; Without Bhutto, it is unclear what Musharraf does next - in particular over the issue of the election, due to be held on 8 January, that are a key component of his move from President in uniform to civilian leader. For while his aides and ministers have stressed that the election should go ahead as scheduled, for many Pakistanis an election so soon after Bhutto&apos;s death, even with the support of President Bush and Prime Minister Gordon Brown, strikes them as indecent haste. &apos;I am surprised that Gordon Brown and George W Bush are saying that the polls should go ahead,&apos; said Ijaz Gilani, head of the polling organisation Gallup in Pakistan and a leading political scientist last week. &apos;It shows a certain lack of sensitivity to the local context. I doubt if any elections could be held now with any credibility.&apos; It is a view shared by the most senior surviving major opposition politician in Pakistan: Nawaz Sharif, the leader of the Pakistani Muslim League and also a returned exile, who has said that his party will boycott the election and has called on Musharraf to step down. Though a bitter enemy of Bhutto while she was alive, Sharif yesterday headed to her tomb to pay homage. But it is Bhutto&apos;s PPP that now faces the biggest challenge as it begins to plan for the post-Benazir era. With its leadership and rank and file booth heavily targeted by Musharraf during the state of emergency, the party meets today to decide on a strategy deprived of their most powerful and charismatic asset in a political system as much focused on its leadership as its policies. Already there are signs that Bhutto&apos;s murder will have the potential to damage Pakistan&apos;s most powerful individual party. Although some believe that the PPP - the personal creation of the Bhutto family - is now destined to collapse, many analysts believe that a schism is more likely than atomisation. That break-up battle is likely to be fought around two poles: a new leadership that has coalesced of late around the high-profile lawyer Aitzaz Ahsan, who has been imprisoned in recent months and enjoys growing credibility within the party, and Bhutto&apos;s widower, Zardari. In this struggle, Zardari - who many believe will have been nominated by Bhutto as her political heir in her will- will face an uphill struggle. Never a heavyweight in Pakistani political circles, he is badly tarnished by his reputation as a playboy and by corruption allegations. Yet despite the potential for friction within the party, there are some analysts who believe there may be reasons for the PPP leadership to retain at least some optimism about the months ahead. &apos;The future for the PPP is actually quite good,&apos; says Gilani. &apos;Recently we have seen the personal element of Bhutto herself declining in favour of a stronger institutional party identity. The PPP would not have survived Bhutto&apos;s exile so well if that had not been the case. They would not have been able to get so many people out on the streets to welcome Bhutto back in October, nor field so many candidates in the forthcoming elections.&apos; Gilani and his researchers also have evidence to suggest that Pakistan may be able to survive the present upheaval. One key reason may be that, despite all the chaos, the voice of the &apos;moderate majority&apos; of 173 million Pakistanis is barely audible. It is the voice of the shopkeepers, labourers, businessmen and other members of society who, in the midst of the recent state of emergency, simply got on with trying to improve their lives. Theirs was an attitude that baffled Benazir Bhutto as much as it gave her ammunition. For one common desire uncovered by Gilani and his pollsters - one recognised by Bhutto - is a &apos;profound popular wish for reconciliation&apos;. &apos;It was very different when Bhutto&apos;s father was hanged,&apos; said Gilani. &apos;It is much less polarised now.&apos; Other polls show declining support for suicide bombers and militants such as Osama bin Laden, for whom support was strong in the wake of the start of the war in 2001 in neighbouring Afghanistan. Bhutto herself, despite her years of exile, had sensed some of this change in attitude and knew that a potential political constituency might be found in the desire for peace, something she touched on when she returned home. But that Pakistan perished last week with her. What has been left in the wake of that atrocity is a Pakistan too stunned to do much more than grieve, riot or sit and hope. It is a country that is now as confused as it is damaged, its horizons shrunk to the contemplation of one awful act. &apos;We do not know what is going to happen in this country,&apos; said Ilyas Gil, a businessman in Islamabad, speaking for many. But perhaps the mood was best summed up by Akhtiar Ali Sial, a former servant for the Bhuttos, as he watched Benazir&apos;s body being buried inside the family mausoleum as her husband, in a black salwar kameez and a jewelled skullcap, looked on stern faced, watching other men scoop the sandy soil over the body of his wife. &apos;This is untold misery,&apos; the former gardener pronounced. Leading players Baitullah Mahsud Militant commander accused of ordering Benazir Bhutto&apos;s death, which he denies. The few journalists who have met the leader of the Taliban in Pakistan speak of his desire to wage jihad on foreign forces in Afghanistan. Asif Ali Zardari Husband of Benazir Bhutto, likely new leader of the Pakistan People&apos;s Party. His enemies describe him as a corrupt opportunist. Accused in 1996 of organising the murder of Benazir&apos;s brother, he was held in prison from 1997 to 2004 on charges which included corruption. The cases were finally set aside after a mistrial. President Pervez Musharraf Took power in a 1999 coup as chief of the army. Has twice suspended the constitution, most recently after Bhutto&apos;s return. Many activists jailed in recent state of emergency. Killing of Benazir Bhutto united opposition against him. Nawaz Sharif A former Prime Minister, his term ended with Musharraf&apos;s coup. Exiled after corruption allegations, Nawaz has recently been negotiating his return to Pakistan. Described by officials as a potential target of Islamic militants.", "tags": ["Pakistan", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "Focus: After Benazir", "sentences": ["Speaking again to this newspaper not long before her death - this time by phone from Dubai - Bhutto had voiced her concerns.", "&apos;Some people,&apos;

I can hardly conceive how the city of my birth will reshape itself in coming years. Post-hurricane devastation and the loss of half its population could lead to a renaissance, as happened in San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake. Or it could splutter out in an exploitative mess fuelled by developers and bureaucrats. I plan to reacquaint myself with those classic New Orleans experiences that tourists used to take for granted - brunch at the Court of Two Sisters, dinner at Commander&apos;s Palace, and any bar that serves Dixie Blackened Voodoo beer ice-cold.  MATT TURNER Editor, hotel design magazine Sleeper Of the 50-plus hotels that are scheduled to open in Beijing for the Olympics next year, none will hold a torch to the new Mandarin Oriental. It is part of the China Central Television headquarters and will be housed in its own iconic structure, with two restaurants linked via a champagne bar suspended above a dramatic staircase with stunning views of the optical illusion that is the main CCTV building.  At the other end of the design spectrum will be The Other Side in Neiden (theotherside.no), Norway, which opens in the spring close to the Russian border. Guests will be met at the airport by husky sleigh and taken to a resort perched on a plateau overlooking salmon rivers, Arctic tundra and the Barents Sea, with interior design inspired by the culture of the local Sami people. The hotel promises &apos;an extreme take on modern luxury&apos;, &apos;otherworldly shamanism&apos;, and a chance to see the northern lights. Sounds good to me. SARA HENRICHS Travel editor, *Wallpaper In the spring I hope to go to Miami for the opening of the Mondrian South Beach (mondriansouthbeach.com), designed by multiple award-winning Marcel Wanders. It&apos;s a sister hotel to the Delano. Wanders promises that the South Beach will be his &apos;Sleeping Beauty&apos; creation. The exterior boasts a 16-storey wall of artwork that will be visible throughout the Miami Beach area, while a floating, elliptical, black-lacquered staircase leads guests away from the lobby, where vast digital images inspired by fairy tales will play against the walls.  STEPHEN BAYLEY The Observer&apos;s design critic Nice is one of my very favourite places. I suffer from the Englishman&apos;s hopelessly sentimental view of the south of France, but that apart, it&apos;s still a wonderful city: sophisticated and cosmopolitan or rough and romantic, according to choice. You can have a fine glass of champagne or a pissaladiere (the local take on pizza) and a tumbler of Provencal ros\u00e9, depending on where you are. I&apos;ve been going there often since 1981, but for the past few years enjoyment has been compromised because the vast Place Massena has been excavated for tramways, turning the centre of the city into a building site. I&apos;m looking forward to Nice getting back to its familiar sunny chaos in 2008. THE TOUR OPERATORS TOM BARBER Director, Original Travel  I&apos;m excited about the Musandam Peninsula in Oman. It&apos;s separated from the rest of the country by the UAE and is totally unspoilt with mountainous scenery and great diving. The Evason Hideaway Zighy Bay (sixsenses.com/hideaway-zighybay) opening in January, sits on a huge bay. You can get there by boat, by four-wheel-drive over mountains - or you can paraglide in.  Closer to home, I think Romania&apos;s one to watch. The Danube Delta is beautiful and unspoilt and you get all the African birds on their migration route to Europe in April and May. It&apos;s the best wildlife experience you can have without going to Africa. You can stay at a new eco-lodge, The Delta Nature Resort (deltaresort.com). VICTORIA MCCLELLANDProduct director, Wellbeing Escapes  There&apos;s been a big shift from traditional spas to wellness resorts. Rather than pampering experiences, people are looking for longer-lasting substantial health benefits. They want a measure of self-improvement that they can incorporate into their lives back home. Ayurvedic treatments will continue to be big in 2008. Of all the Ayurvedic resorts, the Kalari Kovilakom in Kerala, India (kalarikovilakom.com) is perhaps the most powerful. It&apos;s really strict and really authentic and the results last.  Brazil is coming up in the wellness market. It&apos;s not really been on most people&apos;s radar, but the resorts there are trying to do something interesting, using local artisans and products. At some luxury spas you feel as though you could be anywhere in the world, but in Brazil they feel wholly authentic and unique to that country. The Kiaroa Eco-Luxury Resort (kiaroa.com) is fantastic. You fly into Salvador and then take a small plane to a private landing strip on the Marau peninsula. The spa is fabulous and there are just 28 rooms in 24 acres of lush jungle, fringed by beaches of gorgeous white sand. TOM MARCHANTManaging director, Black Tomato Panama looks set to explode in 2008. It&apos;s stunningly beautiful, with amazing beaches and rainforest. The canal is incredible: it starts in an industrial zone and then emerges into open water dotted with tiny islands full of monkeys. It&apos;s a cool place to kayak, despite the crocodiles. Panama City&apos;s Unesco-protected Old Town is special, with its French and Spanish heritage - atmospheric and safe. It&apos;s easy to explore the city&apos;s jazz bars and cafes. One of the best eco-lodges is Coral Lodge, Bocas del Toro (blacktomato.co.uk/experiences/escape+time/a+secret+ paradise), with over-water villas, pristine rainforest and mangrove kayaking. We are seeing a lot more interest in the Syrian capital, Damascus. It&apos;s like Marrakesh was 20 years ago, all crumbling city walls, amazing souks, mosques and coffee houses where the aroma is so dense you can almost feel it. The fact that it&apos;s only a six-hour flight away makes it a viable long-weekend destination. The city&apos;s first boutique hotel, the Al Mamlouka (almamlouka.com) recently opened in a 17th-century house in the Christian quarter of the Old City. It&apos;s been refurbished in traditional style and some of the rooms still have 200-year-old Christian frescos on the ceilings. TONY HOPKINS  Director of products, Thomas Cook  The latest destination to make a splash is Port Ghalib on the Red Sea in Egypt. It&apos;s a remote stretch of unspoilt coastline, perfect for diving and snorkelling. The resort is new, having opened its doors to the paying public in November. The area offers rolling hills, desert terrain and coral reefs, not to mention ancient monuments locally and in the adjacent Nile Valley. We&apos;re featuring a four-star hotel, the Sun Oasis. It&apos;s ideal for families and those looking to take advantage of local activities. THE HOTEL GURUS  JAMES LOHAN Founder, Mr &amp; Mrs Smith hotel guides  Since having a child a few months ago, I&apos;m trying to stay closer to home. Fortunately, in Wales, the sprucing up of time-locked coastal havens has brought boutique hotels, delis and craft shops, which have sprinkled just the right amount of style dust over extraordinarily scenic surroundings. Cardigan Bay has hidden coves and sweeping river estuaries. Hurst House (hurst-house.co.uk) in Carmarthen Bay has reopened after a huge overhaul, and as well as seductive rooms, it has a helipad, a spa, a swimming pool, and a fire-breathing dragon sculpture in the courtyard. At the other end of the spectrum, The Drawing Room near Powys (the-drawing-room.co.uk) is a discreet three-bedroom hideaway. The owners describe it as a restaurant with rooms, and while it is unashamedly food-centric, it would be a mistake to think the rooms are an afterthought. NIKKI TINTO Founder, hotel website i-escape.com Luang Prabang in Laos is a hotbed of boutique hotels. It&apos;s a beautiful spiritual city on the banks of the Mekong, famed for its cafes and bars and Buddhist temples. It has always been on the backpacker trail, but is moving into the mainstream. Our favourites are La Residence Phou Vao (residencephouvao.com/web/plua/laos.jsp) - which is the best in town. The Apsara (theapsara.com) is the best budget option, with colourful interiors, super-stylish rooms and an easy-going ambiance. Siem Riep in Cambodia also has some lovely new boutique hotels. You could spend three or four days exploring the temples and into the jungle. The speedboats linking Siem Riep with Phnom Penh used to be basic affairs serving backpackers, but now we&apos;re seeing new, sophisticated luxury craft plying the route. It&apos;s mainly French ex-pats who are driving the new trade, investing heavily in the area&apos;s tourist infrastructure. Our favourite top-end hotel is the newly opened Heritage Suites (i-escape.com/heritagesuiteshotel.php), but the budget Hanuman Alaya (i-escape.com/hanumanalaya.php) is no less charming.  ALASTAIR SAWDAY Publisher, Special Places to Stay accommodation guides When I read about Count Kalnoky&apos;s Romanian guesthouses (transylvaniancastle.com/kalnoky.html) I was so excited I almost had to be restrained. They were mostly built in the 1800s and have been beautifully restored to keep their Transylvanian character, with big gardens and storks nesting on nearby rooftops. There are woodstoves, luscious bathrooms, a sauna and billiard room and a sense of distance.  Miklosvar is a remote village with little infrastructure. There may be an occasional electricity failure and the village streets remain unpaved and pot-holed. Perhaps it is a bit crude to want to enjoy something so removed from the experiences of the local people. But a combination of a country so long ignored and troubled, and a great house of such character, is hard not to long for. HERBERT YPMA Creator, Hip Hotels Tangalle in Sri Lanka must surely be one of the few remaining secrets the Indian Ocean has left to offer. Guests at the new Amanwella resort (amanresorts.com) get three things: a beautiful beach all to themselves; architecture and design inspired by Sri Lanka&apos;s legendary Geoffrey Bawa; and the level of personal indulgence and luxury that Aman has specialised in. I&apos;d also like to go to the Maldives, which is very underrated as a family destination. Each resort is on its own island so you can&apos;t lose your kids, and the water isn&apos;t deep. At resorts such as Soneva Fushi (sixsenses.com) they can cycle around the island, watch films on the sand and stay in a room that has a slide into a swimming pool. For those with a taste for contemporary luxury and a short attention span, I&apos;d recommend the W Retreat &amp; Spa (starwoodhotels.com/whotels). With three vastly different restaurants, god knows how many bars, a spa complex that looks like something out of an architecture competition, it&apos;s a tiny little power house of an island. THE ADVENTURERS  AMANDA MARKS Managing director, fair-trade travel company Tribes There&apos;s a lot of really good stuff going on in Zambia at the moment. It has always been known for its walking safaris but there&apos;s much more than that, from boating safaris on the Zambesi to excellent fishing. The lodges are fantastic, the guiding is wonderful, it&apos;s properly wild and a lot of tourism is done ethically, from safaris with people like Robin Pope and Norman Carr, to smaller operators - and the anti-poaching measures in Zambia are great.  I&apos;m planning to take my family to South Africa in the summer. We&apos;re going to the Pafuri Camp (pafuri.com) in the northern part of the Kruger National Park, which is ideal for walking safaris. I know my sons, who are seven and 10, will love it. We&apos;re then going to the Shiluvari Lake Lodge by the Limpopo. The Venda tribe live there and it&apos;s home to lots of artists. JONNY BEALBY Founder, adventure travel company Wild Frontiers I am looking forward to the colourful Shandor Polo Festival in northern Pakistan which, combined with a short walk in the Hindu Kush, will represent a classic adventure trip. We&apos;ll be running a trip there in July. At 3,800m, it&apos;s the highest polo ground in the world and I&apos;ve heard it&apos;s an extraordinary spectacle. Chitral and Gilgit - the Man United and Liverpool of Pakistani polo - come together for three days of competition ending in a grudge match overseen by the president and 20,000 fanatical locals. With canvas tents, campfires and various sideshows and events, it&apos;s a scene that resembles the eve of some medieval battle.  HILARY BRADT Founder, Bradt Travel Guides From 1 April all pensioners in England can travel free on local buses in any area of the country. So in spring my friend and I will see if we can travel all the way from Land&apos;s End to the Wash without paying. We expect to augment the bus travel with a spot of hitchhiking. The route and time taken will be entirely in the lap of the gods.  Travel trends for 2008? My hunch is that more people will want to go on expedition cruises rather than conventional ones. Silversea Cruises (silversea.com) is adding a small (150 passengers) ship to its fleet, but this will visit unusual destinations and use Zodiacs (inflatable boats) to land in remote areas and uninhabited islands. CHARLIE HOPKINSON Director, overland expedition company, Dragoman Our overland trip from Istanbul to Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan is selling phenomenally well for 2008. But it&apos;s the Georgia part of the trip that we&apos;re excited about. It&apos;s a stunning country - like Europe 50 years ago. Our trip includes Georgian home stays with local families, plenty of Georgian wine and food, and walks in the Caucasus. Our demographics are changing at Dragoman. The 40-plus market has taken off. The average age of the next St Petersburg trip, for example, is 43. Whereas the younger traveller still comes to us saying they want to follow the well-trodden hedonistic path used by their peers, the older travellers are looking for challenging trips, through challenging terrain. We&apos;re having to look at our programmes to cater for this demographic - more hotels and less camping, and shorter hours on the road - removing the rough edges.  THE HEDONISTS PETE TONG DJ The new Fasano Hotel in Rio (fasano.com.br) has become a home from home for me since it opened on Ipanema beach last summer. It&apos;s almost perfect, not too over-styled, just how you would want your own apartment. I will be staying there in February for the carnival. I will also be travelling to Sao Paulo and Curitiba in south-east Brazil. It&apos;s all part of the Bacardi B-Live global music and cultural exchange, where artists collaborate to give local singer-songwriters the chance to work with internationally renowned musicians. For next summer, Mykonos is the hot clubbing destination. Its beauty blows me away. One of the two hottest clubs there is Cavo Paradiso (cavoparadiso.gr), on the top of a hill with an awe-inspiring view. The party goes on all night and until the middle of the next day, with partygoers spreading down the cliffs all the way down to the other hot club, the Paradise Club (paradiseclub-mykonos.com). TREMAYNE CAREW POLE Publisher, Hedonist&apos;s Guides I had an amazing time in Sierra Leone - it&apos;s got the most beautiful beaches, big game fishing, elephants, leopards and lions, and it&apos;s just a six-hour flight from London. The infrastructure is very basic but it&apos;s one to watch. Otherwise the Central Asian &apos;stans&apos;, especially Kazakhstan, are very interesting right now. We launched a Hedonist&apos;s Guide to Almaty in November. It&apos;s where Moscow was 10 years ago, very exciting and vibrant, with that slight air of Russian decadence because of all the petro-dollars floating through. The nightlife is meant to be fantastic and on the doorstep is a wild, rugged land of steppes, mountains and lakes. NEIL GREENWAY Creator, efestivals.co.uk British festivals are set for a tricky 2008 - this year&apos;s atrocious summer means people will probably wait to see what the weather&apos;s like before booking. I&apos;m going to Wychwood and Guilfest because they&apos;re small, friendly and civilised. Endorse It (lgofestivals.com) in Dorset (8-10 August) is a crap name, but a nice festival with lots of ska and reggae and an old-style feel, as if a group of friends have put up a stage in a field. Festivals abroad are growing in stature, especially in Eastern Europe. Tickets to Opener (opener.pl) in Gdansk, Poland (4 -6 July) cost \u00a340, which means you can buy a ticket, fly there and get drunk all weekend for the cost of a ticket to Reading - and it has most of the same acts.  RALPH MOORE Assistant editor, Mixmag If you want cutting-edge electronic music, the next place to blow (after Berlin of course) will be Bucharest, Romania. The biggest techno record across Europe this summer was a remix of St Germain&apos;s &apos;Rose Rouge&apos; by Raresh, a young Romanian DJ who is leading the charge in Bucharest, along with Rhadoo and Petre Ispirescu. There&apos;s an excitement in the city because they are discovering quality techno for the first time. Our spies tell us that the key clubs are Krystal Glam (clubkristal.ro) and Webclub (thewebclub.ro), which are visited by Ibiza/Cocoon DJ legends such as Luciano and Ricardo Villalobos. I haven&apos;t been yet, but it&apos;s definitely on the agenda for 2008. THE ETHICAL TRAVELLERS  MARK SMITH Creator, rail information website Seat61.com This year we&apos;ll see Amsterdam becoming a European rail destination to rival Paris and Brussels. Since the high-speed line to the Channel Tunnel was completed in November, you&apos;ve been able to hop on a Eurostar in central London, make one quick change in Brussels, and reach Amsterdam in about five-and-a-half hours, with no airport blues. But a new high-speed line across the Netherlands, opening late next year, will cut London-Amsterdam to four hours 10 minutes, city centre to city centre, changing in Brussels. You can also now combine the city with Prague, Vienna, Milan, Copenhagen or Warsaw, thanks to the recent launch of new &apos;City Night Line&apos; sleeper services from Amsterdam (bahn.de/citynightline). GREG STEVENSON Owner, Under the Thatch, an ethical cottage rental company  I set up Under the Thatch in Wales to preserve traditional buildings and local communities. I&apos;d love to do something similar in Eastern Europe, particularly Bulgaria. Property developers - many of them British - have been buying up 10 houses at a time, wonderful stone-tiled buildings. They&apos;re either being left empty and will eventually rot, or being modernised really badly. At Under the Thatch, we restore sensitively and drop the prices until the cottages fill, so we can employ people all year round. In Bulgaria there&apos;s a risk that buildings that have been preserved by poverty will be ruined by people who see it as the new Costa del Sol.  LUCY SIEGLEEthical columnist, The Observer This year we&apos;ll see a rise in the standard and variety of homegrown &apos;eco-ware&apos; hotels. The Andaz (formerly the Great Eastern) on Liverpool Street is at the vanguard (andaz.com). It has a fairtrade purchasing policy, intelligent lighting, a super-duper heating system and water reduction policy, and it sources food and drinks locally. All of which means you can have a break in the city without leaving a footprint the size of greater London.  Travellers are beginning to realise that the term &apos;no-frills airline&apos; is shorthand for &apos;intense misery&apos;, what with the security queues, the being barked at like an errant two-year-old, and the cancellations - never mind the carbon emissions. This really could be the age of the train. I quite fancy a &apos;deluxe compartment&apos; on the Danube Express (danube-express.com). Billed as a luxury &apos;hotel on wheels&apos;, from May it will run from Budapest to cities including Istanbul, Prague, Krakow and Berlin, pulled by a modern, electric locomotive.  SIAN BERRY Green Party candidate for Mayor of London I&apos;ve spent much of 2007 travelling around the UK doing research for my book, 50 Ways to Greener Travel. I have noticed a huge swing towards people taking domestic holidays in the old-school places: seaside resorts and national parks. We have the most stunning coastline, beaches and countryside in the world. It&apos;s a pity the train companies aren&apos;t doing much about high fares and complicated booking procedures. Though if you take a carful of people, it&apos;s as efficient for your carbon footprint as travelling by train. More and more people I know are planning to take the train to Europe. Even my non-green friends are turning their backs on low-cost flying, keen to rediscover the romance of rail travel. Can there be anything more romantic than a sleeper cabin? And some of them are even talking about InterRailing in 2008, now it&apos;s open to all ages. Personally, I&apos;d love to go to Copenhagen - the cycling capital of Europe.  THE LUXURY LOVERS GLEN DONOVAN Founder, luxury travel company Earth  I&apos;m very excited by Brazil. We&apos;ve discovered some great new boats - converted fishing boats, not gin palaces, with just six to eight cabins - which you can hire to travel along the smaller tributaries of the Amazon.  Warapuru (warapuru.com), the new Anouska Hempel hotel on the coast at Itacare in Bahia, opens next year. We&apos;re hoping it will kickstart a wave of Aman-style small boutique hotels. The hotel will have 40 pavilions tucked away in the rainforest with a spa and a beach club. I&apos;m also likely to be spending a lot of time on the Gower Peninsula in Wales in 2008 - I&apos;ve just bought a ruined barn there. The beaches are different from Brazil&apos;s but, in their own way, just as staggering.  MELINDA STEVENS Travel editor, Tatler Of course there will be fresh places on the up which will be exciting to visit this year, but there are also some old favourites which have strapped on their dancing shoes and are ready to jig. Thailand, for example, has been in and out of fashion since before the Vietnam War, but this year it&apos;s going crazy, with a mass of upmarket hotel openings including the splashiest of the lot, Soneva Kiri on Koh Kood (sixsenses.com) scheduled to open by the end of 2008, with its massive private villas, personal butlers and knockout beach. The Soneva properties are all about eco-cool, but it doesn&apos;t stop them from being the most indulgent places on the planet.  WENDY KENNEALLY Senior product manager, long-haul specialist Kuoni Travel Bali is seeing a return to popularity, with business up by 26 per cent for 2008 so far. The country offers a superb combination of fascinating culture, beautiful beaches and excellent service. At the top end, the private villas of the Chedi Club (ghmhotels.com) - a former tea estate among rice paddies - or the lavish Ritz-Carlton (ritzcarlton.com), which has been renovated, are noteworthy, while there are also some wonderful options inland such as The Alila Ubud (alilahotels.com). India is also booming for 2008. We are seeing an increase in boutique properties with a twist, such as tea estates, small palaces which are run by descendents of the royal families, as well as luxury tented accommodation. PHILIP HAMILTON-GRIERSON Marketing director, luxury tour operator Cox &amp; Kings We&apos;re particularly excited about a luxury train we&apos;re launching in India in the autumn. It will travel from Mumbai to Kolkata and run year round, offering affordable luxury and visiting major places of interest en route, such as Varanasi and Delhi. It&apos;s like a cruise on land - you have the benefit of keeping your things in one place yet seeing a lot of the country. We&apos;re also offering a new boat in the Galapagos Islands called La Pinta, starting in March. It claims to be the most luxurious vessel in the region and is good news as the Americans tend to block-book boats, making availability tight. There&apos;s a restriction on numbers visiting the Galapagos, so it will become an increasingly exclusive destination. ESCAPE&apos;S PICKS JOANNE O&apos;CONNOREscape editor I&apos;ve just finished reading Philip Pullman&apos;s Northern Lights and am now obsessed with the idea of seeing the Aurora Borealis. This winter, tour operators Black Tomato and Original Travel are starting tours to Svalbard, a remote archipelago inside the Arctic Circle where there are almost as many polar bears as humans. I want to go dog-sledding under the northern lights and enjoy a pint in the northernmost pub in the world. After that, I might need some sunshine, so I&apos;ll head to Turkey to walk the Lycian Way. There are some lovely guesthouses opening along this coastal route to cater for walkers. Exclusive Escapes has a good selection, and for 2008 it can arrange stays with locals in traditional village houses. TOM HALLTravel editor, Lonely Planet Bmi&apos;s takeover of the routes and fleet of BMed (British Mediterranean Airways) has got me interested in using two of their more unusual routes to visit Syria. An open-jaw trip into Damascus, below, and out of Aleppo would get any traveller&apos;s mouth watering. Damascus&apos;s Old City and Umayyad Mosque for starters, then Palymra&apos;s enormous Roman ruins, the Crusader castle of Krak des Chevaliers, and finishing with a few days getting lost in Aleppo&apos;s souks. For somewhere different, Yemen is an increasingly accessible trip for anyone with a nose for an under-rated Arabian adventure - and there won&apos;t be a chintzy Dubai-style hotel complex in sight.  TOM ROBBINSEscape deputy editor Last winter, the ski industry was obsessed with exploring ever more exotic slopes, from Japan to Alaska, Kashmir and Kamchatka. But this year things are turning full circle - the real trend is the rediscovery of the tiny, traditional mountain villages of the Alps. Perhaps it&apos;s because of the best early-season snow in Europe for more than a decade, combined with a growing aversion to long-haul flights and the over-crowded pistes of the mega-resorts. Swiss villages such as Lenzerheide, Grimentz, Vals and St Peter, for example, once dismissed as too small for anyone but families and learners, are now drawing advanced skiers looking for powder fields that don&apos;t get tracked out by others within an hour of the lifts opening. Young companies like Snowmotions (00 41 76 345 6292; snowmotions.com) are specialising in such villages and also offer guides to take guests on long off-piste tours from hamlet to hamlet, without another soul in sight.", "tags": ["Travel"], "title": "Where's hot for 2008?", "sentences": ["For somewhere different, Yemen is an increasingly accessible trip for anyone with a nose for an under-rated Arabian adventure - and there won&apos;t be a chintzy Dubai-style hotel complex in sight."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/dec/30/2", "publicationDate": "2007-12-30T11:09:52Z"}, {"article": "Abustling metropolis and a ski slope: unless you are talking about dry slopes, or that one in the deserts of Dubai, these two things are not usually linked. But here&apos;s an interesting exception to the rule that a ski trip must mean staying in a little village: Salt Lake City. The state capital of Utah has all the trappings of your average US city - cinemas, eclectic restaurants, a sports stadium, bars and shopping malls - and fascinating extras such as the humongous cathedral that is the world headquarters of the Mormon religion. It also happens to have seven ski resorts within a 35-minute drive, giving you the chance to do a winter holiday in a whole new way. Up to your eyeballs in powder all day then, instead of dancing on the tables in your salopettes or heading out to dinner in moonboots, you change into urban togs and go out on a real town, with a population of 180,000.  Utah boasts, indeed has trademarked, the &apos;Greatest Snow on Earth&apos; - huge dumps of it, six storeys high over a season, falling fast and furious but dry and light as weather systems cross the western sierras and hit the Wasatch Mountains. Every day is a chance to fly down the canyons and glide the fluffy glades. Then at night the piste seems far away as you head to a jazz club, or experience the all-American atmosphere of a basketball game at the stadium, complete with hot dogs, beers and cheerleaders.  There are regular public buses to the four closest resorts - Alta, Snowbird, Brighton and Solitude - with pick-ups and drop offs at the main hotels. Private shuttles operate between Salt Lake and the other three: Park City, Deer Valley and The Canyons. Or for quicker and more flexible - and not wildly dearer - transport, hiring a car for the week gives the ultimate freedom. The very same mountains also provided the giant granite blocks that built the Mormon temple which dominates the city centre. It is not unusual for foreign visitors to be squeamish about this off-beat religion, but rather than tiptoe around the subject all week, it is easier to plunge in and take a stroll around the temple&apos;s grounds, reading the plaques that explain its bizarre origins. The church has recently taken steps to ensure that nervous tourists are not accosted by zealous missionaries. There is no general public entry to the temple itself, but the world-famous Tabernacle choir rehearses in public and puts on concerts at the nearby convention centre.  And after that dip into religion, what better contrast than to step into the Hotel Monaco nearby and almost fall over the ostentatious &apos;harem sofa&apos; in the entrance (it&apos;s a sort of four-poster sofa, draped in satin). This boutique hotel describes its own rooms and restaurant as &apos;sexy and whimsical&apos;, and frankly a harlequin would feel camouflaged against the flamboyant decor. They give out free shoulder massages and glasses of wine in the lobby and guests without their own pets can borrow a goldfish.  There&apos;s no shortage of cuisine in Salt Lake - sushi, Mexican, Thai, gourmet American, Italian, seafood buffet. And it is proud of its art galleries, spas, brasseries, museums, festivals, night clubs, even a gay scene. Contrary to popular perception, it&apos;s not &apos;dry&apos; either - there are bars aplenty, although some require you to become a temporary member before you can get stuck in. But the slopes are just as big a draw, blessed, as they are, with almost twice as much snow every winter as rival Colorado. Alta has cult-status among expert skiers across the continent and beyond, on account of its reliable powder and steep slopes and couloirs which are a rarity in many US resorts. Snowboarding is banned here, but not in nearby Snowbird whose pistes are linked to those of Alta, making one of the biggest ski areas in the US. The only real drawback with either area are the resorts themselves - Alta is little more than a scattering of lodges, Snowbird is full of claustrophobic concrete blocks - but of course this is neatly side-stepped if you are day-tripping from Salt Lake. Rookies are better off next door in Big Cottonwood Canyon, at the quiet Solitude resort or on the forgiving pistes and in the picturesque fir-lined glades of my personal favourite, Brighton.  Brighton is known as the place &apos;where Utah learns to ski&apos; - children aged less than 10 ski for free. But it&apos;s not just a beginner&apos;s boot-camp. In recent years the snowfall has almost matched that of Alta and Snowbird, and experts are cottoning on to the fact that the deep stuff gets tracked-out far less quickly in a resort mainly full of families. After an ecstatic afternoon under brilliant blue skies flashing down the intermediate slopes, our little party ran into Britain&apos;s star freestyle skier Mike Wakefield and his up-and-coming ski pal Andy Collin in the car park. These two teenagers are totally at home spinning somersaults in world competitions but reported an excellent day at Brighton and were heading next for the stunt skiing &apos;terrain&apos; parks in Park City. &apos;It&apos;s amazing here,&apos; Wakefield said. &apos;The snow in Europe is so much heavier and stodgier.&apos;  And over in the direction of the 2002 Olympic Games bobsleigh, luge and ski-jump park, are Salt Lake&apos;s three other local resorts, trendy Park City itself, upmarket Deer Valley and the fun sprawl of The Canyons. Hiring a car makes sampling them all a possibility in a week, and if you&apos;re staying for 10 days, you could even consider venturing 90 minutes north to two other resorts, local favourite Powder Mountain - not named in vain - and Snowbasin. Here you can try the runs on which the Olympic downhill and super giant slalom races in 2002 were run - just in case you needed any more ski stories to come home with.

It is arguably the most perilous job in Pakistani politics. Bilawal&apos;s grandfather died at the gallows, his mother following last week&apos;s bomb and bullet attack. But his leadership will be initially symbolic because the party will be stewarded by his father, Asif Zardari, until his studies at Oxford are over. &quot;When I am at university my father will take care of the party,&quot; said Bilawal at his maiden press conference at the family estate in Naudero. &quot;The party&apos;s long struggle for democracy will continue with renewed vigour,&quot; he said. &quot;My mother always said, democracy is the best revenge.&quot; It was a remarkable day for Bilawal, described by relatives as a polite, somewhat bookish young man who just one week ago was a university student on Christmas break at the family home in Dubai. Now, barely coming to terms with the assassination of his mother, he has become the titular head of Pakistan&apos;s greatest political dynasty as the country staggers towards turbulent elections. Also yesterday the PPP said it would contest the January 8 elections, despite widespread violence that has rocked the country leading to more than 40 deaths, mostly in Bhutto&apos;s home province of Sindh. The other opposition leader, Nawaz Sharif, said he would also contest the poll. Bhutto supporters vowed to throw themselves back into electioneering. &quot;If the government tries to quash us, Pakistan will be finished. You can write this with my blood,&quot; said one. The day started with grief when Zardari, clad in black, led prayers for his wife. Mourners beat their chests, many with fresh tears in their eyes. &quot;How many Bhuttos will you kill? We are all ready to die,&quot; Zardari shouted. Out in the street, posters of Bhutto in her various incarnations - young firebrand, prime minister, diplomat, mother - plastered the walls, a reminder of the giant vacuum to be filled. Black-clad women with hoarse voices and gleaming eyes filed past. &quot;Benazir is innocent!&quot; they cried. Inside the sprawling house, senior party officials were still wrestling with their grief. Navid Khan, Bhutto&apos;s formidable assistant, slumped on a table with wet cheeks and a vacant stare. Government claims that Bhutto died from a bang to the head as she ducked into her bulletproof jeep last Thursday, sparked angry talk of head wounds, brain matter and bullet holes. &quot;I never heard that landcruisers are fitted with bars that can kill you. It is so ridiculous,&quot; scorned her press secretary, Farhatullah Babar. The main business of the day was to choose Bhutto&apos;s successor. For a party dominated by one woman for three decades, it was a critical decision. &quot;The thread that was keeping us together was broken. The beads are together because of an explosion of grief. But now we need a new thread, to hold it all together,&quot; said Babar, the spokesman. As the leadership meeting approached, Zardari cross-legged in a room of mustard tiled walls, his son, Bilawal, sat beside him, rarely speaking. A portrait of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former prime minister who started the Bhutto legacy, looked down from the wall. When Bilawal read out his mother&apos;s political will it emerged that her first choice was her husband, Zardari. But the party elders deemed that fresh blood was needed. With his political inexperience, shy demeanour and Armani glasses, Bilawal was not the obvious candidate to lead his mother&apos;s party. During the press conference Zardari deflected reporters&apos; questions away from his son, pleading that he was at a &quot;tender age&quot;. His son&apos;s name would be changed, he said, from Bilawal Zardari to Bilawal Bhutto Zardari - a key piece of branding in Pakistan&apos;s tribal-feudal political system. &quot;We will avenge the murder of Bhutto through the democratic process after winning the elections,&quot; he said. &quot;God willing, when it is the People&apos;s party&apos;s reign, when the People&apos;s party government is formed, then we would have taken revenge for Bibi&apos;s blood and that blood would not have gone to waste.&quot;", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "Middle East and North Africa"], "title": "My mother said democracy is best revenge - Bhutto son", "sentences": ["&quot;My mother always said, democracy is the best revenge.&quot; It was a remarkable day for Bilawal, described by relatives as a polite, somewhat bookish young man who just one week ago was a university student on Christmas break at the family home in Dubai."], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/31/pakistan.topstories35", "publicationDate": "2007-12-31T01:18:26Z"}, {"article": "Waitrose, the supermarket chain owned by department store group John Lewis, is to open more than 20 stores in Dubai by 2010 in its first foray abroad.

Asif Ali Zardari, a suave businessman and former polo player, is widely known in Pakistan as &quot;Mr 10 per cent&quot; after a string of charges against him for taking kickbacks from government contracts while his wife was prime minister. He served eight years in jail on charges ranging from corruption to murder, an experience which left him with chronic health problems. He emerged in 2004 after a judge controversially quashed his convictions. Part of that time was served for charges that he ordered the 1996 shooting of Benazir&apos;s younger brother, Murtaza, who had challenged her for the leadership of the Pakistan People&apos;s party. Zardari and Bhutto denied all the charges, describing them as politically motivated. Speaking to a journalist from Karachi central prison in 1997, Zardari called the allegations &quot;a meaningless game&quot; but did not directly challenge documentary evidence for the case against him, a large dossier that was reportedly sold to investigators by an unknown source for $1m (\u00a3500,000). The couple also denied ownership of some of the more extravagant properties they were said to possess, including a mansion in Surrey, bought for \u00a32.5m in 1995. It was formally owned by a network of companies and trusts around Europe, but when proceeds from the sale of the mansion were claimed by the government, Zardari&apos;s lawyers stepped in naming him as the beneficial owner. The struggle over the money is still under way in the British courts. The Swiss authorities are also investigating allegations that Zardari used the country&apos;s banks to launder millions of dollars from kickback deals. Benazir Bhutto stunned her western friends when she agreed to an arranged marriage with Zardari in 1987. It was a negotiated union between the two families, both wealthy landowning dynasties. He was best known in Pakistan at the time for the polo team he ran, the Zardari Four, but he represented serious money. His family owned a construction business and a Karachi cinema where he said he first spotted the young Benazir. She saw him for the first time only six days before their engagement was announced. At the time, she told a reporter that she found him &quot;tolerant,&quot; with a &quot;good sense of humour.&quot; Besides, she added, &quot;you get tired of saying no, no, no all the time.&quot; During Bhutto&apos;s two terms as prime minister, Zardari operated as a freewheeling broker for government contracts, operating without any portfolio until she named him investment minister in her last days in office. He caused a scandal by ordering the bulldozing of acres of protected woodland near the official residence in Islamabad, for a polo field and stables for his ponies. A senior government official, Muhammad Mehdi was fired after he complained about using public money on the project. The reputation the couple acquired during their time in power did much to confirm the Pakistani public&apos;s cynicism about politics. Zardari, 51, has homes in Manhattan and Dubai but has long been a power behind the scenes in the PPP. He made it clear yesterday he would overshadow his teenage son, who he shielded from questions on account of his &quot;tender age&quot;. Although the party maintained yesterday that Bhutto had named him as her chosen successor, its decision to elevate him to a formal role as one of the party&apos;s top officials, suggests it feels the tarnish on his reputation is outweighed electorally by his association with the Bhutto name. Ijaz Gilani, the head of the Gallup polling organisation in Pakistan, thinks the Zardari appointment could prove costly to the PPP. &quot;Most believe in the corruption stories about him,&quot; Gilani said. &quot;My hunch is that under the present circumstances the party&apos;s hardcore supporters will stand by the decision. However, it will turn off the people on the margins, and it is these free-floating, less committed voters that count. It will hurt the party in the electoral outcome.&quot; He said he thought the appointment of Zardari, was more emotional than rational. &quot;I suspect the atmosphere is very introverted at this time,&quot; he said. &quot;What it does is it reveals the darker side of the People&apos;s party, which has always been this dynastic aspect. It will further turn off the intellectuals ... which have been a key element in its growth.&quot;", "tags": ["World news", "Pakistan", "Middle East and North Africa", "Asif Ali Zardari"], "title": "Asif Ali Zardari: 'His elevation will turn off floating voters.

The chair at the head of the table was empty apart from a portrait of the assassinated matriarch and political leader, Benazir. There was urgent business on the agenda. As grieving supporters shouted at the gates of her home, her softly spoken son, Bilawal, produced an envelope containing a handwritten &quot;political will&quot; - written two days before her ill-fated return from exile last October - and started to read. In her testament, Benazir Bhutto called on her husband, Bilawal&apos;s father, Asif Ali Zardari, to take over the reins of her party on her death. But her posthumous wishes were overruled by her family. Within moments, Bilawal became the third Bhutto to lead Pakistan&apos;s largest political party - a job with a terrifying death rate. Described by friends and relatives as a reserved and polite young man, Bilawal initially rejected the job that was thrust upon him yesterday. &quot;He didn&apos;t want to do it. He wanted to continue his studies,&quot; admitted Ali Jafri, an uncle whose task it was to &quot;prepare&quot; the teenage dauphin for the role. Ultimately there was little choice. The inexperienced Oxford student accepted the job with a short speech in which he urged the party to work &quot;for the poor downtrodden people of Pakistan&quot;, according to Zulfikar Ali Mirza, a family friend who was present. He also urged those present to &quot;run the party democratically&quot; - an ironic touch given that his mother was &quot;chairperson for life&quot; and he himself was selected without a vote. A black belt in taekwondo and enthusiastic target shooter, Bilawal will be a figurehead until he completes his studies at Oxford, becoming the third generation Bhutto to study there. But in a country dominated by a 40-year-old political cult, the symbolism will be powerful. Bilawal is something of an unlikely candidate. Jafri, his uncle who shared the family&apos;s eight-year exile in Dubai, described him as a shy and bookish teenager who never had a girlfriend. &quot;The mother wouldn&apos;t allow it,&quot; he said with a smile. &quot;Bilawal was never a sporty guy. He was always into magazines, books and history. He was a very, very shy boy. But with tons of effort we&apos;ve groomed him very well. He was learning everything from [Benazir] about politics and about Pakistan.&quot; Alan Duncan, the Tory shadow business secretary and longtime friend of Ms Bhutto, said Bilawal had spent a couple of days working for him during the summer before he began studying at Oxford. &quot;He seemed to me quite reserved, dutiful and steeped in the cause of the family. There are moving echoes of what happened to Benazir when she was at Oxford, when her father was deposed and hanged. She rose to events and I have no doubt that Bilawal will do so too.&quot; Bilawal&apos;s shyness is perhaps behind his decision to go by the name Bilawal Lawalib - his first name spelt backwards, at Oxford. Fellow students described him as popular and sociable. They say he does not broadcast his family connections and appears to live the life of any other first-year student. On the section of his Facebook page devoted to favourite quotes he lists jokey comments from Oxford friends and the words of his own family, including his mother. Messages of sympathy now fill his wall on the site, and on the day of the assassination, he added the quote: &quot;Well behaved women rarely make history&quot;. In throwing himself into Oxford student life, he has followed in his mother&apos;s footsteps. Bilawal has been to several debates and social events at the Oxford Union, of which Benazir was president in 1976, but has not expressed any intention to run for elected office himself. &quot;He was a familiar face at the Union,&quot; said Luke Tryl, who was president last term. &quot;He&apos;s very charismatic and engaging; he speaks confidently and eloquently. He seems very worldly and aware. He&apos;s chatty, he is willing to speak to lots of different people and he&apos;s good at making friends with new people. He never said who his family were. I only found out some time after I met him.&quot; Christ Church second year student Phillippa Neal said: &quot;It was something that was known but not broadcast as particularly interesting or special.&quot; At the age of 15 and a student at a prestigious school in Dubai with top GCSE grades under his belt, Bilawal was reported to be a keen swimmer, horseman and squash player. Asked in an interview with the Pakistani daily newspaper Dawn in 2004 if he had immediate plans to go into politics, he was undecided. &quot;We will see, I don&apos;t know. I would like to help the people of Pakistan, so I will decide when I finish my studies ... I can either enter politics, or I can enter another career that would benefit the people.&quot; That choice seems to have been taken out his hands. Bilawal will now be groomed by party elders in the dark arts of Pakistani politics. It will be a lesson in survival. Mirza, the family friend, said: &quot;Here, politics are very volatile. It&apos;s not like playing a game where one can go home and sleep well. It&apos;s full of risks. You have to be very, very careful.&quot;Additional reporting: Ed Hancox Young heads King Hussein of Jordan Ascended the throne in 1952.
