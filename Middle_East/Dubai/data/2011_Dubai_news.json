His players marked the occasion with a comfortable victory that revives Sunderland&apos;s Europa League ambitions while quite possibly testing their manager&apos;s resolution to restrict his intake of nerve-assuaging pork pies and lagers during 2011. Despite a couple of disappointing festive defeats, Bruce&apos;s team are now sixth. &quot;We&apos;ve given ourselves a chance of staying there,&quot; Sunderland&apos;s manager said, before stressing that nothing is certain. &quot;We&apos;ll try our utmost but football drives you mad; it drives you to the fridge \u2013 to the pies and the beer.&quot; Last Tuesday the Wearsiders had 32 scoring chances but missed them all and lost 2-0 at home to Blackpool. Four days on, life seemed altogether smoother as they swiftly went two goals up courtesy of a couple of inviting crosses from the excellent Ahmed Elmohamady. Emphasising that he is a better right-winger than full-back, the Egypt international prompted Danny Welbeck&apos;s sixth goal in eight games with a centre Blackburn failed to clear. The strike from the Manchester United loanee flew past the wrongfooted Mark Bunn after taking a hefty deflection off Ryan Nelsen. It was not long before a wonderful Elmohamady cross picked out Darren Bent, who relieved considerable personal and managerial frustration by out\u2011leaping Grant Hanley and heading his first goal in six games to leave Steve Kean, Blackburn&apos;s new manager, scratching his forehead. By now the away dugout was filled with furrowed brows, but it hardly came as a surprise that Kean&apos;s team were struggling. Rovers had arrived without nine injured players, seven of whom \u2013 including Paul Robinson, Christopher Samba, Phil Jones and Steven Nzonzi \u2013 would have been certain starters. Commendably undaunted, they might have pulled a goal back had El Hadji Diouf \u2013 deeply unpopular during his Sunderland days \u2013 not volleyed off target after connecting with Morten Gamst Pedersen&apos;s splendid free-kick. It was arguably a very big miss. If set pieces looked Blackburn&apos;s best hope of a goal, Bruce&apos;s side proved pleasingly fluent in open play and nearly scored again when Welbeck&apos;s chip struck the bar. A case of double Diouf nearly brought Rovers back into things early in the second half, but Mame headed off target after meeting El Hadji&apos;s fine cross. The latter had earlier provoked much merriment when landing painfully on his backside while retrieving a ball on the touchline. Pantomime villains seldom come more stereotypical. Bruce&apos;s defence \u2013 generally well-marshalled by Titus Bramble \u2013 lived dangerously again as David Dunn went close with a volley, but his colleagues were soon on the back foot when a typically clever pass from Steed Malbranque \u2013 happily restored to Sunderland&apos;s starting XI \u2013 played in Kieran Richardson, whose delivery prefaced Bent missing a sitter. The England striker fluffed two more decent openings and the impressive Jordan Henderson hit the bar with a chipped shot, but a third goal was en route, arriving shortly after Asamoah Gyan replaced Bent. Sunderland&apos;s \u00a313m Ghana striker met a glorious long pass from Henderson and, with Kean&apos;s defenders backing off, Gyan directed a subtly curving shot into the bottom corner. &quot;It was tough to take,&quot; said Kean, who continues to talk confidently about &quot;reaching the top six&quot; next season, even if he does now concede Europe is an &quot;unrealistic&quot; ambition for the Venky&apos;s-owned club this term. &quot;We had nine bodies out but the margins were still very, very fine. If we&apos;d pulled a goal back they&apos;d have been under real pressure.&quot; Although he shared a drink with Kean, Bruce spared a thought for Kean&apos;s Ewood Park predecessor. &quot;I dedicate that win to Sam Allardyce and I hope that over in Dubai, or wherever he is, he&apos;ll raise a glass of something to us,&quot; Bruce said. &quot;Sam&apos;s was a ludicrous sacking; what the hell is going on at Blackburn?&quot; THE FANS&apos; PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT  PHIL WILSON, Observer readerWe almost scored too early. We had chances in the second half and I wasn&apos;t entirely happy until we got the third. Gyan wasn&apos;t on for long but he looked a class act and took his goal well. It was good for Darren Bent to get on the scoresheet but he was off the pace and was wasteful at times; I&apos;m not sure if he is 100% fit. It&apos;s nice to be going into the new year with 30 points. I didn&apos;t think we&apos;d be in this position at the start of the season, but we still have only an outside chance for European qualification\u00a0\u2013\u00a0we don&apos;t have enough depth in the squad to make a good enough run in the second half of the season.

The contest was even but the result showed the difference between the money spent on the teams&apos; respective strikers. Sunderland took their chances and the big fat zero by our name shows we didn&apos;t. We are trying to play a new brand of football \u2014 the attractive sort the new owners want \u2014 but we are three or four creative, attacking players away from being able to do that while not giving our defence too much work to do. The owners suggested there is money, but until they spend it we will struggle \u2013 and it could be the difference between, say, seventh and 17th.

Airline staff queued up to go on strike, collapsed travel companies left clients stranded around the world, and holiday bookings wobbled as consumer confidence dipped. Mother Nature intervened in April as Iceland&apos;s Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano spewed its innards across a\u00a0considerable chunk of the northern hemisphere, costing the airline industry $1.7bn in lost revenue. Then, predictably, Britain&apos;s transport system froze to a standstill as the snow arrived in December. But there are reasons to be cheerful in 2011. TripAdvisor&apos;s annual Travel Trends survey \u2013 which sampled 6,000 users \u2013 has revealed that Brits are hesitantly positive about their travelling prospects, with one in 10 planning to holiday more often this year. The Great British &quot;staycation&quot; also looks to be on the wane, with just 38% of those surveyed planning to stay at home for their holiday compared with 45% last year. Voluntourism and adventure travel are set to rise in popularity, our appetite for the Middle East is expected to grow apace with new flights to the region, and long-haul travel is fighting its way back against the dominance of European city breaks and mid-haul sun-seeking. 1. EasyJet enters Jordan     Photograph: PA    Spearheaded by the emergence of Dubai as one of the world&apos;s busiest flight hubs (the airport&apos;s capacity surpassed JFK last September), and the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council&apos;s prediction that the region&apos;s tourist growth will outstrip any other in 2011, British holidaymakers are expected to pour into the Middle East. Having entered the region with its first flights to Tel Aviv in 2009, easyJet is adding Jordan to its portfolio, with flights into Amman scheduled to begin in March, from a lead-in price of \u00a3105.98 return. With midsummer temperatures regularly tipping over 40C, aim for a\u00a0visit during spring or autumn.Details Flights begin on 27 March (easyjet.com) 2. Trailblazing in Nepal     Photograph: Rex Features    A recent TUI study reported British travellers are more likely to book an adventure travel trip over the next three years. For those looking to sate their inner explorer this year, a groundbreaking new trail in Nepal should do the job. Australian Robin Boustead has spent 152 days traversing a series of routes winding beneath the world&apos;s highest peaks over the past few years, meticulously mapping the Great Himalayan Trail (thegreathimalayatrail.org) \u2013 the first continuous trail across the Nepalese Himalayan arc from Kanchenjunga on the eastern border, through the foothills of Everest, concluding on the Tibetan border in the west. The inaugural public expedition, led by Boustead himself, begins in February and will cost an eye-watering \u00a320,500 for the entire trip. But World Expeditions has broken the trail down into a handful of sections that can be &quot;hopped&quot; on to from \u00a32,350 for 18 days.Details worldexpeditions.co.uk 3. Airbnb in Asia     Photograph: Alamy    Airbnb.com, the peer-to-peer B&amp;B network that invites tourists into locals&apos; spare bedrooms and apartments, grew phenomenally last year and has set its sights on Asia in 2011. While the network \u2013 and similar networks such as iStopOver and Crashpadder \u2013 has developed huge bases in Europe and North America (the site boasts more than 4,000 listings in New York), a promotional drive has seen the company&apos;s portfolio in Asia increase significantly. Beijing, Bangkok and Seoul have seen notable additions, but Shanghai (pictured)\u2013 helped by its large expat community \u2013 is leading the pack with a tenfold increase in the second half of last year, including sleek modern apartments in the French Concession, where the majority of the new additions are clustered.Details Shanghai rooms from \u00a36.40 per night (airbnb.com) 4. Hi-tech adventures in Portland     Photograph: Robert Galbraith/Reuters    Near Field Communications (NFC) is something many Londoners use every day \u2013 it&apos;s the technology that lets you enter the tube system via an Oyster card \u2013 and industry insiders expect it to have a significant impact on air travel, with mobile phones being used as boarding cards. But a Google experiment in Portland, Oregon, is seeing the technology rolled out to hundreds of caf\u00e9s and restaurants in the city in the form of stickers. Visitors will soon be able to hold their phone up to a sticker in the window of an establishment and have all of its reviews transmitted on to their display.Details tinyurl.com/NFCportland 5. Overland from Ecuador to Colombia     Photograph: Alamy    Tourism has continued to grow year on year in Colombia, with the high-end crowd setting its sights on new boutique hotels in Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn \u2013 luxury specialists Cox &amp; Kings has earmarked the country as one of its most in-demand destinations of 2011. Provincial travel in the country, however, has stuttered due to heightened tensions with neighbouring Venezuela and Ecuador. But after a two-year hiatus due to Foreign Office advice, Dragoman Overland is returning to Colombia with an epic trip across the country. The 19-day Andean and Caribbean Trails begins in the Ecuadorian capital of Quito before heading into the market town of Otavalo and then across the border into Colombia. The route takes in the old town of Popay\u00e1n and the Purac\u00e9 National Park in the south before rising up through Andean coffee plantations and the cloud forests of the Sierra Nevada foothills, then down on to the unspoilt beaches of the Tayrona National Park before finishing in the walled city of Cartagena (pictured).Details Eight departures in 2011 from 1 June, \u00a3650 plus a\u00a0kitty of \u00a3300 (dragoman.com) 6. Mid-haul Libya     Photograph: Alamy    In 2011 short-to-medium-haul winter-sun destinations outside the eurozone, such as Turkey (where easyJet is launching two flights a week into Izmir from May) and Egypt, are predicted to remain strong, with a\u00a0fringe of more adventurous travellers trying out more unusual \u2013 but equally accessible \u2013 destinations. Libya is the last north African country to open up to European tourism and has seen steady rises in visitor numbers since the recent relaxation of visa requirements, making it possible for visitors to obtain visas at the point of entry. According to the Lonely Planet Thorn Tree travel forum, Libya is targeting 1.5 million visitors a year under its 2008-12 tourism programme.Details Explore (0845 013 1537, explore.co.uk) features three itineraries, with a five-day tour of Tripoli, ancient Sabratha and Leptis Magna from \u00a3826pp including flights 7. Turin city break     Photograph: Alamy    With the continuous growth of city-break tourism expected to be one of the key drivers in the recovery of European tourism as a whole, Brits are expected to venture beyond the usual suspects for a value-for-money urban weekend in 2011. Turin will be a\u00a0good bet, with the city acting as the focal point for a line-up of events celebrating the 150th anniversary of Italian unification (Turin was the newly united Italy&apos;s first capital from 1861-64). The recently derelict Officine Grandi Riparazioni \u2013 a vast 19th-century locomotive factory in the heart of the city \u2013 will house large temporary interactive &quot;laboratory exhibitions&quot;, and more than 300 Italian masterpieces (including works by Caravaggio, Giotto, Botticelli and Da Vinci) will be on show at the newly restored Venaria Reale, a 17th-century hunting palace on the fringes of the city.Details Ryanair (ryanair.com) flies to Turin from Stansted, Edinburgh and East Midlands from \u00a337.98 return.

Rugby (and food) in New Zealand     Photograph: Getty    With 66% of Brits planning to travel long haul next year, according to TripAdvisor, 25,000 are expected to head to New Zealand for this autumn&apos;s Rugby World Cup. As part of the biggest tournament in the country&apos;s history, hundreds of events are being staged, including performances by Kiri Te Kanawa in Auckland and the transformation of Cathedral Square in Christchurch into a mini rugby pitch. There will be farmers&apos; markets, new wild-food menus at hundreds of restaurants on the South Island, oyster festivals, and a wine festival bringing together more than 50 wineries in the Marlborough region.Details Rugby World Cup, 9 September to 23 October (nz2011.govt.nz). England Rugby Travel (0844 788 5000, englandrugbytravel.com), Gullivers Sports Travel (01684 878 590, gulliverstravel.co.uk) and Thomas Cook Sport (0844 800 9900, thomascooksport.com) are offering travel-plus-ticket packages 9. Making an eco village in Sierra Leone     John Obey beach, Sierra Leone    Voluntourism is expected to continue to be one of the fastest-growing markets in global tourism, and a brand-new venture on a remote Sierra Leone beach is one of the most intriguing projects. As the country gears up for its 50th anniversary of political freedom in April, the John Obey beach community is the newest undertaking by Tribewanted \u2013 the social experiment that saw hundreds of volunteers build a sustainable eco resort from scratch in Fiji over the past three years. The first-footers arrived in October, and work is already under way, with locals and &quot;tribe members&quot; working together to build the first mud houses in the new eco village. The perks? Downtime is spent exploring the forests, fishing with locals, and lounging on some of Africa&apos;s most untouched beaches.Details A week with Tribewanted Sierra Leone costs \u00a3295 (sierraleone.tribewanted.com) 10. Tallinn for culture, Kopaonik for budget skiing     Photograph: Alamy    Long famed \u2013 and unfairly so \u2013 as a\u00a0cheap destination for lager-swilling Brits on tour, the Estonian capital is taking its responsibilities as European Capital of Culture very seriously. Hundreds of events are planned for 2011, with a different festival each month, including the Old Town festival in June, an opera festival in August and a film festival in November. July will see the opening of the new Estonian Maritime Museum, in vast, renovated sea-plane hangars on the city&apos;s western coast. Elsewhere in eastern Europe, Skyscanner reports a 130% rise in winter searches for Serbia as value-seeking skiiers opt for the increasingly popular resort of Kopaonik (pictured).Details easyJet (easyjet.com) flies to Tallinn from Stansted and Liverpool from \u00a355.98 return.

The plan is the brainchild of Balaji Rao, a member of the family who run Venky&apos;s, the Indian chicken company which recently bought the Lancashire club. Ronaldinho has been given permission by Milan to find a new club and was widely believed to be heading back to Brazil to play for Gremio. But his brother and agent, Roberto de Assis, revealed to he Daily Mirror that Blackburn and another unnamed Premier League club have been in contact with him about signing the Brazilian World Cup winner. &quot;Blackburn have contacted us. There is also other interest in England but this is confidential,&quot; said De Assis. Venky&apos;s leaked news of its interest on its website briefly yesterday before removing it. However, sources close to Rovers reveal the move has been on for the past month. Rovers are understood to have offered Ronaldinho a \u00a3130,000-per-week, two-and-a-half-year contract and would also have to pay Milan a fee. Rovers&apos; chances of landing Ronaldinho appeared slim after he was given permission by Milan to leave their training camp in Dubai and fly back to Brazil to negotiate a transfer. &quot;It&apos;s just a decision by him to change his life, go back to Brazil,&quot; Milan&apos;s coach, Massimiliano Allegri, said last night. &quot;It&apos;s difficult for him to come back.&quot; The Brazilian clubs Gremio, Flamengo and Palmeiras have said they are interested in the playmaker. Ronaldinho&apos;s brother left the door open tantalisingly when he added last night: &quot;We will arrive in Porto Alegre in order to negotiate with Gremio but nothing is decided yet. &quot;Everything depends on how these negotiations go. If we don&apos;t reach an agreement with a club in Brazil, then he will return to Milan, as he is still a Milan player. We are not ruling anything out.&quot; The Rao family bought Blackburn for \u00a343m in November and showed their ability to shock the footballing world when they sacked the manager, Sam Allardyce, a few weeks later. Venky&apos;s chairman, Anuradha Desai, said after Allardyce&apos;s departure that the new owners wanted a top-five finish and &quot;good football.&quot; The signing of Ronaldinho would certainly fit in with that remit and bring a fresh buzz to Ewood Park. A source close to Venky&apos;s was last night reported as saying the club have been in negotiations with De Assis for several weeks and have made their interest in the player official.", "title": "Blackburn Rovers launch bid to sign Brazilian legend Ronaldinho", "sentences": ["Rovers&apos; chances of landing Ronaldinho appeared slim after he was given permission by Milan to leave their training camp in Dubai and fly back to Brazil to negotiate a transfer."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-03T00:13:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/03/sunderland-blackburn-rovers-premier-league", "tags": ["Premier League", "Sunderland", "Blackburn Rovers", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2010-11", "Steve Kean"], "article": "It was hard not to feel sorry for Steve Kean. His depleted Blackburn Rovers team were comfortably beaten yet attempted to play the sort of attractive football conspicuous by its absence during Sam Allardyce&apos;s tenure. Then, by way antagonism, Steve Bruce dedicated Sunderland&apos;s victory to his old pal Allardyce and suggested Kean&apos;s predecessor would interrupt a Dubai holiday to raise a celebratory glass. &quot;It&apos;s not a problem,&quot; said the new Rovers manager. &quot;I&apos;ve had a drink with Steve, it&apos;s OK.&quot; If their conversation proved a little awkward it probably did not perturb Kean; a few minutes in the articulate Scot&apos;s company reveals a confident and thick\u2011skinned character. Asked how it feels to have so many people openly doubting him, Kean did not require pause for thought. &quot;I&apos;ve been in the game a long time as a player, a coach, an assistant manager, I&apos;ve worked abroad so there&apos;s nothing too new. I&apos;ve taken it all in my stride. I don&apos;t think the fact I&apos;ve not done this job before is a massive handicap. &quot;As far as getting the respect of the players there&apos;s no problem; we&apos;ve got a good relationship. We&apos;ve shown real togetherness and, despite having nine bodies out injured, are playing attacking football.&quot; Rovers \u2013 with David Hoilett and David Dunn clearly revelling in new\u2011found creative freedom \u2013 sit in mid-table but further adverse results could still provoke a relegation fight. But Kean said: &quot;We&apos;re trying to stabilise and have a top 10 finish. The push for the top six will happen in the next window. This window we want three, possibly four, new signings and we don&apos;t need to raise capital by selling any emerging players. That&apos;s the first time this club&apos;s been in that position for a long time.&quot; It is quite a while since Sunderland mounted a realistic challenge for Europe but their autumn 2011 schedule could yet feature continental assignments. Two fine right\u2011wing crosses from the excellent Ahmed Elmohamady enabled the increasingly impressive Danny Welbeck and, then, Darren Bent to quickly put Bruce&apos;s side two up before the substitute Asamoah Gyan sent a glorious, late, third curling into the bottom corner. Although Bent registered his first goal in six games he, once again, disappointed. &quot;I&apos;ve never lost faith in Darren,&quot; said Bruce before hinting he may omit the sometime England striker for the visit to Aston Villa on Wednesday. &quot;Class is permanent and Darren will always score but he&apos;s not playing for a manager who won&apos;t drop him. I had a decision to make here but Gyan was stiff and sore. &quot;If Gyan is fresher on Wednesday I won&apos;t be frightened to change things. Asamoah has got that touch of the unexpected but he&apos;s finding it hard to adapt. His family are in Ghana. And he was expecting a break; he didn&apos;t think the Premier League played in the winter.&quot; It appeared that Bruce may have abandoned recent attempts to make a 4-3-3 formation featuring Gyan, Bent and Welbeck \u2013 who after scoring six times in eight games is undroppable \u2013 work. Not so. &quot;We&apos;ll keep persevering with the three strikers,&quot; said Sunderland&apos;s manager, whose side looked much more fluently menacing in 4-4-2 mode with the recalled Steed Malbranque&apos;s midfield invention complementing the industry of Jordan Henderson and David Meyler. &quot;I won&apos;t give up on it but one thing I have looked at is that when all three play together we often don&apos;t score.

Yes book-giving, part of the Bookstart scheme run by the Book Trust, giving books to babies and older children, which was to be abolished by the education secretary, Michael Gove, despite the fact that it cost the state only \u00a313m and levered in \u00a356m from publishers and donors. A big fuss by Labour, a phalanx of writers and those dismissed by the rabid right as the &quot;chattering classes&quot; forced a U-turn just before Christmas, and now Rosemary is off to meet the Queen. The Lady, of whom we hear much of late, was never for turning. Her successors, by contrast, seem to spend their days hatching silly plots and watching them unravel. Round and round they go on the malevolent\u00a0carousel. \u2022 A tough start to the year, alas, for Chelsea captain John Terry, following his contretemps with a team-mate on Sunday as his team tries to arrest an inexplicable slide. And it was a trying 2010 for &quot;JT&quot;. First, at the turn of the year, he was alleged to have had an affair with his England team-mate Wayne Bridge&apos;s former partner Vanessa Perroncel; then he was stripped of the England captaincy, and also nearly lost his wife, Toni, when she fled to Dubai. But all&apos;s now well with the couple, who live in a \u00a36.5m home in Surrey. JT&apos;s even getting on with the neighbours. Inhabitants in a 65-flat sheltered housing development have been very cross with him in the past for partying with his footie pals late into the night \u2013 keeping the septuagenarians and octogenarians awake. But that was so 2010. Now the Terrys are playing good neighbours. They&apos;ve offered to buy up some land from the old folk, at the back of their already large garden, to convert into grazing land for the family&apos;s horses. And it seems a good deal, for the money, all things being equal, will pay for overdue repairs to the two-story retirement homes on the estate. For now, JT can do\u00a0no wrong in Surrey.

It probably feels pretty crap, especially to see the whole thing retold, with big pictures, in the Mail on Sunday and the mocking headline &quot;Hugh&apos;s Ferrari farrago&quot;. Perhaps the only person who might understand is Tommy Sheridan, who is facing imprisonment after his conviction on charges of perjury arising from his denials of a story in the Murdoch press. Just before the verdict, Sheridan bought chocolates for the court staff, a recognition of their assistance to him during the proceedings. They, in turn, made the chocolates part of a charity raffle. And they were much enjoyed by the winner, a photographer from the News of the World. \u2022 Finally, the cataclysmic events in Ambridge provoke comment from many different perspectives on different media.

But without the support of a key partner, whichpulled out of the ruling coalition at the weekend, Gilani will struggle to enact policies. The Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) believed a vote would &quot;damage the whole country&quot;, the party chairman, Raja Zafar-ul-Haq, told Reuters. The PML-N&apos;s decision means Gilani&apos;s fragile Pakistan People&apos;s party-led government could survive the country&apos;s latest political crisis that was triggered when the Muttahida Qaumi Movement withdrew from the coalition, depriving the government of a majority. The MQM pulled out on Sunday in protest at a rise in fuel prices, leaving the government 12 seats short of a majority. The move prompted speculation that the government could fall if the opposition decided to pursue a no-confidence vote. But today a spokesman for the PML-N, which is led by the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, said a no-confidence vote &quot;does not look like a possibility&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s a matter of concern for the government which has turned into a minority (in parliament) as to how they will effectively run its affairs,&quot; said Ahsan Iqbal. The second biggest opposition party, the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-Q), headed by Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, would not push for a no-confidence vote either, party officials said. Gilani spent much of yesterday locked in talks with opposition leaders. Last night President Asif Ali Zardari expressed confidence in the prime minister, in an apparent attempt to head off media speculation that ties between the two men had become strained. &quot;(Zardari) has full confidence in prime minister Yusuf Raza Gilani and solidly stands behind him in foiling any attempt to destabilise the coalition government,&quot; the presidential spokesman said in a statement. Despite the reprieve, analysts do not expect Gilani to serve out his term, which ends in 2013. &quot;The government may survive for some time but it can&apos;t continue indefinitely in this state,&quot; said Hasan Askari Rizvi. &quot;It has to muster support. The opposition will continue to embarrass it and paralyse it.&quot; PML-N leaders were due to hold talks today on the party&apos;s response to the turmoil. Rather than demanding a vote of no confidence, the PML-N and other opposition parties may prefer to wear down a weak prime minister by blocking legislation and holding street protests to force an early election. &quot;The opposition will want this government to collapse rather than moving against it. All opposition parties will pounce on Gilani in the parliament,&quot; Rizvi said. The upheaval coincides with increased US pressure on Pakistan to hunt down Islamist militant groups to help it turn around the faltering war in Afghanistan. Washington said it would offer no comment on Pakistan&apos;s coalition politics but suggested the turmoil should have no effect on the campaign against the militants. &quot;I can&apos;t say at this point that the fact that they have this current political situation necessarily distracts them from ... what else they&apos;re doing,&quot; state department spokesman PJ Crowley told reporters. &quot;We are going to continue to work with the Pakistani government.&quot; Meanwhile, the exiled former president, Pervez Musharraf, said from Dubai that the new party he launched in October, the All Pakistan Muslim League, stood ready to contest early elections if they took place.", "title": "Pakistani opposition rules out no-confidence vote", "sentences": ["&quot;We are going to continue to work with the Pakistani government.&quot; Meanwhile, the exiled former president, Pervez Musharraf, said from Dubai that the new party he launched in October, the All Pakistan Muslim League, stood ready to contest early elections if they took place."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-04T09:08:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jan/05/secret-mediterranean-with-trevor-mcdonald", "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture", "Travel TV"], "article": "Trevor McDonald is on holiday. He had one before, remember, to the Caribbean? This time \u2013 The Secret Mediterranean with Trevor McDonald (ITV) \u2013 it&apos;s short haul. Not that he&apos;s slumming it: Sir Trevor is getting around in a private helicopter (thanks to Heli Air Monaco in the credits). A private helicopter is always the best way to meet other people along the way, I find. First stop is the French Riviera and a superyacht called the Christina O, which once belonged to Aristotle Onassis. It&apos;s available for charter, at \u00a3400,000 a week, if you&apos;re interested. On the way out to the ship in its splendid wooden tender, Trevor asks chief officer Lee Wilkes if he still gets a sense of excitement approaching the famous yacht. &quot;Basically I&apos;m a seafarer, been at sea for 25 years, and this is part of my career,&quot; says Wilkes. &quot;When I look back in time I&apos;ll tell my young son, &apos;This is what your dad&apos;s been doing.&apos; He thinks I chase pirates. This is a classic old ship, so I&apos;ll be able to say I&apos;ve worked on this.&quot; Eh? What does he mean? He&apos;s talking gibberish. Answer the question, man. It gets better on board, where Sir Trevor is met by general manager David Jean Jean. &quot;You need to be passionated to walk on the Christina,&quot; says Monsieur Jean Jean. &quot;Without passion I think you miss things.&quot; He has a lovely French accent; his passion more or less rhymes with my nation. Sir Trevor clearly doesn&apos;t lack any pation because he notices lots of things \u2013 the opulence, the sense of history, the beautiful backdrop of the C\u00f4te d&apos;Azur. In the bar \u2013 I think where Onassis&apos;s first wife, Athina, walked in on Ari getting a bit too passionated with Maria Callas \u2013 Jean Jean removes a barstool&apos;s new cover to show the original upholstery underneath. &quot;Dare&apos;s ernly wern bearsterl een de werld oo eez aving whel ferskeen,&quot; says David. Whale foreskin! Blimey. It looks a bit manky and stained, to be honest, probably through overpassionisation. David tells Trevor of the time when Ari told Greta Garbo she was sitting on the &quot;beegurst penniz een zi werld&quot;. &quot;She must have been impressed,&quot; says Trevor, Britishly. From the Christina O he choppers off to Turkey, and a brief sojourn downmarket at a camel-wrestling fair in the hills outside Izmir. The camels wrestle each other and produce disgusting slimy white foam from their mouths as they do so. A bout ends when a camel falls to the ground, or runs away, or \u2013 rather charmingly \u2013 when one starts crying. &quot;You&apos;re joking!&quot; says Trevor. &quot;Yes,&quot; says his guide, meaning no. They find a stall selling sausages. Made of? Camel, says the guide. &quot;You&apos;re joking!&quot; says Trevor, again. It&apos;s one of the things he says. Then it&apos;s back to opulence at Antalya with a stay at one of the most expensive hotels in the world, a hideous Vegas-Dubai style blingtastic monstrosity built by Azerbaijani oligarch Telman Ismailov. A night in the royal suite costs \u00a312,000, the swimming pool is 16,000 square metres, and there&apos;s a canal with gondolas. Trevor doesn&apos;t take one, though. Because next stop is Venice, where he has a ride in a real one, propelled by a real gondolier. A gondolier with a difference though, because she&apos;s a she, one of only two. It&apos;s not easy being a lady gondolier: on the waterways she&apos;s shunned by the others. &quot;I&apos;m still surprised there&apos;s even latent hostility, because it&apos;s so unmodern,&quot; says Trevor. Chauvinism in Italy? Who&apos;d have thought it? It&apos;s an odd hotchpotch, this show. There seems to be no reason in the route; Trevor hops about from one side of the Med to the other, in search of the unfamiliar in the familiar. Some of the little pieces are quite nice, there are good characters such as David Jean Jean and the gibbering seaman on the boat, and the frothing camels at the fair. But I&apos;m not getting much sense of the Mediterranean as a place or an idea, either today or historically. And Sir Trevor isn&apos;t the best guide, I&apos;m afraid. Ever so nice, but that&apos;s not enough for a travelogue. You need to bring something, some kind of expertise perhaps, or a personal reason for a journey. The Secret Caribbean with Trevor McDonald had that \u2013 he was born in Trinidad, it was journey to his past and his roots. This one doesn&apos;t.

Simon Ford, who received a London fire brigade gold award after risking his life to rescue victims on the No 30 bus in Tavistock Square in the 2005 terrorist attacks, was a key player in a sprawling network of underworld criminal gangs who flooded south-east England with drugs. He will now serve 14 years in prison. Details of the 41-year-old&apos;s case can be reported for the first time after the final member of the drugs and money laundering gang faced sentencing at Southwark crown court and legal restrictions were lifted. As part of Operation Eaglewood, 520 officers carried out simultaneous dawn raids at 30 addresses in the capital and the home counties in February 2008, leading to 16 linked trials spanning two years. A run-down but heavily fortified taxi garage, Royal Oak Taxis, under the Westway in Paddington, west London, was at the hub of the drugs operation. Huge consignments of cocaine, ready for repackaging and distribution, passed through its doors, with the offices also acting as a one-stop money laundering shop, where bags of sterling were swapped for \u20ac500 notes. Ford was one of 22 people arrested during the dawn raids, led by Scotland Yard&apos;s special intelligence section (SIS) after 10 months of surveillance, with officers employing a mechanical digger to ram through the wall of one address in Uxbridge, Greater London. The Soho-based firefighter was caught by officers at his flat in Chertsey, Surrey, as he divided more than 100kg of cocaine worth around \u00a35.5m, for delivery to a ring of couriers waiting at service stations around the M25. Ford&apos;s medal for bravery was displayed on a table near where police caught him sorting through the parcels. The waterproof packages had been picked up the previous night on a beach in Hythe, Kent, after being delivered from Europe by men on an inflatable boat. They were still wet with sea water, police said. Ford, who admitted laundering several million pounds and conspiracy to supply cocaine, had become a trusted member of the network after taking cocaine as he struggled to cope with the aftermath of the 2005 bombings. Cage-fighter Aman Salhan, of Harlington, west London, also found in the flat, was jailed for 17 years after being convicted of conspiracy to supply. As police searched the property, dozens of phone calls were made to three pay-as-you-go mobile phones as worried criminal contacts tried to discover why the two men were late. Detective Superintendent Steve Richardson, the head of SIS, said the operation had dealt &quot;a huge blow&quot; to the British class A drugs industry. The money laundering and drug distribution network was linked to up to 10 criminal gangs with interests in Colombia, Spain, Israel, India, Dubai, Morocco and other north African states. The investigation began after undercover police followed two known drug smugglers as they met a mystery accomplice. They learned that the accomplice was 47-year-old Eyad Iktilat, who operated Royal Oak Taxis, which masqueraded as a taxi repair and loan company but was in fact a front for a vast criminal empire. Millions in cash and drugs passed through its doors, earning Iktilat a fleet of prestige cars including a Bentley Continental, a Ferrari with personalised plates, and several homes. Iktilat, of Euston, central London, was jailed for 30 years after being convicted of money laundering, conspiracy to supply cocaine and cannabis and possession of cocaine. Money mules brought bags of up to \u00a3500,000 in cash to the taxi company to be converted into \u20ac500 notes via Euro Foreign Exchange (EFX), a corrupt currency exchange company in Paddington, where the manager, 56-year-old Jean-Claude Frigieri, bought hundreds of thousands of pounds-worth of \u20ac500 notes from a banknote wholesaler known as Interchange. Frigieri, of West Molesey, Surrey, was jailed for 10 years after being convicted of money laundering. Others linked to the gang included a convicted murderer, bodybuilders and Cambridgeshire drug dealer Russell Tate, 49, whose brother, Patrick, who was shot dead in a Range Rover in Rettendon, Essex, in 1995. The gang&apos;s main banker, Iraq-born Maythen al-Ansari, 42, was jailed for three years for money laundering after police used a digger to smash down a wall at his Uxbridge home. &quot;These criminals had been living the lives of wealthy businessmen through their criminal activity. The lives they are now leading could not be more different,&quot; DS Richardson said. &quot;The link between drugs and violence has been well made and can ultimately be traced to violence and harm in London&apos;s boroughs.

The former Australian soldier was handed the death sentence last January after a Kabul court found him guilty of shooting an Afghan colleague before making a crude attempt to make the crime look like a Taliban attack. But it emerged this week that Robert William Langdon persuaded two supreme court judges that he should be allowed to live after the family of the dead man, who was known as Karimullah, accepted a large compensation payment raised by Langdon&apos;s relatives in Australia. However, the payment, known in sharia law as ibra, was not enough to commute the whole sentence, so Langdon will face 20 years in Kabul&apos;s notorious Pol-e-Charki prison, home to Taliban and al-Qaida inmates as well as criminals. The jail term is thought to be the longest given to a westerner in Afghanistan since the toppling of the Taliban regime in 2001. At the time of the killing in May 2009, Langdon was working for Four Horsemen International, a private firm which works with the US military and specialises in protecting military supply convoys. According to the Afghan court&apos;s two-page judgment on the case, which has been seen by the Guardian, the killing took place during a routine journey with a supply convoy through hostile territory south-east of Kabul. About 60 expatriate and Afghan guards were travelling with the convoy when they were ambushed by insurgents. After stopping in the capital of Wardak province Karimullah argued with Langdon that it\u00a0was too dangerous to continue and they\u00a0should wait until the following morning. During the argument Langdon shot Karimullah as he sat in the cab of his vehicle. Another foreign contractor was ordered to move the vehicle containing Karimullah&apos;s dead body to an isolated area out of town where the guards were ordered to fire their weapons into the air &quot;in order to make it look like an enemy attack&quot;. The vehicle was torched with the help of a grenade thrown by Langdon. Langdon hurried back to Kabul, where he withdrew $10,000 from his Afghan bank account and tried to board a Dubai-bound plane. However, he was arrested by airport police after some colleagues raised the alarm. Langdon, who was sentenced to death by two different courts, had argued that he acted in self-defence after thinking Karimullah, who was sitting in a car, was reaching for his own gun. &quot;He reached across, and I am ex-military, so it was like bang-bang-bang-bang,&quot; Langdon said at his appeal. &quot;I didn&apos;t have time to think. We had just been hit, we didn&apos;t know what was happening and everyone was antsy.&quot; Namatullah Hafizi, head of the attorney general&apos;s punishment department, said withdrawing the death sentence was justified given the family&apos;s ibra payment, but said that such a ruthless crime deserved a long jail sentence, particularly given Langdon&apos;s &quot;cruel&quot; desecration of the corpse. &quot;Burning the body in our religion is a serious action,&quot; he said. Langdon will serve his sentence in Pol-e-Charki prison alongside just a handful of other foreigners, mainly drug smugglers and murderers. Langdon&apos;s family have not commented on the case and the former soldier himself has shied away from the media since his arrest. Security firms are widely despised in Afghanistan, where they are blamed for fuelling corruption and behaving with impunity even when their activities lead to innocent members of the public being injured or killed. The Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, has repeatedly called for security companies to be closed down.

But, far from being the black-cab repair garage it purported to be, it was instead a one-stop shop for criminal gangs whose members included a fireman hero of the 7/7 attacks. It served as the hub of a vast drug and money laundering network that flooded the south-east of England with an estimated \u00a3100m worth of cocaine. The astonishing reach of the criminal network throughout London and the home counties emerged as the last of 33 gang members \u2013 all of them arrested during the biggest simultaneous drug raids ever staged by Scotland Yard \u2013 was today sentenced as part of Operation Eaglewood, begun by the police special intelligence section (SIS) three years ago. Those convicted following the dawn raids by 520 officers on 22 addresses \u2013 with police using a JCB mechanical digger to smash down a security wall in one case \u2013 have been sentenced to a total of more than 200 years in jail. Among them is Simon Ford, 41, a firefighter commended for heroism after he risked his life to rescue victims on the No 30 bus which was blown up in Tavistock Square during the suicide bomb attacks on London in 2005. The recipient of a London Fire Brigade gold award for bravery, he claimed he turned to cocaine after the 7/7 bombings. But he went on to become an important member of the network of underworld gangs responsible for importing, repackaging and distributing drugs, then laundering profits on an industrial scale through a corrupt bureau de change. Details of the convictions had been subject to legal restrictions, which were lifted today following the conclusion of the last of 16 linked trials spanning two years. The raids came after a 10-month surveillance operation targeting 10 established gangs who worked together to create a &quot;clearing house&quot; to launder profits. The centre of this criminal spider&apos;s web was Royal Oak Taxis, a rundown, fortified garage and cafe owned by Israeli-born Eyad Iktilat, 47. He was also a director of the nearby Euro Foreign Exchange, through which up to \u00a31m a day in drug money would be laundered. Millions of pounds in cash and drugs flowed through the garage&apos;s shuttered doors as the gangs used it as a &quot;clearing bank&quot;. Teams of runners, or &quot;money mules&quot;, dropped sackfuls of sterling to be exchanged into more easily transportable \u20ac500 notes at the nearby foreign exchange. Undercover detectives were led to Iktilat in April 2007 after following two convicted drug traffickers who were meeting a mystery accomplice. When arrested, one of them, Kofi Appiagyei, 28, was found to be in possession of a bag stuffed with \u20ac1.6m (\u00a31.36m) and a raid on his home uncovered a Glock pistol. Police discovered that the mystery accomplice was Iktilat, whose criminal dealings had allowed him to establish a fleet of cars including a Porsche and a Bentley Continental, both with personalised plates, and an extensive property portfolio to which he was poised to add a \u00a32.75m villa development in Spain. Further leads took officers to Simon Ford&apos;s door. The Soho-based firefighter was on sick leave, claiming to be suffering from stress. He was due to give evidence to the 7/7 inquest. Initially he was believed to be a money launderer, as he was seen making repeat visits to drop off bags containing up to \u00a3500,000 in cash at the taxi garage. Only after the raids did investigators realise what an important role Ford played in the gang network. He was caught red-handed at his flat in Chertsey, Surrey, as he divided more than 100kg of cocaine, worth around \u00a35.5m, into bags \u2013 his medal glittering on a display table nearby. The drugs had been picked up from a beach in the Kent coastal town of Hythe the previous night, having been smuggled from continental Europe on a rigid-hulled inflatable speedboat. When officers stormed Ford&apos;s property, the waterproof canoe bags in which the drugs had been smuggled were still wet with seawater. Ford was due to distribute the drugs to a ring of couriers waiting at service stations around the M25 within the hour, police believe. As officers searched the flat, dozens of calls were made to three pay-as-you-go mobile phones as worried criminal contacts wondered what had happened to Ford. The firefighter, who owned two Audis and lived what has been described as a &quot;champagne lifestyle&quot;, had compiled a handwritten delivery list. Drug paraphernalia littered his plush flat, along with a freshly prepared line of cocaine. He admitted laundering several million pounds and conspiracy to supply cocaine, and was jailed for 14 years. Aman Salhan, 28, a cage fighter from Harlington, west London, who was also arrested in Ford&apos;s flat, was jailed for 17 years after a jury found him guilty of conspiracy to import cocaine. Iktilat, of Euston, north London, denied counts of money laundering, conspiracy to supply cocaine and cannabis, and possession of cocaine, but was convicted after a five-month trial. Initially jailed for 21 years, his sentence was increased to 30 on appeal. &quot;He did not believe he was doing anything wrong. He believed he was acting as a bank,&quot; said an officer. In two years, an estimated \u00a3100m passed through the ramshackle breeze-block taxi building. It was then taken to the bureau de change. There, manager Jean-Claude Frigieri, 56, of West Molesey, Surrey, bought up to \u20ac450,000 at a time, sometimes several times a day, from a bank note wholesaler called Interchange, which had no idea about his criminal dealings. He was convicted of money laundering and jailed for 10 years. Belying the gangster movie image, this collection of drug and money laundering gangs maintained an &quot;amiable&quot; relationship with each other, according to a senior investigation source. If one gang was late paying for drugs, it was given more time, and not subjected to violence for fear of attracting police attention. Criminals would be &quot;introduced&quot; to Royal Oak Taxis, paying a usual 5% commission to &quot;clean up their money&quot;. &quot;For a drugs gang, the hardest part is not smuggling the drugs in, it is cleaning up their money,&quot; said the senior investigator. Helping them to do that was the network&apos;s main banker, Iraqi-born Maythen al-Ansari, 42, from Hillingdon in west London, whose extensive business interests allowed him to deal with large sums of money without attracting attention. He was jailed for three years for money laundering. The network&apos;s tentacles stretched to Colombia, Spain, Israel, India, Dubai, Morocco and other north African states. Others linked to the gangs included a convicted murderer, bodybuilders, and a Cambridgeshire drug dealer, Russell Tate, 49, whose brother Patrick was shot dead in a Range Rover in Rettendon, Essex, in 1995. Detective Superintendent Steve Richardson, head of SIS, said the operation dealt a huge blow to the UK class-A drug industry. &quot;These criminals had been living the lives of wealthy businessmen through their criminal activity. The lives they are now leading could not be more different. &quot;The link between drugs and violence has been well made and can ultimately be traced to violence and harm in London&apos;s boroughs. Operation Eaglewood has prevented these men contributing to that.&quot; The final gang member to be imprisoned was Anwar Laraba, 39, of St John&apos;s Wood, north London. He was jailed for four years and eight months at Southwark crown court today after admitting conspiracy to supply cannabis. Two suspects, Carlos Tabares and Nicholas John &quot;Peter&quot; Tayler, are still wanted by police for offences including money laundering, drug trafficking and conspiracy to supply cocaine. Jonathan McGarry, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said today&apos;s trial was the last in a series of 16 linked hearings that formed the biggest case ever handled in London by prosecutors and the Met. He said: &quot;Having also co-ordinated the 16 trials, I have seen dozens of corrupt criminals face justice and a series of drugs and money laundering networks disbanded. I thank the Metropolitan police for their exhaustive investigation, and pay tribute to the witnesses who bravely came forward to give evidence to ensure these dangerous men would not go unpunished.&quot; Others to be jailed included Royal Oak Taxis co-owner Stuart Wright, 49, of Paddington, who was convicted of money laundering and jailed for 10 years, and Patrick Dowling, 49, also of St John&apos;s Wood, who admitted money laundering and two cocaine supply conspiracies, and was jailed for 10 years. The banker Iraqi refugee Maythem al-Ansari was the main banker. When police swooped on his \u00a33m west London home they had to use a digger and angle grinders to smash through a fortified security wall. He arrived in Britain in 1999 as Mithum Mohammed, later changing his name to al-Ansari, a famous banking name in Saudi Arabia.

Fallon will be 46 next month and another championship, eight years after his last, would make him the oldest jockey to take the title since Lester Piggott rode 188 winners in 1982 at the age of 47. Joe Mercer was 45 when he won the championship in 1979, and Scobie Breasley, in 1957, and Sir Gordon Richards, in 1953, were champions at 49. In recent decades, though, the title has often been won by much younger jockeys with the strength, stamina and determination to get them through a gruelling season. To win the championship, which runs during the turf season from March to November, it is necessary to travel many thousands of miles by road or air, never mind on horseback, and frequently ride at two meetings in one day. Fallon, though, insisted that his desire to be champion remains strong. &quot;This year I&apos;ll be really hungry, probably more so than any other jockey and I&apos;m going to be working really hard,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve done it many times before and know what it takes and how to pace myself. Richard [Hughes] didn&apos;t know he was in the championship until after Royal Ascot. I talked to him in the weighing room when he was 28-1 and I said to him, &apos;Richard, you&apos;ve got a chance here&apos;. &quot;He did take some days off and then all of a sudden went for it, but if you&apos;re going for the championship you can&apos;t afford to take one day off. In the end he just killed himself, taking in all the night meetings and going for 10 or 12 rides a day. He&apos;s tough but after having thrown so much at it, has he got anything left? Hopefully he won&apos;t and there will be only one or two guys to go after, rather than three or four.&quot; Fallon had his first rides of 2011 at Meydan today, partnering four horses on a low-key card ahead of the start of Dubai&apos;s Carnival series of meetings next week. He could not record his first winner of the year, though, with a third place the best he could manage. Fallon was edged out of third place by Ryan Moore in last year&apos;s title race, riding 131 winners to the former champion&apos;s injury-affected total of 137. Paul Hanagan and Hughes, meanwhile, were well clear of both, with 191 and 189 winners. Despite the ground he needs to make up from last year, Fallon is no better than 7-2 with the bookmakers to win his seventh championship, behind the strong favourite Ryan Moore, top-priced at 11-10. Hanagan is 5-1 to retain the title, with Hughes available at 8-1, and it is 20-1 bar. It will certainly require immense application by Fallon if he is to defy the recent statistics on the age of champion jockeys, though his travails over the years with drugs and court cases do at least ensure that, in some respects, he does not have many miles on the clock. At this stage, however, Moore looks by far the more credible candidate for the title, and it is a surprise to see him trading at a fraction of odds-against.", "title": "Kieren Fallon will go all out to win 2011 Flat jockeys' championship", "sentences": ["Hopefully he won&apos;t and there will be only one or two guys to go after, rather than three or four.&quot; Fallon had his first rides of 2011 at Meydan today, partnering four horses on a low-key card ahead of the start of Dubai&apos;s Carnival series of meetings next week."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-06T20:36:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/jan/06/2022-world-cup-qatar-asian-cup", "tags": ["World Cup 2022", "Football politics", "Fifa", "Qatar", "Football", "Sport", "Asian Cup 2011", "World Cup"], "article": "From the moment a grinning Sepp Blatter opened the envelope in Zurich on 2 December to reveal that Qatar would host the 2022 World Cup, the pressure has been on the hitherto little-known nation to stage an impressive 2011 Asian Cup and go some way to proving the doubters wrong. This doesn&apos;t mean the tournament \u2013 which runs from tomorrow, when the hosts kick off against Uzbekistan, to 29 January \u2013 will be a dress rehearsal for 2022. Most of the work \u2013 including the new stadiums, the hotels and the infrastructure \u2013 will be done over the next 11 years, and anyone who witnessed the changes in the city over the previous 11 will have no doubt that they will be done and done very well indeed. The next three weeks are about changing what locals feel are misconceptions about the country. These have spread far and wide. The Australian national team are in action over the next three weeks and hoping for better results than their 2022 bid team which secured one vote. That still rankles down under as the comments from Les Murray, a respected Australian broadcaster and Fifa ethics committee member, showed at the time of the vote. &quot;That Qatar should hold the World Cup is a notion that borders on the ludicrous,&quot; Murray said. &quot;Who&apos;s going to go to Qatar? No fans are going to go \u2026 There&apos;s no pedestrian culture in Qatar, there are no pavements. If you walk the streets you are suspected of something.&quot; In fact, the only thing anyone walking would be suspected of is not owning a car in a nation where everyone drives (those that can afford to at least; others will have to make do with buses or wait for Deutsche Bahn to build the metro system). Nonetheless, we will have to wait until 2022 to see if people travel to Qatar as the Asian Cup is not going to be a litmus test. Few from outside west Asia will go. Even in the region itself, fans from major cities such as Riyadh, Kuwait City, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Manama don&apos;t have far to travel and may not stay. The big boys from elsewhere \u2013 Korea, Japan and Australia \u2013 will be cheered on mainly by expats but that is always the case when the competition is held in west Asia. Australia&apos;s supporting group, the Green and Gold Army, said that &quot;very, very few&quot; were expected to make the trip from down under while Red Devils who will travel from South Korea will be measured in the 10s rather than the hundreds. With around 20% of the local population Indian, the second-best supported team should be the south Asian rank outsiders. Questions about the ability of Qatar to handle a massive influx of international football fans won&apos;t be answered this month. What the country is ready to do is to ensure that for fans who do come from far afield, it all runs as smoothly as possible. For the duration of the tournament, visitors will be able to collect their visas upon arrival at the airport. They will likely join the locals on the city&apos;s promenade, known as the Corniche, home to hotels, skyscrapers and the giant countdown clock that has almost reached zero. The distinctively designed Sheraton Hotel has been around for longer than most but doesn&apos;t plan anything special for the competition except &quot;screens in the bars&quot;. Watering holes do exist in this part of the desert but unlike the 2022 World Cup fan zones, which will have beer freely available and tolerate scantily clad Brazilians if necessary, the Asian Cup areas will not serve alcohol. Locals, though, are bemused by the focus on alcohol from overseas. &quot;The World Cup is not just about beer,&quot; one journalist said. &quot;Qatar is a country with high international standards. Qataris may not drink but respect the rights of others to do so. Fly with Qatar Airways and see if they serve alcohol or not.&quot; A member of the local organising committee promised lots of fun ahead. &quot;Staff and volunteers are working hard to ensure that fans will have a great time,&quot; he said. &quot;There will be concerts every day, Asian food festivals, dancing and lots of performances for people to enjoy. We will help fans organise excursions into the desert and explore the country. And the weather is beautiful.&quot; One charge that can&apos;t be put down to bitterness about Fifa decisions but can be laid to rest to some extent over the next few weeks is that Qatar lacks a football pedigree. Having never qualified for the World Cup and having progressed past the Asian Cup group stage only once, even the most loyal fans would struggle to argue that point. A good showing may go some way to silencing the snipers but with Qatar&apos;s habit of naturalising talented South Americans and shoving them into the national team, maybe not. When the countdown clock is reset to 2022 after 29 January, it is going to feel like a long time before the country can show the world what it really can do but if Qatar can avoid making any mistakes that will be seized upon by the international media that will be a good start. 2011 Asian Cup format Group A Qatar, Kuwait, China, Uzbekistan Group B Saudi Arabia, Japan, Jordan, Syria Group C South Korea, India, Australia, Bahrain Group D Iraq, North Korea, United Arab Emirates, Iran Top two from each group qualify for quarter-finals to be played on 21 and 22 January.

The England striker has a thigh injury and Alan Pardew, the Newcastle manager, seized a conveniently timed opportunity to prevent one of his key players from burning out while keeping him thousands of miles away from suitors. &quot;I&apos;ve sent Andy away. He&apos;s had a tough season so I&apos;ve told him to get some sun,&quot; said Pardew, who believes Carroll has a 50-50 chance of being fit for the important Premier League derby at Sunderland on Sunday week. &quot;It&apos;s a total rest for Andy. He&apos;s a super player, I love him to bits and I just want to make sure he comes back refreshed. The injury might be a blessing in disguise \u2013 the break might be a good thing for Andy, it might refresh his batteries.&quot; As a strong advocate of a winter break for England&apos;s top division, Pardew believes clubs can benefit from sending certain players away to soak up vitamin D in warmer winter climes during January. It is something Sir Alex Ferguson has been quietly doing for some years at Manchester United and his Newcastle counterpart said: &quot;If you get the opportunity to give players a break you have to, for sure. I think this is an opportunity for Andy.&quot; During a transfer summit with Derek Llambias, Newcastle&apos;s managing director, on Tuesday Pardew received firm assurances that the much coveted Carroll will not be sold during this transfer window. On Wednesday the club rebuffed an inquiry from Tottenham and today Pardew said: &quot;It was good that Mike Ashley [Newcastle&apos;s owner] and Derek Llambias made that commitment that Andy is not for sale. I&apos;m pleased about that. We won&apos;t be selling any player that we don&apos;t feel needs to be moved on.&quot; Although Tottenham Hotspur&apos;s David Bentley appears to be his main target, Pardew is hoping another name on his shopping list may arrive on Tyneside by the weekend. &quot;We&apos;ve made an inquiry today and we are waiting to hear back from the club,&quot; he said before delivering an ode to Bentley. &quot;David Bentley is the type of player we&apos;re looking to because I don&apos;t think you need to be a genius to know crosses can play a big part for us,&quot; Pardew said. &quot;A player who crosses the ball with Bentley&apos;s accuracy would be a very important addition.&quot; Should Bentley arrive it is likely to be as a permanent transfer rather than on loan. &quot;To buy or loan is something we&apos;re weighing up,&quot; said Newcastle&apos;s manager. &quot;Loaning players from the Premier League isn&apos;t easy. There&apos;s loan fees attached in certain situations and you have to weigh up if it&apos;s better to go for a buy. I think that&apos;s where we are.&quot; Fresh from Wednesday night&apos;s 5-0 thrashing of West Ham United, Pardew then hinted that he is also hoping to recruit from his former club. &quot;I want a player, our board wants a player but that doesn&apos;t mean the other club wants to sell,&quot; he said. &quot;In some ways you don&apos;t know if the result yesterday was a good thing or a bad thing.

Everybody knows that the real reason behind the festivities was Milan&apos;s 1-0 win away at Cagliari. &quot;A Milan who win do good for Italy and strengthen the government,&quot; declared Silvio Berlusconi this week. &quot;When we win everybody celebrates with me in parliament and there are happy faces. When we lose they are all a bit more sad.&quot; The smile on Silvio&apos;s face will have been that little bit broader after a victory that confirmed Milan as the winter champions. Defeats for Napoli and Juventus and a draw for Lazio allowed the Rossoneri to extend their lead at the top of Serie A to five points, with one round of games remaining until the season&apos;s midway stage. The record books show that the winter champions have gone on to win the Scudetto in more than two-thirds of all Serie A seasons. Not that Milan need to go looking for omens, because far more encouraging than any such statistic was the nature of the victory. The Rossoneri were not at their best \u2013 a very long way from it, in fact \u2013 but this was a significant result for a side striving to prove they are not Ibra-dependent. Yesterday they were not only without Zlatan Ibrahimovic due to suspension, but also Alessandro Nesta, Andrea Pirlo, Kevin-Prince Boateng, Mathieu Flamini and Gianluca Zambrotta. In their absence Milan looked flat, uninspired and maybe even a little exhausted from their thinly-disguised marketing expedition to Dubai. With just over 10 minutes to go Cagliari, driven on by a boisterous crowd at the Stadio Sant&apos;Elia, seemed as likely as their hosts to snatch a winner, and had passed up the best chance of the game, Nene failing to convert after the Milan goalkeeper Christian Abbiati passed the ball straight to him inside the area. But then Antonio Cassano came on. Well, actually what he did first was run around looking for a pair of shinpads. After his own failed to materialise Cassano had to be lent a sweaty pair by the already substituted Gennaro Gattuso. As he stood on the sideline waiting, he looked every bit the man who had shown up in Dubai a week and a half earlier 2.5kg overweight, prompting Ibrahimovic to suggest he needed to go on a &quot;little diet&quot;. If Rafael Ben\u00edtez failed to have his panettone before leaving Milan it may have been because Fantantonio got to it first. But a lack of fitness is temporary and nobody could really blame him for being a bit out of shape after being kept out of training for two months at Sampdoria. All that will matter to Milan is that he had enough in the tank five minutes after his introduction to sprint on to a neat backheel flick from Robinho and play a delightful disguised pass to Rodney Strasser, who slipped it past Michael Agazzi for the winner. Strasser may have been a fraction offside but it would have been a marginal decision. Certainly nothing was going to take the shine off the goal for the 20-year-old midfielder, his first for the senior side. &quot;Did you see that pass [Cassano] gave me,&quot; he exclaimed breathlessly afterwards. Before the game he had ribbed his team-mate over his Barese dialect. &quot;[Cassano and I] got on immediately, even if I don&apos;t understand what he&apos;s saying when he speaks. And I speak three languages&quot; &quot;The next time you say you don&apos;t understand when I speak I am going to give you a punch,&quot; said Cassano to Strasser as the pair boarded a plane home later that evening but it was meant in good spirits. Strasser, a product of the Milan youth system with three previous Serie A appearances to his name, has already been on the receiving end of a taekwondo kick from Ibrahimovic this season, though the pair are said to be good friends and share a table every day for lunch after training. What he&apos;ll make of Cassano&apos;s bizarre bottom-grabbing antics, of course, is a whole different matter&apos; He will continue to have a significant role to play in the coming days. Massimo Ambrosini&apos;s yellow card means he is due a suspension, while Gattuso may struggle to recover in time for the game against Udinese on Sunday following a knock to the thigh. So too will his fellow youth team graduate Alexander Merkel, who started yesterday&apos;s game. A committed effort to bring through such players this season would represent perhaps an even greater step forwards for Milan than that which has already been achieved in the league standings. Almost the perfect weekend for Milan, then, but yesterday evening brought a note of caution from their own stadium, hand-delivered by one of their own former stars. Leonardo was almost as impressive in his debut on the Internazionale bench as Cassano had been coming off it for their rivals, his team swatting aside a Napoli side who had come into the game joint-second and boasting the second-best away record in the league. More impressively still, they did it without J\u00falio C\u00e9sar, Wesley Sneijder, Samuel Eto&apos;o or Walter Samuel. &quot;I don&apos;t want to understand, I want to live,&quot; declared Leonardo after admitting he was &quot;surprised&quot; by the ease of his team&apos;s victory. It is hard to imagine such a statement ever falling from the lips of the self-consciously studious Ben\u00edtez, though he too was acclaimed by the home support. &quot;Ben\u00edtez: A sincere thanks from us, the only ones who always backed you,&quot; read a large banner hung from the upper tier. &quot;And now full faith in Leo&quot; Leonardo was quick to play down his own impact and will know there is a very long road ahead. His team kicked off 16 points behind Milan, and though they can close the gap to seven if they win their games in hand, it is also true that no Inter coach has won both their first two games in charge since Luigi Simoni in 1997 (and Leonardo is Inter&apos;s 12th manager since then). A visit to Catania, beaten just once at home so far this season, on Sunday will be no walk in the park. But as long as he can keep his team playing with the enterprise they showed yesterday, Inter will have hope. If Thiago Motta can stay healthy long enough to contribute a few more goals like this, we may see a few a few frowns in parliament yet. Talking points \u2022 If it was a happy return to action or the Milan clubs it was anything but for Juventus. To lose 4-1 at home to Parma was humiliating, for Sebastian Giovinco, who they loaned to Parma, to get two of the goals \u2013 even if he didn&apos;t celebrate \u2013 was infuriating, but to lose Fabio Quagliarella for the rest of the season to a cruciate ligament injury was just plain crushing. The Bianconeri were already in advanced negotiations to sign Luca Toni from Genoa but with Vincenzo Iaquinta already ruled out for three weeks they will surely need to come up with something more than an ageing forward who has scored just three times in 15 games. Their top scorer will not be easily replaced. \u2022 One-nil up, 2-1 down, then 4-2 winners. Life is never dull for Roma, is it? There was much uproar in this morning&apos;s papers over two of their goals \u2013 John Arne Riise seemed to carry the ball over the line before cutting it back for Marco Borriello to equalise at 2-2, and then Mirko Vucinic was in an offside position when he was played in to put Roma back ahead. Having said all that, Borriello&apos;s goal might well have been prevented if the defenders had played to the whistle and tried to stop him from scoring, instead of standing around with their hands in the air appealing while he nudged it into an unguarded net. \u2022 Another Roma forward, Stefano Okaka, scored the only goal of Serie A&apos;s first Puglia derby in a decade. Okaka, who joined Bari on loan, may have been marginally offside too, not that the away fans in the Curva Sud was complaining as he charged towards them after the goal, tumbling over advertising hoardings as he went. This was a huge win for last-placed Bari, their first away from home all season, but also for all those who successfully campaigned against an initial decision by local authorities to play the game behind closed doors. The game may not have sold out, as many had claimed it would, but beyond the ubiquitous paper bombs, the fans were mostly well behaved. \u2022 Adrian Mutu is expected to explain his bizarre departure from a Fiorentina training session at a press conference this afternoon, but even as the club contemplated legal action against him, things continued to fall apart elsewhere. Their draw at Bologna was marred by Marco Marchionni&apos;s furious reaction to being substituted after an hour, while the club is struggling to convince a number of players including Riccardo Montolivo to put pen to paper on new contracts. For all the talent in the squad, Fiorentina are only two places outside the relegation zone. \u2022 Is it just me, or of the (few) goals in Serie A this season, have an abnormally high number been rather brilliant? Another classy strike from Antonio Di Natale.

More than half of world trade passes, at least on paper, through tax havens. More than half of all banking assets and a third of foreign direct investment by multinational corporations are routed offshore. An impression has been created in sections of the world&apos;s media, since a series of stirring denunciations of tax havens by world leaders in 2008 and 2009, that the offshore system has been dismantled, or at least tamed. In fact quite the opposite has happened. The offshore system is in very rude health \u2014 and growing fast. It is no coincidence that London, once the capital of the greatest empire the world has known, is the centre of the most important part of the global offshore system. The City&apos;s offshore network has three main parts. Two inner rings \u2013 Britain&apos;s crown dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man; and its overseas territories, such as the Cayman Islands \u2013 are substantially controlled by Britain, and combine futuristic offshore finance with medieval politics. The outer ring comprises a more diverse array of havens, such as Hong Kong, which are outside Britain&apos;s direct control but have strong links. This network of offshore satellites does several things. First, it gives the City a truly global reach. The British havens scattered all around the world&apos;s time zones attract and catch mobile international capital flowing to and from nearby jurisdictions, just as a spider&apos;s web catches passing insects. Much of the money attracted to these places, and the business of handling that money, is then funnelled through to London. Second, this British spider&apos;s web lets the City get involved in business that might be forbidden in Britain, providing sufficient distance to allow financiers in London plausible deniability of wrongdoing. Much (but not all) of the financial activity hosted in these places breaks laws and avoids regulation elsewhere. The three crown dependencies in the inner ring are substantially controlled and supported by Britain but have enough independence to allow Britain to say &quot;there is nothing we can do&quot; when other countries complain of abuses run out of these havens. They channel very large amounts of finance up to the City of London: in the second quarter of 2009 the UK received net financing of $332.5bn (\u00a3215bn) just from its three crown dependencies. Jersey Finance promotional literature makes the point plainly. &quot;Jersey,&quot; it says, &quot;represents an extension of the City of London.&quot; The 14 overseas territories, the next ring in the spider&apos;s web, are the last surviving outposts of Britain&apos;s formal empire. With just a quarter of a million inhabitants between them they include some of the world&apos;s top secrecy jurisdictions: the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos islands and Gibraltar. Just like the crown dependencies, the overseas territories have close but ambiguous political relationships with Britain. In the Caymans the most powerful person is the governor, appointed by the Queen. The governor handles defence, internal security and foreign relations; he appoints the police commissioner, the complaints commissioner, the auditor general, the attorney general, the judiciary and other top officials. The final appeal court is the privy council in London. It is the world&apos;s fifth largest financial centre, hosting 80,000 registered companies, more than three-quarters of the world&apos;s hedge funds, and $1.9tn (\u00a31.2tn) on deposit \u2013 four times as much as in New York City banks. The third, outer ring of the British spider&apos;s web includes Hong Kong, Singapore, the Bahamas, Dubai and Ireland, which are fully independent though deeply connected to the City of London. In the Caribbean, the modern offshore system traces its origins back to the time when organised crime took an interest in the US tax code. When Al Capone was convicted of tax evasion in 1931, his associate Meyer Lansky became fascinated with developing schemes to get mob money out of the US in order to bring it back, drycleaned. A slick mafia operator, Lansky would beat every criminal charge against him until the day he died in 1983. Lansky began with Swiss banking in 1932, where he perfected the loan-back technique. First he moved money out of the US in suitcases, diamonds, airline tickets, cashiers&apos; cheques, untraceable bearer shares or whatever. He would put the money in secret Swiss accounts, perhaps via a Liechtenstein Anstalt (an anonymous company with a single secret shareholder) for extra secrecy. The Swiss bank would then loan the money back to a mobster in the United States and the money would return home, clean. By 1937 Lansky had started casino operations in Cuba, outside the reach of the US tax authorities, and he and his friends built up gambling, racetrack and drugs businesses there. It was, effectively, an offshore money-laundering centre for the mob. Lansky then moved to Miami and plotted to find his next Cuba, small enough and corrupt enough to be able to buy the political leadership, and close enough to the United States for the gamblers to come and go at will. The Bahamas, the old staging post for British gun-running to the southern US slave states of the Confederacy, was perfect. Lansky set about making this British colony, now dominated by an oligarchy of corrupt white merchants known as the Bay Street Boys, the top secrecy jurisdiction for north and south American dirty money. A quaint memo from a Mr WG Hulland of the Colonial Office to a Bank of England official in 1961, just as Lansky began major operations there, illustrates the uneasy nature of this encounter between the British upper classes and American organised crime: &quot;We feel that this [lack of provision of an effective regulatory system] might be a grave omission, since it is notorious that this particular territory, in common with Bermuda, attracts all sorts of financial wizards, some of whose activities we can well believe should be controlled in the public interest.&quot; London did nothing, and Lansky built his empire. Yet many locals were unhappy. In 1965 Lynden Pindling, a populist Bahamas politician, threw the ceremonial speaker&apos;s mace out of a parliament window in a dramatic power-to-the-people gesture. He was elected prime minister in 1967 on a platform that included hostility to gambling, corruption and the Bay Street Boys&apos; mob connections. Yet as it happened there was a reassuringly British place just next door, where the locals were far more friendly: the Cayman Islands. Milton Grundy, an influential Caribbean offshore lawyer and author of several books on offshore finance, remembers first arriving in the Caymans. Cows wandered through the town centre, there was one bank, one paved road and no telephone system. In 1967 the Caymans published its first trust law, which Grundy drafted, and which a British Inland Revenue official subsequently said &quot;blatantly seeks to frustrate our own law for dealing with our own taxpayers&quot;. Within just a few months Grand Cayman was connected to the international phone network and the airport was expanded to take jet aircraft. Some have argued that Britain set up the offshore networks simply out of a short-sighted desire to find a way for its overseas territories to pay their way in the world. After the second world war, an exhausted Britain found that its empire, once a source of great profits, was becoming more expensive and difficult to run, as locals began to agitate for independence. But the evidence points to a different, more troubling explanation for Britain&apos;s decision to turn its semi-colonies into secrecy jurisdictions. The archives tell a consistent story about how the tax havens grew: private sector operators working in a zone of extreme freedom began to call the shots, with little opposition from Britain and its inexperienced emissaries. In the archives, two schools of opinion emerge within the British civil service. On one side sits the Treasury, and especially its tax collectors in the Inland Revenue, who virulently opposed tax havenry and found the Cayman Islands especially obnoxious. The US authorities were clearly highly vexed too, and the British Foreign Office broadly opposed havenry, though its position was more nuanced. On the other side sits the Bank of England, the most vociferous cheerleader for the new arrangements, and its far less influential supporter, the British overseas development ministry, which seems unperturbed by the possibility that local tax haven activities might foster massive capital flight from developing countries elsewhere. Battle lines were drawn; the exchanges become vigorous and even acrimonious. The Inland Revenue was especially alarmed, while their mandarin bosses in the Treasury showed some, but rather less, concern. They put together a working party, whose report in 1971 said Britain should, in effect, stop encouraging tax havenry in its overseas territories, which in the case of the Caymans had become, as one internal memo in London put it, &quot;quite uncivilised&quot;. A letter marked secret from the Bank of England dated 11 April 1969 gives a better sense of the forces driving the changes in the Caribbean. &quot;We need to be quite sure that the possible proliferation of trust companies, banks, etc, which in most cases would be no more than brass plates manipulating assets outside the islands, does not get out of hand. There is of course no objection to their providing bolt holes for non-residents but we need to be sure that in so doing opportunities are not created for the transfer of UK capital to the non-sterling area outside UK rules.&quot; The Bank of England&apos;s main concern at this time was that the new Caribbean centres were weak points: sources of financial leakage outside the sterling area. So in 1972 Britain shrank the area to Britain, Ireland and the crown dependencies, excluding the new havens. The year the sterling area shrank, the British officials working against tax havens disappeared from the archive files. Their replacements seemed unaware of the 1971 report and only discovered it in 1977, sitting on the shelf, unimplemented. Again they expressed concerns \u2013 and again nothing was done. History repeated itself within and between the departments, all in less than 10 years. And, each time, the Bank of England fought the tax haven corner. &quot;This is no tropical paradise,&quot; said Kenneth Crook, the newly arrived British governor of the Cayman Islands in 1972. &quot;I could enlarge, in terms of a magnificent but mosquito-ridden beach; of a fairly new but rather ill-designed and sadly neglected house; of a pleasant but very untidy little town; of swamp clearance schemes which generate smells strong enough to kill a horse; of an office which will one day ere long collapse in a shower of termite-ridden dust.&quot; But on politics, and the strange relationship between Britain and its little quasi-colony, his tone hardens. &quot;Caymanians don&apos;t want independence,&quot; Crook wrote. &quot;They don&apos;t want internal self-government either \u2013 they are very unwilling to trust each other with effective power \u2026 they quite well understand that the British connection gives them a status which they would otherwise not command.&quot; Nothing of substance seems to have changed, as a senior Caymanian politician, who asked not to be named, explained to me in 2009. &quot;The UK wants to have a significant degree of control,&quot; he said, &quot;but at the same time it does not want to be seen to have that control. Like any boss, it wants influence without responsibility; they can turn around when things go wrong and say &apos;it&apos;s all your fault&apos; \u2013 but in the meantime they are pulling all the strings.&quot; This attitude of the locals towards Britain reassures investors, but the political bedrock underpinning the world&apos;s fifth biggest financial centre is Britain&apos;s role. If Caymanians gained full control, most of the money would flee. While these changes were happening in the Caribbean, something similar was under way far closer to the City of London, in the crown dependencies. A constituent&apos;s letter forwarded and endorsed by Tony Benn, then an MP, to the then chancellor, Denis Healey, about a tax conference in Jersey, gives a flavour: &quot;I am somewhat surprised to see a Mr Gent from the Bank of England giving advice on how to avoid paying tax. I wonder if this is really part of the Bank of England&apos;s duties? Mr Gent suggests that the Bank of England will not be prepared to pass on information required by the Inland Revenue! Does the UK Treasury have no control over the Bank of England? Surely Bank employees should not be working against government policy? And just what sort of arrangements and deals are made at these events &apos;behind the scenes&apos;? &quot;It really is just a bit too sordid to be true.&quot; As in the Caribbean, offshore banking blossomed here from the 1960s, when merchant banks such as Hambros and Hill Samuel opened for deposits. Foreign travel was getting easier and more British expatriates opened accounts in Jersey, where the banks were reliable and comfortingly British, but where bank interest was untaxed and secret. Many did not declare their income to their countries of residence, often poverty-racked African nations, knowing they would not be caught. Martyn Scriven, secretary to the Jersey Bankers&apos; Association, described how Jersey&apos;s network grew. &quot;The biggest business developer is client recommendation,&quot; he said. &quot;The client will say, &apos;I&apos;m happy, and I&apos;d like to introduce you to my friend&apos; \u2013 and you build it up like that. You get some seriously interesting people \u2026 someone who goes abroad as a rigger 20 years ago for Shell may now be in charge of the company&apos;s west Africa operations \u2026 We gather deposits from wealthy folk all around the world, and the bulk of those deposits are sent to London. Great dollops of money go into London from here.&quot; As in the Caymans, Jersey has carefully protected the ambiguous relationship with Britain. Jersey&apos;s most senior public sector officials are appointed in London; its laws are all approved by the privy council in London, and Britain handles Jersey&apos;s foreign relations and defence, and the lieutenant governor represents the Queen. As in the Caymans, Britain goes to great lengths to hide its control. And, as with the Cayman Islands, the relationship with the mother country reassures the wealthy and the financial services industry that Britain will step in if needs be, to protect the tax haven from external attacks. Their money is safe in Jersey.

Many, although not all, bankers and their friends say that high bonuses are essential in keeping talents in an industry that is crucial for Britain. But is that true? The first problem with the pro-banker argument is that it regards bonuses as an &quot;entitlement&quot;, rather than an additional pay for good performance, so much so that bankers had to be paid bonuses even when the banks they work for went bankrupt. But bankers at least deserve bonuses for 2010, their friends would say, when bank performance was good. However, banks have posted the results they have in the last couple of years only thanks to the public bailout and the huge indirect subsidies given to them through exceptionally lax monetary policy. In other words, the &quot;good&quot; performance that the bonuses are rewarding has been possible only because the public has paid for it. Given this, the public have the right to intervene in the setting of banking bonuses. Especially when it comes to RBS and other banks whose controlling shares it owns, the public has an absolute right to dictate their employees&apos; pay. Why are people happy to accept that Kraft, as the controlling shareholder of Cadbury, has the right to do what it wants with the company \u2013 destroying jobs and thus local communities while taking tax revenues abroad \u2013 but baulk at the idea that the controlling shareholders of RBS may ask for a very reasonable pay restraint for their employees? Few of us even notice this double standard, because we have been brainwashed by the banking lobby into believing that bankers are the &quot;masters of the universe&quot; to whom even the basic rules of capitalism \u2013 such as shareholder sovereignty \u2013 should not apply. Morally right or wrong, some say, restraints and extra taxes on banker bonuses are bad for the British economy, because they will lead to an exodus of talented bankers, which will damage the international competitiveness of British banking industry. But the truth of the matter is that few bankers have actually relocated in the last couple of years of lower bonuses, higher tax, and political &quot;banker bashing&quot;. Why? It is because London is a particularly attractive city to work in and live a high life as a banker. Few bankers will move to Geneva, not to speak of Tokyo or Dubai, unless there are very big financial disadvantages to being in London \u2013 and we are still far from such a situation. London is one of Britain&apos;s major competitive assets, and the country should be willing to exploit it. Of course, if pay restraints and higher taxes continue, some bankers will move abroad and weaken the British banking industry. But that may not necessarily be a bad thing. I would not go as far as Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve board and the current chairman of the economic recovery advisory board, in declaring that the only socially useful financial innovation in the last few decades has been the ATM. But it is true that during this period the banks in London have been engaged in activities that are socially unproductive or even harmful, as revealed by the 2008 financial crisis. Losing some of these activities may not be a bad thing.", "title": "The benefits of curbing bankers' bonuses | Ha-Joon Chang", "sentences": ["Few bankers will move to Geneva, not to speak of Tokyo or Dubai, unless there are very big financial disadvantages to being in London \u2013 and we are still far from such a situation."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-10T16:40:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jan/10/pakistan-spot-fixing-icc-verdicts", "tags": ["Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal", "Pakistan cricket team", "Cricket", "Zulqarnain Haider", "Sport"], "article": "The three Pakistan players who face life bans over last summer&apos;s spot\u2011fixing scandal are liable to\u00a0discover their fates today, when an independent tribunal delivers a verdict with far\u2011reaching implications for the sport and the reputation of the International Cricket Council. Amid domestic euphoria over England&apos;s Ashes victory and increased focus on the 50-over World Cup, the ongoing tribunal in the unlikely surroundings of Doha&apos;s financial district has served as a jarring reminder of the impact of the allegations uncovered by the News of the World last August. Lawyers representing Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asif and the former Test captain Salman Butt, concluded the defence on Sunday and yesterday both\u00a0sides delivered their closing statements. Like the rest of the hearing, those were delivered behind closed doors in Qatar Financial Centre Tower No2. The three-man commission, chaired by the British QC Michael Beloff, will first deliver its verdict and then \u2013 if appropriate \u2013 retire to consider sanctions, which range from six months to life depending on which of the multiple charges of &quot;alleged irregular behaviour&quot; they have breached. The outcome will have obvious ramifications for the three, but the decision will also have an impact on the battered reputation of the Pakistan Cricket Board, the ICC&apos;s standing as the game&apos;s global regulator and the public perception of a sport that has been forced to face up to the scale of the problems caused by the huge illegal betting markets in Asia. The ICC has called it the biggest corruption crisis faced in decades, certainly since South Africa&apos;s late captain Hansie Cronje admitted match-fixing over a decade ago. The ICC chief executive, Haroon Lorgat, who came under extreme pressure in the wake of the allegations, said last month that it had &quot;worked hard at collecting all the evidence that we would require to make the charges stand&quot;. The decision reached by Beloff and his fellow tribunal members, Justice Albie Sachs and Sharad Rao will hinge on whether the three players can prove that they did not conspire to bowl three no-balls to order during the Lord&apos;s Test. The trio continue to plead their innocence. The Dubai-based ICC charged them with corruption in September, after the newspaper alleged the players received payments from the businessman Mazhar Majeed, Butt&apos;s agent, in return for bowling no-balls at pre-arranged times in order to prove his control over the players. Majeed, who was also arrested and questioned, appeared to accept \u00a3150,000 from reporters posing as frontmen for a Far East gambling cartel and allegedly stated when the three no-balls would be bowled. Majeed, also under investigation for alleged money laundering by Her Majesty&apos;s Revenue and Customs, did not appear before the tribunal. The News of the World&apos;s Mazher Mahmood appeared as a witness in Doha. The prosecution case, led by Jonathan Taylor of the London solicitor Bird and Bird, is believed to centre largely on the newspaper&apos;s evidence, but has been augmented by phone records and interviews conducted by the ICC&apos;s anti-corruption and security unit, led by Sir Ronnie Flanagan, and the police. One key piece of testimony is likely to be the evidence of Major Javed Khawaja Najam, the team&apos;s former security adviser. His words, leaked to the Pakistani media, reveal how he had asked police who searched Butt&apos;s room to put on record the details of the \u00a342,000 they found in it. He said that Butt claimed the money was for his sister&apos;s wedding. Butt has claimed that some of the cash was appearance-money from a sponsorship deal with a Tooting ice cream parlour. According to a BBC report from Doha, important distinctions have begun to emerge in the defence strategies of the players. The 28-year-old Asif \u2013 who is being represented by David Cameron&apos;s brother Alexander \u2013 claimed that he had unintentionally recorded one of the no-balls after being told by Butt, 26, to bowl a faster delivery. But Butt, who has changed lawyers twice since being charged and also failed in a bid to have the hearing postponed, told the tribunal in his opening statements that he had no idea how Majeed had predicted when the no-balls would be bowled. The 19-year-old Amir&apos;s lawyer has hinted that he will use his client&apos;s age and previous good character as mitigating factors. While the ICC will push for the strongest penalties for those found guilty, all three may receive bans of differing lengths. If guilty of more than one offence, the sanctions would run concurrently. While mindful of the need not to prejudice an ongoing police investigation, the ICC has been keen to learn the lessons of previous sports-corruption cases and consider the case while there was still a trail of evidence to follow. Meanwhile, the issues raised by the case are unlikely to go away, whatever verdict Beloff and his panel come to. The former Pakistani wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider, meanwhile, who fled to London claiming his life was in danger after refusing to co-operate with match-fixers, is hoping to hear this week whether his asylum application has been granted.", "title": "Pakistan spot-fixing trial likely to conclude in Doha today", "sentences": ["The Dubai-based ICC charged them with corruption in September, after the newspaper alleged the players received payments from the businessman Mazhar Majeed, Butt&apos;s agent, in return for bowling no-balls at pre-arranged times in order to prove his control over the players."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-11T00:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/mind-your-language/2011/jan/11/tefl", "tags": ["Tefl", "Written language", "Language"], "article": "I&apos;ve been doing my seasonal look back at the who, where and what of last year&apos;s news, and seeing how things have changed. Working with two lists of &quot;keywords&quot; (words that are statistically prominent when you compare a small corpus with a larger one), I&apos;ve been able to compare 2010 and 2009 against the rest of the Guardian Weekly archive. First of all the people. As in 2009, Barack Obama is at the top of the 2010 list. He is closely followed by the new big three in the UK&apos;s coalition government Cameron, Clegg and Osborne, and the Labour politicians Miliband (Ed or David). Next comes a very disparate group: (Farouk) Abdulmutallab (the &quot;underpants&quot; bomber), Julia Gillard (Australian prime minister) Julian Assange (WikiLeaks), Hamid Karzai, Victor Yanukovych (president of Ukraine) and Andy Coulson (David Cameron&apos;s press chief). Off the list in 2010 are Madoff, Ahmadinejad, Mousavi, Brown, Zuma and Gaddafi. Places making frequent appearances in the news in 2010 were China (economic development and human rights), Greece (euro crisis), and Haiti (earthquake). Down were Swat Valley, Dubai, Copenhagen, Sri Lanka and Gaza \u2013 all 2009&apos;s list-toppers. Finally, the what of this year&apos;s news. On the economic front, the focus was on: austerity, cuts, recession, bailout and spending. Reporting on climate change remained important, but US news predominated with the Deepwater oil spill, healthcare reform and the rise of the Tea Party. Information technology still made news, with Facebook, Twitter, WikiLeaks, Google, and iPhone all in the 2010 top 50. On a more sober note, the forced removal of Roma people from France was widely reported. Organisations most in the news in 2010 were BP and the Lib Dems (the UK&apos;s Liberal-Democrats). Getting fewer mentions in 2010 were: bonuses, bankers, swine flu, MPs&apos; expenses, Taliban, Hamas and LTTE (Tamil Tigers). Was there anything to lighten a year of continued recession, wars and climate concern? Yes.

Police fired teargas at hundreds of stone-throwing protesters at a main intersection, dispersing them into adjoining streets. Two army vehicles were posted at the intersection, close to the French embassy. The fighting broke out even as the president, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, sacked his interior minister and ordered the release of protesters arrested in weeks of clashes that have shattered the country&apos;s carefully constructed facade of stability. The first sign of a climbdown from Ben Ali followed criticism from the US over what it said was the use of excessive force to quell the most serious unrest in his 23-year reign. Only days ago, Ben Ali accused the demonstrators of committing acts of terrorism. &quot;The president has decided to appoint Ahmed Friaa as interior minister,&quot; Mohamed Ghannouchi, the prime minister, told journalists at a news conference. &quot;He has announced the creation of a committee of investigation into corruption and to assess the mistakes of certain officials. The president has decided to free all those arrested in the riots.&quot; As unrest reached Tunis, Reuters reported that a 23-year-old man was shot dead in clashes in the Tunisian town of Thala. The victim, Wajdi Sayhi, was reportedly deaf and unable to hear police instructions to disperse. He was shot in the stomach, said witnesses. Tunisia has come under rising international pressure over its handling of the protests. &quot;We are worried, in general, about the unrest and the instability, and what seems to be the underlying concerns of the people who are protesting,&quot; the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, said in an interview in Dubai with al-Arabiya television. &quot;It seems to be a combination of economic and political demonstrations, and the government&apos;s reaction, which has been unfortunately leading to the deaths of some of the protesters. So we are not taking sides in it, we just hope there can be a peaceful resolution of it,&quot; Clinton said. Clinton&apos;s attempt at impartiality, however, could not mask international concern over the way the Tunisian government has responded to the unrest. &quot;The US and the EU last week spoke out and we have been waiting for the French and I suspect they are intervening behind the scene,&quot; said Dr Claire Spencer, head of the Middle East and North Africa programme at the thinktank Chatham House. &quot;They are Tunisia&apos;s largest economic partner. The real question is whether the system built up by Ben Ali can open itself up and respond to demands from students and unions fast enough, Some good can come from the situation if Tunisia&apos;s partners can actively encourage the government to take their demands on board.&quot; Spencer said the existence of a large educated and skilled population and coherent demands from the unions showed that the opportunity for dialogue was there, should the government take it. The protests are being watched closely in other countries in the Arab world with potential for social unrest. Tunisia has been shaken by a wave of violence that officials say has killed 23 civilians, the worst public unrest since Ben Ali became president. Human rights group put the death toll at 50, at least.

The turf track opens for the first time this year tomorrow and is expected to be on the firm side of good, while the Tapeta all-weather surface has been riding fast in recent weeks. Only a handful of horses have made all, but even fewer have come from way off the pace, so it pays to support horses with the ability to sit up with the speed. When it comes to picking stables to support it is difficult to ignore what have become prevailing trends. Godolphin easily topped the leader board at last year&apos;s carnival with 24 winners which put them comfortably ahead of closest pursuer De Kock who registered 13. However, this was before the official announcement of Mahmood Al Zarooni as the operation&apos;s second trainer and with his input it looks likely that Saeed bin Suroor can expect a reduced tally, with Al Zarooni likely to be responsible for as many, if not more, winners. It will be intriguing to see how the two yards operate as individuals and the impact it will have on Godolphin&apos;s overall performance. South African De Kock was the quickest international trainer to recognise the benefits of the carnival when it started in 2004 and he has been rewarded handsomely with almost 100 winners in Dubai to date. This year he has a team of 34 horses, including last year&apos;s UAE Derby winner Musir whose aim is the World Cup, a race De Kock is yet to win despite twice sending out the runner-up. De Kock has adapted his methods at the carnival and, recognising the need to have his runners fit first time out, gave four of his charges prep races during the domestic season. The fact that one, Mahuba, managed to win, suggests much better is to come for the trainer who will once again rely on the services of Christophe Soumillon and Kevin Shea, with Pat Cosgrave also expected to come in for some rides. De Kock has plenty in his yard worth following, but Bold Silvano is one of particular interest. Last year&apos;s Durban July winner will also be aimed at the World Cup and has seemingly adapted well to the Tapeta. It will be interesting to see whether he or the more fragile Musir turn out to be the stable&apos;s first string for the race come the big day. On the jockey front, apprentice Harry Bentley has been the talk of the season so far, collecting 11 winners, putting him ahead of such established riders as Willie Supple and Kieren Fallon. Formerly based with Gary Moore, Bentley&apos;s three kilo claim has been extremely valuable and trainers are likely to continue to take advantage of this in the carnival&apos;s competitive handicaps. Bentley will also be used by trainer Herman Brown, who has a classy string of horses for the Pattern races in particular. His South African filly Noble Heir, reportedly one of the quickest horses ever clocked around Meydan, will have plenty of opportunities in the sprint division and may represent some value when she gets her chance, while Group Two winner Bankable, who does much of his training on a treadmill, runs over an inadequate six furlongs this week and is one to watch over further later in the campaign. Locally based trainers to follow include Dhruba Selvaratnam, whose two wins at last year&apos;s carnival both came courtesy of the ex Michael Jarvis inmate Kal Barg, who won at 16-1 and 10-1 respectively. He is back for more as is the useful Swinging Sixties, a shade unlucky when second on two starts so far this season. Backed by the considerable force of Sheikh Ahmed al Maktoum, Selvaratnam&apos;s horses are very much aimed at the carnival and it would be a surprise were he not to register a winner. The UAE&apos;s current champion trainer is Ali Rashid Al Raihe and he and Royston Ffrench have struck up a formidable partnership in recent seasons. Along with last season&apos;s 40-1 Dubai Duty Free winner Al Shemali, they also have the useful Derbaas, a dual winner already this term at Meydan, who can be competitive again in the handicapping division and may be overlooked by punters who prefer to concentrate on the international raiders. Al Raihe&apos;s near neighbour Musabah Al Muhairi also has his string in good form and Mutheeb and the lightly raced Ibn Battuta are two to watch out for from his yard.

Paul Jones&apos; daily Cheltenham Festival countdown stat There has been plenty of talk surrounding the Gold Cup chances of Diamond Harry and Pride Of Dulcotedespite their very limited chasing inexperience and it would appear likely that the former will be having just his fifth start over fences come the Festival whilst it looks almost certain that Pride Of Dulcote will be having only his fourth chase outing if he makes the line up.  It says much for the size of their task however when we consider that only a true great in Dawn Run, who was having only her fifth start over fences when winning an historic renewal in 1986, has won the Blue Riband for horses with less than six chase starts since Mill House in 1963 who had five previous chase starts to his name. The pair to have come closest were the novice, Captain Christy, and the three-time winner, Best Mate, who both won the Gold Cup off the back of just six chase starts. Paul Jones is author of the The Cheltenham Festival Betting Guide published by Weatherbys Today&apos;s best bets, by Will Hayler Tim Vaughan endured a tough time for three months in the build-up to Christmas, sending out just seven winners at an uncharacteristically low strike-rate, but the trainer said earlier this week that he is satisfied that his stable is now free of any sickness and three winners in the last 10 days reinforces such an opinion. Nemo Spirit (2.10) produced a satisfactory effort on his first start for the stable and on his hurdles debut at Ffos Las last month, staying on steadily in the final stages, and the move up in trip to two miles and six and a half furlongs at Hereford looks a big positive for his chances today. A decent stayer on the Flat on his day with a good attitude, Nemo Spirit&apos;s proven stamina would have been insufficiently exploited there, but will come into play this afternoon and he may be sharp enough to overcome favourite Minella Stars, who is exciting but thought more likely to find his metier when going chasing. Stamina could also prove the key at Catterick this afternoon and with his stable in form, Rambling Minster (2.20) looks a fair bet at 7-1 to take the North Yorkshire National. Unlike some of these rivals, three miles and six furlongs will be no problem at all to the selection, and although he is 5lb higher in the weights than when second on his last start over fences (rather harsh on a horse who recently entered his teens) this is a lesser-grade event than which he often contests. Back at Hereford, despite a poor run on heavy ground last season, Simply Wings (2.40) has since twice performed well enough on soft going to suggest strongly that conditions won&apos;t be an excuse. Positive tactics seemed not to suit in a more competitive event than this at Newbury two runs ago and he got going too late when third at Towcester last month. Today should be the day where it all falls into place for Richard Lee&apos;s runner.

Chris Hughton&apos;s successor has only had to wait five weeks for his first Tyne-Wear derby, but would have preferred not to be approaching it on the back of an ignominious FA Cup exit at Stevenage. A little more than a month into the job, Pardew continues to receive a cautious welcome from fans puzzled not only by Hughton&apos;s dismissal, but the erratic form of a Newcastle side eighth in the Premier League. Very much a realist, he knows the mood could swiftly turn ugly if Sunderland exact emphatic revenge for a 5-1 Halloween thrashing on Tyneside. Small wonder Pardew prefers to envisage a victory that would help him step out of Hughton&apos;s shadow. &quot;Whatever I do between now and May, that 5-1 win is almost certainly going to be this season&apos;s stand-out result,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m not going to be able to change that, so I have to accept it. But that doesn&apos;t mean to say we can&apos;t go to Sunderland and win. That would be some coup for myself.&quot; On 31 October Pardew watched the game on television at his home in Surrey, little knowing what fate had in store. &quot;I wasn&apos;t really concentrating, to be honest,&quot; he said. &quot;But I saw it again yesterday and noted how crucial Andy Carroll was to a first-class, disciplined display.&quot; Unfortunately for Newcastle, the England striker has returned from a week&apos;s break in Dubai still nursing a thigh injury, which rules him out of Sunday&apos;s re-match. &quot;Andy won&apos;t play,&quot; said Pardew, who is also without the suspended Cheik Tiot\u00e9. &quot;It&apos;s a huge disappointment. Not only are we missing Andy but a very influential midfielder. Cheik has been one of the stars of the season.&quot; Their absence will not prevent him adopting a broadly attacking strategy. &quot;Whenever you go into a derby there&apos;s always an enormous electricity,&quot; he said. &quot;You have a special Cup final-type experience. But if you have a gameplan \u2013 all 11 players have to know their roles and your discipline has to be in good order \u2013 you can get on the front foot. &quot;If you go on the back foot at any stage you&apos;re in trouble. You&apos;ll get dominated, especially if you&apos;re the away team. So it will be a case of stepping on to Sunderland and meeting the challenge head on.&quot; Pardew&apos;s boardroom tactics appear slightly less aggressive. While he evidently hopes Mike Ashley, Newcastle&apos;s owner, will loosen the purse strings and expand a worryingly thin squad, so far at least, his approach seems softly, softly. Ashley&apos;s helicopter landed at the club&apos;s training ground this week, but a subsequent &quot;transfer summit&quot; failed to produce immediate imports. Indeed, a month that began with talk of David Beckham potentially taking up temporary residence on the right of Newcastle&apos;s midfield may, in reality, be more about protecting existing assets, with the St James&apos; Park powerbrokers agreeing to continue rebuffing inquiries for individuals such as Carroll, Joey Barton and Jos\u00e9 Enrique, while extending certain contracts. &quot;I had a meeting with the owner and Derek [Llambias, Newcastle&apos;s managing director], and the main thing that emerged from it was a desire to keep our core players,&quot; Pardew said. &quot;It is nice to be able to bring someone in, but it&apos;s proving difficult. January is a window when everyone is looking at deals but wondering if it&apos;s really right to go overboard and upset the balance of your squad. &quot;The most important players are the ones that are doing well for us right now. That&apos;s been my focus. We&apos;ve obviously secured Steven Taylor long-term, Joey&apos;s got 18 months to go on his contract, and we want to look at both him and Jos\u00e9.&quot; Not that Pardew \u2013 disappointed to miss out on David Bentley to Birmingham \u2013 has entirely abandoned hope of introducing a new face in the next fortnight. After highlighting a dearth of left-sided cover for Enrique, he indicated a craving for an extra striker, saying: &quot;Jay Bothroyd [of Cardiff] is a player I admire.&quot; Whether Ashley takes the hint remains anyone&apos;s guess, but, for the moment, few in the north-east can see beyond Sunday. &quot;Sunderland start as favourites,&quot; Pardew said. &quot;Pulling off a win would be a massive achievement for us.&quot;", "title": "Alan Pardew seeks derby coup to keep Newcastle fans onside", "sentences": ["&quot;But I saw it again yesterday and noted how crucial Andy Carroll was to a first-class, disciplined display.&quot; Unfortunately for Newcastle, the England striker has returned from a week&apos;s break in Dubai still nursing a thigh injury, which rules him out of Sunday&apos;s re-match."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-14T22:00:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/jan/15/working-life-ships-captain", "tags": ["Work & careers", "Money", "Piracy at sea", "World news", "Guardian Careers", "All sectors"], "article": "On the bridge of the Maersk Kithira, tucked to one side of a bank of navigational screens, Roy Whelan keeps a map of the Arabian Sea. At first glance it looks pretty innocuous, a schematic of shipping channels in the busy waters bound by the coastlines of east Africa, Oman, Pakistan and India. It&apos;s only when I look closer and see the words &quot;Anti-Piracy Planning Chart&quot; stamped in one corner that its true purpose becomes clear. &quot;In the whole of this area we&apos;re liable to be attacked,&quot; Whelan says matter-of-factly, running his finger along the Gulf of Aden, a wide channel leading into the Suez Canal. &quot;It&apos;s a heavily protected area, but it&apos;s also a magnet for pirates because they know all the ships will be there. All they have to do is get there before the navy.&quot; Whelan is now into his 40th year at sea and his 16th as a captain with Maersk. A trim 55-year-old with a clipped moustache, round-rimmed glasses and a cheerful demeanour, he is nothing like the gruff, barnacle-weathered mariner I had vaguely imagined he would be. &quot;Perhaps I ought to grow a beard,&quot; he says, half apologetically. Hopefully the anti-piracy chart will not be called into action today in the port of Felixstowe, where the Kithira, an 80,000-tonne vessel carrying 2,500 containers, is on a 27-hour stop. From the vast, sky blue-painted hull to the 12 hulking pistons deep in the engine room, the scale of everything is mind-boggling. Outside, three massive gantry cranes whirr back and forth at bewildering speed, clunking 40ft sea containers in and out of the ship&apos;s colossal hold like wooden puzzle blocks. All this talk of piracy seems a little fanciful on the wintry Suffolk coast. Yet as one of two captains assigned to the Kithira, Whelan can rarely afford to discount the threat it poses. For six months of the year his job is to deliver the ship&apos;s cargo as safely and economically as possible on its scheduled round trip, beginning at Jebel Ali in Dubai then stopping off in India and Oman before passing up the Suez Canal to Algeciras in Spain and on to the major North Sea ports, after which it retraces its path back to Dubai via Jordan. It is a schedule which means he and his crew spend three weeks out of every seven in pirate-infested waters. During this time the ship goes on full security alert, which essentially means that the crew black out the windows and lock themselves in. &quot;American ships will have armed guards on board,&quot; Whelan says, noting pointedly that Britain affords no such protection to its cargo vessels. Is this a state of affairs he would like to see rectified? &quot;I\u00a0would,&quot; he says, flatly. &quot;The frequency of attacks is increasing.&quot; In the Gulf of Aden, by far the biggest threat comes from Somalian pirates, who are at present holding captive somewhere between 500 and 700 seafarers, according to various estimates. &quot;They like to keep around 13 cargo ships at a time, then when someone pays a ransom they go and grab another one,&quot; Whelan explains. Despite the presence of a combined multinational task force in the region, he perceives a lack of urgency in tackling the problem. &quot;If you had a situation anywhere else in the world where there were over 500 hostages there&apos;d be an enormous effort to rescue them,&quot; he says. Light reporting of the boarding and subsequent rescue of a British-flagged vessel only last week seems to underline his point. Mercifully, Whelan has not yet had to confront kidnappers directly. He attributes this to the high speeds the Kithira&apos;s 12-cylinder engines can achieve. &quot;I&apos;ve heard plenty of pirates around us, but we&apos;ve not been directly attacked,&quot; he says. &quot;Sometimes they come up in maybe three boats. You see the skiffs \u2013 they can do about 25 knots and they come in and have a look at you, then probably go away again. Or sometimes they hide.&quot; How does it feel to have to deal with this kind of unwelcome attention? &quot;Uncomfortable is the best word, I think,&quot; he says eventually. For now, the atmosphere feels perfectly calm as we tour the ship&apos;s corridors, occasionally passing crew members bustling about their duties. Whelan&apos;s private cabins are well appointed, with sofas, a writing table and a television. On display are several Christmas cards, including a homemade one from his two children,Ryan, aged eight, and Alexandra, three. For Whelan, the Christmas holidays were spent at sea, which must make the job tough at times. &quot;It&apos;s hard, obviously, especially for the kids,&quot; he admits. Generally, he manages to get back to his family in Uckfield, East Sussex, for Christmas every other year, in agreement with the Kithira&apos;s other captain. Each of them commands the ship for six months a year, usually broken into 10-week stretches, but how they divide the time is up to them. While at sea he works every day, sometimes for up to 24 hours at a stretch if circumstances dictate, for example if weather conditions are poor or there is a particularly hectic turnaround schedule in port. &quot;There are working time regulations but the reality is that there are times when I can&apos;t just step back,&quot; he says. The upside of this is that he gets to spend the remaining six months of the year at home, an arrangement that affords him great freedom but that also depends entirely on the understanding of his family. Since he married his wife, Vicky, and had children relatively late in life, it seems like a routine he is still getting used to. &quot;It&apos;s extremely hard to readjust after working every day for 10 weeks,&quot; he says. &quot;For the first week after I get home, I normally just want to sleep.&quot; Similarly, Whelan has had to make readjustments to life at sea since joining the merchant navy as a 15-year-old cadet. While he seems expertly attuned to the realities of modern-day seafaring, as we nose around the ship&apos;s cabins I can sense his nostalgia for a culture that is fading with every passing year. In the officers&apos; canteen, a portrait of the Queen hangs above a table covered with clingfilm-wrapped sandwiches. Normally a toast is raised to the monarch at Christmas but Whelan admits, rather guiltily, that this year for the first time the tradition was not observed. Maersk&apos;s global recruitment policy means that, with the exception of Whelan himself and the chief engineer, the ship&apos;s 21 officers and crew now come not from Britain but from India, Ukraine, Burma and the Philippines. &quot;It didn&apos;t make much sense any more, gathering everyone around,&quot; he says, a\u00a0little forlornly. &quot;A lot of them don&apos;t really speak English, anyway.&quot; The common room used by the Filipino ratings certainly looks well frequented, with guitars, a drum kit and even a table tennis table somehow squashed in. But it contrasts starkly with the officers&apos; lounge, once a hub of pre-dinner conversation, now home only to a dusty bar (alcohol is no longer permitted on board) and a wilting yucca plant. &quot;I try to turn it around and pep it up, but the other captain usually keeps the curtains closed for the blackout,&quot; Whelan says. Other conventions that once brightened up life at sea have also gone: the occasional carriage of passengers, for instance, and the extended shore leave enjoyed in the days when it could take up to a week to unload and load a ship&apos;s cargo. So, it&apos;s no longer possible for a sailor to have a girl in every port? &quot;No, no \u2026 It just doesn&apos;t happen any more,&quot; he sighs. Nowadays, the cranes work so efficiently that 23 hours in port feels like a luxury \u2013 or at least a reasonable time in which to process the morass of cargo dockets, messages, advance port papers, immigration forms, maritime declarations of health and other admin on his desk. At Zeebrugge, his next port of call, he will have only seven and a half hours to get in and out. &quot;It used to be a way of life, but these days it&apos;s a career,&quot; Whelan says. &quot;The new sea terminals are built for deep water, miles from anywhere, which makes it hard to get ashore, and security means that some ports make it as difficult as possible to do that, anyway. At other ports there is no shore leave. So you&apos;re virtually a prisoner for your entire length on here.&quot; He pauses. &quot;They say the only difference between us and prisoners in jail is that not many prisoners drown.&quot; Up on deck, we take a stroll along the freshly painted perimeter walkway and Whelan recalls how, until recently, he used to run laps to keep fit while at sea. But there is work to be done ahead of the Kithira&apos;s imminent departure for Zeebrugge, so we head back to the ship&apos;s reception office. On the wall is another map of the pirate-filled Gulf of Aden, only this time someone has drawn a skull and crossbones over the top with black marker pen. At least some maritime traditions never die. Overtime At parties, people always say to Roy: &apos;&quot;Where do you park your boat at night?&apos; They often don&apos;t understand that we are constantly on the move.&quot; Roy has not read a novel since 1976. &quot;Lord of the Rings was the last one. I read a lot of technical volumes and newspapers, just not fiction.&quot; In his younger days, Roy used to race cars at Brands Hatch. &quot;But it was a hobby that cost thousands of pounds. I can&apos;t afford to do that now I&apos;ve got my family.&quot; Roy hasn&apos;t been on holiday for about five years. &quot;The last time was Australia.&quot; Curriculum Vitae Pay Whelan earns in the region of \u00a360,000 for six months&apos; work a year. &quot;And if I spend enough days out of the country, I can reclaim the tax back. Most of us do.&quot; Hours During a typical 10-week stretch at sea, Whelan works every day of the week and is potentially on call 24 hours a day, depending on the circumstances. Work-life balance Great when Whelan is at home, but it&apos;s not so good when he is at sea, with one notable exception: &quot;If the timings are right, my wife and kids can come\u00a0and join me on the ship for a\u00a0couple of weeks.&quot; Best thing &quot;The journey home. And having a wife who can cope with anything while I am away, except the central heating control on low.&quot; Worst thing &quot;Pirates, and when crew members fall seriously ill on board.

Endorsed by both countries&apos; prime ministers, David Cameron and Vladimir Putin, the tie-up gives Rosneft a 5% stake in BP, while the London-based company will increase its stake in the Russian firm from 1.3% to 10.8%. It will give the Kremlin a slice of ownership of BP&apos;s global operations, which stretch from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico, north Africa, Azerbaijan and the North Sea. BP&apos;s chief executive, Bob Dudley, hailed the arrangement, signed on Friday night, as a &quot;historic moment for Rosneft, the BP and for the global energy industry generally&quot;, and described it as a &quot;new template&quot; for the way international oil exploration can take place. Russia&apos;s deputy prime minister, Igor Sechin, who chairs Rosneft, suggested that among BP&apos;s attractions were &quot;knowledge and experience&quot; accrued from last year&apos;s disastrous Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The move, which involves BP issuing 988m new shares to Rosneft worth \u00a34.9bn, has gone down badly in the US, coming just days after a presidential commission published a damning report on the blunders leading up to the Deepwater spill. In Washington, the US state department is facing calls to investigate whether the Russian government&apos;s links with BP posed national security issues. &quot;There are various different levels where this deserves some analysis and some scrutiny,&quot; said Michael Burgess, a Republican congressman who sits on the House energy and commerce committee. &quot;BP is one of the biggest suppliers to our military. Are there national security implications to this deal?&quot; Burgess pointed out that BP runs sensitive trans-Alaskan oil pipelines and that the group&apos;s BP America subsidiary is regulated as a US company. Comparing the deal to the blocked purchase by Dubai Ports World of P&amp;O&apos;s US ports in 2006, he called for an inquiry by the US government&apos;s committee on foreign investment, which is chaired by treasury secretary Timothy Geithner and has a mandate to scrutinise potentially threatening financial incursions into the US. His remarks followed comments by a Democratic congressman, Ed Markey, who suggested BP now stood for &quot;Bolshoi Petroleum&quot; and claimed that the Rosneft tie-up could complicate the collection of compensation for the fishing industry hit by the Deepwater spill. BP&apos;s eastward manoeuvre puts the British company in pole position for exploration of more than 125,000 sq km of potentially oil-rich seabed beneath the South Kara Sea off the coast of western Siberia \u2013 an area the size of the North Sea. The Russians are keen to get their hands on BP&apos;s technical expertise, and co-operation will be extended to ventures off the north-eastern frontier of Siberia and even in oil refineries in Germany. The two partners will establish an Arctic technology centre to develop new techniques for the safe extraction of oil. &quot;This has the blessing of the Russian government for BP to get access to some additional resource,&quot; said Philip Weiss, an energy analyst at Argus Research. &quot;Because of the uncertainty in the Gulf [of Mexico], that&apos;s probably even more important for BP.&quot; Any exploration in the Arctic, however, will face opposition from environmentalists. Charlie Kronick, senior climate adviser to Greenpeace, said: &quot;There&apos;s a view from the oil industry, and from governments too, that we absolutely have to go for every last drop of oil, regardless of how damaging it is to get out.&quot; Pointing to the Russian government&apos;s 75% stake in Rosneft, he added that politics and business are &quot;very, very closely bound&quot; in Russia, which could put BP in a sensitive position in the event of future posturing on energy by the Kremlin, which cut gas supplies to Ukraine two years ago in a dispute over pricing. BP&apos;s links to Russia go back two decades. It already operates a joint venture there \u2013 TNK-BP \u2013 although Dudley has a chequered personal history in the country: he left in 2008 after having his work permit revoked following a bitter dispute with local partners. Dudley played this down at Friday evening&apos;s signing ceremony: &quot;I never regarded my experiences at TNK-BP as anything other than an extended business discussion.&quot; Russia&apos;s prime minister has adopted a sympathetic view over the Deepwater spill. Sources say Putin was angry about BP&apos;s treatment by US politicians and was supportive of Dudley&apos;s predecessor, Tony Hayward, who lost his job over a string of ill-considered remarks, including a comment that he wanted to get his &quot;life back&quot; in the wake of the disaster, which killed 11 people. Putin said this weekend that he did not consider BP solely to blame for the incident: &quot;Our experts have scrutinised the tragedy: we know that BP was the organiser of the project, but there were also eight subcontractors, including major US companies.&quot; Analysts say having the Kremlin on board would make it harder for another company to take over BP, which is selling off assets partly in response to the spill. It emerged this month that Shell discussed launching a takeover bid last summer should a US rival table an offer for BP. Public vitriol could prompt Congress to call hearings over BP&apos;s tie-up with Rosneft. But some have expressed cynicism over the motivation for the outrage. &quot;Sometimes politicians say things that make no sense,&quot; said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co in New York. &quot;Has Russia declared war on us? Not to my knowledge.&quot; The energy secretary, Chris Huhne, took part in handshakes to mark the agreement at BP&apos;s London head office. Huhne said that Russia accounts for nearly a fifth of the world&apos;s gas production and 13% of global oil output, which, he said, was vitally important in the medium term despite the government&apos;s aspiration to a low-carbon future. &quot;BP, as well all know, is coming out of a difficult period in its history,&quot; said Huhne. &quot;This partnership shows BP is very much open for business.&quot;", "title": "American hostility grows over BP's deal with Russian state oil company", "sentences": ["Comparing the deal to the blocked purchase by Dubai Ports World of P&amp;O&apos;s US ports in 2006, he called for an inquiry by the US government&apos;s committee on foreign investment, which is chaired by treasury secretary Timothy Geithner and has a mandate to scrutinise potentially threatening financial incursions into the US."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-16T00:07:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/jan/16/horse-racing-cheltenham-kauto-star", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Horse racing tips", "Kauto Star", "Sport"], "article": "Paul Jones&apos; daily Cheltenham Festival countdown stat If Long Run is to follow up his William Hill King George VI Chase victory in the Totesport Gold Cup, he has a big stat on his side in that 8 of the last 11 winners contested the &apos;King George&apos; with Best Mate, Kicking King and Kauto Star (x2) doubling up in the last 8 years but, against that, he would become the first Gold Cup winner to be aged under the age of seven since the great Mill House 48 years ago. That sounds like an horrific stat to overcome but I&apos;m not so sure as only three six-year-olds have contested the race in the last 40 years. On one hand it could be argued that the low representation of six-year-olds underlines how connections have determined the difficulty of task but The Fellow was only inched out of the 1991 renewal by a short-head and Gloria Victis looked set for a place until suffering a fatal fall in 2000. Both were earlier-maturing French-breds as is Long Run. Paul Jones is author of the The Cheltenham Festival Betting Guide published by Weatherbys. Kauto Star &quot;bled from both nostrils&quot;, reports Paul Nicholls 12.30pm: &quot;Paul Nicholls, who has revealed that Kauto Star bled after his disappointing run in the King George VI Chase at Kempton, said today the problem is not serious and that the horse will still be aimed at the Gold Cup at Cheltenham in March. &quot;I can reveal that when he got back last night and stuck his head in the water bucket, Kauto bled from both nostrils,&quot; Nicholls told his Betfair column. &quot;I have just tweeted that Kauto Star &apos;did have a small bleed after the race and will go straight for the Gold Cup now&apos; \u2013 but I will expand on that. &quot;It is an honour to be associated with the horse. But I can tell you now that reports of his demise are somewhat exaggerated and there is no talk of retirement here. I have just spoken to Clive [Smith, the owner]. We agreed that yesterday now gives us a bit of challenge with the horse and hopefully we, and most importantly, the horse will rise to it. &quot;He will be prepared for a tilt at a third Gold Cup victory in March \u2013 different ground, different track, different day \u2013 and we would like to aim him for a third victory at Down Royal in the autumn, too. As long as he is enjoying his racing and running well, then he will continue \u2013 he is 11, not 13. &quot;I am not making excuses but I can reveal that when he got back last night and stuck his head in the water bucket, he bled from both nostrils. He has never done it before, and will probably never do it again. &quot;It wasn&apos;t a big bleed but it indicates that he probably bled during the race (possibly after his mistake at the second last, which meant he had to dig deep to get home), which would not have aided his cause. &quot;But the horse was fine going into the race. You may have read this morning that he wasn&apos;t buzzing in his box yesterday. But he is like a seasoned human athlete these days. Experience of big races breeds a certain calmness and I think he was A1 going into the race, so there are no excuses on that score.&quot; PA Today&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook Alas, poor Kauto. Down at Ditcheat on Wednesday, Paul Nicholls said: &quot;If he runs moderate on Saturday, I couldn&apos;t be saying to you on Saturday night, well, actually, I knew this because \u2026 There isn&apos;t anything. If he runs moderate on Saturday, it&apos;s for a reason that I don&apos;t know about.&quot; When I heard that, I was convinced that nothing would prevent Kauto Star from winning the King George again. Perhaps he wouldn&apos;t be quite as impressive as when he came home 36 lengths clear in last season&apos;s race, but he was going to win. Alas. Horses slow down as they get older and, as we&apos;ve learned once more, there may be no clues from their home work before that effect shows itself on the racecourse. But the Cheltenham Gold Cup is a different race and I hope he stays in training for one more crack at it. He can win, though even at 12-1 I&apos;m not tempted to bet on it. Nicholls revealed this morning that Kauto Star bled after the King George. &quot;Kauto Star fine today. Have to report that he did have a small bleed after the race. Will go straight for the Gold Cup now,&quot; Nicholls said on Twitter. Long Run has to prove he can show his best form at Cheltenham, having been beaten on both starts there, and there must be a suspicion that Kempton suits him better. But it&apos;s not as though he ran disastrously badly at Cheltenham on either visit. He&apos;s getting better and, in light of his raw ability, odds of 7-1 for the Gold Cup go a long way towards compensating for his lack of a course win. I find that more tempting than 10-1 about Diamond Harry, who, though he won a couple of novice hurdles at Cheltenham, blew out really badly on his only try over fences there, jumping poorly before being pulled up in the RSA Chase. But you can take similar odds about horses running today, which at least saves us two months of fretting before the money is lost. Prince Du Seuil (2.40) is 17-2 for the 2m4f handicap hurdle at Ffos Las, which looks on the big side to me about a horse who is showing the best form of his career this season, in common with a few others from Alan King&apos;s yard. Soft ground matters to this one and, after respectable efforts on drier surfaces, he got it at Folkestone last time, when he hammered a big field. He was still on the bit at the last flight that day and should be competitive after an admittedly hefty 13lb rise. Today&apos;s race is tougher but he has his conditions again and can reward each-way support. The apprentice Ryan Clark has made a promising start to the year, with five winners from 21 rides and he gets the leg-up on Conry (3.35) for the in-form Patrick Morris at Southwell. This chestnut couldn&apos;t cope with Dubai Hills here on Thursday but he at least showed his ability to cope with Fibresand and is the pick of a dubious-looking field.

Sheikh Nasser Mohammed al-Sabah was greeted warmly at the same airport where a belligerent Saddam Hussein had brusquely seen off the last Kuwait official to visit - in August 1990 - just before he launched his ill-fated invasion. Things were clearly very different this time. Nouri al-Maliki and an array of his officials were there to meet the neighbours who most of those waiting in line had not got to know in the eight years since Saddam was ousted. Until the guests arrived, Kuwait had remained one of the frostiest fronts in post-Saddam Iraq \u2013 a standoff that the American-led invasion had not been able to end. It had taken not one, but two invasions, then eight years of sizing each other up to get this far. And, in the eyes of many Kuwaitis, their leaders seem to finally have found a trust that citizens are yet to develop. &quot;We have a lot of unfinished business with them,&quot; said Fatima al-Ibrahimi, a 22-year-old university student as she sipped a Starbucks coffee in downtown Kuwait City. &quot;They have needed to do things to convince us that they want to be a good neighbour. We are yet to see many results.&quot; Throughout much of her lifetime, Kuwait has been a place where time stood still, despite the invasion of Iraq, launched 20 years ago on 16 January, which freed the country from Saddam&apos;s marauders after a six-month occupation. The invasion, known as Desert Storm, had several themes in common with the campaign of 2003, known as Operation Iraqi Freedom. They were both launched by a George Bush; they led to the rapid capitulation of the Iraqi army; and they \u2013 at least notionally \u2013 kept a tyrant clear of Kuwait&apos;s northern border. But, despite Desert Storm, Kuwaitis seem largely to believe that the spectre of Saddam&apos;s return loomed large for the following decade, crippling an ability to capitalise on a new-found freedom. &quot;The invasion in 1991 was a result of a massive shock to the system,&quot; said a Kuwait-based western official. &quot;It wasn&apos;t really liberation. &quot;The real liberation came in 2003.&quot; &quot; Don&apos;t forget that in 1994, 1998 and 2002, Saddam mobilised his army and moved south,&quot; the official added. &quot;There was always a threat there, in Kuwait&apos;s eyes. There was no sense of confidence and no sense of being able to build a future. In the 70s and 80s, this was a go-ahead place.&quot; Even now, eight years after the second invasion, Kuwait seems an apprehensive city state. Throughout the 1990s, the economy seemed to chug along rather than roar ahead like the equally affluent Gulf petro-states to its south - Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Several new skyscrapers soar to the heavens, new shopping malls flank broad highways and there is no shortage of five-star hotels or luxury cars throughout Kuwait City. But a residual lack of confidence remains, despite the verified 108bn barrels of oil beneath the feet of the tiny country that seemingly safeguards its future for more than a century, and a per capita income that is among the highest in the world. &quot;Things are fine here,&quot; said Omar al-Tamimi on the Kuwait waterfront. &quot;Look around, there is building, there is progress and the government looks after its citizens very well. &quot;But things would be a lot better if the Americans had gone all the way to Baghdad [in 1991]. &quot;The fact that they didn&apos;t set us back. We have always lived in Iraq&apos;s shadow, even when things deteriorated there.&quot; A lost decade caused by a reluctance to overthrow Saddam in 1991 is a common refrain in Kuwait as the 20th anniversary of the war that freed it ticks over. The eight years since invading armies went all the way has seen a significant effort to right the wrongs of Iraq&apos;s 1990 occupation, with $30bn in damages being paid from Iraq&apos;s treasury and 5% of oil revenues being used to pay monthly instalments of an outstanding $22bn. A further $15bn that Kuwait had lent Iraq before the invasion is yet to be addressed, along with other issues from Iraq&apos;s brief but brutal reign. These include the return of treasures looted from Kuwait during Iraq&apos;s invasion, the fate of farmers on the border, a disputed maritime boundary along the Shatt al-Arab waterway and the repatriation of the remains of 364 Kuwaitis who were taken to Iraq by the retreating invaders. Late last year, Iraq was given added impetus to square the ledger with Kuwait, when the UN pledged to lift a swathe of long-standing restrictions which restore the international standing it had before the 1990 invasion - the caveat being it had to make things good with Kuwait. &quot;This is why the Iraqis are so keen to help now,&quot; said a senior Kuwaiti official who refused to be named. &quot;They have not shown too many trust building measures so far, but let&apos;s see how they behave now.&quot; Of all the debts to settle, it is perhaps the issue of missing persons which resonates deepest with Kuwaitis. Dr Ibrahim al-Shaheen, head of Kuwait&apos;s national committee for missing and POW affairs, has the job of finding the remaining bodies. Efforts are focusing on Nasireya in southern Iraq, which is thought to contain most of the outstanding remains. Last year, Kuwaiti and Iraqi officials conducted their first field dig in the suspected Nasireyah site. They will soon be back for a further look. &quot;From 05-08 the situation in Iraq was very bad and they were committed to survival, nothing else,&quot; said Dr Shaheen. &quot;After that we felt things had improved and said they should be doing more. But no documents were left behind by Saddam&apos;s regime. They had hidden the mass graves completely.&quot; Throughout the city, there are few outward signs of the war and the two invasions that took place here in 1990-91. A National Memorial Museum showcases relics from Iraq&apos;s military rule \u2013 and souvenirs seized from Iraq after Baghdad fell in 2003, such as a bronze bust of Saddam&apos;s head and a favourite blue cloak of his sadistic son, Uday. Across town, a ruined house where a small band of resistance fighters held out against Iraqi tank shells is one of the few other obvious war landmarks. There are some signs, however, of a new will to move on. As prime minister Nasser al-Sabah returned from Baghdad on Wednesday evening he would have flown near two giant new urban environment construction sites, a waterside development called Pearl City and another called Silk City, which comprise Kuwait&apos;s first steps to match the Gulf states for size and glitz as well as stake a claim on being a major regional investment hub. Both, as well as a giant port, are expected to be finished within five years. &quot;We will look back on 2010 as being a hugely important, if not watershed year for Kuwait,&quot; the western official said. &quot;If these things are resolved and you can be confident in the designs of your northern neighbour then there is a way forward.&quot;", "title": "Gulf war, 20 years on: Kuwait emerges from under Iraq's shadow", "sentences": ["Throughout the 1990s, the economy seemed to chug along rather than roar ahead like the equally affluent Gulf petro-states to its south - Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-16T16:58:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/17/sherlock-holmes-official-sequel-anthony-horowitz", "tags": ["Arthur Conan Doyle", "Books", "Publishing", "Culture", "Anthony Horowitz"], "article": "Master detective Sherlock Holmes is to follow in the suave footsteps of spy James Bond, gaining a new lease of life in the hands of a high-profile modern novelist.

Yet despite promises from clubs and the game&apos;s authorities that transfers would become more transparent, the football public is still told very little about how agents like Mendes do their work, or how such deals, involving huge money, are concluded. Tomorrow the Guardian begins a three-part series which will reveal more detail than ever known before about the deals Mendes has conducted, including the most extraordinary transfer of last summer and arguably any other: Manchester United&apos;s \u20ac9m signing of B\u00e9b\u00e9, the fledgling striker. The Guardian has since discovered a bitter legal dispute going through the district court in Mendes&apos;s home city of Porto, brought against him by the English agency, Formation, formerly run by Paul Stretford, Wayne Rooney&apos;s agent. Formation claim they had a partnership agreement with Mendes&apos;s Gestifute agency to help establish Mendes&apos;s players in the Premier League but that he reneged on that contract once Ronaldo&apos;s move to United, in 2003, ushered him into football&apos;s big time. Formation are claiming they are owed half the fees Mendes earned on that deal and when Chelsea signed Mendes&apos;s three client players, Ricardo Carvalho, Paulo Ferreira and Tiago Mendes, shortly after Mourinho joined Chelsea as the manager. Mendes is defending the claim, arguing that his was not an agreement which required him to share agent&apos;s fees 50-50 and that Gestifute in Porto did not receive anything from the Chelsea deals because the club&apos;s contracts were with Gestifute International, a company registered in Ireland. This unprecedented insight into how Mendes and two of the Premier League&apos;s richest and most prestigious clubs did their deals comes three weeks after Mendes picked up the agent of the year award at the Globe Soccer event in Dubai. The presentation was accompanied by a video featuring high praise for Mendes from his clients, Mourinho and Ronaldo, who described Mendes as his &quot;big brother&quot;.

He is reported to have struggled to build a career in Portuguese semi-professional football, then worked as a DJ, opened a video shop, bar and nightclub in Caminha, northern Portugal. There, in 1996, he happened to meet the goalkeeper, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, who was then playing for Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es \u2013 the same club from which Mendes orchestrated B\u00e9b\u00e9&apos;s sale to Manchester United 14 years later. Mendes negotiated Nuno a move to Deportiva La Coru\u00f1a, and after that, he moved gradually into the agency business. Known now for doing hugely lucrative deals representing almost all Portugal&apos;s international players, together with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, and Luiz Felipe Scolari and Carlos Queiroz \u2013 both former Portugal national team coaches \u2013 Mendes&apos;s rise has been hard-edged. It was marked, famously in Portugal, by a fist fight at Lisbon airport with Jos\u00e9 Veiga, Luis Figo&apos;s agent, whom Mendes was gradually supplanting in the early 2000s as the country&apos;s top football fixer. He has also been accused by other agents of moving in on their players shortly before agreeing major deals \u2013 Nani&apos;s former agent, Ana Almeida, complained that the player joined Mendes, then Manchester United, in 2005, while she still had a contract with him. B\u00e9b\u00e9&apos;s agent, Gon\u00e7alo Reis, has said he was cut off mid-contract, before Mendes suddenly began to represent B\u00e9b\u00e9 then within days agreed a \u20ac9m (\u00a37.5m) deal with United. Discussing the dispute with Almeida in an interview in 2006, Mendes was quoted as saying: &quot;There are people that have signed contracts with players and are there waiting for a Jorge Mendes to show up and take him to a big club. They want to be glued to the operation without ever having done anything to promote it.&quot; Even Mourinho is always reported to have dropped his own agent, Jorge Baidek, before signing up with Mendes then moving from Porto to manage Chelsea in 2004. In a video message played at the award ceremony in Dubai, Mourinho praised Mendes&apos;s skill in building good relationships with clubs and managers, and for motivating players to &quot;respect the commitments with the clubs&quot;. Ronaldo described his agent as &quot;a fair and honest man&quot; with whom he established &quot;immediate empathy&quot; as a 17-year-old. Accepting the award in Dubai, which he dedicated to his mother and brother, who have both died in the last year and a half, Mendes said: &quot;Portugal is a small country, where people who do well are the target of envy, but you have to struggle against the tide.&quot;", "title": "Jorge Mendes: The rise and rise of Portugal's super-agent", "sentences": ["In a video message played at the award ceremony in Dubai, Mourinho praised Mendes&apos;s skill in building good relationships with clubs and managers, and for motivating players to &quot;respect the commitments with the clubs&quot;.", "Accepting the award in Dubai, which he dedicated to his mother and brother, who have both died in the last year and a half, Mendes said: &quot;Portugal is a small country, where people who do well are the target of envy, but you have to struggle against the tide.&quot;"], "publicationDate": "2011-01-18T08:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2011/jan/18/jorge-mendes-super-agent", "tags": ["Football", "Chelsea", "Real Madrid", "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho", "Cristiano Ronaldo", "Arsenal", "Manchester United", "Sporting Lisbon", "Sport"], "article": "For a wheeler-dealer who not that long ago was running a nightclub in Caminha, a resort town north of Porto, Jorge Mendes&apos;s ascent to football &quot;super-agent&quot; has been stratospheric. His Gestifute agency harbours most of Portugal&apos;s stellar names \u2013 Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ricardo Carvalho \u2013 as well as B\u00e9b\u00e9, the former third division striker Manchester United signed this summer. In a few short years, Mendes has made enormous money from football as his client players have joined United, Chelsea and Real Madrid; he is reported to have received \u20ac3.6m of the \u20ac9m United paid for B\u00e9b\u00e9, earned handsomely when Real Madrid signed Ronaldo from United for \u00a381m in 2009, and untold millions from other deals. Last month, the Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai, describing itself as &quot;an annual meeting for all [football&apos;s] main market operators&quot;, declared Mendes &quot;agent of the year&quot; for 2010 accompanied by a video featuring high praise from Mourinho and Ronaldo. Mendes&apos;s own Gestifute agency humbly interpreted the award on its website as: &quot;Jorge Mendes proclaimed world&apos;s best businessman&quot;. Yet the football public still knows painfully little about how the game&apos;s multimillion\u2011pound transfer business is done, or how so-called &quot;super-agents&quot; actually earn their money. After United&apos;s extraordinary signing of B\u00e9b\u00e9 his former agent, Gon\u00e7alo Reis, complained he had been cut off by the player before Mendes moved in and earned prodigiously from the \u20ac9m (\u00a37.5m) deal. Since then, the Guardian has discovered there is a lawsuit against Mendes proceeding at glacial pace through the concrete-pillared district court in Porto brought by Formation, the English football agency formerly run by Paul Stretford, Wayne Rooney&apos;s agent. It exposes an illuminating, bitterly disputed account of Mendes&apos;s rise to the big time, with Formation claiming Mendes reneged on a partnership with it once his client, Mourinho, moved to Chelsea as manager. The case also lays bare what supporters are never told of how football really works, including exactly how much Mendes was paid when three of his clients \u2013 Carvalho, Paulo Ferreira and Tiago Mendes \u2013 were signed by Mourinho for Chelsea in July 2004. Chelsea&apos;s contracts both with the players and with Mendes, seen by the Guardian, show that Chelsea paid Mendes for acting both for the players and the club, but presented \u20ac2.45m not just as payment for completing the transfers, but for a baffling range of services, including ensuring his millionaire players turned up for training on time. All of that was permitted at the time by the Football Association, which still, following a U-turn last year, allows agents to act for both clubs and players in the same transfer. The origins of the falling out between Formation and Mendes lie in Lisbon, in March 2002. There Stretford was introduced to Luis Correia, Mendes&apos;s nephew and a Gestifute director, by Carlos Freitas, a Sporting Lisbon director, who suggested they work together to move Portuguese players to England&apos;s money-soaked Premier League. Mendes, with close relationships at Sporting and Porto, had signed up most of Portugal&apos;s fine generation of players, many of whom would come to prominence when Mourinho&apos;s Porto won the 2004 Champions League. In the court claim, seen by the Guardian, Formation argues that it agreed with Mendes to promote and represent Gestifute&apos;s Portuguese players in England, to share fees equally when moves were concluded, and that in May 2003 the two agencies signed a written agreement to that effect. Formation claims it shared its agents&apos; fees exactly 50-50 in June 2002 when Sporting&apos;s Hugo Viana signed for Newcastle \u2013 Mendes&apos;s first major international deal \u2013 then when Nuno Capucho joined Rangers in June 2003. Mendes did, according to the claim, share part of the fee he received from United when Ronaldo signed from Sporting Lisbon as a miraculously gifted 18-year-old in August 2003. However, after Mourinho joined Chelsea the following summer and immediately signed Carvalho, Tiago and Ferreira for a combined \u00a341m, Mendes paid nothing to Formation. The relationship between the two agencies broke down, and Formation sued Gestifute, for half the fees Mendes was paid in those Chelsea deals, and in Ronaldo&apos;s transfer. Tony Henry, the former Manchester City and Stoke City midfielder who was the main Formation agent promoting Gestifute players in England, remains furious. &quot;I gave two and a half years of my life to Mendes,&quot; Henry, now chief scout at Everton, says. &quot;I worked non-stop, introducing him to people, trying to get his players into clubs. We shared our fees honourably, but then once he knew people, and got Mourinho into Chelsea, he went on his own.&quot; In its defence, also seen by the Guardian, Mendes&apos;s Gestifute company in Porto claimed it received &quot;nada&quot; \u2013 nothing \u2013 when Carvalho, Tiago and Ferreira joined Chelsea. Formation&apos;s Lisbon-based lawyers reacted by obtaining, via English and Portuguese court orders, Chelsea&apos;s original contracts with Mendes, which show that Chelsea paid Gestifute \u20ac2.9m in total when the players signed. Formation accused Gestifute in court documents of having &quot;lied barefacedly and shamelessly&quot; for arguing it was paid nothing. Gestifute responded that its defence was correct because the \u20ac2.9m had been paid to Gestifute International Limited, a company registered in Ireland where corporate tax rates are much lower. Formation is pushing for a court hearing at which Mourinho and Ronaldo are listed as court witnesses for Gestifute, as well as Peter Kenyon, who as chief executive both at Manchester United and Chelsea agreed the big deals with Mendes, and now has a formal partnership, as managing partner of the sports marketing company, CAA, to promote Mendes&apos;s players commercially. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is understood to be proposed as a Formation witness \u2013 Arsenal were negotiating the details of a move for Ronaldo in 2003, right up until the player signed for United. For all that Mendes is now dubbed a &quot;super-agent&quot;, involved with players across Europe and South America, often part-owning their &quot;economic rights&quot;, which gives him a cut of transfer fees, it is generally acknowledged that Hugo Viana, a slight 19-year -old who did not flourish at Newcastle, was Mendes&apos;s first major international football transfer. Formation says it did most of the work; Henry had flown for his first meeting with Mendes in May 2002 to Switzerland, where Portugal&apos;s Under-21 team were playing Italy in the European Championships. Henry recommended Viana, then young European footballer of the year, to Stretford, who had very close links with Newcastle \u2013 Kenneth Shepherd, son of the club&apos;s then major shareholder, Freddy, worked for Formation. Charlie Woods, Newcastle&apos;s chief scout, went with Henry to watch Viana in the next game, and within a month, Stretford, Freddy Shepherd and Douglas Hall, Newcastle&apos;s other major shareholder, were meeting Mendes and Sporting directors in Lisbon to finalise Newcastle&apos;s signing of Viana, for \u00a38.5m. &quot;Mendes was big in Portugal,&quot; says Henry, &quot;wasn&apos;t known in England. A month after meeting us, we&apos;d got one of his players a move to a major club and made him a lot of money.&quot; The agent&apos;s fee paid by Newcastle, according to Formation&apos;s court claim, was \u00a3300,000. Stretford did the negotiations, the money was paid to Formation, and although no written partnership contract with Gestifute was yet in place, Formation agreed to share the fee exactly equally, \u00a3150,000 each, with Mendes&apos;s agency. Stretford and Henry continued to promote Gestifute players to English clubs, particularly Ronaldo, the 17-year old sensation, whom they took to meet Wenger at Arsenal&apos;s training ground in November 2002. The two agencies signed the formal partnership agreement, for a two-year period, beginning on 27 May 2003. The first deal concluded after that was not Ronaldo but the winger Nuno Capucho, signed by Rangers for \u00a3670,000. When United gazumped Arsenal for the signing of Ronaldo \u2013 paying \u00a312.24m, far more than the \u20ac6m Arsenal were discussing \u2013 Mendes handled negotiations directly with Sir Alex Ferguson and Kenyon. The following day, according to the claim, Mendes told Stretford his fee for the Ronaldo deal was \u20ac400,000 and offered to pay Formation \u00a380,000 in full settlement. Formation claims Stretford accepted because he wanted to preserve a profitable relationship, so it was deeply aggrieved when United published in their 2004 accounts that the payment to agents on the Ronaldo deal had been \u00a31.129m. After the Ronaldo signing, Formation says it pressed on with the partnership. No further deals were concluded, however, until after Porto beat Monaco 3-0 in the Champions League final on 26 May 2004, their team including Ferreira, Carvalho, Pedro Mendes and Deco \u2013 all Mendes clients. Days later, on 2\u00a0June, Kenyon, by then Chelsea&apos;s chief executive, unveiled Mourinho as the new manager. Chelsea then paid Porto \u00a313.2m to sign Ferreira, \u00a319.85m (a round \u20ac30m) for Carvalho, and \u00a38m to Benfica for Tiago, all in July 2004. Mendes negotiated those deals directly, according to Formation&apos;s claim, and did not report his fees to Formation or pay it anything. Mendes reacted by saying Formation had now itself breached their contract, so he would regard the partnership as ended. Formation sued Gestifute for the half of the fees it claimed were due. Chelsea&apos;s original contracts, with the players and Mendes, obtained via court order in Portugal and which the Guardian has seen, reveal that the club paid Gestifute \u20ac2.9m in agents&apos; fees, and shine a revelatory light into how football works. Agents were, still are, permitted to act for both a club and a player in transfer deals. Although that is an apparent breach of Fifa rules requiring agents to act with no conflicts of interest, the FA at the time allowed it. Subsequently the FA introduced a rule requiring players, not clubs, to pay agents, but after an outcry by agents they are now allowed to act for both again, as long as the players state they are happy with the arrangement. Chelsea&apos;s contracts with Carvalho, Ferreira and Tiago were all for three years and set out the players&apos; salaries \u2013 Carvalho starting on \u00a32.18m a year &quot;basic&quot;, plus bonuses and benefits including all housing costs; Ferreira \u00a31.55m a year basic, Tiago \u00a31.25m. Each included an agent&apos;s fee of \u20ac150,000 paid by the club to Gestifute SA, Mendes&apos;s Portuguese company, on behalf of the player. Chelsea had separate agreements to pay much more. These were with Gestifute International, a company registered in Ireland, and were signed by Correia and Mendes. Identical other than the amounts involved, the three contracts include that lower fee, \u20ac150,000, to Gestifute for &quot;acting on the player&apos;s behalf&quot;, which also appeared in each player&apos;s own contract. Then there are bigger payments: \u20ac1,050,000 for the Carvalho deal, \u20ac1,050,000 for Ferreira, \u20ac350,000 in Tiago&apos;s \u2013 \u20ac2.45m in total \u2013 for three duties ostensibly nothing to do with acting on the transfer itself. The first was to pay Mendes &quot;to facilitate the renegotiation of the player&apos;s contract with the club&quot;. The second, remarkably, was to &quot;look after the wellbeing of the player \u2026 the agent will do his best to ensure that the player \u2026 timeously [sic] attends training and matches.&quot; The third was for Mendes to &quot;act as a consultant \u2026 to secure any image rights attached to the player for the club&quot;. Despite the description of those duties, the FA has confirmed that Chelsea paid the whole \u20ac2.9m through it, as English football&apos;s &quot;transfer clearing house&quot;. Sources close to the arrangement have told the Guardian this was common practice at the time, with clubs describing such duties in contracts, indicating the fees were not paid to the agent for working on behalf of the club in the transfer. Chelsea, however, declined to comment when asked why they had framed Mendes&apos;s agents&apos; fees as payment for such services. The disclosure of these contracts led Formation&apos;s lawyers to accuse Gestifute of having &quot;lied barefacedly and shamelessly&quot; when it claimed it had received &quot;no commission whatsoever&quot; for the Chelsea deals. Gestifute&apos;s lawyers responded by saying that statement was true, because all payments were to Gestifute International, the Irish company. Contacted by the Guardian with a series of questions about the case, a spokesman for Gestifute said: &quot;This is a normal commercial dispute. The matter is being dealt by our lawyers, and we are very confident that the Court will decide on our favour.&quot; Formation would not discuss the issues, saying: &quot;We are making no comment as there is currently a legal dispute with Gestifute waiting to be heard in Portugal.&quot; The garland of &quot;super-agent&quot; is accorded to just one or two of football&apos;s fixers, informed by very little insight into what they actually do.

The eye-popping scale of Brian and Mary Pat O&apos;Donnell&apos;s debts has been laid bare in a court case brought by Bank of Ireland in relation to some \u20ac70m (\u00a358m) in debts it is trying to recover. The couple, from Killiney, county Dublin, are fighting the case and say the bank is trying to make them sell one of their prime London assets \u2013 Sanctuary Buildings, used by the Department for Education \u2013 without legal entitlement. The office block is just metres from the Houses of Parliament and was the first of many audacious moves made by the solicitor and his wife into the property market at a time when Ireland&apos;s banks were making huge loans that have since brought the country to its knees and forced Dublin to accept a bailout from the EU and IMF. The Bank of Ireland loaned the O&apos;Donnells \u20ac26.7m towards the \u00a3170m purchase price in 2006. The couple then went on to expand their empire to Stockholm, where they bought the city&apos;s biggest office block, Fatburen for \u20ac285m. In April 2008, when the worldwide credit crunch was beginning to bite and had already claimed the likes of Bear Stearns in New York, the couple were still able to access funds. With the strength of the euro in their favour, the O&apos;Donnells managed to outbid a group from Dubai to pay a record $172.5m (\u00a387m) for an office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington DC, just a few blocks from the White House. This was what the O&apos;Donnell&apos;s Vico Capital described as &quot;trophy class&quot; with &quot;sweeping views of the White House, the Monuments and the Potomac River&quot;. Its tenants included a law firm and a merchant bank and it was described in the local property press as a smart buy. Vico Capital set a record, paying $867 (\u00a3436) for every square foot of the their Washington investment. The previous record in the American capital was $827. Arguably, even more audacious was the acquisition of two buildings in London&apos;s Canary Wharf \u2013 the purchase of 17 Columbus Courtyard in 2005 for \u00a3125m and 15 Westferry Circus for \u00a3140m. The first building is home to Credit Suisse and the second to Morgan Stanley. For years, it probably seemed nothing could go wrong. The O&apos;Donnells live in a clifftop home in one of Ireland&apos;s most salubrious suburban roads and count the U2 frontman Bono among their neighbours. The O&apos;Donnells&apos; rise in the property sector mirrors that of dozens of other investors who got sucked in during the Celtic Tiger years when credit was cheap and capital yields, or profit on buildings, meant millions could be made, often in just a number of weeks. But unlike many other middle-class professionals of their ilk who dabbled in the property market with a few buy-to-lets, this couple became major players and amassed an international property portfolio of more than \u20ac1.1bn (\u00a3921m) with a rent roll of some \u20ac150m (\u00a3125m). They are, however, a low profile couple, and are aghast that their private financial affairs are now being made public. It is understood that as recently as last weekend, they tried to get a court approved mediation process underway. &quot;Most people in Dublin wouldn&apos;t know what they looked like. They are an extremely private family and would have hoped to have continued to conduct their business in private,&quot; said a source close to the couple. Their case isthe latest in a series of court actions being instigated against property developers now bearing the brunt of Ireland&apos;s financial collapse. According to informed sources there are two other private investors in the O&apos;Donnells&apos; Sanctuary Buildings in Westminster and there are concerns that the court case will lead to &quot;value destruction&quot;. However the O&apos;Donnells are determined to tough it out and have been given three weeks to put together a case for a fuller court hearing. O&apos;Donnell, 58, is one of Dublin&apos;s leading commercial lawyers and ironically is on a list of 64 potential legal advisers approved by Ireland&apos;s National Asset Management Agency \u2013 the new state bank which has been charged with clearing the mountain of bad debt amassed by property developers during the good times. Nama said O&apos;Donnell had not been used in any case. His practice, Brian O&apos;Donnell solicitors, has the usual run of commercial expertise including mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructuring, insolvency and tax structuring. His practice, however, is not high profile in the media. He first diversified into a serious property business back in 1999 and, with access to funds from a string of banks including Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Anglo-Irish, made his audacious moves in London, Scandinavia and the US. Ten years later he and his wife, now 56, who are relatively low-key on the Dublin social circuit, were listed on the Sunday Times Rich List \u2013 178th richest in Ireland, alongside another, more high profile property investor Derek Quinlan. Quinlan, a former tax inspector who also caught the property bug, ended up with the crown jewels of London&apos;s hotel and retail trade including the Savoy Hotel, Claridges and a retail block between Harvey Nichols and Knightsbridge in London. \u2022 This article was amended on Sunday 23 January to correct an outdated reference to Department for Education and Skills. \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 6 December 2011.

Moneta, 44, is leaving Aviva at the end of February to &quot;pursue new challenges in the financial services sector,&quot; the insurer said. The latest management reshuffle at Britain&apos;s second largest insurance group took markets by surprise. Mayer was appointed to his North American role a year ago after heading up the UK general insurance division since mid-2007, and was replaced by Mark Hodges in Britain. Eamonn Flanagan, a Shore Capital analyst, said: &quot;What people were looking for from Aviva was a period of stability ... This disrupts everything. The pieces are being moved around the chessboard again.&quot; Another analyst said that while Moneta had a strong team around him, some of the changes implemented in Europe were &quot;not going too well&quot;. The head of Aviva&apos;s French business, Philippe Sorret, walked out last February, unhappy with the changes to his role under the company&apos;s new pan-European strategy. Italian-born Moneta was recruited by the insurer in July 2008 from Dubai Financial Group, one of the emirate&apos;s investment companies. He has overseen Aviva&apos;s &quot;quantum leap&quot; strategy that integrated its 12 European divisions and launched a pan-European approach to distribution and simplified the insurer&apos;s product range. European revenues were up 10% to \u00a313bn in the third quarter of last year. Moneta, who lives in Milan with his family, is entitled to his 12-month salary of around \u00a3635,000. He previously worked for Accenture, the European Central Bank and served as chief financial officer of Italy&apos;s UniCredit. Aviva reiterated today that the growth of its European business remained one of its main priorities and said that Mayer&apos;s experience was crucial to its strategy. &quot;Aviva&apos;s strategy update announced in November 2010 reinforced the importance and potential of the European region,&quot; the company said. &quot;Igal&apos;s 20 years of experience at Aviva and his success in delivering excellent results will be invaluable to the business.&quot; Mayer, regarded as a &quot;nuts and bolts man,&quot; has plenty of international experience. He joined Aviva in 1989 and held a number of senior roles in Canada, including CFO and CEO, before leading the UK general insurance division, formerly known as Norwich Union. He oversaw the rebranding of Norwich Union as Aviva in 2009, for which some of the world&apos;s most famous faces were enlisted, including Bruce Willis, Ringo Starr and Elle Macpherson.

In years past, the American left-hander played golf outside the United States about as often as he had candlelit dinners with Tiger Woods. He was a home bird, a stalwart of the PGA Tour. Now he is anything but; perhaps not a &quot;world player&quot; in the manner of Gary Player or Ernie Els but he is getting there.

The PGA Tour does not allow appearance fees but in golf&apos;s new frontiers, around Asia and the Middle East, such lucrative stipends have become part of the landscape. Tiger Woods, for instance, is scheduled to play in next month&apos;s Dubai Desert Classic for a reported $3 million.

And for how much longer can it bear to watch events like this week&apos;s Bob Hope Classic, once a premier tournament on the other side of the Atlantic, reduced to a sideshow. The field at the Hope, which is taking place in Palm Springs, has only two players from the top 40 of the world rankings. The Abu Dhabi event, meanwhile, boasts all four of last season&apos;s major championship winners, Mickelson included, along with the world No1, Westwood. From a purely golfing perspective, the next four days might offer one of the best quality tournaments of the year outside the major championships. The Englishman is trying to maintain his place at the top of the world rankings and Mickelson is out to prove he is fit again after a 2010 which began brilliantly with victory at the Masters but faded as he battled the effects of arthritis. &quot;We know we are not going to be as sharp as we are on day one at Augusta but we have to have our game ready this week. The only way to know where you stand is to play against the best,&apos;&apos; the American said. Mickelson will certainly get his wish, and on a difficult golf course made very difficult by some thick rough. It should be quite a spectacle. The rise of the Abu Dhabi event should also be recorded as a bellwether in golfing politics. In the mid-90s Greg Norman floated the idea of a world tour featuring the top 40 players in the world playing in select events but he ran into opposition from the then hugely powerful PGA Tour. The proposal, which was to be financed by the late Australian tycoon Kerry Packer, never got off the ground. Fifteen years later, Norman&apos;s vision has been partly realised, albeit without his involvement. The Australian is not in the field this week, but he will be here in spirit.", "title": "Phil Mickelson is in Abu Dhabi and it's no joke for the Bob Hope Classic", "sentences": ["Tiger Woods, for instance, is scheduled to play in next month&apos;s Dubai Desert Classic for a reported $3 million."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-19T22:17:53Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jan/20/saeed-bin-suroorgroup-meydan", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Horse racing tips", "Sport betting", "Sport"], "article": "Last week&apos;s first Dubai International Carnival meeting proved to be business as usual for the major players; Saeed bin Suroor, Mahmood Al Zarooni and Mike de Kock, who collectively landed five of the seven Thoroughbred races.

He&apos;s so scrupulously polite and softly spoken and understated and, well, just so sensible. Could he really have worked for Ramsay for the best part of a decade? Been his protege? Opened his award-winning Maze restaurant in London for him (and six others scattered across the globe)? I&apos;m expecting at least a little bit of a chip off the old block, a certain swagger of the hips, but to the naked eye at least, there&apos;s nothing. It&apos;s not as if he&apos;s unambitious \u2013 he&apos;s opening his first restaurant, Pollen Street Social, in March \u2013 but there are no plans as yet for world domination. He&apos;s not interested in becoming a TV superstar, and he didn&apos;t want to put his name above the door, he says, &quot;because if we did open more than one restaurant, I wouldn&apos;t want to walk around London and see my name everywhere.&quot;\u00a0 And then there&apos;s the fact that in\u00a0his new place, the one he&apos;s been planning and dreaming about for 22 years, he will be embracing the decidedly un-macho world of puddings: Pollen Street Social will have a &quot;dessert bar&quot;. &quot;It&apos;ll be what looks like a cocktail bar at the end of the dining room, and stood behind there will be the pastry team, but not in chef&apos;s jackets \u2013 they&apos;ll actually look like they&apos;re making cocktails. It&apos;s such a skilled art. The only part of the kitchen where everything has to be measured, it has to be weighed. If you put one too many olives in the tapenade, nobody is going to know. When you make a lemon tart, if it hasn&apos;t got the exact amount of eggs in it, it&apos;s not going to set. I really want to celebrate pastry.&quot; It&apos;s a bold move, made more so because he&apos;s doing it in a recession. And funding it himself: 75% of the finance is coming directly from his savings. &quot;I&apos;ve put all of my money into it. There&apos;s not a penny left.&quot; Did the recession at least give him pause for thought? &quot;Not really. There&apos;s never a right time to do anything. It&apos;s like having a baby. We&apos;re about to have our second child. You just get on with it. I had a great job working for Gordon and creating the Maze brand. But it always had Gordon&apos;s name above the door and although I enjoyed my 10 years there, when this chance came up, I thought, &apos;I&apos;m 39, if I don&apos;t jump ship now, I&apos;ll never know.&apos;&quot; It&apos;s quite a year he has ahead. The restaurant opening in March, the baby due in August, turning 40 in September. He&apos;s married to Irha, a Filipina he met in Dubai, and they had their first child six years ago. &quot;It was when we opened Maze, so it&apos;s our lucky omen. We hope so anyway.&quot; Because it is a huge gamble. He worked for a parade of three-star Michelin chefs, including Nico Landis and Marco Pierre White, before Ramsay. And, it&apos;s not about money, he says: &quot;Salary-wise I&apos;ll never pay myself that again. Because, you know, I ran seven restaurants. It was a big job.&quot;\u00a0 But back to the puddings. What&apos;s with the beetroot sorbet? &quot;I&apos;m a big fan of using vegetables in desserts. Jerusalem artichoke makes a great ice cream. Or confit parsnip.&quot; As a pudding? &quot;Yes. The trouble in Britain is that we&apos;re so conservative. And when you&apos;ve lived and worked in Spain, they&apos;re so avant garde, and willing to try new things. Why not?&quot; His greatest influence is probably Ferran Adri\u00e0, the acclaimed chef of El Bulli, for whom he worked for a spell, and there are Spanish influences in Pollen Street Social \u2013 an emphasis on sharing, for one. It&apos;s &quot;social&quot; he says, because &quot;it&apos;s really important to me that people understand this is not just a fine dining restaurant. It&apos;s your fine dining restaurant. You can come and just have a glass of wine, or a coffee, or sit at the bar.&quot; The style of food is changing, too. He says there are no signature dishes yet, but he&apos;s been re-inventing old classics. &quot;One of the dishes we&apos;re working on is an Escoffier rib of beef which we&apos;re trying to modernise, and you&apos;ll get a recipe card so you can cook it at home. But the idea is that the garnish is on the plate, and you share the meat.&quot; The pressure on Atherton is not just commercial: he built up a formidable reputation while working for Ramsay and everyone wants to know how he&apos;ll fare by himself. Is there any competition between the Ramsay proteges? You and Marcus Wareing and Angela Hartnett? &quot;Yes, of course. But we&apos;re good friends. I go for dinner with Marcus, once, twice a month, and Angela once a month. We&apos;ve gone through a lot of hard times. And they&apos;re great chefs.&quot; I came across an interview Atherton did, for the financial pages of a newspaper, when he was in his mid-20s, in which he said: &quot;I can&apos;t work the hours I do now past 40 so I want to accumulate as much as I can now.&quot; He guffaws when I read it to him. &quot;And here I am now! Forty in September, and still doing the same shit! It&apos;s changed though. When you&apos;re that age, 10 years seems such a long time, but it goes like that. And you know, you grow to love it, I really do love my job. At that age, it was more difficult. The long hours. I didn&apos;t see my friends.

But it turns out there&apos;s a simple explanation for this: the banks are much bigger than national economies. That was the message of Britain&apos;s Banks: Too Big to Save? We learned that the loans and investments of Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC each exceeded \u00a31.5 trillion just before the meltdown. &quot;That&apos;s greater,&quot; as Robert Peston, the Beeb&apos;s verbally eccentric finance guru noted, &quot;than Britain&apos;s GDPeeeeeee!&quot; Not since Loyd Grossman&apos;s heyday has any TV presenter produced such excitingly unpredictable locutions and stresses as Peston. If every voice is an instrument, then his is a Moog synthesizer playing the works of Rachmaninov. Sometimes he&apos;s so violently emphatic it&apos;s hard to keep in mind what he&apos;s emphasising. Oh, that&apos;s right, the complex madness of our financial system, which has created things like CDOs\u00b2. What are CDOs\u00b2? None of the experts Peston interviewed seemed sure, which was worrying because half of them ran banks and the other half regulated them. One did manage to say that the term stood for &quot;collateralised debt obligations squared&quot;, although I was none the wiser, especially as apparently there are also &quot;synthetic&quot; CDOs\u00b2 and even CDOs\u00b3. It would have been nice if regulators had been a bit more OCD about CDOs, but Peston recounted how the people charged with overseeing global finance met in Basle in Switzerland before the crisis and decided that nothing much needed changing in the system. That&apos;s scary to think about, but not nearly as scary as the fact that they&apos;ve met since the crisis and the same system remains in place. There was a debate about banking in 10 O&apos;Clock Live, C4&apos;s new satire show which, as the title suggests, goes out live. David Mitchell, of this parish, noted that anger at the banks has gone &quot;way beyond the irritation at the pens on strings&quot;. It was the best line in what turned out to be a non-event discussion, and one of the highlights of what felt very much like a trial-run hour. Both Mitchell and Jimmy Carr, who coined the imperishable double-entendre &quot;Johnson out, Balls in&quot; to mark the shadow cabinet reshuffle, enjoyed successful first nights. That&apos;s chiefly because they had the strongest monologues and, as it stands, 10 O&apos;Clock Live is over-leveraged on contractualised diatribe obligations. Charlie Brooker&apos;s rant on the egregious Sarah Palin was a frenzied rush at a door that had been kicked off its hinges a long time ago, and all he managed to hit was a brick wall. Whereas the fourth member, Lauren Laverne, had to make do with a lame skit on another mouldy target, American news anchors, and came across as a rather fey Tina Fey. Even the more up-to-date material, such as the revolt in Tunisia, suffered from over-exposure, not least in the show itself, where it featured in two almost identical riffs on tourism. Although you only launch once, these are very early days. The comedic chemistry and sense of live urgency will take a while to develop. It was not helped by the blank spaciousness of the set, which leaves the participants looking removed not just from the audience but external events. The show&apos;s key asset, though, is four talented performers. Last Thursday they each looked as if they desperately didn&apos;t want to be the one that failed. Either they make more overt use of that competition or increase the opportunities for collaboration. More dialogue, in other words, and less monologue. There&apos;s been talk that 10 O&apos;Clock Live might compete with Question Time, against which its scheduled, for a mainstream political audience. It&apos;s a reasonable theory but it underestimates both the enduring strength of QT&apos;s format and its ability to turn its hand to satire. How else to explain George Galloway&apos;s righteous dramatics about the suicide of David Kelly, in which he accused fellow panellist Alastair Campbell of driving the weapons inspector to his death? It couldn&apos;t be moral indignation, because it was only a few months ago that Galloway appeared on the Iranian state&apos;s English-language propaganda channel, Press TV, for which he works, conducting an interview of stupefying proctological moistness with &quot;Your Excellency, President Ahmadinejad&quot;, while countless Iranians lay tortured and under threat of death and stoning in overflowing jails. Therefore we have little choice but to view Galloway&apos;s outrage as another demonstration of the rich comedic gift that gave us the unforgettable (and I&apos;ve tried) catsuit mime on Celebrity Big Brother. Still, it must have rattled Campbell, because he said that if the Chilcot inquiry found that the Iraq war was illegal, then &quot;the people who took us into this unlawful war deserve to be punished&quot;. He tried to step back from the statement when David Dimbleby pointed out what he&apos;d said, but it&apos;s out there for ever. It&apos;s lucky that Campbell is no longer a spin doctor because he would now have to give himself the kind of bollocking that would make The Thick of It&apos;s Malcolm Tucker blush. Piers Morgan questioned Condoleezza Rice about Iraq in Piers Morgan Tonight, his new talkshow on CNN, taking over from Larry King. She wasn&apos;t flustered, and Morgan didn&apos;t seem that interested. He was more concerned with her love life, or absence of it. There were some cheesy attempts at flirting (by him, not her) but it seemed like a long hour, even taking into account the incessant ads for golf in Dubai. Then again, Rice wasn&apos;t the big guest of the week. That, of course, was Ricky Gervais. The Iraq war is so 2003, whereas the big global story of the moment is a risqu\u00e9 set at the Golden Globes. Gervais spent a long time insisting that he wasn&apos;t bothered about the critical response. No, not a bit. Not bothered at all. Although after half an hour of his maintaining that he was completely unbothered, you began to wonder if perhaps he wasn&apos;t really very bothered indeed. Morgan played the interview as two Brits made good in the States, and the air of self-satisfaction \u2013 which Morgan wears like aftershave \u2013 sometimes threatened to reach levels of suffocating smugness. It was only the golf in the Gulf that came to the rescue. Having only ever watched Larry King when I was jet-lagged in foreign hotel rooms, I can&apos;t say how Morgan compares. But an hour is a gaping hole to fill with just one guest. He needs some other distractions. Perhaps he should consider some banker&apos;s braces.", "title": "Rewind TV: Britain's Banks; 10 O'Clock Live; Question Time; Piers Morgan Tonight; Hattie", "sentences": ["There were some cheesy attempts at flirting (by him, not her) but it seemed like a long hour, even taking into account the incessant ads for golf in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-23T00:04:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/23/sherry-rehman-pakistan-blasphemy", "tags": ["Pakistan", "Salmaan Taseer", "World news", "Islam", "Religion", "Freedom of religion", "Freedom of speech", "Pakistan's blasphemy laws"], "article": "All Sherry Rehman wants is to go out \u2013 for a coffee, a stroll, lunch, anything. But that&apos;s not possible. Death threats flood her email inbox and mobile phone; armed police are squatted at the gate of her Karachi mansion; government ministers advise her to flee. &quot;I get two types of advice about leaving,&quot; says the steely politician. &quot;One from concerned friends, the other from those who want me out so I&apos;ll stop making trouble. But I&apos;m going nowhere.&quot; She pauses, then adds quietly: &quot;At least for now.&quot; It&apos;s been almost three weeks since Punjab governor Salmaan Taseer was gunned down outside an Islamabad cafe. As the country plunged into crisis, Rehman became a prisoner in her own home. Having championed the same issue that caused Taseer&apos;s death \u2013 reform of Pakistan&apos;s draconian blasphemy laws \u2013 she is, by popular consensus, next on the extremists&apos; list. Giant rallies against blasphemy reform have swelled the streets of Karachi, where clerics use her name. There are allegations that a cleric in a local mosque, barely five minutes&apos; drive away, has branded her an &quot;infidel&quot; deserving of death. In the Punjabi city of Multan last week opponents tried to file blasphemy charges against her \u2013 raising the absurd possibility of Rehman, a national politician, facing a possible death sentence. &quot;My inbox is inundated. The good news is that a lot of it is no longer hate\u00a0mail,&quot; she says with a grim smile. &quot;But a lot of it is.&quot; Pakistani politicians have a long tradition of self-imposed exile but 50-year-old Rehman \u2013 a former confidante of Benazir Bhutto, and known for her glamour, principled politics and sharp tongue \u2013 is surely the first to undergo self-imposed house arrest. Hers is a luxury cell near the Karachi shore, filled with fine furniture and expensive art, but a stifling one. Government officials insist on 48 hours&apos; notice before putting a foot outside. Plots are afoot, they warn. She welcomes a stream of visitors \u2013 well-educated, English-speaking people from the slim elite. But Pakistan&apos;s left is divided and outnumbered. Supporters squabble over whether they should call themselves &quot;liberals&quot;, and while candle-lit vigils in upmarket shopping areas may attract 200 well-heeled protesters, the religious parties can turn out 40,000 people, all shouting support for Mumtaz Qadri, the fanatical policeman who shot Taseer. &quot;Pakistan is one of the first examples of a fascist, faith-based dystopia,&quot; warns commentator Nadeem Farooq Paracha. Is it really that bad? At Friday lunchtime worshippers streamed into the Aram Bagh mosque, a beautiful structure in central Karachi inscribed with poetry praising the prophet Muhammad. &quot;He dispelled darkness with his beauty,&quot; read one line. At the gate a banner hung by the Jamaat-e-Islami religious party offered less inspiring verse: &quot;Death to those who conspire against the blasphemy laws.&quot; Qamar Ahmed, a 50-year-old jeweller, said he &quot;saluted&quot; Taseer&apos;s killer, Qadri. &quot;Nobody should insult the glory of the prophet, who taught us Muslims to pray,&quot; he said. A sense of siege is setting in among Pakistan&apos;s elite. Hours later, at an upscale drinks party in the city, businessmen and their wives sipped wine and gossiped about second homes in Dubai. One woman admitted she wasn&apos;t aware of Rehman&apos;s plight because she had stopped reading the papers. &quot;Too much bad news,&quot; she said. Yet Pakistan is not on the verge of becoming a totalitarian religious state. The fervour is being whipped up by the normally fractious religious parties, delighted at having found a uniting issue. Leading the protests is Jamaat-e-Islami, which made the mistake of boycotting the last election and now wants to trigger a fresh poll. More significant is the lack of resistance from every other party. Rehman is polite when asked about the silence of her colleag ues in the ruling Pakistan Peoples party on the blasphemy issue. &quot;They feel they want to address this issue at another time,&quot; she says. The truth is, they have abandoned her. The party played with fire over the blasphemy issue last November when President Asif Ali Zardari floated the idea of a pardon for Aasia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death on dubious blasphemy charges. According to Rehman, he also agreed to reform the law. But then conservative elements in the party objected, a conservative judge blocked the pardon and, even before Taseer had been killed, the party had vowed not to touch a law that has become the virtual sacred writ of Pakistani politics. The opposition has also been quiet. &quot;The greater the failure of the ruling class, the louder the voice of the cleric,&quot; says politician and journalist Ayaz Amir. The mess is also the product of dangerous spy games by the powerful army, which propped up jihadi groups for decades to fight in Afghanistan and India. Some of those militants have now &quot;gone rogue&quot; and allied with al-Qaida; others, according to US assessments in the WikiLeaks files, are still quietly supported by the military. &quot;Our establishment, especially the army, is in league with these people,&quot; says Javed Ahmad Ghamidi, a moderate cleric. &quot;And until they stop supporting them they will never be weakened.&quot; The furore has exposed the fallacy of western ideas about &quot;moderate&quot; Islam. Qadri is a member of the mainstream Barelvi sect, whose leaders previously condemned the Taliban. But after Taseer&apos;s death, Barelvi clerics were the first to declare that anyone who even mourned with his grieving family was guilty of blasphemy. Progressives demonstrate loudly in the English press and on Twitter but lack political support, having largely spurned corruption-ridden politics. Politicians say now is the time to come back. &quot;They will be contemptuous of the politician, but they will not actually soil their hands with politics. But none of them has a constituency from which to stand,&quot; says Amir. And there are signs that extremists do back down when confronted. Qari Munir Shakir, the cleric accused of calling Rehman an &quot;infidel&quot;, denied his comments after Rehman supporters filed a police case against him. &quot;It&apos;s all been blown out of proportion,&quot; he said. &quot;All I did was ask her to take the law back. I can&apos;t imagine calling her a non-Muslim or declare her Wajib ul Qatil [deserving of death].&quot; Rehman is unlikely to attend Pakistan&apos;s parliament when it resumes this week. Her progressive credentials are strong, having previously introduced legislation that blunted anti-women laws and criminalised sexual harassment. But critics, including senior human rights officials, say she made a tactical mistake in prematurely introducing last November&apos;s blasphemy bill without the requisite political support. &quot;There&apos;s never a right time,&quot; she retorts. &quot;Blasphemy cases are continually popping up, more horror stories from the ground. How do you ignore them?&quot; At any rate the bill is a dead letter: clerics are demanding its immediate withdrawal from parliament and the government is likely to comply. Amid the gloom there is some hope, from unlikely quarters. On a popular talk show last Friday night Veena Malik, an actress who faced conservative censure for appearing on the Indian version of Big Brother, gave an unforgettable tongue-lashing to a cleric who had been criticising her. &quot;You are attacking me because I am a soft target,&quot; she railed into the camera, wagging her finger. &quot;But there&apos;s a lot more you can fix in the name of Islam\u2026 What about those mullahs who rape the same boys that they teach in mosques?&quot; As the mullah replied, she started to barrack him again. Hope also springs inside the silent majority. &quot;The blasphemy law should be changed,&quot; declared Muhammad Usman after Friday prayers. Clutching his motorbike helmet, the 30-year-old pharmaceutical company representative said he was unafraid of speaking his mind. &quot;It&apos;s just the illiterate ones who are supporting Mumtaz Qadri. They don&apos;t have any real religious knowledge,&quot; he said. Some analysts downplay the worst predictions, saying blasphemy is exceptionally sensitive in a country obsessed by religion. They are right. Pakistan will soon return to more concrete worries: Taliban insurgents, economic collapse, the rise of extremism. Yet there is no doubt the aftermath of Taseer&apos;s death points to a country headed down a dangerous path. &quot;We know from history that appeasement doesn&apos;t pay. It only emboldens them,&quot; said Rehman. She has no idea how long her self-imposed house arrest will last, but the precedents are ominous. In 1997 a judge who acquitted two Christians accused of blasphemy was gunned down \u2013 three years after the judgment. &quot;It makes me realise that life is pretty fragile,&quot; she says. &quot;But we don&apos;t want to leave. I see no meaning to a life away from my country. It&apos;s my identity, it&apos;s everything.&quot;", "title": "Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's defiant prisoner of intolerance, vows to stay put", "sentences": ["Hours later, at an upscale drinks party in the city, businessmen and their wives sipped wine and gossiped about second homes in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-23T00:04:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jan/23/vanessa-feltz-andy-kershaw-nicky-campbell-review", "tags": ["Radio", "Television & radio", "Vanessa Feltz", "Nicky Campbell", "Radio 4", "Radio 3", "Culture"], "article": "Vanessa Feltz (Radio 2) | iPlayer Music Planet (Radio 3) | iPlayer Showstopper (Radio 4) | iPlayer Vanessa! Once a woman so famous that her TV show had no need of her surname (eat that, Jeremy Kyle), Vanessa Feltz has been rather less than front-page news for quite some time. At least, if you don&apos;t live in That London, where she&apos;s been presenting BBC London&apos;s morning show for the past six years. She is brilliant at it, feisty and funny, introducing the day&apos;s phone-in topics with an articulate fluency that&apos;s almost beyond belief (15-minute fault\u2011free monologues are not unheard of), and was duly rewarded with a Sony gold award for speech personality of the year in 2009. It&apos;s a different job altogether, however, to ease a Radio 2 audience into the very early morning (5-7am), especially an audience used to the bumbling rambles and barely coherent newspaper-reading of Sarah Kennedy. This week&apos;s question was: could Vanessa squash down her Space Hopper personality and let us just wake up? By Friday, there was no doubt that she could. Vanessa was purring through her two hours, upbeat but not jarring, sharp but uncombative. Oh, she is so much better on radio than TV. On telly, her mental mutton Barbie look dominates; on radio, there&apos;s no desperation, just her cheerfulness and bright mind. She interacts well with her guests, whether Andrew Graystone of Pause for Thought, or callers to the new slot of &quot;I&apos;d Like to Wake Up To\u2026&quot;, where a listener says which track they&apos;d like to hear and why. She enjoys her words, managing to squeeze in &quot;terpsichorean&quot; twice when referring to a news piece on how the older you get, the more confident you are on the dance floor. (&quot;Of or related to dancing&quot; \u2013 I had to look it up.) Honestly, Vanessa was great. A perfectly judged debut. And welcome back to Andy Kershaw, another broadcaster who&apos;s had his wilderness years, as co-presenter of Radio 3&apos;s Music Planet, on Thursdays at 9pm. The series, which ties in with BBC1&apos;s Human Planet, sees Kershaw and Lucy Duran travelling around the planet in search of local music, the lucky gits. On Thursday, in the second show, Kershaw went to Algeria and Dubai, Duran to Mongolia. You could hear the thrill of it in their voices. I have mixed feelings about Andy Kershaw.

A haute couture dress costs about \u00a350,000 and many in the fashion industry assumed the couture tradition would be killed off by the recession. On the contrary, couturiers are reporting an uptick in sales. Christian Dior, whose blockbuster shows had been scaled back to in-house presentations in recent years, staged today&apos;s spring/summer show in an 800-seat marquee in the grounds of the Mus\u00e9e Rodin. The bigger venue was in response to a surge in demand for tickets, Sidney Toledano, Dior&apos;s chief executive, told Women&apos;s Wear Daily this week. The fantasy-based aesthetic of couture, which looked out of step with the times a decade ago, seems to chime with a new generation of consumers. Last week&apos;s unveiling of the One Hyde Park apartment block in Knightsbridge, west London, promises &quot;haute couture living&quot; (at \u00a3140m for a penthouse) while Lady Gaga was photographed last spring wearing dresses from Giorgio Armani&apos;s sculptural silver haute couture collection, which, the designer said, was inspired by the moon. On the double-length catwalk at the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, Dior designer John Galliano used the power of a no-expense-spared haute couture show to beam an image of the Dior brand around\u00a0the world. Galliano is famous for his spectacular fashion and desire to shock, but this collection was primarily about the elegance of Dior. He took as his inspiration the work of Ren\u00e9 Gruau, the fashion illustrator who brought the ideas of Christian Dior himself to life and played a major role in promoting the rebirth of French fashion after the second world war. The result is an evocative vision by Galliano of what the Dior brand stands for: beautiful tailoring cut to emphasise a swan-like, elongated feminine silhouette, accented by sharp elbows in long black gloves, imperious eyebrows and immaculate red lips. It was a gorgeous collection and one that fits neatly with Galliano&apos;s tribute to Gruau \u2013 that his work &quot;stimulates all the senses&quot; \u2013 and with Toledano&apos;s belief about couture that &quot;the image is so strong \u2026 and this generation is looking for strong images&quot;. Haute couture dresses are handmade in Paris, with no time and expense spared, either by the designer \u2013 for last season&apos;s floral collection, Galliano apparently spent an hour watching the light move on a parrot tulip \u2013 or by the teams of skilled craftspeople who work in the ateliers. But for all the organza and tulle, couture is made of stronger stuff than it is given credit for. The couture houses have successfully pursued an aggressive policy of reaching wealthy customers around the world. For example, Armani enjoyed a 45% increase in sales in 2010.

This week he is at a trade fair in Dubai called Arab Health and it is demand from regions such as the Middle East for his company&apos;s hospital and dental equipment that makes him upbeat. Eschmann which was founded in 1830, makes about half of its revenue overseas but Kennedy expects that these sales will generate the majority within three years. &quot;The weak pound has helped our ability to export. There is booming demand particularly in markets in the Middle East and far east for modern healthcare equipment. There is still a great emphasis overseas on British manufacturing quality and British supported brands. We feel fairly resilient.&quot; There is more uncertainty on the domestic front. The firm has benefited from the huge investment under Labour in hospitals and requirements for dentists to upgrade equipment, but Kennedy says sales to the NHS could be hit by public spending cuts. His big worry is rising inflation which he fears could drive up wage costs that he cannot pass on in a global market. &quot;It&apos;s an ever-present danger. I&apos;m concerned that if inflation is not nipped in the bud quickly it would start to affect our business moving forward. Interest rates need to go up soon to keep inflation under control.&quot; Despite the criticisms of outgoing CBI chief Richard Lambert about the government&apos;s supposed lack of direction to the private sector to lead the economic recovery, Kennedy is reasonably content with the level of government support, particularly from trade agency UKTI. But he adds that the political rhetoric about rebalancing the economy away from financial services and towards manufacturing has not been translated into action. &quot;I can understand the frustration that there was a great deal of noise made at the general election that &apos;we have to grow our way out of recession and get back to manufacturing&apos;.

This week&apos;s feature is the Group Two Al Rashidiya, over nine furlongs on turf, which has attracted a field of 13. Epsom Diomed Stakes winner Bushman goes well fresh and conditions should suit, although his trainer David Simcock&apos;s 0 for 24 record in Dubai is a concern. Preference then is for Mike de Kock&apos;s South African Grade One winner Irish Flame (5.45), who has to give weight away all-round but can enhance his trainer&apos;s excellent run of form. Presvis, winner of the Group Two Jebel Hatta over course and distance, is also one to note on his return after a break. The opening mile Tapeta handicap features a closely matched bunch and Yirga, a staying-on second over a furlong shorter last week, and Riggins, unbeaten on the all-weather, can both go close. The season&apos;s leading trainer, Satish Seemar, may have the answer, though, with the unexposed Reynaldothewizard (2.35), winner of both his Meydan starts. Happy Dubai won here last week over five furlongs and is respected again in the six-furlong turf event, but he may find a couple too good, including the tough French raider Mariol (4.10) who runs over his optimum trip. Saeed bin Suroor can take the 11-furlong Tapeta handicap with the ex-Jeremy Noseda-trained Lost In the Moment (4.00), who makes his all-weather debut and looks progressive. Halicarnassus and Prizefighting finished second and third behind Rock N Roll Ransom a fortnight ago and both can feature again.

Last year&apos;s UAE Oaks winner Raihana returns from a disappointing Australian campaign in the closing mile turf handicap and a good run would suggest she retains her ability.

But as seasoned Middle East analysts such as the Financial Times&apos;s Roula Khalaf have noted, grassroots opposition to the increasingly prevalent practice of dynastic succession or tawrith \u2013 inherited rule \u2013 among non-monarchical, secular regimes is also fuelling the unrest. Across the region, Arab rulers are seeking to perpetuate their rule by passing on power to favoured sons or other male family members. But such cosy succession schemes are anathema to demonstrators pushing for expanded democratic rights. They also underscore the low status afforded to women. After this month&apos;s successful intifada in Tunisia, which overthrew the self-perpetuating ruling family, would-be dauphins, pretenders and heirs-apparent throughout the Middle East are wondering whether their dynastic great expectations may yet be thwarted. Here are some of the men who would be king: Egypt Egyptians have long assumed their charmless president Hosni Mubarak, 82, who came to power unexpectedly in 1981 after the assassination of Anwar Sadat, is planning to transfer power to his equally unprepossessing son, Gamal \u2013 a wheeze both deny. Gamal, a western-trained banker, is deputy secretary-general of his dad&apos;s ruling National Democratic party. But unlike his father, he has no military constituency, no experience of public office \u2013 and like his father, he lacks popular support. Reports in recent days that Gamal boarded a private jet in Cairo with 100 pieces of luggage and fled to London appear to be wishful thinking. But with presidential elections due later this year, such hostile rumours underscore the extreme difficulty that Mubarak Snr will face if he tries to foist his son on to an unwilling Egypt. It really could be the straw that breaks the pharaoh&apos;s back. Tunisia This month&apos;s &quot;jasmine revolution&quot; appears to have been inspired in part by popular hatred of the avaricious ways of the family of the deposed president, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, and in particular, his son-in-law, Sakher al-Materi, married to Ben Ali&apos;s daughter, Nesrine. American diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks described the &quot;great wealth and excess&quot; surrounding Materi, symbolised by a large tiger, named Pasha, kept in a cage in their Tunis home. &quot;The opulence with which Materi and Nesrine live and their behaviour make clear why they and other members of Ben Ali&apos;s family are disliked and even hated by some Tunisians. The excesses of the family are growing,&quot; one US diplomatic cable reported. Materi was widely tipped as successor to Ben Ali before the revolution ended the family&apos;s grip on power and sent them running. He fled to Dubai. No one knows what happened to Pasha. Libya The country&apos;s maverick leader, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, who seized power in a coup d&apos;etat in 1969, is widely reported to be cultivating his son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, as his successor \u2013 although there is as yet no indication that the old man is ready to surrender the camel reins. Gadafy Snr, famous for his &quot;little green book&quot;, his penchant for pitching a Bedouin tent at international summits, and his bizarre overtures to Italian womanhood, will be a hard act to follow. But Saif has gained a reputation as the contact man for western governments and businesses wanting to do build relations with energy-rich Libya \u2013 he reportedly persuaded his dad to scrap Libya&apos;s secret WMD programme. Like Britain&apos;s Prince Charles, he may have a long wait for his inheritance. He also faces a possible rival to the throne in his brother, Mutassim Gaddafi, Libya&apos;s national security adviser, who has an eclectic taste in brown suits. Yemen Ahmed Saleh, the son of Yemen&apos;s president Ali Abdullah Saleh and head of the Republican Guard, looks well placed to follow his father into the presidential palace in Sana&apos;a. Except the Yemeni public, unconsulted until now, appears deeply unimpressed and may yet scupper any succession plan. Many thousands have spent recent days in large-scale protests demanding the government resign. &quot;We will not accept anything less than the president leaving&quot; said an independent MP, Ahmed Hashid. Saudi Arabia could get crowded at this rate. A rattled Saleh Snr insists he has no intention of passing the baton to his son. That may be just as well. The ways things are going in Yemen, which faces a separatist movement in the south, tribal warfare in the north, and Iranian, Saudi, al-Qaida, and US meddling, there may soon be no country left to rule. Hillary Clinton showed up there last week to help. As if Saleh &amp; Son didn&apos;t have enough problems. Syria Not for the first time, Syrians appear to have missed the boat by supinely acquiescing in the 2000 transfer of power from their long-serving leaderHafez al-Assad to his London-trained, awkward-looking opthalmologist son, Bashar. The Lion of Damascus, as Hafez was known, cut a powerful and influential figure on the Middle Eastern stage, feared and admired by friends and enemies alike. Bashar has proved a poor substitute, messing up in Lebanon in 2005-6, humiliated repeatedly by the Israelis (who bombed his mystery &quot;nuclear&quot; plant in 2007), and blowing hot and cold over Barack Obama&apos;s clumsy attempts to kiss and make up. Bashar is a good reason why dynastic succession is a bad idea. But that does not mean it won&apos;t stretch to a third generation. Bashar and his London-born wife had a son in 2001.

Local Hero&apos;s odds cut for the Festival 1.35pm Greg Wood at Cheltenham: Steve Gollings has not ruled out the Fred Winter Handicap Hurdle as a possible target for Local Hero, the winner of the first race, but the Triumph is still a realistic option after a hard-fought success to maintain his unbeaten record over hurdles. &quot;I think the bad thing about it was that they didn&apos;t go fast enough for him,&quot; Gollings said. &quot; With a stronger gallop, he would have won more convincingly. &quot;Also, he was a bit novicey at one or two, he kicked one of them out of the ground and threw himself at another, but he&apos;s going the right way. Obviously we&apos;ll be thinking about the Triumph Hurdle now, he&apos;ll have an entry in that and also in the Fred Winter. &quot;He&apos;d beaten nothing [before today], but you just get a gut feeling about horses. He&apos;s got a good cruising speed and he can only get better.&quot; Local Hero is 20-1 (from 25-1) for the Triumph Hurdle with Stan James, and 12-1 (from 16-1) for the Fred Winter with the same firm. Third Intention, the runner-up today, could also be a horse to bear in mind, though, as he was very keen early on and was sent for home a fair way out. He too should benefit from a stronger pace at the Festival. Paul Jones&apos; daily Cheltenham Festival countdown stat Five Gold Cup entries take their chance in today&apos;s Argento Chase but, despite a golden spell between 1995 and 2000 during which the race signposted three Gold Cup winners, 11 years have now passed since Looks Like Trouble, the last horse to run here before winning the big one at the Festival. Maybe this has plenty to do with the introduction of Newbury&apos;s AON Chase, which attracts horses of similar quality. Cheltenham executives were certainly not happy when Newbury announced their own Gold Cup trial, which has featured two recent Gold Cup winners in Kauto Star and Denman. The JCB Triumph Hurdle Trial, also today, was a shocking guide to the Festival race until Katchit completed the double in 2007, as the previous 16 winners to line up in the Triumph were beaten. Since Katchit, two of the three winners were then second in the Triumph, so, unlike the Argento, this trial is proving more effective these days. Paul Jones is author of The Cheltenham Festival Betting Guidepublished by Weatherbys Today&apos;s TV races, by Chris Cook It is very easy to be suspicious of a horse such as Tidal Bay, who combines masses of talent with a disappointing strike rate. But there are worse outsiders for the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March than this 50-1 shot and those odds may be a distant memory if he proves capable of winning the Argento Chase at the same course. Now 10 years old, Tidal Bay (2.30) has won four times at the home of jump racing, notably when beating an admittedly weak Arkle field at the 2008 Festival. A more significant victory in today&apos;s context may be the one he pulled off in the Cleeve Hurdle on this card last year, when he came five lengths clear of Time For Rupert, who would have lined up against him today but for a dirty scope on Thursday. Being Tidal Bay, he has not managed to win again in the past 12 months, though he ran an extraordinary race to be second to Imperial Commander in the Betfair Chase at Haydock in November. Held up out the back, he looked like the first beaten but stayed on stoutly from the second-last to be beaten just a length and a quarter. The bare result may flatter him but he ran on past some good horses and, around this testing circuit, there is plenty of reason to hope that he may get there in time. Given that stamina now looks his long suit, it is surprising to remember that it was in doubt until his Cleeve success. Punchestowns won here over hurdles and ran two excellent races in defeat behind Big Buck&apos;s but was a major disappointment when tried over these fences in the RSA Chase, when he was the 2-1 favourite but was beaten 24 lengths. Perhaps he will be able to atone but, in the circumstances, short odds make no appeal. Cheltenham 2.00 Noland, third in Tidal Bay&apos;s Arkle, is a fascinating contender but hardly well handicapped on his first run over obstacles for more than two years. Wishfull Thinking, by contrast, is just 4lb higher than the mark from which he ran in last year&apos;s Coral Cup, when he was close up and going well before falling at the second\u2011last flight. He took another tumble on his fencing debut but will have learned plenty from his fine second to Reve De Sivola here last time. Doncaster 2.45 This step up to an extended three miles should be just the thing for Rose Of The Moon, who kept on powerfully to be second behind Bobs Worth on his hurdles debut at Cheltenham over a half-mile shorter trip. Buck Mulligan, impressive at Wincanton last time, looks a real threat. Cheltenham 3.05 The Challow Hurdle was run in thick fog and it seemed that Backspin seized the opportunity to murder his rivals, who were nowhere to be seen when he emerged on the run-in. The second and third have been easy winners since and it will be surprising if Backspin cannot \u00ademulate Wichita Lineman, who won this for the same connections in 2007. Doncaster 3.20 Blazing Bailey seemed to have lost the winning habit until pulling clear of a big field at Cheltenham on New Year&apos;s Day, but that was his fifth outing over fences and his first in a handicap. He has been raised 13lb but still hard to beat if in the same mood. Cheltenham 3.35 Punters have often underestimated Organisateur, a 20-1 runner-up in the Lanzarote on his most recent start. Ian Popham left his challenge too late when the pair were held off by a short-head at Taunton before that, but those handicap efforts under big weights read well. Horse sense This week&apos;s work by Punchestowns (2.30), we are told, was his best for some time and he will be expected by Nicky Henderson&apos;s staff to sustain the yard&apos;s good form when lining up for the Argento Chase at Cheltenham. There is less confidence behind Tidal Bay, who won the Arkle there in 2008 but whose current appetite for jumping fences is doubted by at least one person in a position to form a view. Henderson may be in for another good day, as Shakalakaboomboom (1.30) is thought to have improved again since his Taunton success, while Bobs Worth (3.05) is fancied for the tough-looking Grade Two novice hurdle. Connections have yet to decide whether he should be tried at the Festival. The primary aim for Spirit River is a confidence-boosting clear round in the Cleeve Hurdle after his two tumbles over fences. He will not be sent back over the bigger obstacles this season. In the same race, Bensalem (3.35) is thought likely to go well. His trainer, Alan King, has had a tricky news week but there is confidence from the yard about the chances of his Iolith, a 14-1 shot for next month&apos;s Totesport Trophy. There is a tip going around for the Irish raider Killyglen (3.20) in Doncaster&apos;s Sky Bet Chase, though Aimigayle is also interesting at big odds on this first run back after a year off with a tendon problem. Connections would rather have had a prep run over hurdles but the mare is said to be fit enough to do herself justice. Dark Shadow (3.55), from Henderson&apos;s yard, makes his racecourse debut in the last and is said to be a nice bumper horse. Buaiteoir (1.25) is strongly fancied at Lingfield, while Jamie Spencer is said to be a significant booking for Timeteam (2.55). Twice Over is described as looking &quot;in top form&quot; on the gallops as Henry Cecil prepares him for a second tilt at the Dubai World Cup at the end of March, for which he is 5-1 second-favourite. Seen and heard A winning formula is repeated as often as possible in the slightly superstitious world of horse racing and that is presumably the explanation for Moose Moran, fifth at Royal Ascot last year, making his hurdling debut at Ludlow on Monday. His owner, Raymond Tooth, is the owner of Punjabi, who jumped hurdles for the first time in the same, extremely low-profile race four years ago, the beginning of a career that peaked with victory in the Champion Hurdle of 2009. The Newmarket trainer Amy Weaver so enjoyed her spin round Cheltenham in the charity Flat race at last year&apos;s Festival that she applied to take part once more in what is now known as the St Patrick&apos;s Day Derby. Alas, there were so many entrants that Weaver, having already had her turn, was turned down A great pity, as she had been offered the ride on Henry Cecil&apos;s Ajaan, a classy beast who was fifth in the Ebor. Now we must wait to see if Cecil, who will be Cheltenham&apos;s guest of honour on the day, can be persuaded to offer the mount elsewhere. If Doncaster beats the frost to race today where the highlight is the Sky Bet Chase, it will be thanks to frantic efforts by staff in the darkness of the Yorkshire night. It takes five hours to lay frost covers around the course and yesterday&apos;s final race did not start until 4.10pm.", "title": "Talking Horses", "sentences": ["Twice Over is described as looking &quot;in top form&quot; on the gallops as Henry Cecil prepares him for a second tilt at the Dubai World Cup at the end of March, for which he is 5-1 second-favourite."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-29T10:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/jan/30/buy-to-let-repossessed-homes", "tags": ["Buying property abroad", "Buying to let", "Investments", "Property", "Repossessions", "Money", "US housing and sub-prime crisis", "Business", "Spain", "World news", "Europe"], "article": "British investors unable to afford buy-to-let properties in the UK are buying ultra-cheap repossessed US homes in a bid to profit from rent guarantee schemes and possible long-term capital appreciation when the American economy recovers. The homes are selling for as little as \u00a320,000 in cities such as Detroit, where the combination of long-term unemployment and the credit crunch has led to house price falls of 70% since 2006, with few signs of any imminent recovery. &quot;We had money in premium bonds and savings in this country, getting almost no returns, and we couldn&apos;t afford to buy an investment property here. Then we heard about buying in the US,&quot; says Lynn Duggan, a clinical co-ordinator from New Malden in Surrey. &quot;At first we were wary and we spoke to some US legal contacts. We were attracted by the principle of a government-guaranteed rental scheme which, if it does what it claims, will cover the purchase price of the home in seven years.&quot; Duggan bought a four-bedroom Detroit home for \u00a330,000 cash in the autumn, paying an initial \u00a33,000 deposit and the rest 14 days later. Under a US federal housing and urban development scheme, rent for some low-income tenants is paid directly to landlords \u2013 and this is what British investors are relying on to achieve high yields. &quot;I&apos;m getting about 20% return in year one and about 13% annually thereafter,&quot; Duggan says. &quot;I pay a management fee of $100 a month but otherwise the money is rolling in. &quot;Obviously I hope the capital value of the house goes up, but if not in seven years&apos; time I&apos;ll have covered my cost and everything I resell for is profit.&quot; The British firm marketing the properties is the Belgrave Group, which has set up legal teams to handle sales in Atlanta and Detroit, where the market has plummeted. Its director, Nigel Gough, says the potential return from repossessed US homes sold off by banks has always been high, but the practicalities of buying have been difficult for individual investors. &quot;The turnkey solution we&apos;ve created overcomes this and meets the demand for a property sector with exceptional yields and the prospect of very strong appreciation,&quot; says Gough. This is not the only way British investors are cashing in on the US crash. &quot;Foreclosure bus tours&quot; \u2013 coach trips run by estate agents, often for visiting Britons \u2013 go to homes in areas as diverse as Las Vegas, Alabama, Minnesota and California. In those cities with major economic problems, prices may be just 30% of their 2006 highs; in more affluent areas with homes foreclosed because of individual owners&apos; misfortunes, prices are typically 60%. Some cities have streets now plagued with antisocial behaviour as a result of repossessed homes being empty, sometimes for years. Even so, tour operators report strong interest from foreign investors as well as domestic buyers. &quot;Nothing&apos;s more exciting than giving clients a chance to own a piece of America,&quot; says Sammy Hastings, who runs a foreclosure bus tour in the Bay Area of California. There is also British investor interest in Spain, where the scale of over-supply of properties \u2013 including second homes in coastal areas as well as those mainly for Spanish owner-occupiers \u2013 is set to grow this year as a glut of foreclosed homes come to the market. The Spanish-language website pisosembargadosporbancos.com, showcasing homes seized by banks from defaulting owners, says there are now 100,000 foreclosed properties on sale across the country. It warns this will rise to 300,000 by the end of 2011 as a series of repossession orders begun three years ago reach their conclusions this year. As a result of these extra homes \u2013 added to the estimated 900,000 properties across Spain awaiting buyers \u2013 asking prices, which have already dropped 20% to 50% in some places, are expected to fall further this year. Websites such as property-abroad.com and top-tour-of-spain.com list hundreds of homes costing \u00a340,000 or less, and many for just half that. Spain is a tougher investment challenge than the US because the Spanish rental market is also in the doldrums. This is because there is a glut of homes for sale in cities and tourist areas whose frustrated owners are letting them out until they can find a buyer. Stephen Harman, a businessman from Manchester, has bought a three-bedroom villa near the popular village of Frigiliana, a short drive from Malaga, for under \u00a365,000. &quot;It was repossessed and on sale for almost \u00a390,000 but I bartered,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s a lovely holiday home and I can hold on to it indefinitely. I&apos;ll rent it out as and when but I accept rents are low. I&apos;m hoping sales prices will eventually rise again.&quot; Two other major countries where house prices have dropped in recent years \u2013 Portugal, where the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors predicts more falls this year, and Ireland, where average values have plummeted from \u00a3265,750 in 2008 to \u00a3164,000 now \u2013 have not seen similar international interest in foreclosure sales, although they may do if price reductions accelerate. Meanwhile, the US is making the running as the new opportunity for Britons who still have an appetite for buy-to-let. At least those getting involved know there are possible downsides. Lynn Duggan says: &quot;I admit that I&apos;ve invested in a photograph of a house on a website. I&apos;m never going to see it and there must be some risks. No one wants to lose \u00a330,000 but an investment that size is not a disaster if it goes wrong. &quot;Detroit&apos;s lost its car industry but other businesses are starting up \u2013 electric cars and new technology. In 10 years&apos; time, who knows what the place will be like? It would be nice to make a profit if it comes back.&quot; The pitfalls of buying abroad Buying a home overseas is a minefield for the unwary as prices in many countries popular with Brits continue to slide.  In Bulgaria prices are 34% off 2008 highs. In Ireland prices are 31% down and values have dropped 10% in Portugal.  In Dubai prices fell 47% in 2010 alone according to estate agents Knight Frank, which says values are dropping in over half the 42 countries it monitors. In Spain there are also hundreds of disputes concerning the legality of homes. A British couple has been sentenced to eight months in jail and ordered to demolish their Costa del Sol villa for breaching regional planning regulations. David and Janet Hartshorn, who retired to Spain from Congleton, Cheshire, illegally built a house on protected land. Their sentence is expected to be suspended.  Experts advise would-be purchasers to follow a six-point plan to minimise risks: \u2022 Seek out estate agents who are officially registered or hold local licenses. \u2022 Use independent surveyors and lawyers familiar with the area where you are buying. \u2022 Research all costs - service charges, utility switch-on fees, responsibility for previous owners&apos; debts, local taxes and inheritance issues - before completing. \u2022 Never sign any deposit or purchase document that is not in English and which you have not discussed with your lawyer. \u2022 Set up a direct debit to pay bills on the property if they are not the responsibility of a tenant. It is often easier to open a bank account in the country of purchase. \u2022 If you rent out a property overseas consult an accountant or financial adviser - in some circumstances you may have to pay tax to UK and foreign authorities.", "title": "British buy-to-let investors cash in on repossessed US homes", "sentences": ["In Dubai prices fell 47% in 2010 alone according to estate agents Knight Frank, which says values are dropping in over half the 42 countries it monitors."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-30T00:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/30/sundance-festival-2011-review", "tags": ["Sundance film festival", "Festivals", "Film", "Culture"], "article": "Kevin Macdonald&apos;s documentary marvel, Life in a Day, is formed out of some 4,500 hours of material shot by film amateurs around the world and sent in to YouTube. There are images of striking beauty, tender and funny scenes. Nothing much newsworthy happened on 24 July 2010, but as a girl from Illinois whose footage closes the film says, something did happen. At Sundance, to make sure we didn&apos;t all think we&apos;d dreamed the whole thing up, 25 of the film-makers, from Chile, Bali, Ukraine, Dubai and indeed Britain sat on chairs and talked about the experience of seeing their work edited into a film. &quot;Life is different now,&quot; the girl from Illinois said. &quot;I feel different.&quot; In bad times, it&apos;s easy to snuggle within a reassuring notion of the past. Perhaps this accounts for the excess of admiration heaped on the deeply retro The King&apos;s Speech from both sides of the Atlantic. It certainly explains the dreary heritage fare to be found on TV. But there are braver, more ambitious ways of facing the worst than relying on tried and tested good feelings. In its own brave way, this is what Robert Redford&apos;s Sundance has done. Gone this year are the films slotted in to please powerful Hollywood interests. Instead of celebrities, one can encounter social entrepreneurs flown in to learn about the educative potential of media. In the Main Street eateries I heard many bemoan the new puritanism. My own feelings were distinctly less negative. After a week of jet-lagged blinking in the sharp Utah sunlight between screenings, I began to grasp the sheer scale of the Sundance ambitions. What I saw wasn&apos;t always reassuring, or even fun, but it had to do with the current state of the world. At Sundance, to my astonishment, I found I could learn about real things \u2013 and not just about the state of the American film business. Films by well-known directors are now excluded from the competitions, to make way for newcomers. Many offerings were dark, not evidently destined for success. Margin Call, a first film by JC Chandor, is set over one night and within a Wall Street dealing room. In order to avoid going under, the partners of a firm swindle their clients by unloading their worthless derivatives. Demi Moore does sterling work as a dim, treacherous, about-to-be-fired exec, and a cadaverous Jeremy Irons hilariously impersonates a haggard, cynical Brit at the top of this syndicate of thieves. In places the film sounds like a Marxist tract from the Depression, but one&apos;s interest is held by a brilliantly weary performance by a braces-wearing Kevin Spacey, urging his staff on as he prepares to sack them. Among other impressive debuts was The Guard, directed and scripted by John Michael McDonagh, and starring Brendan Gleeson as a foul-mouthed, bizarrely erudite local representative of the Garda. Sergeant Gerry Boyle gets a bad dose of the clap from girls described as &quot;Dublin hookers&quot;, buries his mother, and chases down drug smugglers in what appears to be a long, drunken weekend. The Ledge is a first film from Matthew Chapman, an expatriate Brit descended from Charles Darwin. Chapman&apos;s depiction of fundamentalist Christianity is harsh and on the money. Despite its good young cast (including the ravishing Liv Tyler as a reformed hooker and addict) the film was panned by critics, somewhat unfairly. Oprah Winfrey showed up to tell Sundancers that on her new cable channel she plans to do for documentary film what she did on her show for books. She might have added that Sundance has encouraged the tendency for documentary subjects to be used as fictional material. Documentaries about Irish bare-knuckle fighting and Bengali detectives were acquired by the festival last week in order to be turned into drama. Thanks to Sundance, the journey from fact to fiction has become easier. In 2004, Brazilian film-maker Jos\u00e9 Padilha brought a documentary about a Rio hijacking to Sundance. His latest film, Elite Squad 2, which chronicles the wars between factions of drug dealers, crooked cops and bent politicians in contemporary Rio, has been an astonishing box-office success in Brazil. It is as rough as The Wire, but more elegantly constructed. Its success at Sundance brings nearer the day when we shall be watching sophisticated films based on real political events from all over the world. Those who have been successful at Sundance tend to come back. Three years ago, James Marsh won two Sundance awards for Man on Wire, which went on to win an Oscar. His latest film, Project Nim, recounts the unhappy life of Nim the chimpanzee, who was taught sign language as part of a 1970s experiment. At first sight the documentary seemed to enter the familiar terrain of animal rights. But Marsh is more interested in the variety of delusions entertained by humans in their quest to share the planet with other species. Like an orphan out of Dickens, Nim was shipped from one neglectful human foster parent to another. Poor Nim never had a chance. Eugene Jarecki&apos;s long 100th-birthday film portrait of Ronald Reagan appeared to revel in its evocation of the Gipper&apos;s breezy folksiness, and his unassuming way with adversity. But the film became more critical when it moved from Reagan&apos;s Hollywood years to his controversial presidency. Reagan had been wrong, witnesses in the film suggested, in his all-American notion that there were no limits to possibilities, and that all you had to do was spend. The current adulation of Reagan, from the Tea Party and others, is absurd. Most of the liberal crowd agreed. But they seemed to balk at the notion, canvassed in a debate after the film, that to get elected progressive politicians must learn at least some of the great communicator&apos;s tunes. There are many festivals in Britain, each performing a valuable function, but none has the zest or cachet of Sundance, or indeed its ambitions. This year, a record six (of 20) feature films showing in competition in Park City came through the Sundance Institute&apos;s unique, 30-year-old workshop programme (the &quot;Sundance Labs&quot;), which helps emerging writers and directors develop scripts, and shoot and edit scenes, under the guidance of experienced mentors. A similar scheme exists for documentaries. No single organisation in Britain outside the BBC can set out to challenge the drift of culture, and appear to do so successfully. The Sundance Institute survives by means of donations from sponsors and donors such as the Ford Foundation and George Soros&apos;s Open Institute, with a budget of $25m a year. Within the next 10 years it aims to extend its reach globally. Isn&apos;t it time for our own Sundance?

It warned that Egypt&apos;s public finances could suffer if authorities respond to the crisis by raising wages or increasing subsidies on food and fuel. Credit Suisse believes that the Egyptian economy has already been hurt by the crisis. Analyst Jacqueline Madu said that the biggest immediate danger was a run on Egypt&apos;s banks, once the authorities allow them to open again. &quot;The central bank is unlikely to allow the banks to open, in our view, until some measure of calm is restored by the security forces. Once the situation calms down and the banks reopen, however, we would expect the central bank to provide enough [Egyptian] pound-liquidity to prevent a crisis. However, in so doing, we think the central bank will have to tread a fine line in order not to exacerbate the depreciation pressure on the pound,&quot; Madu said. Madu cut her forecast for Egypt&apos;s gross domestic product growth this year to 5%, down from a previous forecast of 5.8% and slightly slower than last year&apos;s 5.1% expansion. With tourism unlikely to recover soon, Credit Suisse believes Egypt&apos;s deficit will rise to 8.7% of GDP this year, up from 8.1% last year. This would push Egypt&apos;s national debt up to 76% of GDP. &quot;We expect that fiscal deficit and debt ratios will all deteriorate as growth slows and spending picks up due to the costs of re-building and maintaining security,&quot; said Madu.

The Tiger Woods Dubai, a $1.1bn golf and property development, was due to open in late 2009 but as the global financial crisis struck and property prices in the desert emirate crashed its opening was postponed several times. Dubai Properties, the government-controlled company behind the project, continued to insist throughout that the course would open sooner rather than later. In a statement today, however, the company confirmed it had suspended the project. &quot;This decision was based on current market conditions that do not support high-end luxury real estate,&quot; it said. &quot;These conditions will continue to be monitored and a decision will be made in the future when to restart the project.&quot; The company said it would maintain its commercial agreement with Woods and his organisation. No date was given for resumption of work on the golf course project, although with countless high-end developments being abandoned in Dubai last year, there are doubts that it will ever be completed. Reports today suggested a decision had been taken to stop watering the six holes that had been built \u2013 a move which means the property will return to desert within a matter of months. In November last year the Observer revealed construction work on the 292 residential properties had never started and that most of the staff employed at the development had been laid off months earlier. Those who remained were waiting for confirmation that the project was being allowed to &quot;return to nature&quot;. Over the last 10 years a number of golfers, including Ernie Els and Colin Montgomerie, have been paid to &quot;design&quot; high-end courses as the desert emirate sought to expand its tourist industry. Even by Dubai&apos;s gilded standards, the Woods-endorsed development was opulent with &quot;mansions&quot; and &quot;palaces&quot; for sale, some of them priced at $25m. The project was also to feature a boutique hotel and a Michelin-starred restaurant. Sources suggest that up to 30% of the properties on the development had been pre-sold, with buyers having put down a deposit to secure the purchase. It is not known what will happen to these deposits. Woods is reported to have received a $10m fee for &quot;designing&quot; the course, as well as royalties on real estate sales and his choice of mansion on the development once it was completed. The former world No1 \u2013 now ranked third \u2013 is due to travel to Dubai next week to play the Dubai Desert Classic. Woods made his first appearance of the 2011 season at the PGA Tour event in San Diego, where he finished a disappointing 44th. Afterwards, he was asked about the status of his Dubai project. &quot;It&apos;s been put on hold for right now. A lot of projects are out there,&quot; he told the Associated Press. &quot;It&apos;s still there. We&apos;ve got six completed holes and a few that were about to be grassed before construction was halted. Everything is on hold.&quot; In the 14 months since his infamous car crash outside his Florida home, Woods has endured a tough time on and off the course. He endured the first winless season of his career in 2010 and saw his form dip as he embarked on swing changes under a new coach, Sean Foley. He also lost many of his biggest commercial sponsors, including the American telecommunications company AT&amp;T and the financial firm Accenture.

A broadsheet editor determined to follow the trusted maxim: all power tends to corrupt, power point corrupts absolutely. I come from a family of journalists. So does my younger brother, Tony. Our father left school at 15 and started as a copy boy on the Leeds Weekly Citizen before graduating to Fleet Street and the BBC World Service. Frank Barber was a blunt, self-educated Yorkshire man, a dedicated sub-editor who never met a paragraph he couldn&apos;t cut. He regarded the news business not as a profession but as a vocation. My own route to journalism was more circumspect. At Oxford, a young man called Mark Thompson turned down an article I proposed for Isis magazine. Now I know why people complain about editorial bias at the BBC. After many - too many - job rejections, I won a place on the Thomson regional newspapers training scheme in Newcastle and several shorthand tests later joined the Scotsman in Edinburgh. Back in 1979, the Scotsman sold 91,000 copies. It carried a page of foreign news. 20 North Bridge, an imposing Victorian building overlooking Waverley station, housed printing presses which thundered through the night. It was also home to many fine journalists: reporters and editors such as Neal Ascherson, Chris Baur, Harry Reid, Jim Naughtie, and later Andrew Marr. Today, the Scotsman is a tabloid; it sells 45,000 copies and that page of dedicated foreign news has disappeared. North Bridge is now a five star boutique hotel with a gym, poetic justice for generations of journalists raised on cigarettes and whisky. As a cub reporter, I devoured books about journalism. One tome sticks in my mind because it sat for many years on my father&apos;s many bookshelves at home in London. Hugh Cudlipp&apos;s memoir Walking on the Water captured for me the thrill of the news business. The prose is economic, funny and splendidly irreverent. One paragraph toward the end of the book is particularly notable and quotable. &quot;Knowing what is going on is the lure of journalism. Explaining to vast audiences what is going on is the art. Influencing, or trying to influence, what is going on is the self-imposed mission.&quot; Cudlipp&apos;s dictum just about sums up my own credo, though I might quarrel with the last point about media influence, especially in the light of the latest, pressing questions about journalistic ethics in this country. I will return to that subject later. For the moment, I want to talk about the business of journalism today, specifically the role of the mainstream media, and my own experience as editor of the Financial Times for the past five years. The decline of the mainstream media may no longer be front page news, if it ever was; but the pace of decline remains relentless. Since 2004, the UK newspaper market has shrunk by more than 20%. The fall in circulation has affected broadsheets and tabloids alike. The News of the World, for example, still sells more than 3m copies every Sunday and remains a market leader, but that is one million fewer copies than 10 years ago. These figures largely reflect a western disease: the virus has yet to strike the world&apos;s biggest countries, China and India; and it is not true of many emerging countries such as Brazil, where the appetite for news in all forms is growing fast. Since 2005, for example, the number of paid-for Indian daily newspaper titles has surged to 2,700, according to the World Association of Newspapers. The circulation of Hindi papers rose from less than 8m in the early 1990s to more than 25m last year. Meanwhile, the total circulation of Brazilian newspapers has expanded by 1m over the past decade to 8.2m, with steamy tabloids among the biggest beneficiaries. The victims of mainstream media disease are often newspapers and broadcast news programmes with proud histories. Many have long enjoyed a publish-and-be-damned tradition of reporting stories which beyond doubt serve the public interest by exposing corruption, injustice or the abuse of office \u2013 precisely the kind of campaigning journalism in which Hugh Cudlipp revelled. In the US, where I worked as a foreign correspondent for 10 years, some of the best known metropolitan dailies, often with newsrooms comprising well over 500 or more journalists, have either died or are in intensive care. Metro papers such as the Los Angeles Times, the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Rocky Mountain News, and sadly the Washington Post. I say sadly because in the summer of 1985 I was lucky enough to spend three months on the Post&apos;s national staff, thanks to the Lawrence Stern fellowship, still going strong by the way after 32 years, and still a wonderful opportunity for an ambitious twenty-something reporter to work in a big American newsroom. Back in 1985, Ben Bradlee was editor. There was a swagger about the Post newsroom. Memories of the Watergate scandal were still fresh. So, incidentally, was the scandal of Janet Cooke, who won a Pulitzer prize for an elaborately concocted fake collage of an eight-year-old crack addict in the nation&apos;s capital. But that&apos;s another story. In hindsight, Watergate was a curse as well as a blessing for American journalism. The courageous reporting of the Post and the New York Times \u2013 coupled with the favourable Supreme Court rulings on publication of the Pentagon Papers \u2013 were landmarks for the interpretation of First Amendment rights and the freedom of the press. But they also encouraged the cult of celebrity and media self-absorption. In the words of Eric Alterman, as reporters became more sophisticated and respected, the top rank came to be regarded as the social equal of those people they were reporting on such as Senators and CEOs. Some came to identify more closely with their subjects rather than with their readers. In short, they joined the Establishment. The rise and fall of mainstream American journalism carries sobering lessons for those of us practising our craft here in Britain. First, I believe we have entered our own period of media self-absorption, driven partly by our industry&apos;s financial difficulties. Second, we have in recent years witnessed if not exactly a merger of the media and political class, certainly an increasingly intertwined relationship which, I suspect, does not necessarily serve the interest of either. Today, many members of the political elite in Britain have all worked in or with the media industry. David Cameron worked in a commercial TV company. Jeremy Hunt ran a publishing business. Michael Gove was a newspaper columnist. Boris Johnson was a magazine editor (and still writes a weekly newspaper column). Ed Miliband was a TV researcher. And Ed Balls was an editorial writer for the FT. This new social network in Britain may be more informal than formal, but it still comes across as far too cosy. Arguably, our elected representatives have become a tad too respectful toward broadcast and print media. Of course, this reverence may be a tribute to the fearless interviewers on the Today programme or to the Christmas culinary delights of the Brooks household. But excessive deference \u2013 even in an age where deference has become a dirty word \u2013 is unhealthy. As my FT colleague John Lloyd has written, and my old sparring partner Alastair Campbell would doubtless agree, it may also encourage the notion that the media is somehow an alternative establishment, enjoying as much or more popular legitimacy than MPs and ministers. My next point is less political, more economic. Thanks to the internet revolution, the advertising model which has sustained newspapers since Cudlipp&apos;s day is passing, or at least shrinking rapidly. This is particularly true of the classified advertising business which has now moved largely online. The American media commentator Clay Shirky summed up this historic shift in December 2009 on his blog. In an earlier age, he wrote, the barriers to entry meant that advertisers had no choice but to use newspapers to reach their customers. Shirky added: &quot;The expense of printing created an environment where Wal-Mart was willing to subsidize the Baghdad bureau. This wasn&apos;t because of any deep link between advertising and reporting, nor was it about any real desire on the part of Wal-Mart to have their marketing budget go to international correspondents. It was just an accident&quot; Baghdad bureaus, as we at the FT among other news organisations know, are very expensive. But so are Beijing, and Washington, and Moscow, and Berlin, and Paris, and Johannesburg. For the FT, which has more than 100 staff foreign correspondents, these bureaus are essential. They are part of the DNA of our news organisation. For others, they were once a vital source of news. Now, because of financial pressures and relentless cost cutting, they can be no longer for many sections of the mainstream media. So the foreign bureaus go \u2013 and a window on the world slams shut. In the summer of 2009, I modestly predicted that most major news organisations would be charging for content within 12 months. Charging, I argued, would not only plug the revenue gap; it would also help to re-establish value in their news product. This past year, pay walls have gone up around content that was previously free. News International has been a notable convert. This year, pay walls will appear around the content of the New York Times and, as the FT has reported, the Daily Telegraph too. The hope in this is that people will wish to continue to read the content that these organisations provide \u2013 and will subscribe. The risk is that they will simply go elsewhere \u2013 to a free news site, like the BBC \u2013 or indeed, any major broadcaster. For the BBC and others, a free website is an obvious and relatively cheap addendum to their main purpose of streaming news and entertainment on screen to a mass audience. In this respect, I was pleased to see that the BBC has at last begun to recognise the economic threat that BBC online poses to newspapers, particularly those in the regions. The sharp cuts in the BBC&apos;s online budget go some, if not all the way, towards redressing the balance. Further steps in this direction, including relaxing restrictions on cross media ownership in the provinces outside London, should be considered by the government. For those publications adopting pay walls, the strategy represents a big leap into uncharted territory. Those which remain free or substantially free, have another kind of hope: that the very large audiences they are able to garner through freely available content will boost sales \u2013 or at least slow the decline of the print edition. The other gamble for the free content camp is that they can gather sufficient advertising to provide the editorial budget which they need to sustain a major newspaper. New offerings such as online dating services may also boost the bottom line. Now it is true that digital revenues are increasing rapidly, albeit from a relatively low base. The question is whether the migration will occur in sufficient volume and at sufficient pace to compensate for the decline in print. For all these extenuating factors, the broader criticism is that the British newspaper industry has mismanaged its own decline. Yes, British broadsheets and tabloids have displayed eye-catching innovation compared to their stodgy US rivals. But they have essentially applied 20th century solutions such as new design, formats and aggressive marketing \u2013 to a 21st century problem, primarily fragmented audiences, new advertising platforms, and massive digital storage capacity through so-called cloud computing. In the age of the personal computer, the Mac or the iPad, people are more likely to identify themselves as enabled consumers rather than as passive readers of a daily newspaper. So what is the way forward for the news business and how has the Financial Times managed this perilous transition from print to digital? EVER since its foundation in 1888, the FT, with its roots in the City of London, has been a specialist newspaper not a general newspaper. Sir Gordon Newton, our greatest editor, who sat in the chair from 1949 to 1972, once defined the FT&apos;s mission as reaching those people who influence or seek to influence decisions in business, finance and public affairs around the world. This is indeed the essence of FT journalism. As our coverage of the global financial crisis shows, we connect the dots, between the sheikhs in Dubai, to the oligarchs in Russia, to the central banks in Beijing, Frankfurst, London and Washington. Now, we do not always hit the ball out of the park. Like many other news organisations, we were, with two notable exceptions, too slow to highlight the risks ahead of the bursting of the credit bubble. Commentators such as Martin Wolf and Gillian Tett correctly identified the dangers in global financial imbalances and exotic debt instruments such as credit default swaps. But we did not always give them quite the front or full page exposure they deserved. Overall, the challenge for all news organisations is to exploit the power of the brand across all platforms, from print to digital. The FT&apos;s strategy can be summed up in five points. First, we doubled the price of the newspaper on the retail stand in Britain and raised cover prices elsewhere around the world. The price hike had little impact on sales, but generated substantial extra revenue. More important, it sent a powerful signal to the market and to our own journalists that the FT was a premium product. Second, we rapidly developed our subscription business, both digitally on ft.com and in newspaper form. That way we reduced our dependence on the casual purchaser in favour of the loyal subscriber. Coincidentally, we shifted the terms of debate here in the UK away from the febrile confines of the monthly ABC circulation figures to a broader and more meaningful definition of audience, based on both print and digital consumers. Third, we swung firmly behind the principle of charging for content. At the height of the dotcom bubble, we havered between charging for business news while offering general news for free. In practice, the distinction, at least for FT readers, was meaningless. So we came up with an ingenious compromise. From 2007, we started charging for content based on a meter model. Users would be given a limited number of free articles to entice them into first registering and later signing up for subscription. Four years on, the meter model has proved to be an industry pioneer and an unequivocal success. FT.com now has more than 3.2m registered users and more than 200,000 paid subscribers. Other publications, including the New York Times, are now adopting or about to adopt similar meter models. Fourth, we abandoned or revised arrangements which allowed other news providers or aggregators to sell our content to third parties in return for a fee. In future, we determined, we would sell direct to our customers. And we would aggressively pursue any party seeking through cookies or sharing of password to gain access to our content for free. Yes, believe it or not, some people do still think there is free lunch with the FT. Fifth and finally, we made significant changes in the newsroom which complemented our commercial strategy. Back in 1999, the FT pioneered the concept of the integrated newsroom. We put all web journalists on the same contracts as print colleagues. And we required all journalists to work both for the print and digital channels. More than a decade later, we have a fully flexible and integrated news operation in which reporters and editors work seamlessly in print and online. These changes have put us in the best possible position to develop new niches, with more depth and focus to attract new audiences such as FT Alphaville, our award-winning financial blog or FT Tilt, our new emerging markets service, or our prize-winning iPad application which has brought in extra revenue and subscriptions. And, incidentally, I believe the tablet is the most exciting technological development in recent years, a game-changer because it has all the feel of a newspaper and the advantages of being a dynamic interactive device. Let me be very clear: The FT approach does not necessarily lend itself to being adopted by others. We have a distinct advantage because we are both a high-end niche product but with weight, global reach, and tradition. We live in a time of great experimentation. There are no universal media models, let alone silver-tipped bullets. Each news organisation must determine how to distinguish itself in an increasingly fragmented market, where the consumer is far more discerning and powerful than ever before. Technology cuts both ways. It allows third parties and journalists to slice and dice content to better fit the demands of the consumer. Technology allows the use of content to be measured according to traffic generated. This in turn means journalistic supply and, crucially, demand can be measured in real time. In theory, these advances threaten to undermine the traditional role of journalist as gatekeeper and arbiter of what constitutes news. In practice, the pass has already been sold. The question is what are the new terms of engagement, the new balance of power between the mainstream journalist and other non-traditional aggregators of news, analysis and commentary? Now there may be some in the audience who find it surprising for a newspaper editor to dwell so long on the business side of the news business. But in my judgement newspaper editors need to be actively involved in strategic decisions affecting the business. Many on the commercial side would appear to agree. In the past decade or more, many journalists with a background in business journalism have gone on to be national newspaper editors. Peter Stothard and Patience Wheatcroft, my old colleagues from the Sunday Times Business News section, as well as James Harding, Will Lewis and Robert Thomson from the Financial Times. I am tempted to suggest that the FT should henceforth be renamed the GE School of Journalism given the number of first-rate former FT journalists now occupying the commanding heights of British journalism. Of course, there will always be thick red lines between editorial and commercial. We at the FT are more than mindful of anything which could compromise the integrity of our journalism or our reputation, our most valuable asset. The case for close co-operation remains unanswerable. In these revolutionary times, I am tempted to quote Benjamin Franklin on the signing of the Declaration of Independence. &quot;We must all hang together or assuredly we will hang separately.&quot; Let me now turn to more current sources of controversy, notably the WikiLeaks phenomenon and the phone-hacking scandal. While each is very different and each raises important questions for public policy, there is a single common thread: the transformational power of technology which is rendering media laws and practice obsolete. First, a few words on the WikiLeaks affair. The two industrial scale data-dumps included vivid, if partial US military dispatches from the front-line in Afghanistan and Iraq followed by 250,000 classfied diplomatic cables from US embassies around the world. Set alongside each other, they look like the scoops of the century. But as both Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian and Bill Keller, editor of the New York Times, have recounted: managing the story and Mr Assange was far from straightforward. Keller describes Assange as a character out of a Stieg Larsson novel who was &quot;elusive, manipulative, volatile and ultimately openly hostile to the New York Times and Guardian.&quot; That will not surprise too many journalists accustomed to dealing with tricky sources, but in this case, other equally challenging ethical, legal and practical problems presented themselves. These included how to deal with a US government committed to protecting classified information; how to conduct a cross-border investigation encompassing other media organisations; and how to disentangle the newsworthy and compelling from tens of thousands of computer-stored data. In this respect, the Daily Telegraph&apos;s handling of its Westminster expenses scoop, while still a formidable logistical challenge, tends to pale by comparison. Both Keller and Rusbridger have done a public service by revealing the decision-making behind the WikiLeaks story. Demystifying the editorial process may offend the traditionalists, but at a time when all established institutions face calls for greater openness and transparency this is surely the right path forward. Keller&apos;s observation that Assange was primarily a source is highly pertinent. That plain fact should tamp down the fevered debate over whether WikiLeaks spells either the end of diplomacy or a new age of journalism. Like Keller, I believe it does neither. Cablegate caused enormous, if temporary embarrassment to the US government. Thanks to careful redaction on the part of the news organisations involved, there was little discernible damage to national security. (That may not have been the case with the earlier data where unredacted passages may have betrayed the identity of Afghan or Iraqi nationals assisting the American military occupation). So while official reprisals may still follow, I am inclined to side with my FT colleague Gideon Rachman who wrote, half tongue in cheek, that the Obama administration should pin a medal on Mr Assange. By and large, the cables revealed that what the US government reported in private was exactly what the US government said in public. As for WikiLeaks&apos; impact on journalism, I am again inclined to side with Keller. In his words, &quot;Long before WikiLeaks was born, the Internet transformed the landscape of journalism, creating a wide-open and global market with easier access to audiences and sources, a quicker metabolism, a new infrastructure for sharing and vetting information and a diminished respect for notions of privacy and secrecy.&quot; What WikiLeaks underlines is that, in a world where the sources of information are varied and multiple, journalism must do more than simply provide the first intimations of significant events, the first analysis of those events; the first commentary on their meaning. Journalism now needs to fulfil with renewed vigour an old task: that of aggregating and verifying sources. It must put the imprimatur of a trusted news organisation on those sources, assesss them for reliability, quality and context, and then pass them on to the readers. None of the above can substitute for deep and original reporting \u2013 to my mind the very core of quality journalism \u2013 but it should serve as one of the ordering principles for journalism in the internet age. However, and it is a big however, the task of aggregating and verifying multiple sources and data depends fundamentally on trust. Trust that the facts are accurate. Trust that appropriate weight has been given to context. And, make no mistake ladies and gentleman, trust in the journalistic profession is a scarce commodity. In her Reith lecture in 2002, Onora O&apos;Neill declared that &quot;deception is the real enemy of trust&quot;. O&apos;Neill highlighted how increased transparency \u2013 surely the most overused, most abused and most misunderstood word in the English language \u2013 did not lead to greater faith in public institutions. Harold Evans, who alongside Hugh Cudlipp must rank as one of the finest British newspaper editors of the post-war era, said the other day that deception may ultimately be justified in the pursuit of the public interest. But it must only be used in the most exceptional circumstances. The reason is that can be deeply corrosive not just to the newspapers bond with its readers but also to the body politic. In this respect, the Daily Telegraph&apos;s decision to dispatch two journalists posing as constituents to interview the business secretary Vince Cable falls into a very different category than its earlier scoop on MPs expenses. The latter story, though acquired for money and deeply damaging to the standing of the Westminster class, clearly met the public interest test; the first did not. It was nothing more than entrapment journalism. The Telegraph&apos;s conduct, while regrettable, pales by comparison with the phone-hacking scandal which has engulfed Rupert Murdoch and News International and jeopardised his bid to take full control of BSkyB, the highly profitable satellite TV channel. Full disclosure: I used to work for Rupert Murdoch. More than 25 years ago, I was a business reporter on the Sunday Times in London. I have nothing but admiration for how he took on the print unions and forced through change. He saved the British newspaper industry. Rupert Murdoch has been an innovator and a risk-taker all his life. Not just with BSkyB, which brought News Corporation to bankruptcy, but also with Fox News, colour printing presses and much else. The phone-hacking scandal marks a watershed \u2013 not just for News International but also for tabloid journalism. True, the practice of phone-hacking was widespread (and not only among the tabloids). The Information Commissioner&apos;s report in 2006 showed that 305 journalists used private investigators. The number may well have been higher. And yet, beyond the conviction of one News of the World journalist and one private investigator, the infamous Glenn Mulcaire, no serious action was taken against them; not by the police, not by the courts, and not by the Press Complaints Commission. The PCC was supine at best. And while the Metropolitan Police has now re-opened its inquiry, many questions remain about why it did not pursue the original News of the World investigation with sufficient rigour. Most important of all, the newspaper industry itself did not take the issue seriously or seek to establish the truth. Indeed, aside from the lead taken by the Guardian, which was followed by the FT, BBC and Independent, the rest of the newspaper industry took a pass on the News of the World phone-hacking story \u2013 almost certainly because they too were involved in &quot;dark arts&quot;. Indeed it took a foreign newspaper \u2013 the New York Times \u2013 to break fresh ground after an investigation lasting many months. For all that period and more, a conspiracy of silence ruled Fleet Street. As for News International itself, the management failed to follow the advice its newspapers would have given business or any other public figure in similar circumstances: own up rather than cover up, come clean rather than surreptitiously paying off aggrieved celebrities such as the publicist Max Clifford. The suspicion must remain that News Corporation assumed that it enjoyed enough power and influence in Britain to make the phone hacking controversy go away. Now, thanks to the overwhelming opposition of its news industry rivals to its bid for BSkyB, that influence is under threat as never before. News Corporation can argue, with some justification, that opposition to its BSkyB bid is motivated by base commercial interests rather than a high-minded concern over media plurality. Yet the concentration of broadcast and print power which would result from a fully combined BSkyB and News International&apos;s titles is troublesome, especially in the light of still unresolved questions about the extent of phone hacking at the News of the World. The bid deserves proper scrutiny by the authorities. Promises about editorial independence for Sky should be judged in the light of repeated assurances that the phone hacking was the work of a lone actor at the News of the World. In the final resort, failure to clean house at all news organisations would leave the mainstream media in Britain at risk of retribution in the form of statutory regulation. Many MPs are itching to retaliate for the humiliation of the expenses scandal, but statutory regulation would be a grave step in the wrong direction. Press freedom is woven into the fabric of our nation. We do not want to go down the same road as countries such as Argentina, Hungary and South Africa which have adopted or are about to adopt new laws curbing press freedom. Democracy, it should be remembered, is not just about holding elections. There is a case for rebalancing the right to privacy and the protections offered by Britain&apos;s overly onerous libel laws which are weighted in favour of the well-heeled plaintiff. But Westminster should also tread carefully with regard to privacy, lest the rich and famous, on and off the football field, become untouchable. More interesting, perhaps, would be to consider whether it is feasible to introduce curbs on newspaper bribery of employees or other institutions and organisations. This may not be unreasonable given the strictures on corporate behaviour laid down in the new Bribery Act, though I see tonight that the government is delaying enactment after lobbying by business. It would be infinitely more preferable, of course, for the profession to conduct a rigorous collective self-examination. Journalism is not perfect, nor was it ever meant to be. But we have allowed our standards to lapse. Let us hope we have not left it too late. Ladies and Gentlemen, whatever its current difficulties, the mainstream media in Britain has much to be proud of. Despite its preponderance of power in this country, the BBC remains a world-class brand. Its journalism is rightly ranked among the best. Rupert Murdoch remains one of the leading innovators in the news business. His drive to establish a new paid-for culture in the UK digital business deserves applause. And while Britain&apos;s popular press may be gossipy, raucous and sensationalist, it reflects at its best, the national mood and the aspirations of the majority of its readers, as Paul Dacre, one of Britain&apos;s most successful editors (and most influential moral arbiters) noted in an earlier Cudlipp lecture. Finally, as I mentioned at the beginning of this lecture, media companies across the emerging world are either being formed or are growing rapidly. British media companies could be exporting their brands, insights, talent and technology, just like the advertising business before them. As the FT discovered more than a century ago, there is a whole world out there to be explored. That&apos;s the new frontier in the business of journalism. Let&apos;s go for it!", "title": "Lionel Barber's Hugh Cudlipp lecture: the full text", "sentences": ["As our coverage of the global financial crisis shows, we connect the dots, between the sheikhs in Dubai, to the oligarchs in Russia, to the central banks in Beijing, Frankfurst, London and Washington."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-31T20:02:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/31/kabul-bank-losses-twice-admitted", "tags": ["Afghanistan", "World news", "Banking", "Business"], "article": "Kabul bank, once Afghanistan&apos;s largest, was known to have been struggling to recover $300m of loans to politically well-connected businessmen who frittered it away on disastrous investments, including Dubai&apos;s real estate bubble. But Mahmoud Karzai, the president&apos;s brother and a leading shareholder in\u00a0the disgraced bank, said there was an additional\u00a0$375m that investigators were trying to\u00a0retrieve. If true, the total amount owed exceeds the central bank&apos;s $400m bailout of Kabul bank last year, when revelations about the extraordinary dealings led to a run on the latter and the near collapse of Afghanistan&apos;s embryonic banking system. It will also re-ignite concerns about the viability of Kabul bank and whether anyone will face criminal charges, given how intertwined it had become with the government of Hamid Karzai. &quot;The first $300m has been acknowledged by borrowers and some repayments have been made,&quot; the president&apos;s brother said. &quot;But the rest are larger loans that they cannot pay because all the money is invested in these projects.&quot; Even though Mahmoud Karzai insisted that all the money could eventually be recovered, and some loans had already been repaid, his figure is lower than the one obtained by the New York Times. Citing information from US and Afghan officials, the newspaper says losses could be as high as $900m \u2013 a huge figure in an impoverished, war-shattered country with a GDP of $12bn. At a press conference today, Abdul Qadir Fitrat, governor of the central bank, denied the allegations, claiming that Kabul bank had loaned $540m of its assets. But an official at the banking regulator told the Guardian that in September Kabul initially asked the government for a $700m bailout from its foreign reserves, which would ultimately be paid for by ordinary Afghans through their taxes if the money was not recovered from bank borrowers. The central bank instead agreed to\u00a0 $200m in a bid to shore up confidence\u00a0of customers, who include most of Afghan soldiers and policemen. When that proved insufficient it lent another $200m. The request for $700m suggests that Kabul bank knew its liabilities were far higher than it chose to admit publicly. A former Afghan intelligence officer claimed that the $400m had already been &quot;stolen&quot; by some of the individuals involved. Forensic accountants have been employed to try to unravel the mess at the bank that for years was run by two of the least likely executives: its chairman Sherkhan Farnood, an international poker champion, and Khalilullah Frozi, a former gem dealer. One western official with knowledge of the case said it would be impossible to recover all the money, in part because of one of the scams allegedly employed by the bank to hide large loans that broke banking regulations. Instead of the total sum being in one person&apos;s name, it would allegedly be lent in smaller amounts to family members and in some cases domestic staff, although they never received any money. &quot;In some instance when the limit was exceeded they created false companies and people,&quot; said Mahmoud Karzai (pictured below). But he added that he believed that in many cases it was obvious who the real borrowers were. The investigators&apos; task is made all the harder by the political clout said to have been purchased by the bank through campaign contributions to his brother&apos;s re-election campaign in 2009. Although such allegations have been made before, including last year by the opposition leader Abdullah Abdullah who told the Guardian that a Kabul bank guest house was used as a place to buy the votes of MPs, an article on the website of the New Yorker magazine, headlined &quot;The Great Afghan Bank Heist&quot;, names former and current government ministers. The article quotes unnamed US officials saying that Omar Zakhilwal, the finance minister, &quot;was one of dozens of Afghan leaders and businessmen who, collectively, accepted tens of millions of dollars in gifts and bribes&quot; from the bank. Zakhilwal vigorously denied the claims, telling the Guardian that when he was approached by an offer of a personal donation of $200,000 to Hamid Karzai&apos;s re-election effort, he merely &quot;directed&quot; the money to campaign staff. The finance minister said the bribe allegations reflected anger among some sections of the international community over his recent efforts to tax foreign contractors. &quot;If anyone throughout my government career presents credible information that Kabul bank has bought me even a cup of coffee or a single penny from any business person, Afghan or foreign, I will submit my resignation,&quot; said Zakhilwal. Renewed allegations about high-level corruption could further weaken the Afghan president, who has lost much of his influence over the country&apos;s MPs after he was humiliatingly forced last week to inaugurate a new parliament in which his political enemies now predominate. In a further blow, Karzai&apos;s favoured candidate for speaker, a former warlord accused of human rights abuses called Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, failed to win election. From the US embassy cables Confidential cables in the most recent release of material by WikiLeaks show that US diplomats were concerned about the bank long before it almost collapsed last September. These concerns included the bank&apos;s alleged use of depositors&apos; cash to subsidise an airline it owned in an attempt to put rival carriers out of business. In a February 2010 cable the US embassy warned that Kabul bank was the least liquid bank operating in Afghanistan and it was &quot;highly exposed to the Dubai property market&quot;. The fact that the bank would often delay paying government workers&apos; salaries for two weeks was an indication that it was strapped for cash and using the salaries to collect interest, the cable said. It routinely ignored orders from the central bank, in theory the main regulator of commercial banks, telling it to phase out &quot;lottery&quot; accounts designed to entice depositors with the promise of winning a cash prize. The bank, the cable revealed, was also planning to build a multimillion-dollar headquarters in Kabul with &quot;three office towers encased in bulletproof glass&quot; that would include three underground garages, a waterfall and a rotating restaurant on top.", "title": "Kabul bank's losses twice the $300m admitted, says Karzai's brother", "sentences": ["Kabul bank, once Afghanistan&apos;s largest, was known to have been struggling to recover $300m of loans to politically well-connected businessmen who frittered it away on disastrous investments, including Dubai&apos;s real estate bubble.", "In a February 2010 cable the US embassy warned that Kabul bank was the least liquid bank operating in Afghanistan and it was &quot;highly exposed to the Dubai property market&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-31T22:00:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/03/dubai-carnival-crowded-house-ben-cecil", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Horse racing tips", "Sport"], "article": "This week&apos;s Meydan card is one of the best ever in Dubai outside of the World Cup meeting, with three Pattern races, including the Group Three Al Maktoum Challenge Round Two over a trip just short of that run in the World Cup itself.

He may need the run, though, and preference tonight is for the 2008 Racing Post Trophy winner Crowded House (6.10).

He held Inxile readily on that occasion and is the one to beat again. Sangaree, Grade One placed for Bob Baffert in America, is also worth keeping an eye on. The seven-furlong Meydan Classic trial has attracted a decent field of three years olds. The classy Roayh (3.00), the pick of Frankie Dettori, looks to have the edge over Energia Carioca, a gritty winner over this trip on the Tapeta last time but who connections feel is better on turf. Bin Suroor also has three live chances in the 1400-metre turf handicap with Dettori&apos;s mount Colonial overlooked in favour of the Ted Durcan-ridden Quit Wit (5.35), a winner of three of his five starts, who scrapes in off an appealingly light weight. The closing 10-furlong turf handicap is a fascinating affair, with Here To Win and Haatheq respected after good runs last time, while Eduardo Martin&apos;s Hot Six (6.45) ran on pleasingly over an inadequate trip last time and should offer more value.

Beyond The Rails, the TV programme billed as racing&apos;s answer to Top Gear, will get a very low-key first airing today when sample footage is used to demonstrate 3D televisions in shops across East Anglia. Customers of Hughes Electrical will be the first viewers to get a look at the new venture, whose producers hope there is an untapped global audience for a show that tries to mix sporting thrills with the glamour of international travel. It will offer, they claim, the world&apos;s first 3D footage of horse racing and will bring the sport to a broader audience. But shooting the sport for the new medium is far from straightforward, as was revealed by a test last autumn at Kranji racecourse in Singapore, using cameras borrowed from the latest Jet Li movie. &quot;At the moment, the 3D rigs are huge,&quot; says Ted Bather, chairman of Rainshine, the producing company. &quot;You need two cameras, they&apos;re very bulky and we&apos;ve been testing how close we can get them to the track. They also require very good light, but horses don&apos;t like strong light, they don&apos;t like bulky things looming over them. &quot;Over the next two to three months, there will be another generation of 3D cameras coming on to the market which will be lighter, more portable, much easier to use, that will enable us to deliver the kind of content we&apos;re seeking. The quality of cameras is improving dramatically and in a couple of years it&apos;ll be much easier.&quot; But Bather has no intention of putting the project on hold to wait for better technology. He hopes to give his cameras a second outing during the Dubai carnival meeting at Meydan next week. &quot;The light is rather nice in Dubai at this time of year,&quot; he says. He is less complimentary about the general quality of light in Singapore, but the Guardian has donned a pair of 3D glasses to get a sneak preview of the Kranji footage and it is impressive nonetheless. The trackside shots of runners breaking from the stalls are dramatic and the technology shows its worth when a horse jogs past after a race, sending great flecks of foamy sweat flying out towards the viewer. &quot;I do think [racing] doesn&apos;t film well in 2D,&quot; says Bather. &quot;You lose the muscularity, the speed of movement. People who aren&apos;t into horses, when they&apos;ve seen our footage, they&apos;ve all said, &apos;wow.&apos; &quot; But Bather cannot yet offer a date when the British public will get to decide its reaction. &quot;We&apos;ve spent the last nine months testing the equipment and the format in order to be able to hit a viable price-point. We&apos;re just starting conversations with a number of broadcasters.&quot; The number of broadcasters around the world offering 3D programming, and the number of households capable of viewing same, remain limited, but Bather says he expects imminent growth in both areas and hints at a new 3D channel trying to start up in Britain before the royal wedding in April. He may make the first complete edition of Beyond The Rails at Sha Tin, Hong Kong, that month. At the latest, he hopes to begin at Kranji in May. When they finally see it, committed racing fans may feel that Bather&apos;s show is not aimed solely, or even mainly, at them. &quot;Our model is not to follow a [complete] race,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;ll show an event,&quot; meaning the race-meeting as a whole, &quot;and the human-interest stories around it.&quot; He says Beyond The Rails will be &quot;very travelogue-y&quot; and will have &quot;reality elements&quot;. Publicity material describes celebrities being given a small amount of money and being challenged to get to that month&apos;s main international race-meeting by whatever means they can. Bather&apos;s target is an audience beyond the heartland. &quot;It&apos;s a funny old sport, people are either really into it or they ignore it. We&apos;re trying to show why so many rich and famous people are gripped by it.&quot; In the meantime, broadcasters are receiving his trailer, which could hardly be accused of underselling the sport. &quot;More muscular than muscle cars \u2026 or muscle egos&quot; says the throaty voiceover as shots of Formula One cars are followed by Premier League footballers. &quot;It&apos;s addictive adrenaline, debonair and dashing.

Reporters from a number of media organisations, including CNN&apos;s Anderson Cooper and the BBC&apos;s Jerome Boehm, were targeted yesterday and earlier today as supporters of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak continued their attacks against anti-government protesters. Western broadcasters, including ITN and the BBC, today joined the Arabic networks in warning about the running battles taking place in and around Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square. Jonathan Munro, the deputy editor of ITV News, told the Guardian that the safety of its reporters was at the &quot;forefront of all our minds&quot; in discussions on how to cover the protests. &quot;Whenever we work in a volatile region, we take safety very seriously,&quot; he said. Channel 4 News reported today that Mubarak&apos;s &quot;secret police&quot; were threatening journalists to keep away from the streets of Cairo. Jonathan Rugman, Channel 4 News&apos;s foreign correspondent, tweeted earlier today: &quot;One journalist punched in face, another stabbed in leg by pro-Mubarak thugs in Cairo this morning. On their way to hospital now.&quot; Jon Snow, the broadcaster&apos;s chief news anchor, added: &quot;Media hotel [is] suffering Mubarak thugs attacking all our attempts to get out to report.&quot; Reuters said one of its television crews was beaten up early today close to Tahrir Square while filming a piece about shops and banks being forced to shut during the clashes. David Degner, a Cairo-based photographer, said five of his journalist friends has been &quot;beaten and had their equipment confiscated&quot; as clashes between the two groups escalated. Press freedom groups warn that reporting on the Egyptian uprising is becoming increasingly perilous as the number of journalists injured and arrested continues to rise. &quot;Starting yesterday we saw a surge phase in attacks against journalists,&quot; said Mohamed Abdel Dayem, the Committee to Protect Journalists&apos; Middle East and North Africa programme co-ordinator. &quot;This is like a return to the first phase, before the censorship, but far more violent and universal. They are now targeting anybody with a camera, notepad, anybody interviewing people \u2013 anyone will get violently attacked, anyone they could get their hands on. If you&apos;re a journalist in Egypt at this late stage in the game, they don&apos;t care if you&apos;re from Mars \u2013 they&apos;re going to come after you.&quot; Munro, who has ITV News colleagues reporting from Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square, said: &quot;When deciding who to send to Egypt, we chose some of our most experienced reporters, producers and cameramen, and asked one of our senior news editors to run the operation there. &quot;They are all used to operating in difficult conditions. Their safety is the first thing we consider when we&apos;re looking at the day&apos;s newsgathering, and it remains at the forefront of all our minds as we discuss how to cover the moving story.&quot; Arabic language news channels al-Jazeera and al-Arabiya appear to have suffered some of the worst of the attacks. Pro-government protesters charged the Dubai-based Al-Arabiya news network&apos;s Cairo office yesterday afternoon. Several of its staff were left bloodied and beaten in the assault, and its correspondent Ahmed Abdullah had to be taken to a nearby hospital with severe head injuries. Dan Nolan, al-Jazeera&apos;s United Arab Emirates correspondent, said the there was &quot;so much anti-Jazeera sentiment&quot; among the president&apos;s supporters that it was &quot;not safe to be outside&quot; for the broadcaster&apos;s reporters. Cooper, CNN&apos;s star reporter based in Cairo, described how he was &quot;roughed up by thugs&quot; late yesterday in the pro-Mubarak crowd. &quot;It was pandemonium. There was no control. Suddenly a man would come up to you and punch you in the face,&quot; he said. Cooper&apos;s CNN colleague, Hala Gorani, today recounted the incident: &quot;I got slammed against the gates and was threatened by one of the pro-Mubarak protesters who was telling me to &apos;get out, get out!&apos;. The pro-Mubaraks, whoever they are, whoever sent them, are being threatening toward camera crews, journalists, anybody who looks like they may be onlookers.&quot; The leaders of France, Germany, the UK, Italy and Spain today said they view the &quot;deterioration&quot; of the situation in Egypt with &quot;extreme concern&quot;. The attacks on foreign media, which have mostly taken place in and around Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square, were &quot;unacceptable&quot;, the leaders added in a joint statement. \u2022\u00a0To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

This is why I do this \u2013 so the neighbours come out, double-take and go, &quot;What the...?&quot; Ha. Well, you\u00a0know, business has been going pretty well lately. These wheels are worth more than \u00a365,000\u00a0with the extras. What do you mean, it looks like a Vauxhall Insignia? Cheeky. So, where to go in a car worth more than \u00a365,000. Well, nowhere initially, if\u00a0you&apos;re me and my girlfriend. It&apos;s like\u00a0a stately frigging home inside, and so much warmer and more comfortable than our own front room. So we spent the evening parked on our shabby north-west London street, taking turns to run back to reality for another bottle of Pouilly Fum\u00e9 or more olives. And when we got bored with pressing buttons and sniffing the leather, we watched TV. Big Cat Diary would have been good, but there&apos;s no BBC, so we watched something about sharks on Channel 4 instead. The weekend came, and we decided it would be appropriate to motor to the English countryside for\u00a0lunch. The journey started brilliantly. The Jag was a joy \u2013 it purred, then roared, when told to. The performance is extraordinary for a diesel. And Elgar via a Bowers &amp; Wilkins 1,200-watt premium sound system and 20 speakers is intensely moving. Yes, I know Jaguar is Indian-owned now, but bhangra would have been wrong. Then the snow came. Not just snow \u2013 this was the Big Dump a week or so before Christmas. We were on the M40, going up a gentle incline. And suddenly we weren&apos;t going anywhere, stuck by the side of\u00a0the road. I promise you, there&apos;s nothing I could have done about it. The combination of big car, rear-wheel drive, automatic transmission and highly sophisticated traction control means this car is absolutely useless in the snow. Even with the traction control off, it simply wouldn&apos;t move. It wasn&apos;t just us: all the big Mercs and BMWs were paralysed, while Fords and Fiats nipped by. Snow inverts the social hierarchy. So what to do in a situation of such seriousness? We watched Friends. And eventually a nice man in a 4x4 towed us off the motorway. There we abandoned \u00a365,000-worth of car in the middle of nowhere and walked through the snow to a village with a hotel. One unscheduled minibreak. In Stokenchurch. The following day the car was still there, and we managed to get it back on the road, which had been gritted. And we just about got home, not purring, certainly not roaring, more like whimpering. And then, when we needed to go to the supermarket, we took the old Polo, to be sure of getting there. Guess where we spent the evening though?

The marriage of international literary stars with local and expat audiences in exotic locations has inspired an unprecedented surge in book tourism, from Shanghai to Byron Bay, Australia. In Jaipur last month, for instance, you could bump into JM Coetzee, Richard Ford, Martin Amis and Candace Bushnell. With the export of festival UK, ambitious writers today are advised to carry a pen and a passport. The importance of this phenomenon is marked by the way successful festivals are getting bogged down in politico-cultural controversy. In 2009, in Dubai, there was a row about medieval censorship. Last week, in Jaipur, the organiser, William Dalrymple, was accused of neocolonialism, promoting English and American writing at the expense of Indian culture, a charge he swatted as if it were a lazy mosquito. A few hundred miles further south, in Sri Lanka, the Galle literary festival was also caught up in politics. The brutal regime that crushed the Tamil insurgency is rightly charged with repressing, &quot;disappearing&quot; and allegedly killing journalists. So Galle was accused of collaborating with an enemy of free speech. The Booker-shortlisted South African novelist Damon Galgut pulled out. Last weekend I attended the Galle festival as a guest. It would be difficult to miss the military tenor of Sri Lanka&apos;s government, but this friendly week of books and conversation in a world heritage site on the south-western tip of a magical island is also a showcase of international literary values and a haven of benign civility. Far from being the dupe of a dreadful regime, Galle represents the best of the amateur principle and provides an impressive voluntary programme of social and cultural renewal. First, just as Hay reflects the personality of its founder, Peter Florence, so Galle is made in the image of its creator, Geoffrey Dobbs. You might mistake him for a character from an Evelyn Waugh novel; actually, he is a courageous cultural entrepreneur who, like Dalrymple in Jaipur, is not afraid to stand up to cant. He started the Galle festival, singlehanded, and has worked tirelessly to raise audiences and sponsorship, develop local literary workshops and promote education. As well as attracting literary superstars, from Colin Thubron to Germaine Greer, the festival has championed local writers and addressed Sri Lankan issues. This year, there was a session, covered by BBC reporter Bridget Kendall: &quot;After the Shock: the Lingering Legacy of Civil War&quot;. The locals turned up in force. If you read Jon Lee Anderson in the New Yorker, you will know that President Mahinda Rajapaksa is an exceedingly brutal dictator. However, his people are not yet cowed into silence. Galle is obviously a world away from the 30-year war with the Tamil Tigers, but it has also known tragedy. The 2004 tsunami struck this corner of Sri Lanka with particular ferocity. Despite massive reconstruction, the coast road from Colombo still takes the visitor past ghost villages. The formerly Dutch Galle fort, protected by 17th-century stone ramparts, was unscathed. It remains an oasis of colonial history and is the focus of the festival. So the Galle festival has been at the heart of the socio-cultural renewal of a shattered community. Amid the oppressive gloom of Sri Lankan politics, it looks like a beacon of hope, optimism and good taste that will, with a bit of luck, shine for years to come. No one should mistake it for Sri Lankan reality, but at least it offers a little bit of literary freedom unintimidated by President Rajapaksa&apos;s autocratic regime.", "title": "Out of Sri Lanka's trials comes a beacon of hope", "sentences": ["In 2009, in Dubai, there was a row about medieval censorship."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-06T00:05:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/06/racehorse-slaughter-animal-welfare", "tags": ["Animal welfare", "Horse racing", "Sport", "Animals", "UK news", "World news"], "article": "Philip Larkin immortalised them in his poem At Grass. Old racehorses, their victories long forgotten, &quot;stand anonymous again&quot;. The retired racehorses, Larkin claimed, &quot;have slipped their names, and stand at ease, or gallop for what must be joy&quot;. But for many horses the prospect of spending their final days in &quot;unmolesting meadows&quot; is little more than fantasy. New figures released by the government show that last year the total of all horses and ponies slaughtered for meat in England, Scotland and Wales rose to 7,933, representing a 50% increase on the average number slaughtered in previous years. &quot;A lot of that increase, at least half, will be thoroughbreds,&quot; said Dene Stansall, an adviser to Animal Aid, a charity that campaigns against the use of animals in sport. Stansall said a huge increase in the number of foals born to supply the racing industry, up from around 5,000 in 1960 to almost 19,000 a couple of years ago, was the main factor driving the slaughter of horses. A spokesman for the British Horseracing Authority hit back at this claim. &quot;The official figures, specifically in relation to Britain, simply do not back this up,&quot; he said. &quot;It should be borne in mind that Animal Aid campaigns against horseracing and is on the record as saying it would like to see racing banned. This claim should be seen in that context.&quot; Some racehorses will cease competing after three or four years, others will go on until into their teens, yet they can live for up to 30 years, so many will have decades ahead of them once they stop racing. The foal oversupply is particularly acute in Ireland where there is an eight-week wait for horses to be slaughtered, resulting in a growing number being shipped to the UK to be shot and then bled. The slaughter figures tell only part of the story. Many horses are sent to knackers&apos; yards or turned into meat to feed hunt dogs, according to Animal Aid. Finding the horses a home after they have raced is difficult, as cash-strapped families are also abandoning their animals, placing acute pressures on sanctuaries. &quot;The current recession has now added to an already critical situation and is starting to reflect heavily on the re- homing process of this sanctuary,&quot; said Graham Oldfield, of the Racehorse Sanctuary in West Sussex. Roly Owers, chief executive of World Horse Welfare, said vets were reporting a rise in owners wanting their horses put down. &quot;If an animal is older and perhaps not in the best health it may be better to have it kindly put to sleep than to sell or pass it on, when you don&apos;t know what kind of home it may go to, or whether it will end up in the meat market.&quot; However, with each racehorse costing around \u00a35,000 to look after per year, sending them to slaughterhouses is becoming an attractive option for owners who cannot sell them on. In 2009, Stansall estimated about 50% of racehorses in Ireland and 30% in England were failing to sell at auction. That proportion is expected to have risen last year. Virtually all of the meat from horses slaughtered in the UK is exported to the rest of Europe, as it is still highly prized in some countries. &quot;Racehorses are always well stuffed with grub,&quot; Stansall said. &quot;They are lean-looking animals, but don&apos;t get deceived by their thin legs. Look at the rump, there is lots of flesh.&quot; He cited the fate of Capped For Victory, an eight-year-old once owned by Sheikh Maktoum Rashid al-Maktoum, the late ruler of Dubai, as that which typically befalls old racehorses. Imported from the US to Britain, where he raced 17 times, the horse was given away free at the end of his racing career. Within days of finishing 10th out of 12 runners in his final race, Capped For Victory had been killed, although how he died is unclear. &quot;Whether or not he was rendered down or turned into meat I don&apos;t know,&quot; Stansall said. &quot;But his meat carcass value would have been worth around \u00a3600.&quot; Corran Ard, a prize-winning nine-year-old gelding, was retired from racing last year and was due to be slaughtered in France. He was saved at the last minute when an animal rights campaigner spotted him for sale on a website. Animal charities accuse the racing industry, which races about 8,000 horses a year, of not doing enough to look after the animals once they have finished racing. However, the industry has been proactive in trying to secure homes for old racehorses. It pays for about 200 horses a year to be rehabilitated so that they can be ridden conventionally, although the process is expensive. Financial pressures plaguing the racing industry are also being blamed. Many betting companies are locating offshore to avoid having to pay tax. As some of this tax has traditionally been distributed back across the racing industry, some trainers and owners are struggling to turn a profit. &quot;There&apos;s a major crisis,&quot; Stansall said. &quot;You&apos;ve probably got, say, 13 horses in a race at Wolverhampton or Southwell running for less than \u00a32,000 prize money for first place. As a result there&apos;s been a big increase in horses abandoned.&quot; A BHA spokesman rejected this claim as without foundation. Even valued horses can suffer this fate. Lady Margaret, who raced five times in a season and went into breeding as a brood mare, giving birth to three thoroughbred foals, died in 2010 aged 14 due to injuries caused by neglect. Figures from the British Horseracing Authority show the recession is starting to have an impact on the breeding of thoroughbred horses, with the number of new foals being registered in Britain declining 23% between 2008 and 2010. The BHA pointed to its own slaughter figures, based on official Food Standards Agency returns, of British-born horses registered with an independent company, Weatherbys. These showed 499 racehorses were slaughtered in 2010, a drop of 9% on the previous year. A total of 340 British-born and registered racehorses were slaughtered for meat in 2008. The BHA figures do not include thoroughbreds born abroad, chiefly in Ireland, that have never been in training in Britain or horses lost in the tracking system. According to a BHA submission to parliament in 2009: &quot;Thoroughbreds that have never raced are also killed in abattoirs; our initial analysis shows around 800 such animals in England, Scotland and Wales were in that category last year and a considerable proportion of these will be former breeding stock.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 17 February 2011 to include quotes and figures from the British Horseracing Authority.", "title": "'Record' number of thoroughbreds being slaughtered for meat", "sentences": ["Look at the rump, there is lots of flesh.&quot; He cited the fate of Capped For Victory, an eight-year-old once owned by Sheikh Maktoum Rashid al-Maktoum, the late ruler of Dubai, as that which typically befalls old racehorses."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-06T00:07:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/feb/07/atletico-madrid-gil-marin-quique", "tags": ["La Liga", "European club football", "Football", "Sport", "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"], "article": "Miguel-Angel Gil Mar\u00edn does so love it when a plan comes together. Which might just explain the permanently bewildered look on the face of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid&apos;s chief executive, majority shareholder and son of former Godfather Jes\u00fas Gil y Gil. Gil Mar\u00edn, after all, is the man for whom plans don&apos;t so much come together as fall apart. This is the genius who celebrated the club&apos;s centenary by commissioning rough-voiced folk singer Joaqu\u00edn Sabina to write a special hymn \u2013 only to be forced to ditch it because of an argument over copyright and to watch his side capitulate to an oddly appropriate defeat against Osasuna. That day, Atl\u00e9tico chose a Stones track instead: You Can&apos;t Always Get What You Want. And, although he keeps avoiding what he really deserves, Gil Mar\u00edn can&apos;t. He celebrated Kids&apos; Day, complete with face-paints, free tickets and bouncy castles, by securing a 4-2 home defeat against a side that had not won away all season, thus securing a whole new generation of supporters \u2013 for Real Madrid. And he set up last weekend&apos;s game against Athletic Bilbao as a celebration of 100 years of wearing red and white striped shirts, a chance to reconcile fans and clubs, his coach calling it a game for happiness, &quot;an amnesty&quot; \u2013 only for his players to prove unworthy of the shirt, capitulating again as supporters departed early chanting: &quot;We&apos;re sick of the Gil family.&quot; But this weekend, a plan did at last come together, with a little help from FC Barcelona, who now have the best record in Spanish football history. On Saturday night, Pep Guardiola&apos;s side defeated Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 3-0 with a hat-trick from Leo Messi, taking them to 16 successive league wins, a new La Liga record which allowed them to overtake Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano&apos;s Real Madrid team of 1960-61 and maintain a seven-point lead at the top. It also meant Atl\u00e9tico Madrid have now gone four games without a goal. Gil Mar\u00edn knew Atl\u00e9tico Madrid would lose at Camp Nou. In a weird sort of way, he also wanted them too. Which is why what might have happened last week might instead happen this week. As for what really needs to happen at Atl\u00e9tico \u2013 the departure of Gil Mar\u00edn and Cerezo \u2013 don&apos;t hold your breath. Last Sunday, as fans trudged away from the Calder\u00f3n in the pouring rain, they sang &quot;\u00a1Gil, cabr\u00f3n fuera del Calder\u00f3n!&quot; (&quot;Gil, you arsehole, get out the Calder\u00f3n!&quot;). And nothing makes a president or an owner&apos;s finger twitch like the fact that fans&apos; fingers might, at last, be pointing his way. And so it was that Gil Mar\u00edn decided that it was probably time to get rid of the coach Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores. Only it wasn&apos;t a very good time. What was the point, he reasoned, of getting a new coach in and burning him with a defeat at Camp Nou? Better to let Quique take that hit too and leave him to play for his job the following weekend \u2013 this Saturday \u2013 against his former club Valencia. Better to postpone it a week; better to give him one last chance. Safe in the knowledge that if he doesn&apos;t take it, you have the perfect excuse; and if he does, you can pretend you never planned anything of the sort. Now, you might be thinking that&apos;s ridiculous. After all, Quique Sanchez Flores was the man who Atl\u00e9tico chose to bring in just over a year ago. The man who finally brought the club some unity at last, brought through youth-teamers David De Gea and Alvaro Dom\u00ednguez, and performed what he described as a &quot;mental cleansing&quot; at the club. He was the man who took inspiration from the basketball coach Phil Jackson&apos;s book Sacred Hoops: Spiritual Lessons of a Hardwood Warrior \u2013 a book that talks of a &quot;Zen Christian attitude of self-awareness&quot;, dismissing anger as a weed and hate as the tree. The man, above all, who won the Europa League and the European Super Cup: the first coach to win anything in 14 years and the first to clinch a European trophy in nearly half a century. The man who took his side to a Copa del Rey final. But then Quique Sanchez Flores was, despite protestations to the contrary, Atl\u00e9tico&apos;s ninth choice as coach and his record was not what it appears to be. Atl\u00e9tico lost 23 times last season, Quique won only a third of his games and his team reached the final of the Copa del Rey having faced just one first division side \u2013 Racing Santander. They played in the Europa League by virtue of being desperately bad in the Champions League but not quite bad enough to actually finish bottom of their group and got through three rounds on away goals. They won just two in eight \u2013 and one of those was against Fulham. Their European record last year stood at: won two, drawn eight, lost four. That&apos;s relegation form. And yet they won the Europa League. Then their defeat of Inter in the European Super Cup raised expectations. Unrealistically. Atl\u00e9tico were top for two weeks. But they should have known they had no chance of staying there when Marca&apos;s editor Eduardo Inda described them as the Third Way \u2013 a Third Way only marginally less meaningless and baseless than Tony Blair&apos;s. Atl\u00e9tico are 31 points off the top. &quot;If we don&apos;t get into the Champions League it would be a failure,&quot; claimed Cerezo. This morning Atl\u00e9tico are eighth \u2013 14 points off a Champions League place. They are out of Europe, defeated by giants Aris Salonica, and out of the Copa del Rey. They are also only nine points off the relegation zone. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s time to look up, not down,&quot; as one Atl\u00e9tico reporter put it last night. Quique Sanchez Flores&apos;s first 50 games in charge are the worst in the club&apos;s history. Of those who have even made it to 50 games that is. Since then, he has lost twice more. He has lost more times than he has won as Atl\u00e9tico coach. Atl\u00e9tico&apos;s defenders continue to play on roller skates; Luis Perea&apos;s legs seem to have been attached by someone who read the instructions incorrectly; Felipe Luis and Diego God\u00edn, the summer signings and good players, have caught the bug. Dom\u00ednguez has disappeared. Even De Gea looks wobbly \u2013 and at 19 he&apos;s entitled to. There is no one to run the game, no one to create, and Diego Forl\u00e1n looks utterly bored and uninterested, all too willing to talk of a future elsewhere, a victim of his own honesty and an alarming drop in form \u2013 last weekend he was whistled when he was taken off; this weekend he did not even start. Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda is a useful scapegoat \u2013 not least because he really isn&apos;t very good. Quique has not once used the same starting XI in two successive league games since he took over. The style changes, the personnel changes. Every week. As for that Zen-Christian stuff, the squad is divided. Quique, says one player, &quot;has little or no support&quot;. The fans, quite rightly, have had enough. There is no institutional support and the knives are out in the press. There is no faith or confidence. &quot;I am scared of us going into a downward spiral,&quot; said Enrique Cerezo this morning, &quot;I&apos;m scared of us giving up.&quot; No wonder Quique talked about enduring moments when he felt &quot;genuinely fragile&quot; and &quot;feared for my health&quot;. And that&apos;s the thing: it is not Quique&apos;s fault. At least not only his fault. Just as it was not the fault of the 17 other coaches Miguel-Angel Gil Mar\u00edn has employed since 1996, none of whom won a thing. The club falls apart around him. Cerezo and Gil Mar\u00edn, the two majority shareholders, president and chief executive respectively, barely talk. They deliberately take contradictory decisions just to wind each other up. When Gil Mar\u00edn recently noted that he had turned down a huge offer for Sergio Ag\u00fcero, all he did was create tension around the club. When Cerezo returned from Miami, where he was celebrating Enrique Cerezo Day, all he could do is roll his eyes and mutter: &quot;This wouldn&apos;t have happened if I was here,&quot; like nothing stupid ever happens on his watch. Sim\u00e3o Sabrosa left, Jurado left and two players who no one is convinced by \u2013 El\u00edas and Juanfran \u2013 replaced them. Forl\u00e1n would have gone too but Spurs could not agree personal terms with him. When Atl\u00e9tico made a big noise about Ag\u00fcero&apos;s new deal, few missed the fact that his buyout clause has gone down not up, with Real Madrid sniffing round. And rather than declaring eternal love and claiming that &quot;I will be here as long as Atl\u00e9tico want me here&quot;, Aguero said: &quot;I&apos;ll leave when I want to.&quot; Sadly, few doubt that he will want to soon enough. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are more than \u20ac100m in debt and soon they won&apos;t even have the thing that makes them special: identity. They are moving to a new stadium on the opposite side of town. Another season is in danger of drifting away at best or becoming a battle for survival at worse. And saddest of all, the greatest success the club enjoyed in more than a decade seems to have been completely forgotten already. But don&apos;t worry because Gil Mar\u00eda has a cunning plan: sack the coach. Again. At the end of December, Miguel-Angel Gil Mar\u00edn was named &quot;football director of the year&quot; by the Dubai-based Globe Soccer group. They might as well have handed Pol Pot the Nobel Peace Prize. Talking points: Results: Athletic 3-0 Sporting, Getafe 4-1 Deportivo, Osasuna 1-1 Mallorca, Barcelona 3-0 Atl\u00e9tico, Real Madrid 4-1 Real Sociedad, Zaragoza 1-1 Racing, Almer\u00eda 3-2 Espanyol, Villarreal 0-1 Levante, Sevilla 0-0 Malaga, Valencia 2-0 H\u00e9rcules. \u2022 Hang on, does that say Levante beat Villarreal? Bloody hell, it does you know. \u2022 Sometimes Barcelona and Leo Messi are a victim of their own boring brilliance. Let&apos;s face it, we really should be talking about them this week but what else is there to say? They have now broken the league record with a 16th successive victory and eased their way past Atl\u00e9tico in the opening 15 minutes on Saturday night. Messi scored a hat-trick, taking him to 24 for the season and \u2013 get this \u2013 83 in his last 82 games for Barcelona. But more than the goal, the thing everyone is really getting excited about is the moment he dashed back 50 yards, took the ball off Ag\u00fcero, dinked a pass round an Atl\u00e9tico player and set Barcelona back on the attack. &quot;He is,&quot; said Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, making the comparison that means even more to most Spaniards than Pel\u00e9 or Maradona, &quot;a 21st century Di St\u00e9fano&quot;. \u2022 Na Na Na Na Na, My Dad Is Bigger Than Your Dad Department: that Quique comment was one that Marca were not prepared to let go. All upset at someone not bowing down to kiss the feet of their lord and saviour (well, one of their three lords and saviours), they splashed their cover with &quot;21st century Di St\u00e9fano&quot; this morning. Not Messi, but Cristiano Ronaldo \u2013 who last night got two more to take his total to 24 and a barely believable 50 in 51 games since joining Madrid. Mourinho&apos;s side battered Real Sociedad last night with Mesut Ozil particularly sparkling. Kak\u00e1 played well too. And there was an impressive performance and a goal for Emmanuel Adebayor. That noise you can hear is probably a nail (not yet the final one, though) being hammered into Karim Benzema&apos;s coffin. \u2022 &quot;A toast to mediocrity.&quot; That was how AS&apos;s report of Sevilla-M\u00e1laga put it. And they could not have put it better. To think, Sevilla used to be worth watching. Once. \u2022 With every passing game, Athletic Bilbao look stronger and Iker Muniain looks better \u2013 he produced a wonderful rub for the second this weekend, scored by Gaizka Toquero. They have now won four on the trot. They&apos;re six points off but a Champions League place looks a genuine possibility. \u2022 Tino Costa doesn&apos;t do normal goals. He scored a beauty last night as Valencia beat Hercules 2-0. So poor were H\u00e9rcules that they decided they might as well send on persona non grata Royston Drenthe. As he was waiting he was given a pep talk by the assistant coach, which presumably consisted simply of a promise: &quot;It&apos;ll be in your account on Monday. Honest.&quot; Only let&apos;s face it, it won&apos;t.", "title": "How long until Atl\u00e9tico Madrid's manager takes the exit door? | Sid Lowe", "sentences": ["At the end of December, Miguel-Angel Gil Mar\u00edn was named &quot;football director of the year&quot; by the Dubai-based Globe Soccer group."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-07T13:26:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/07/egypt-cabinet-announces-salaries-pensions-rise", "tags": ["Egypt", "Protest", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Arab and Middle East unrest"], "article": "Egypt&apos;s new cabinet has announced a 15% rise in salaries and pensions in an attempt to draw the sting from the public protests that have convulsed the country, threatening to drive Hosni Mubarak out of power after 30 years. The increase for public sector workers followed earlier proposals for greater political freedom that have yet to convince pro-democracy protesters to leave Tahrir Square after two weeks of unrest that have claimed up to 300 lives. The new finance minister, Samir Radwan, says some 6.5bn Egyptian pounds ($960m) will be allocated to cover the increases, which will take effect in April for the 6 million people on the public payroll. State TV also announced that the family of a Google marketing manager who helped organise the anti-Mubarak demonstrations, has been told he will be released from prison. Wael Ghonim was one of the most prominent youth organisers of the protests and was seized by security agents last month. But the concessions were unlikely to win over protesters, who insist that Mubarak should go now and not in September, when new elections are due to be held. &quot;Our main objective is for Mubarak to step down,&quot; said student Muhammad Eid. &quot;We don&apos;t accept any other concessions.&quot; Rami Ghoneim, an unemployed internet activist, said the protesters were in no rush to leave so long as their key demand was not met. The longer they stay, he said, the more concessions the regime offers. &quot;It is like a wound, the more you press on it the more blood gushes out. We will press until we empty it,&quot; he said. Attempts by the government to portray the country as returning to normal since the protests began on 25 January, following the upheaval in Tunisia, were less than convincing. Banks reopened after a week-long closure with queues of customers but hours, and withdrawals, were limited. The stock market, which was due to reopen, remained closed, although traffic was returning to ordinary levels in many places. Despite pledges of press freedom, the government moved to clamp down on foreign coverage by demanding that overseas journalists be accredited by the Egyptian authorities before being granted access to Tahrir Square. Egyptian security forces also continued to round up protesters. Security agents wearing body armour and carrying automatic weapons arrested three men inside the foreign ministry and bundled them into the back of a van and driving off. Asked who the men were, a guard on the gate at the ministry said &quot;opposition&quot;. More activists have been arrested, it was reported, including an independent film maker, Samir Eshra, and Abdel-Karim Nabil Suleiman, who blogs under the name Karim Amer. Amer was the first blogger to be prosecuted in the country when he was jailed for four years in 2007 for insulting Islam and the president. He was released last November. A symbolic funeral was held in Tahrir Square for the first journalist to be killed in the unrest, Ahmad Mohamed Mahmoud, a photographer with Al-Ta&apos;awun. Keen to get traffic moving around the square, the army tried early on to squeeze the area the protesters have occupied. Overnight campers rushed out of their tents to surround soldiers attempting to corral them into a smaller area. Wary of the army&apos;s effort to gain ground to try and restore the traffic flow in central Cairo, dozens of protesters slept inside the tracks of the army vehicles. &quot;The army is getting restless and so are the protesters. The army wants to squeeze us into a small circle in the middle of the square to get the traffic moving again,&quot; protester Muhammad Shalaby, 27, told Reuters by telephone. &quot;Things are stable. I can&apos;t say they&apos;re good, but they&apos;re not collapsing,&quot; said a trader at a Cairo-based bank. Egypt&apos;s state-run news agency reported that Mubarak ordered the country&apos;s parliament and its highest appellate court to re-examine lower court rulings disqualifying hundreds of ruling-party MPs for campaign and ballot irregularities that were ignored by electoral officials. The ruling National Democratic party won more than 83% of the 518 seats in the 2010 parliamentary elections. Implementing the rulings against NDP MPs could cause many to lose their seats and force the dissolution of the parliament and new elections if enough are disqualified. In other measures aimed at placating protesters, judicial officials promised to start the questioning on Tuesdayof three former ministers and a senior ruling party official who were accused of corruption after they were dismissed by Mubarak last week. The cabinet reshuffle was intended to placate protesters by removing some of the most hated officials in the government. As Egypt&apos;s political crisis continued to play out, the Egyptian pound hit its lowest level against the US dollar in about six years. The dollar was trading at about 5.953 Egyptian pounds by midday, its lowest since January 2005. The government, meanwhile, is to auction 15bn Egyptian pounds in treasury bills to raise cash. The confidence-building measure comes amid worries about capital outflows and a sharp drop in foreign investment. &quot;Local banks have enough capacity to take up the issue, and I don&apos;t think the central bank would take up an issue of this size if they weren&apos;t confident it would be successful,&quot; said Ahmad Alanani, director of Mideast fixed income sales at Exotix in Dubai. &quot;A successful auction of this size taken up by local banks would send all the right signals that the Egyptian debt markets are back in business,&quot; he added. The Egyptian government has offered a series of concessions at the first talks with opposition groups, including the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, in an attempt to end the mass pro-democracy protests across the country. But opposition leaders said Egypt&apos;s vice-president and long-time intelligence chief, Omar Suleiman, did not go far enough in his proposals.", "title": "Egypt's new cabinet announces 15% rise in salaries and pensions", "sentences": ["&quot;Local banks have enough capacity to take up the issue, and I don&apos;t think the central bank would take up an issue of this size if they weren&apos;t confident it would be successful,&quot; said Ahmad Alanani, director of Mideast fixed income sales at Exotix in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-07T16:36:54Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/08/wael-ghonim-google-facebook", "tags": ["Egypt", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Google", "Technology", "Facebook", "Internet", "Social networking"], "article": "     An emotional television interview given by a young Egyptian Google executive who was arrested after playing a key role in using the internet to spark the uprising against Hosni Mubarak is being hailed as a landmark moment in the ongoing revolt after it struck a chord across Egypt and beyond. Wael Ghonim, a marketing manager who became a hero to anti-government protestors after he went missing on 27 January, confirmed in the interview following his release that he was behind a highly influential Facebook page that helped lead to what he described as &quot;the revolution of the youth of the internet.&quot; Before his appearance on Monday on a privately owned Egyptian television channel, the father-of-two was held in repute by many who believed that he was the anonymous activist behind a Facebook page named after a young Egyptian businessman whose death at the hands of police in June set off months of protests. The page, &quot;We are all Khaled Said&quot;, became one of the main tools for organising the demonstrations that started the revolt in earnest on 25 January. However, Ghonim&apos;s stature across the country now appears destined to rise dramatically if the post-interview reaction on the internet is anything to go by. Calls are being made for him to stand as president. Others predicted that his performance, which was being acclaimed as a tour de force of calm but explosive political passion, would inevitably boost the numbers of those attending the latest mass demonstration in Cairo&apos;s Tahrir square and elsewhere this morning. &quot;I am not a hero. I only used the keyboard, the real heroes are the ones on the ground. Those I can&apos;t name,&quot; said Ghonim, who sobbed throughout the interview, which ended with him being overcome with emotion as he was shown images of some of those who died in the uprising. While insisting that he had not been tortured and saying his interrogators treated him with respect, he said he was taken aback when others who he met in jail believed that he was &quot;a traitor&quot;. &quot;Anyone with good intentions is the traitor because being evil is the norm,&quot; he said. &quot;If I was a traitor, I would have stayed in my villa in the Emirates and made good money and said like others, let this country go to hell. But we are not traitors,&quot; added Ghonim, an Egyptian who oversees Google&apos;s marketing in the Middle East and Africa from Dubai, one of the United Arab Emirates. According to early English translations which were posted online hours after the Arab language interview on DreamTV, Ghonim added: &quot;I wasn&apos;t optimistic on the 25th but now I can&apos;t believe it.&quot; He went on: &quot;Inside I met people who loved Egypt but their methods and mine are not the same. I pay these guys&apos; salaries from my taxes, I have the right to ask the ministers where my money is going, this is our country. &quot;I believe that if things get better those [who he met in prison] will serve Egypt well. Don&apos;t stand in our way, we are going to serve Egypt. I saw a film director get slapped, they told him &apos;You will die here&apos;. Why?&quot; He also downplayed the supposedly cental role of Islamist activists in the revolt, saying: &quot;There was no Muslim Brotherhood presence in organising these protests, it was all spontaneous, voluntary. Even when the Muslim Brotherhood decided to take part it was their choice to do so. This belongs to Egyptian youth. Please everyone, enough rumours. Enough.&quot; Ghonim&apos;s whereabouts were not known until Sunday, when a prominent Egyptian political figure confirmed he was under arrest and would soon be released. He looked exhausted and said he had been unable to sleep for 48 hours, but not because he was being mistreated.", "title": "Egyptian web activist freed after protests tells TV station: 'I am no hero'", "sentences": ["But we are not traitors,&quot; added Ghonim, an Egyptian who oversees Google&apos;s marketing in the Middle East and Africa from Dubai, one of the United Arab Emirates."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-08T00:19:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/08/wikileaks-cables-diplomacy-madhouse", "tags": ["WikiLeaks", "Media", "The US embassy cables"], "article": "It was a tough call. Was it more embarrassing that the US allowed more than 250,000 of its diplomatic cables to be hacked in the first place, or that their subsequent disclosure revealed international relations to be every bit as venal and gossip-rich as many had always feared? Not for the first time, the devil was entirely in the detail. Most of us could have guessed that the US was under pressure from some countries to attack Iran. That three of them turned out to be Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Bahrain was conclusive proof that religion actually comes a distant second to self-interest in realpolitik. Likewise, who would have thought the US would have taken private masterclasses in negotiation with Geoffrey Adams, the former British ambassador to Iran? All those Ivy Leaguers at their beck and call, but when push comes to shove, the only person the Americans really trust is a retired Briton. It was also a relief to discover that one US ambassador showed impeccable judgment in describing President Sarkozy as &quot;susceptible and authoritarian&quot;, while the Chinese foreign minister&apos;s description of North Korea &quot;behaving like a spoilt child&quot; in 2009 revealed that the traditional alliances among the communist regimes in the far east are a lot less stable than they were. Closer to home, Prince Andrew&apos;s boorishness has long been a feature of public life but the suggestion that in a speech to British businessmen in Kyrgyzstan, HRH rubbished corruption investigations by the Serious Fraud Office \u2013 and, for that matter, Guardian reporters \u2013 showed him to be a menace as well as cocky and rude. Nor is it just a large proportion of the UK who doubt the suitability of Prince Charles to succeed the Queen as head of the Commonwealth; that view is also shared by Amitav Banerji, Commonwealth secretariat director of political affairs. Our politicians also got it in the neck. Prior to last year&apos;s general election, Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, was happy to criticise George Osborne and David Cameron for their lack of experience, the lack of depth in their inner circle, and their tendency to think of issues only in terms of their electoral impact. Yes, that&apos;s the same Mervyn King who is now just about the only senior economist to back the coalition&apos;s economic policy. And if you wondered who thought Osborne lacked gravitas and was a political lightweight because of his &quot;high-pitched delivery&quot; then take a bow, because it was you; well, all of us, according to a pre-election Conservative poll which explains why he was nowhere to be seen during the campaign. Shame he hasn&apos;t stayed out of sight, really, as no one has changed their mind about him. It also emerged that the Lib Dems planned to run a campaign portraying David Cameron as &quot;fake&quot; and &quot;out of touch&quot;; I guess they can take it out of mothballs in 2015 and use it for Nick Clegg. Nor did the Labour party come out of WikiLeaks with any great distinction. The Foreign Office was still trying to shore up what remains of the &quot;special relationship&quot; with the US by promising to protect their interests (aka keep their dirty secrets) during the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war; the US soon showed how much the &quot;special relationship&quot; meant to them by ignoring Gordon Brown&apos;s entreaties to allow the hacker Gary McKinnon to serve his jail sentence in the UK. The US description of the former prime minister as a man with an abysmal track record, lurching from crisis to crisis, wasn&apos;t exact a ringing endorsement either. Nor did David Miliband look quite his usual saintly self with the suggestion that his championing of the 2009 Sri Lankan humanitarian crisis had as much to do with winning favour with Tamil voters in the UK as an unswerving commitment to human rights. News that the US considers Russia to be a virtual mafia state with rampant corruption was not too much of a shock, though Putin&apos;s alleged profiteering might: one analyst estimates his wealth as in excess of \u00a325bn, making him Europe&apos;s richest person. Also said to be doing well out of Russia is Silvio Berlusconi, who US diplomats suspect has profited personally and handsomely from deals with Putin. The Russian prime minister&apos;s wealth makes the \u00a352m reportedly found on Ahmad Zia Massoud, vice-president of Afghanistan, on his arrival in Dubai look like loose change. Massoud was freed with the cash after being stopped for questioning. US sources described his boss, President Karzai, as emotional, erratic and prone to believing paranoid conspiracy theories. Just what we need. Still, at least there are kickbacks for the US for their involvement in Afghanistan: the US military charges its allies a 15% handling fee on the hundreds of millions of dollars being raised internationally to build up the US army. Nowhere escaped this international madness. China could be plotting internet warfare via private firms known to have recruited top hackers; the leader of Burma&apos;s military junta considered a \u00a3634m bid for Manchester United; Saudi Arabia \u2013 the same Saudi Arabia that wants the US to bomb Iran \u2013 is the world&apos;s largest source of funds for Islamist militant groups. Meanwhile, good old Shell \u2013 always a company with the developing world&apos;s interests at heart \u2013 has apparently managed to insert staff into every main Nigerian ministry. And don&apos;t forget the Pope, a man with an unerring lack of judgment who, according to then British ambassador to the Vatican, might even spark violence against UK Catholics through his invitation to Anglican opponents of female priests to convert en masse. Note to embassy: we are not in the 17th century, we no longer burn Catholics at the stake, and frankly no one is that bothered if a few sexist bigots convert to Catholicism. Still, American diplomats got it wrong too. You have to feel for the US ambassador who claimed President Mubarak was likely to stay in power until he died. The 10 cables we wish we&apos;d found (but never did) UNITED NATIONS: Vladimir Putin shocked other world leaders by suggesting that membership of the United Nations security council should henceforth be decided solely on the ability of each country&apos;s leader to wrestle a tiger or leopard into submission with their bare hands, while clad only in a loincloth and glistening with body oil, the US embassy cables reveal. Gordon Brown was vocal in his opposition to the plan. PYONGYANG: An Obama administration plan to &quot;keep Sarah Palin out of harm&apos;s way&quot; by appointing her as a ceremonial envoy to North Korea floundered after Kim Jong-il refused to work with the former Alaska governor on the grounds that she was &quot;far too dangerously weird&quot; and &quot;almost completely out of touch&quot;. The furious dictator interrupted a tour of a door-wedge manufacturing facility to denounce the &quot;imperialist American provocateurs&quot; for daring to suggest appointing Palin, whose &quot;sole political experience was as the leader of an eccentric, isolated fiefdom&quot; where she had shown an &quot;obsession with grandiose and pointless state-funded construction projects&quot;.

BRUSSELS: The US ambassador to Belgium was so alarmed by rising tensions in the upper echelons of the Belgian government that he cabled his Washington superiors for the first time in months, marking his communique &quot;Not Particularly Urgent Because Let&apos;s Be Honest It&apos;s Still Only Belgium&quot;, the Guardian has learned. &quot;Also please advise on likelihood of Rome or Paris posts opening up sometime soon,&quot; the dispatch continues, noting that &quot;a man can only eat so many moules frites before he starts to wonder what his life is for&quot;. ROME: Silvio Berlusconi sometimes prefers a quiet night in playing Rummikub with fellow septuagenarians, according to an explosive diplomatic cable that threatens to destroy the Italian prime minister&apos;s carefully crafted public image as a creepy egomaniac sleazeball. WASHINGTON: The United States invaded Iraq because &quot;Dick Cheney&apos;s soul is a twisted knot of pure evil&quot;, according to a top secret cable that will surprise those who had attributed the invasion either to American efforts to control the world&apos;s oil reserves, or a misguided effort to bring democracy to the Middle East. The briefing document, prepared for US diplomatic staff in foreign capitals, also brings to an end the longstanding debate among moral philosophers over whether evil can truly be said to exist. It reveals that fresh supplies of it are delivered by secure courier to his Wyoming compound to this day. LONDON: Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, is a &quot;mercurial and untrustworthy&quot; figure, obsessed with flamenco dancing and horseracing, racked by phobias, and unable to travel anywhere without a &quot;voluptuous&quot; Ukrainian nurse on whom he is entirely dependent, according to a top US diplomat who conceded that his notes may have got mixed up during a recent transfer from Tripoli, though he added that he was &quot;pretty sure the mercurial and untrustworthy bit [was] accurate in both contexts&quot;. WASHINGTON: The world teetered on the brink of nuclear Armageddon after Joe Biden accidentally left his vice-presidential nuclear briefcase under the pool table in a Washington dive bar, a WikiLeaks diplomatic cable alleges. The vice-president, who carries an exact duplicate of the presidential &quot;nuclear football&quot;, told close aides he had been showing it to a female lobbyist at the bar who &quot;looked like she could use some company&quot;, but could remember nothing further until waking from a whisky-induced haze on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at six o&apos;clock the following morning.

(C) In a May 6 meeting with Assistant Minister of Petroleum (MinPet) Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, he outlined the Ministry&apos;s latest thinking on record-high crude prices, and OPEC&apos;s general refusal to budge on possible production increases. Contrary a few months ago, Prince Abdulaziz promised no relief on production or pricing. He told the Energy Attache that the Ministry was &quot;extremely worried about demand destruction&quot; in the U.S. as a result of the latest financial crisis indicators. However, he also fretted about squeezed refining margins in the U.S. and globally, noting the grave impact on U.S. refining utilization, currently running a scant 84 percent. He asked if the USG could assist the current political situation in Nigeria, where the production has collapsed to about a million barrels per day (mbpd) during the last week as a result of militant attacks and strikes. On the anti-OPEC lawsuits, he explained Saudi Arabia continued to gather amicus briefs for the now-consolidated cases in Texas. He generally dismissed the further threat of NOPEC legislation, saying if Congress could have passed the legislation, they would have done so already. ----------------------------- &quot;Refining Margins Shocked,&quot; Refining Utilization Falling ----------------------------- 2. (C) Queried about Monday&apos;s record surge in crude prices to above $120/barrel, Prince Abdulaziz noted, &quot;We are extremely worried about demand destruction, like in the early 1980s. Aramco is trying to sell more, but frankly there are no buyers. We are discounting crudes, now we&apos;re at a $10 differential between West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Dubai Light, sometimes as much as a $12-$13 differential. Our buyers still bought less in April than they did in March.&quot; Prince Abdulaziz attributed the lack of willing buyers to the current low refining margins. He indicated that that current high crude prices were squeezing refining margins, as refiners were unable to pass on the full brunt of crude prices to the end consumer. &quot;There are no refining margins, refining margins have been shocked. It&apos;s purely technical, not policy-induced. There are commercial impediments.&quot; The consequence of poor refining margins was a declining refining utilization rate. Prince Abdulaziz fretted, &quot;the U.S. refining utilization is 84 percent now, it&apos;s usually above 90 percent. The quickest relief would be if crude prices would come down from these highs, if some of these political crises would resolve.&quot; He queried if the USG could do anything to assist current political situation in Nigeria. --------------------------------------------- ------------- &quot;Grey Area of Demand Destruction, We Must Hold Our Guard&quot; --------------------------------------------- ------------- 3. (C) Prince Abdulaziz dis-missed speculation that King Abdullah&apos;s press statements last week on Saudi Arabia planning to cap production capacity at 12.5 million barrels per day and leave oil in the ground for future generations represented a new policy. He stated, &quot;It&apos;s a statement of fact, we need to be credible. We&apos;re pumping more than 9 million bpd, and right now, there is a grey area of demand destruction. We must hold our guard, and wait and see what happens with potential demand. Vice President Cheney was very complimentary about our maintaining spare capacity. We are honest with our commitments, we&apos;ve been credible with our program. The other producing countries should do it the way RIYADH 00000732 002 OF 002 we do. If we announce new capacity, we budget for it, we allocate for it, we acquire rigs, we have timelines. We don&apos;t have pipedreams, if we make an announcement, we are certain to supply it. ------------------------------------ Anti-OPEC Lawsuits and NOPEC Updates ------------------------------------- 4. (C) On the issue of pending lawsuits against Saudi Aramco and the national oil companies of other OPEC member and oil producing nations, Prince Abdulaziz indicated: --the lawsuits had been successfully consolidated into one court in Texas; --Saudi Arabia had worked with most other OPEC nations to file amicus briefs with the court. --To Iran&apos;s offer to file an amicus brief, Saudi Arabia had said, &quot;thanks, but no thanks,&quot; recognizing it probably would not be helpful in a U.S. court; --The Mexicans and Russians would also file amicus briefs. --The Norwegians also now have a case filed against them in Florida, so are reluctant to file an amicus brief. Prince Abdulaziz believes the Departments of State and Justice seem to be coming around to filing a Statement of Interest (SOI) on behalf of the Saudi government in the lawsuits, but noted the White House was still concerned about the political optics of such a move. He felt such concerns were mis-placed now, particularly with respect to possibly fueling NOPEC legislation. 5. (C) Prince Abdulaziz indicated that if NOPEC had the strength to pass it would have done so already, but it hasn&apos;t, in large part he felt due to the Administration&apos;s clear opposition. He argued the lawsuits and NOPEC had much in common: &quot;The Adminstration needs to be consistent in its policy. The effects of the lawsuits are very similar to that of NOPEC, but the plaintiffs are individual companies, rather than the Attorney General.&quot; Prince Abdulaziz added, &quot;Frankly our Embassy feels that once people are aware of the ramifications of such legislation, they&apos;ll be reluctant to abuse it. The Minister has been very candid to explain the ramifications, which would be far more serious for the U.S. economy and energy markets than the Saudi markets.&quot; -------- Comment -------- 6. (C) Prince Abdulaziz seemed more comfortable with the state of play in the anti-OPEC lawsuits, his considerable earlier anxiety much diminished. He appears to have largely dis-missed NOPEC legislation as a credible threat for now. We are concerned that the Saudi energy leadership does not seem sufficiently well-advised on how the current high oil price environment is fueling U.S. election year &quot;resource nationalism,&quot; and how this might impact our bilateral relationship in future years. In this vein, King Abdullah&apos;s recent comments that Saudi Arabia would cap its production capacity at 12.5 million bpd and leave crude in the ground for its children -- while representing no new initiative or substance -- seemed ill-timed at a moment when the market is looking for calming words from the world&apos;s energy market leader.

The transatlantic tie-up would create &quot;an international exchange leader&quot; with headquarters in both London and Toronto, according to a statement last night by the London exchange, or LSE. An announcement that the merger is going ahead could come as early as this week, creating a group which would reportedly be valued at around \u00a35.5bn; it would be 56% owned by the LSE, with the remainder in the hands of TMX. While one estimate suggested that it would be world&apos;s seventh-biggest exchange, the new group&apos;s real strength would stem from its position as one of the largest international platforms for mining company listings, at a time of surging commodities prices. Some of the largest mining companies in the world are listed on the LSE, where mining and energy interests account for more than 30% of the companies on its benchmark FTSE 100 index, while the TSX boasts several big gold companies, as well as thousands of junior miners listed on both its senior exchange and on the TSX Venture Exchange. It has been reported that the LSE&apos;s chief executive Xavier Rolet, who took over in 2009, would become chief executive of the new group. His opposite number at TMX, Thomas Kloet, would take on the role of chairman of the merged group, whose operations would be overseen by regulatory authorities in Canada and the UK. The expected merger, which would likely secure the future of the LSE against future takeover approaches (it has successfully foiled all bids off so far), follows a strategic partnership begun by the LSE and TMX in 2009. In a statement, the LSE said that it was in &quot;advanced discussions with TMX Group Inc regarding a possible merger of equals to create an international exchange leader&quot;. It went on: &quot;Current discussions contemplate an exchange ratio close to the current market capitalisation of London Stock Exchange Group and TMX Group . &quot;It is currently contemplated that the executive management and senior leadership of the merged group will be drawn from a balance of leaders from both organisations. &quot;The merged group would be co-headquartered in London and Toronto and continue to be overseen by its existing regulatory authorities.&quot; The Financial Times reported that the merger is being backed by Borse Dubai, which became LSE&apos;s largest shareholder after buying a 20% stake from Nasdaq OMX. The deal also has support from Qatar Investment Authority, which owns 15% of the LSE, and Italian bank shareholders UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo. The potential merger comes at a time of consolidation among the world&apos;s bourses. In January, the Singaporean and Australian stock exchanges announced plans to merge. Elsewhere, the New York Stock Exchange has bought Euronext, the Deutsche Borse has taken over the International Securities Exchange in the US and the LSE itself bought Borsa Italiana in 2007.

Witness its decision to send out the three-ball of Lee Westwood, Martin Kaymer and Tiger Woods for the opening two rounds of the Dubai Desert Classic. The world&apos;s three top-ranked players \u2013 whoever they are \u2013 usually play in the same event around 10 times a season but almost never together. Famously, Woods and Phil Mickelson spent the best part of a decade as the world&apos;s two best players yet when they played in the opening two rounds of a PGA Tour event they played on opposite ends of the draw \u2013 one in the morning, the other in the afternoon. No doubt some tour apparatchik with a clipboard would explain why this was so \u2013 health and safety, perhaps, or maybe there was an unwritten rule that, whenever possible, the golfing public should be denied what it wanted. Anyway, whatever the reasoning behind this perverse policy it apparently no longer stands, with the PGA Tour conceding a couple of weeks ago that it would be manipulating its so-called &quot;blind draw&quot; (the one that magically kept Mickelson and Woods apart for so long) with a view to producing some marquee groupings, and talking points for the benefit of television and by extension the viewing public. Hence, we had Woods and Rocco Mediate paired together for the first two days of Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines \u2013 the venue where they famously contested a play-off for the 2008 US Open. The European Tour has never had, or rather could never afford, such qualms when it comes to such attention-seeking ploys. Being the plucky underdog, it couldn&apos;t afford to. Still, when the idea of having Westwood, Kaymer and Woods in the same three-ball in Dubai was floating around there was a little scepticism. Perhaps they wouldn&apos;t want to be grouped together. Perhaps it was asking too much of the stewards to becalm the inevitable throng. Perhaps it would be too hurtful to the other 135 players in the field to discover no one in Dubai was interested in watching them at work. If such concerns were raised \u2013 and it is doubtful that they were \u2013 they were dismissed by the tour. So Westwood, Kaymer and Woods it is; 12.20pm local time, Thursday. Be there or be square. Yet if the European Tour deserves congratulations for its sense of theatre, it cannot be expected to guarantee anything other than that the gladiators will turn up on time. Fireworks are to be hoped for, but they should not be expected \u2013 as anyone by the 1st tee on the last occasion the world&apos;s top three were grouped together, at Torrey Pines in 2008, will testify. The atmosphere was electric when Woods, Mickelson and Adam Scott stepped up that day, but the competition turned out to be dimmer than a 40-watt bulb. Woods played decently, Scott was his usual anonymous self and Mickelson&apos;s main contribution to the gaiety of the occasion was his daft decision to play without a driver. The real competition \u2013 and what a competition it turned out to be \u2013 didn&apos;t get going until the weekend, when Mediate and Westwood got involved. It was ever thus in 72-hole tournament golf, where the opening two days are usually bereft of real drama and the main aim of those taking part is not to play themselves out of contention. It&apos;s a dreary old clich\u00e9, admittedly, but that doesn&apos;t mean it isn&apos;t true. Still, if Thursday&apos;s three-ball will inevitably fall short of expectations it should still provide a fascinating snapshot of where golf&apos;s balance of power lies, particularly in relation to Kaymer, who many people believe is the best player in the world. The German, of course, has already proved himself in the big time, winning his first major championship in a play-off at the PGA Championship last year. The first two days of the Dubai Desert Classic can hardly match Whistling Straits when it comes to defining Kaymer except in one way; he will know this world is watching and perhaps more importantly he will know Westwood and Woods, who he defers to when the discussion turns to his claims on being the world&apos;s best player, will be watching. Does he have the game, and the fortitude, to withstand the scrutiny? If he does the answer is yes, and if he can go on to win the tournament on Sunday, then not even Martin Kaymer will be able to deny that Martin Kaymer is the best golfer in the world.", "title": "Dubai three-ball might expose Martin Kaymer as the world's best player | Lawrence Donegan", "sentences": ["Witness its decision to send out the three-ball of Lee Westwood, Martin Kaymer and Tiger Woods for the opening two rounds of the Dubai Desert Classic.", "Still, when the idea of having Westwood, Kaymer and Woods in the same three-ball in Dubai was floating around there was a little scepticism.", "Perhaps it would be too hurtful to the other 135 players in the field to discover no one in Dubai was interested in watching them at work.", "The first two days of the Dubai Desert Classic can hardly match Whistling Straits when it comes to defining Kaymer except in one way; he will know this world is watching and perhaps more importantly he will know Westwood and Woods, who he defers to when the discussion turns to his claims on being the world&apos;s best player, will be watching."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-09T14:47:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/09/tiger-woods-dubai-desert-classic", "tags": ["Tiger Woods", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "The continent is different but as Tiger Woods looked ahead to his first competitive round outside the United States of the 2011 season the erstwhile behemoth of professional golf was reading from the same old script. &quot;To win,&quot; he said when asked about his hopes for Dubai Desert Classic. &quot;That&apos;s why I tee it up. If I&apos;m in the event, it&apos;s to win. That&apos;s just plain and simple. I don&apos;t always win. I&apos;ve certainly lost a lot more tournaments than I&apos;ve won. But it&apos;s the goal every week you tee it up and that doesn&apos;t change.&quot; Of course Woods would say that on the eve of an event \u2013 most top-class golfers do so, publicly at least \u2013 but is fair to say the 14-times major champion once uttered his oh-so-familiar mantra with a little more conviction. Fifteen months without a victory and countless blows to professional and personal pride, not least in the rash of former sponsors who have disassociated themselves from their once-gilded pitchman, have had their effect. So, too, has Woods&apos;s last competitive appearance, two weeks ago at the Farmers Insurance Open in San Diego, a tournament he had traditionally used to remind his peers of his superiority at the start of every season. He had won that tournament six times but this year&apos;s experience was a humbling one, his 44th place memorable only for the fact that his rookie playing partner for the final round, Brendan Steele, suggested afterwards that Woods had not &quot;given it everything&quot; during a three\u2011over\u2011par round of 75. &quot;I tried hard but I just didn&apos;t have much,&quot; Woods said when asked about Steele&apos;s remarks. That much is certainly true. After being dumped by his former coach Hank Haney, the world No3 teamed up with the Canadian swing coach Sean Foley in August last year and together they have begun to overhaul his swing \u2013 the third time during Woods&apos;s 15-year professional career he has embarked on such a major change to his technique. So far they appear to have made some progress, although the promise shown by Woods during a second-place finish at the Chevron World Challenge at the end of the last year had disappeared by the time he got to San Diego. &quot;I&apos;ve been here before,&quot; he said. &quot;It takes time. I went through, as I said, a two\u2011year period where I didn&apos;t do anything and I went through a year-and-a-half period [from 1997 to 1999] where I didn&apos;t do anything. It takes time to make these changes. You don&apos;t make changes and just start winning a bunch of golf tournaments. It doesn&apos;t work that way.&quot; As for the setback in San Diego? &quot;It was\u00a0good to have these problems kind of show themselves under tournament atmosphere and it was very good, to identify and fix it.&quot; Woods and his Canadian sidekick have spent the past week working on the failings that betrayed him in San Diego, most notably in his short game, and they had better hope the fix is in because a tough examination lies ahead over the next four days. The Emirates course is not especially long by modern standards but it has quick greens and narrow fairways. Suffice to say, if the American has flaws in his game they will quickly be revealed. Even if Woods were to recapture some of the magic that helped him to win twice here in the past there is still no guarantee that will be enough. The golfing world has changed dramatically in a short space of time and the evidence of that will be clear to him when he steps on to the 1st tee for the opening round to find Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer waiting for him. The Englishman and the German stand at No1 and No2 in the world rankings respectively and, thanks to the common sense and sense of theatre of someone in authority at the European Tour, they have been paired with Woods for the first 36 holes. It should be a threeball to keep an eye on, to say the very least. In the pre-match formalities Westwood and Kaymer have been careful to give their American visitor due respect but it can be\u00a0assumed they will be hoping \u2013 or even expecting \u2013 to remind him why he is No3 these days.", "title": "Tiger Woods looks for upswing in fortunes at Dubai Desert Classic", "sentences": ["&quot;To win,&quot; he said when asked about his hopes for Dubai Desert Classic."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-09T20:56:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/10/meydan-dubai-carnival-mike-de-kock", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Horse racing tips"], "article": "This week&apos;s seven-race Meydan card again looks to revolve around trainer Mike de Kock, who provided four of the seven Thoroughbred winners at last Thursday&apos;s carnival meeting. The Group Three UAE Guineas is today&apos;s feature race and, as is often the case with these &apos;Classic&apos; races, it lacks a certain amount of depth. Zazamar (5.30), representing de Kock who has won four of the 11 runnings of this race, is a worthy favourite based on his trial win over seven furlongs. Sure to appreciate the step up in trip, it is hard to find one to oppose him, but Herman Brown&apos;s Paulinho, reported to have improved since his second in a conditions event over 1400 metres in December, can make the frame. The preceding Listed Firebreak Stakes, over a mile, is one of the most competitive races of the carnival so far, with several in with live chances. De Kock has three and on jockey bookings it would look as if last season&apos;s UAE Derby winner Musir is the first string. However, with an excellent second in Group Three company behind Mendip under his belt, it may pay to side with stablemate Imbongi (4.50), who has the benefit of race fitness. Bankable, an eyecatching fourth over an inadequate trip last time out, can also feature. Both Godolphin handlers were without a winner at last week&apos;s meeting but Saeed bin Suroor can rectify that in the second race with the progressive Lost In The Moment (3.05). A cosy winner last time, he again gets in off a light weight and can get the better of stablemate Once More Dubai, the mount of Frankie Dettori. De Kock again has a strong contingent in the nine and a half furlong handicap where his Golden Sword (3.40) can gain his first victory since the 2009 Chester Vase. He was a good second last time when held up over a mile and a repeat of those tactics can see him prevail here. Happy Dubai has won both straight turf races so far, but off top weight he looks vulnerable to Walter Swinburn&apos;s Monsieur Joe (4.15), who was half a length behind him two starts ago but meets him on four kilos better terms this time. The concluding nine-furlong turf handicap looks a three way battle behind Irish Flame, Kingsfort and Raihana (6.15), with the last-named taken to improve for her narrow defeat in third last time out. She gets four kilos from stablemate Irish Flame and can round off what should be another profitable evening for team de Kock.

It will be a major surprise if otherwise extremely bright buttons do not place big counties and key cities in the most peculiar locations while quite possibly displaying an alarming haziness about the Pennines&apos; very existence. Aware of this geographical inarticulacy, Kevin Keegan was famously able to persuade Rob Lee that Newcastle was south of Middlesbrough. By the time the midfielder discovered it was actually an hour&apos;s drive north he had already signed on the dotted line at St James&apos; Park. Fortunately Lee, a Londoner, swiftly became smitten with Tyneside and could not have been more delighted to fall for such a soft con. Eighteen years later and 12 miles down the road the boot was on the other foot when Darren Bent pulled a reverse trick on Sunderland. The striker&apos;s oft-reiterated declarations of regional devotion proved horribly hollow as he scarpered for the A1 (southbound) at the first flutter of G\u00e9rard Houllier&apos;s eyelashes. Even if alarm bells probably should have clanged the moment Bent claimed to &quot;really like&quot; Antony Gormley&apos;s controversial Angel of the North sculpture, his deception touched a raw north-eastern nerve. While Sunderland&apos;s board was privately satisfied at acquiring \u00a324m of Aston Villa&apos;s money, Steve Bruce was dismayed that, having moved heaven and earth to entice Bent to Wearside 18 months earlier, he could not hold him. &quot;We all know that, geographically, it can be difficult to get players here; there&apos;s no point in trying to pull the wool over anyone&apos;s eyes,&quot; lamented Sunderland&apos;s manager last week, clearly deriving little consolation from the installation of the former foreign secretary David Miliband as his club&apos;s new vice-chairman and roving ambassador. Delivered days after Andy Carroll&apos;s \u00a335m defection from Newcastle to Liverpool Bruce&apos;s message seemed as sad as the Geordie filmed endeavouring, vainly, to set a Carroll replica shirt alight outside St James&apos;. If the garment&apos;s failure to ignite proved reassuring in the sense that such tops are perhaps not quite as flammable as feared, it also served as a depressing metaphor for a one-time football hotbed now incapable of truly catching fire. The puzzle is that Newcastle and Sunderland possess two of England&apos;s best grounds, consistently attract some of the Premier League&apos;s biggest, most passionate, crowds and are a short hop from stunning coastline and countryside. Admittedly it takes around three hours to drive to both venues from Manchester and two from Leeds, but, considering footballers fly everywhere these days that is almost irrelevant. Roy Keane once moaned that inadequate shopping opportunities made footballers&apos; Wags Sunderland-resistant but he was ignoring the frequent British Airways Newcastle-Heathrow shuttles; not to mention the former airport&apos;s daily Emirates flight bound for Dubai&apos;s miles of air-conditioned malls. For more everyday purchases, Tyneside&apos;s own retail outlets are virtual Identikits of stores found up and down an increasingly homogeneous country. Browsing in John Lewis or Fenwick in Newcastle you could be anywhere in the UK and the same goes for the upscale, invariably electronically gated, housing enclaves favoured by Premier League luminaries. Were you to transport someone blindfold between triple-garaged developments in Northumberland, Cheshire, Warwickshire and the home counties, it would be astonishing if they emerged blinking into the northern, southern and Midlands lights able to divine which was which. Like a snobbery-busting blind wine tasting, such an exercise could debunk many geographical prejudices while altering a host of skewed, if not downright false, perceptions. Meanwhile Bruce and his Newcastle counterpart, Alan Pardew, should remember that fashion is a fickle, whimsical thing.

Sources with knowledge of the deal struck in 2006 between Woods and the then developer Tatweer confirmed the &quot;broad thrust&quot; of a report by Arabian Business magazine claiming Woods received $26.25m (\u00a316m) in 2006, when he agreed to &quot;design&quot; a course as the centrepiece of a $1b residential development called Tiger Woods Dubai. The former world No1 received a further $26.16m two years later when he renegotiated, just before the global economic downturn in the autumn of 2008. In exchange for the additional fee Woods agreed to give up his right to own a property on the development. Less than a month after the deal was signed, in August 2008, the collapse of Lehman Brothers bank in New York sent the global property market into a downward spiral, with values in Dubai \u2013 which dropped an estimated 50% within months \u2013 among the worst affected. According to Arabian Business, Woods was to receive an additional $14.6m (\u00a39m) within 10 days of appearing at the official opening of the development, as well as a fee of $28.8m (\u00a318m) if he agreed to design a second course for Tatweer. He is now unlikely to see any of this money. Tiger Woods Dubai was supposed to feature mansions and palaces \u2013 some selling for more than $20m (\u00a312m) \u2013 a Michelin-starred restaurant and a luxury boutique-hotel. But it was one of many so-called luxury developments in the desert emirate subject to delays after the downturn, with the planned opening date of autumn 2009 pushed back time and again until it was clear its problems might be terminal. Its future became even more uncertain when the Observer newspaper revealed in November that work on the residences had never started, that only six holes of Woods&apos;s course had been completed and that most of the staff had been laid off. Photographs showed the site of the proposed $1.1bn (\u00a3686m) development was little more than a dustbowl, even though a reported 30% of the 240 planned properties had been sold to prospective buyers. The sales office, hidden behind the facade of an Arabian palace, was deserted but for a handful of cleaners and a scale-model of the development. Dubai Properties Group (DPG) \u2013 a government-owned company that took over responsibility for Tatweer&apos;s work \u2013 confirmed last month it was &quot;suspending&quot; work on the project. &quot;This decision was based on current market conditions that do not support high-end luxury real estate. These conditions will continue to be monitored and a decision will be made in the future when to restart the project,&quot; the company said in a statement, adding that it hoped to maintain its financial ties with Woods. This week Woods, who is in Dubai this week competing in the Dubai Desert Classic, was asked to comment on his agreement with Tatweer \u2013 which has since been taken over by DPG. &quot;I am not going to talk about that,&quot; he replied. Woods added that he and his representative were planning to have meetings with the developers in the coming days although he declined to say more. DPG did not respond to queries. The Dubai course was to be the first &quot;designed&quot; by Woods, who was at the peak of the marketability when the deal was struck. As the world&apos;s most recognisable and successful athlete he would have been expected to command a premium for his services but these figures are far in excess of what had been reported. They are also far in excess of what any other player in history has been paid for &quot;designing&quot; a course and illustrate how valuable the Tiger Woods brand was before his image was damaged by personal scandal. Asked if he had any comment to make about the his client&apos;s business dealings with Tatweer, Woods&apos;s agent, Mark Steinberg, said: &quot;No.&quot;", "title": "Tiger Woods 'paid more than $50m' for work on abandoned Dubai course", "sentences": ["Tiger Woods has reportedly been paid more than $50m (\u00a331m) for his work on a golf course development in Dubai which has since been abandoned because of the collapse in the Middle East property market.", "Sources with knowledge of the deal struck in 2006 between Woods and the then developer Tatweer confirmed the &quot;broad thrust&quot; of a report by Arabian Business magazine claiming Woods received $26.25m (\u00a316m) in 2006, when he agreed to &quot;design&quot; a course as the centrepiece of a $1b residential development called Tiger Woods Dubai.", "Less than a month after the deal was signed, in August 2008, the collapse of Lehman Brothers bank in New York sent the global property market into a downward spiral, with values in Dubai \u2013 which dropped an estimated 50% within months \u2013 among the worst affected.", "Tiger Woods Dubai was supposed to feature mansions and palaces \u2013 some selling for more than $20m (\u00a312m) \u2013 a Michelin-starred restaurant and a luxury boutique-hotel.", "Dubai Properties Group (DPG) \u2013 a government-owned company that took over responsibility for Tatweer&apos;s work \u2013 confirmed last month it was &quot;suspending&quot; work on the project.", "This week Woods, who is in Dubai this week competing in the Dubai Desert Classic, was asked to comment on his agreement with Tatweer \u2013 which has since been taken over by DPG.", "The Dubai course was to be the first &quot;designed&quot; by Woods, who was at the peak of the marketability when the deal was struck."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-10T09:36:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/10/rory-mcilroy-tiger-woods-dubai-classic", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "Tiger Woods", "Golf", "Lee Westwood", "Martin Kaymer", "Sport"], "article": "The last word on the opening day of the Dubai Desert Classic went to Tiger Woods, who eagled the 18th, but that flash of the genius he once was could not hide the flawed player he has become, nor could it outshine the brilliance of Rory McIlroy. For the Northern Irishman, who was out early in the morning, there was plenty to celebrate in a near-flawless round of 65, two shots clear of the field. For the struggling American, paired later in the day alongside Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer, the two men who have climbed above him in the world rankings, there was only further evidence of his diminished place in a sport he once dominated. Woods&apos;s &quot;scratchy&quot; 71 was good enough for 27th place but it was nowhere near good enough to beat his playing partners, who both signed for three-under 69s. The two-shot difference flattered the former world No1, who was outplayed until it came to the final hole. A stunning approach shot from 250 yards left him with a five-foot putt for eagle and something to cling on to as he pursues a first victory in 15 months. &quot;It took me a while when I was with Hank [Haney] and it took me a while when I was with Butch [Harmon]. I didn&apos;t play worth a darn for two years,&quot; he said afterwards. &quot;I&apos;m doing it now [with the Canadian coach Sean Foley] because I know I can become better. It will be more efficient.&quot; Woods is one of nature&apos;s more cussed men, not to mention most inherently gifted athletes. In other words, do not bet against him; not yet, anyway. He could well restore his swing, and his game, but if he should ever get back to the top of the mountain he will find it is a more crowded place than it was before. He got first-hand proof of that from Westwood and Kaymer, who both played beautifully all day only to be undone by insolated but costly mistakes \u2013 the Englishman on the 18th, which he bogeyed, and the German at the 9th, which he double-bogeyed after his approach shot ricocheted off a hospitality tent and into the greenside water. McIlroy&apos;s only dropped shot came with a three-putt at the 7th, but he more than balanced the ledger with eight birdies. The 21-year-old won this tournament in 2009 \u2013 his only victory on the European Tour \u2013 and counts the Emirates club as a home away from home. &quot;When you can draw on good memories and good feelings, it really helps you,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;d like to think I&apos;m a better player than two years ago. I&apos;m definitely more experienced and a more rounded and complete player. All I&apos;m trying to do is focus on hitting good shots \u2013 not just for the next three days, but for the next 12 months.&quot; Fighting words from McIlroy, a standard bearer for golf&apos;s new generation.

The young Irishman has prospered while the attention has been on the American and the two Europeans who usurped Woods in the world rankings, adding a second-round 68 to his opening-day 65 to take a one-shot lead into the weekend. He will begin his Saturday in the company of the South African Thomas Aiken but, like most others with a broader interest in the sport, his attention will be drawn to some other names stacked up on the leaderboard. Woods, obviously, is one of them but so, too, will be Sergio Garc\u00eda, who like McIlroy was once deemed to be the future of golf but has somehow ended up as a cautionary tale. Exhausted and uninterested, the Spaniard departed the scene last August looking for something to spark his game and his enthusiasm. Two rounds of 67, five under par, suggests the former world No2, and now world No79, has found it. But, if the Spaniard&apos;s return to form has been eye-catching, Woods&apos;s grappling with a game he once mastered has been compelling. Thursday&apos;s opening round of 71, rescued by an eagle on the final hole, was a flattering reflection of what had gone before. His second-round 66, six under par, was exactly what he deserved \u2013 just reward for some great ball-striking and a typically prideful statement in the presence of the world&apos;s No1 and No2. Westwood finished with a 36-hole total of 139, five under par and two shots behind Woods. Kaymer was one shot worse on 140. &quot;I felt it was important to post a number and I played myself right back into the tournament. I controlled my trajectory a lot better. The two shots I hit down 18 [to set up his eagle on Thursday] were the way I know I can swing and I worked out a few things last night that I didn&apos;t like,&quot; Woods said afterwards. Whether the fix is permanent will become apparent by the Masters. Whether it will be good enough to secure a first tournament victory in 15 months remains to be seen. McIlroy, for one, is unlikely to step aside and allow Woods to claim the prize. The Irishman, on 11 under for the tournament, has a four-shot advantage over the American and a sense that this tournament is something of a personal property. He led from start to finish when he won two years ago and was not ruling out a similar outcome this time. &quot;I can&apos;t see any reason why I can&apos;t win wire-to-wire again. That&apos;s the plan this year. I&apos;ll just keep shooting good scores and, if I can do that, then there&apos;s no reason why I can&apos;t beat that,&quot; he said. McIlroy is one of the game&apos;s coming generation \u2013 a peerless ball-striker who has ascended into the world&apos;s top 10 in a short space of time. Yet for all his natural gifts he has yet fully to master the art of winning. Two career victories is scant reward for his talents but perhaps a fair reflection of his youthful impetuosity in a sport where calm reflection is a better bet. He has gone for his shots when perhaps he should have picked his spots and he is beginning to understand that now. &quot;Maybe this time last year I would not have been able to grind out a 68 after the start I had. Rounds like this prove I am doing the right thing,&quot; he said. &quot;If I come up against Tiger this weekend I look forward to the challenge. I don&apos;t think you should be intimidated by anybody on tour.

The move came as the former president was reported to have flown to the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, where he has previously chaired summits, received guests and enjoyed the winter sunshine well away from the crowds. Mubarak said in his first speech during the uprising on 1 February that he would not leave his homeland, pledging to &quot;die on the soil of Egypt and be judged by history&quot;. But exploratory discussions involving the Saudis, the US and the UAE have reportedly taken place about him moving to Dubai. One important issue is immunity from any prosecution he might face on charges of crimes against humanity after 300 deaths and documented abuses by the security forces. According to the London-based paper al-Quds al-Arabi, revelations about the Mubarak family fortune and possible legal action over that are also a factor in planning for a post-presidential future. Experts have estimated that the Mubaraks could be worth \u00a343.5bn, with much of the wealth from investment deals in British and Swiss banks or tied up in upmarket real estate in London, New York, Los Angeles and expensive tracts of the Red Sea coast. In Britain, sources say the Bank of England cannot act against Mubarak&apos;s UK assets, which are thought to be considerable, unless it receives a formal request from either the EU, UN or a new Egyptian government. No requests have, as yet, been forthcoming. Mubarak&apos;s half-Welsh wife, Suzanne and their sons, Gamal and Alaa, were able to accumulate wealth through partnerships with foreign investors and companies, dating back to when he was in the army and in a position to benefit from corporate corruption. It had been thought that Mubarak might be persuaded to again seek urgent medical treatment in Germany, where he spent three weeks convalescing after surgery last March. But Omar Suleiman, the vice-president, denied on Wednesday that this option was under consideration. Germany has also denied offering him hospitality. A peaceful retirement in Sharm el-Sheikh would be an unusual outcome for an Arab president in the post-second world war era. Several Lebanese presidents retired after serving their terms in office, but otherwise Arab leaders have mostly either died in office or been murdered. In Tunisia, human rights campaigners are attempting to unravel the former president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali&apos;s web of assets, believed to spread from Canada and South America to the Gulf, and draw a &quot;blacklist&quot; of misappropriated assets. A Tunis prosecutor opened an investigation into the overseas assets of the ousted leader and his family. Much of the fortune, allegedly made from pillaging the economy, is believed to be held in property and secret bank accounts. A number of countries, including France, are examining requests to identify and block any movement of funds belonging to members of the Ben Ali regime, including relatives of his second wife, Leila Trabelsi. She was reported to have fled last week to Saudi Arabia with 1.5\u00a0tonnes of gold worth \u20ac50m (\u00a342m).", "title": "Where next for Hosni Mubarak?

The first race was run, but then the meeting was abandoned after the stewards held a meeting to review the situation. All racegoers at the track will be given a full refund. Newbury chairman Christopher Spence said: &quot;It&apos;s a nightmare for everybody. We can&apos;t be certain what it is, we all think it&apos;s electric, but we don&apos;t know.  &quot;It&apos;s easy to say carry on and hope for the best, but just hoping is not something we should or could do. We&apos;ve got to look after our customers and we&apos;ve got to look after the horses, so very regrettably we&apos;ve called the meeting off.  &quot;It&apos;s defeated everyone and we don&apos;t know the answer. We&apos;ll have a meeting to decide if we can re-run any of the races and we&apos;ll make further announcements as soon as we possibly can. We&apos;ve looked at the cables and we couldn&apos;t see any damage and no work has been carried out on the paddock since the last meeting.&quot;  Trainer Philip Hobbs is keen that the meeting be rescheduled as soon as possible. He said: &quot;The only thing I know is that now it has been abandoned hopefully we can get the meeting on again next week, it&apos;s absolutely vital for all of us as we have nowhere to go and Cheltenham coming up.  &quot;I was with Paul Nicholls, Alan King and Nigel Twiston-Davies and we were shocked when we found out it was off, but we don&apos;t know all the facts. I would have been happy to carry on, we badly need to as their aren&apos;t opportunities for there horses anywhere else.  &quot;I spoke to Stuart Middleton [of race planning] at the British Horseracing Authority - it looks possible it might go ahead again in the next few days, but I suppose for it to go ahead they have to sort out the problem here whatever that may be.&quot;  2.30pm Newbury abandoned after two horses die in paddock Tony Paley: The stewards at Newbury abandoned racing following an incident in which two horses collapsed and died in the paddock before the first race.  More details here.  Today&apos;s TV races by Will Hayler Salden Licht can enter the reckoning for next month&apos;s Champion Hurdle by defying top weight to take the Totesport Trophy at Newbury. It takes a serious performer to win a race as obviously competitive as this one from such a high position in the handicap, but there are good reasons for thinking that we have still to see the very best of this likable and late-maturing type over hurdles. Wayne Hutchinson&apos;s mount was a smart novice last season, whose performances deserve even greater credit given that they came at a time when the Alan King stable could hardly find a winner. He returned to the Flat in the autumn, winning a 20-runner handicap off top weight before finishing a very creditable fifth in the helter-skelter November Handicap off a mark of 102. Given a break for a couple of months, it might have seemed a rather low-key event at Exeter in which he returned to hurdling on New Year&apos;s Day, but he simply brushed aside his rivals and the form has worked out outstandingly well \u2013 every one of the next five horses home has franked the form book since. Against horses who have been campaigned with this race in mind for months, a clear career-best effort will be required. But Salden Licht (3.35), a horse having just his sixth start over hurdles, can rise to the occasion for a stable in red-hot form. Each-way punters should make sure that they bet with one of the bookies offering the extra concession of five places rather than the standard four. Newbury 1.55 Unproven at the trip he may be, but the signs are positive that Sir Kezbaah will relish the extra distance. His form at shorter trips has been smart this season. The 7lb-claiming Ed Glassonbury shone on a winner at Taunton on Thursday. Warwick 2.10 Jumping continues to be an issue for Hey Big Spender, who lost his rhythm after an early mistake last time out and faded tamely. But the ability is still there and in this lesser-grade his fencing should come under less pressure. Newbury 2.25 A tricky contest to weigh up, with Riverside Theatre having had a hard race to finish second to Long Run in the King George four weeks ago. The flat track is in his favour, but he has gone best fresh in the past and I am keen to oppose him. What A Friend flopped at Haydock, but although his Aintree form is open to question, his previous Leopardstown victory is harder to argue with. Despite the doubts, this looks his kind of contest. Fair Along goes chasing for the first time in three years, but this trip ought to suit and he has possibilities at the prices. Warwick 2.40 A stiffer test for Finian&apos;s Rainbow, but only marginally, and it will be disappointing if the ante-post favourite for the Arkle Chase at Cheltenham loses his unbeaten record over fences. Newbury 3.00 Despite producing an impossibly bad performance on his reappearance, the balance of French Opera&apos;s form last season stands up well to scrutiny. He can put the record straight. Leopardstown 3.15 Testing conditions threaten to suit Money Trix more than the favourite, Joncol. The selection performed well when second to Pandorama over Christmas (Joncol back in third), despite an interrupted preparation, and he will again appreciate the cut in the ground. Horse sense Ante-post money started arriving for Solix (3.35) the moment he produced a high-class piece of work against Oscar Whisky during that horse&apos;s preparations for the Welsh Champion Hurdle at Ffos Las last week. Do not be deterred by the decision to use the conditional rider David Bass to take off 5lb either, for while stablemate Soldatino has come on a lot for a recent reappearance, Solix will take all the beating in the Totesport Trophy at Newbury if reproducing the sort of displays he has been showing on the gallops. Drill Sergeant, an outsider, is worth a mention for each-way punters. His trainer, Donald McCain, believes that this contest will bring out the very best in this mercurial performer. Kid Cassidy (1.20) is capable of overcoming Al Ferof in the opener, if he settles better than on his last start. Work has been done at home to try and help him overcome that problem. French Opera (3.00) would not want much more rain, as his jockey reported that he was unable to handle the soft conditions when behind Cornas and company at Sandown last month. He is clearly much better than that run. The bumper is probably the hottest of the season so far, with Ericht and Bygones In Brid seen as legitimate Cheltenham Festival contenders. However, Persian Snow (4.40) can prove too strong for them both. Connections are understandably keen to get a win out of Albaraka (8.20), a daughter of the Champion Stakes winner Alborada, when she lines up at Wolverhampton. She worked on the Al Bahathri gallop on Thursday and looks a straightforward sort who should appreciate this step up in distance. Twice Over continues his steady build-up to the Dubai World Cup. He was spotted going nicely under Tom Queally on the Cambridge Road on Wednesday. Seen and heard Traditionally one of the boozier racing bashes of the year, the weights for the John Smith&apos;s Grand National will be unveiled on Tuesday at a lunch in a London hotel, but not everyone will be joining in with the revelry. Nicky Henderson has taken his regular vow of abstinence for the month of February, and has been joined by fellow trainer Alan King. However King, who has West End Rocker entered for the Aintree race, reported at Sandown last Saturday that he was finding it heavy going after just five days. The most relieved person on the track after Willie Twiston-Davies rode his first winner under Rules at Wetherby last Saturday aboard Baby Run was his mother, Cathy, who drove with him from Gloucestershire to the West Yorkshire track and also saddled stablemate Crescent Island to win at the same meeting. However, Willie&apos;s mother is set to have a harder task persuading her 16-year-old son to carry on at school when he finishes his GCSE examinations later this year. Although Willie&apos;s elder brother Sam made a start at his A-levels before abandoning schooling to pursue his dreams of being a leading jumps jockey, Twiston-Davies Jr has made his feelings about school clear. &quot;All I want to do is ride,&quot; he said last week. &quot;I&apos;d happily ride for free every day for the rest of my life.&quot; Will Hayler&apos;s best bet What A Steel 4.30 Ayr In the event that Ayr&apos;s meeting beats the weather, What A Steel is worth a bet to break his duck. He lost ground at a vital stage when squeezed up going to the second-last flight on his latest start at Market Rasen, but caught the eye once getting his second wind on the run-in and was going on strongly at the finish. Soft ground has never seemed to be a problem in the past and although it is a concern that he is still searching for his first success, he seems honest enough in the finish and the switch back to a left-handed track may also prove a positive.", "title": "Talking Horses", "sentences": ["Twice Over continues his steady build-up to the Dubai World Cup."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-12T10:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/12/rory-mcilroy-tiger-woods-dubai", "tags": ["Golf", "Rory McIlroy", "Tiger Woods", "Sport"], "article": "A cavalry charge in the desert or a redemption march? Tiger Woods and Sergio Garc\u00eda, two great players who have been down on their luck for a while, will be hoping the former turns into the latter when they pair up for the final round of the Dubai Desert Classic. The two men will start their day one behind the lead and looking for a victory that would mean a lot more than a winner&apos;s cheque. Woods, the scandal-scarred former world No1, is, as ever, looking to ram the words of his critics back down their throats, to prove there is golfing life after a year spent on the pages of the supermarket tabloids. Garc\u00eda will be seeking to re-establish a relationship that seemed irrevocably broken when he walked away from the sport last summer. Only one of them will live the Dubai dream, unless of course neither does. Woods last won in November 2009, Garc\u00eda in November 2008. That is a long time away from the pressures of competing at the business end of a golf tournament, when the smallest flaws in temperament and technique are exposed. There is also the small matter of the competition. After the wind had died and the dust settled on the third day of the Desert Classic 20 players were within three shots of the lead. All of them will arrive on the first tee believing they can win but with more wind forecast for tomorrow&apos;s final round it is safe to say this will be a ball-striker&apos;s day, a player like Rory McIlroy. The young Irishman won this tournament two years ago, when he led at the end of every round, and he has done so again at the end of every round this week. His third-round 75, three over par, was his worst effort of the week by seven shots, but it still left him tied at the head of the field alongside Anders Hansen of Denmark and the South African Thomas Aiken. &quot;I played the last 11 holes in one under which was actually pretty good,&apos;&apos; a sanguine McIlroy said after a torrid day. &quot;Overall I wish I had played a little better today and given myself a bit more of an advantage. It&apos;s now going to be a test of patience and about trying to play smart golf and make pars and make the odd birdie when you can get it.&quot; And Garc\u00eda might have added but didn&apos;t need to, it will be a good day to stay away from the double bogeys. The Spaniard led for much of today&apos;s third round only to run up a six at the par-four 17th after hitting his tee shot in a bush. It was one slack moment in an otherwise terrific performance but it cost him the overnight lead. Significantly, however, it did not cause him to lose his composure. &quot;I thought I was doing pretty well in the conditions. I didn&apos;t play the back nine that badly, I was holding it nicely and I had a couple of chances to get to 10 [under]. The good thing is that I&apos;m still in it, I could have had a one-shot lead, but that&apos;s the way it is,&apos;&apos; he said afterwards with admirable cool. Woods, too, was steeling himself for the challenge ahead. Back in 2008, when vulnerability was something that afflicted other people, he shot a seven-under-par 65 around the Emirates golf course on Sunday to win the event. Life, and golf, seemed so easy for the American back then.

It has taken decades for the storm surge to break over Egypt, but when it finally did the forces of change proved irresistible, sweeping away Hosni Mubarak in just 18 days of popular and peaceful street protests. The most remarkable feature of all is that nobody saw it coming. For all its resources, the United States and its western allies were taken completely by surprise by the brutally swift events which are now reshaping the geo-strategic map of the Middle East. Regime change, the Arab street has shown, need not be given such a bad name after all. Some have called this moment the Arab world&apos;s 1989, when the Iron Curtain fell in eastern Europe \u2013 but that was presaged by the years of reform in the Soviet Union under Gorbachev. In truth, there are no real precedents. A first draft of why it happened must begin in a rural town in Tunisia on the shores of the Mediterranean where Mohamed Bouazizi was the unlikeliest catalyst of the extraordinary realignment in the region. Known locally as Basboosa, Mohamed, aged 26, was a street fruit vendor in Sidi Bouzid, where unemployment is conservatively estimated at 30%. He earned around \u00a387 a month, the money going to support his six siblings, including one sister in university. He was regularly stopped by police, who expected him to pay them bribes to allow him to sell his wares from a wheelbarrow. On the morning of 17 December last year he had spent the equivalent of \u00a3125 on merchandise when it was seized. What made the loss harder to take was the humiliation. A 45-year-old female officer slapped him across the face, spat at him, scattered his fruit on the ground and confiscated his electronic scales. Two of her colleagues joined in, beating him. As a coup de grace, the woman insulted Mohamed&apos;s dead father, a labourer who died of a heart attack when his eldest son was just three years old. Mohamed finally snapped. For decades millions of young men like him right across the North African coastal plain have watched television images beamed from the other side of the Mediterranean from a European continent of prosperity, freedom and opportunity. They have watched the cronies of their own regimes growing older and, in their decadence, more arrogant and corrupt. They have watched hope for a better future leaking away. Seeking justice, Mohamed went to the local governor&apos;s office to complain about his treatment. He issued a warning when told that the governor was unavailable: &quot;If you don&apos;t see me, I&apos;ll burn myself.&quot; At 11.30am, less than an hour after he had been robbed and humiliated by the state&apos;s forces, he doused himself in petrol in front of the governor&apos;s office and set himself alight. &quot;What kind of repression do you imagine it takes for a young man to do this?&quot; said his sister Samia when her brother finally died of horrific injuries on 4 January. &quot;A man who has to feed his family by buying goods on credit when they fine him ... and take his goods. In Sidi Bouzid, those with no connections and no money for bribes are humiliated and insulted and not allowed to live.&quot; The young man&apos;s desperate action was a rallying call long awaited in his country and its neighbours. Mohamed Bouazizi&apos;s death became the spark which lit the bonfire on which the corrupt regime of Tunisia&apos;s President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali would also perish. And, like a bushfire out of control, there was soon fears that the &quot;contagion&quot; would spread. In an eerie coincidence with subsequent events in Egypt, it took 18 days for Mohamed to die, during which time Ben Ali was sufficiently shaken by the growing voices of anger and protest that he visited the dying young man in hospital. At his funeral 5,000 mourners chanted: &quot;Farewell, Mohamed, we will avenge you. We weep for you today. We will make those who caused your death weep.&quot; He was buried at Garaat Bennour cemetery, 10 miles from Sidi Bouzid. By then there was no turning back for the old guard as riots in Sidi Bouzid spread to the capital, Tunis. It seemed miraculous to Tunisians how quickly the iron fist of Ben Ali, president for 24 years, was loosened. The internet played a vital role, subverting the state-controlled communications channels by allowing ordinary citizens to bypass them and organise democratically. &quot;Game Over!&quot; taunted the placards and cheers of the jubilant crowds in a deliberate reference to the age of online computer gaming \u2013 a world beyond the reach of ageing tyrants, where the sans culottes of the Arab world come together in cyberspace. For decades Tunisia had been characterised by the west as a &quot;model&quot; Arab nation, but the WikiLeaks saga, months earlier, revealed the ugly truth of what its key sponsor, the United States, really thought of this &quot;mafia state&quot;, run as a virtual private enterprise by Ben Ali and his hated, avaricious wife Leila Trabelsi, who plundered 1.5 tonnes of gold from the central bank when they fled to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. Ben Ali&apos;s removal from power suddenly seemed to be creating a potential domino-effect around the region. First he tried to quell the protests by addressing the nation on state television and promising reforms. But when this failed to stem the tide of opposition, and with confidence among the armed forces ebbing from him, he chose to run. An international arrest warrant has been issued by Tunisia and his assets in Swiss banks have been frozen. While opposition figures, including a leading internet activist, have joined an interim government in preparation for elections within two months, the situation in Tunisia remains highly fluid and volatile, with most ordinary citizens unhappy that so many leading lights of the old regime remain in power. The results of Mohamed Bouazizi&apos;s self-immolation swiftly prompted protests across the region. Inspired by Tunisia&apos;s Jasmine Revolution, large protests began in Algeria, Yemen, Jordan and Egypt, with lesser incidents in Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Oman, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya and Morocco. Many were characterised by a playful, party atmosphere. In Amman, the Jordanian security forces handed out soft drinks to protesters, who laughed as they chanted &quot;Mubarak you are next!&quot; The Jordanians could not have known they were right. But to fully comprehend the swirling fury of the Egyptian street one must look back nine months. It was near midnight on Sunday 6 June when two Egyptian police officers walked into the Space Net internet cafe on Boubaset Street, a short stroll from Alexandria&apos;s crumbling corniche, and demanded to speak to Khaled Said. According to his mother and sister, Said, 28, was devoted to his pet cats and enjoyed pacing the seafront, flying kites on his own. His room was a jumble of wires and old car batteries, part of a homemade music system Said used to practise rapping; the thumping bass from behind his door could often be heard well into the early hours. &quot;He was ordinary, like any one of us,&quot; remembers his sister, Zahraa. &quot;He never seemed interested in politics at all.&quot; That night Khaled Said was beaten to death by the two officers who came looking for him. They smashed his head against a marble ledge in the lobby of the building next door before throwing his body into the back of a van, driving around, then dumping it by the roadside. It later emerged that Said had taped a secret video depicting what appeared to be corrupt local security chiefs dividing up the spoils of a drugs bust. His family also discovered self-penned anti-government songs stored on his computer. Three months ago, in the run-up to Egypt&apos;s blatantly rigged parliamentary elections, Zahraa told the Observer that the suffering of her brother and others like him could end up shaking the country to its very foundations: &quot;Change will not come from this regime&apos;s version of democracy, it will come in the shape of a tidal wave from below. Maybe the torture and murders carried out by our policemen will set that tidal wave in motion.&quot; Her words were prescient. Khaled Said was not the first Egyptian killed at the hands of Mubarak&apos;s police force, nor would he be the last. In Said&apos;s Sidi Gabr neighbourhood alone, dozens of police torture cases have been logged by local activists over the past eight months, some of them fatal. But the brazen manner of this particular murder \u2013 on a public street and not behind the blacked-out windows of the Sidi Gabr police headquarters \u2013 and the fact that the victim was middle-class, with relatives able to resist pressure from the security services to keep quiet, ensured that the name of Khaled Said quickly become synonymous with the staggering brutality and corruption of Mubarak&apos;s vast security apparatus, a brutality and corruption to which almost all Egyptians, to a lesser degree, were exposed on a daily basis. &quot;That was the turning point,&quot; claims Heba Morayef, the Human Rights Watch advocate in Egypt. &quot;Prior to that, demonstrations in favour of political reform struck many ordinary Egyptians as somewhat abstract, even if they had vague sympathy with the sentiments being expressed. &quot;Police cruelty, however, was something that touched people personally and it inspired a whole new, cross-class section of society to adopt a more combative stance towards the state.&quot; After much dithering and buck-passing by the authorities, the two officers responsible (though not their seniors) were put on trial and mass protests in major cities began. The demonstrations were never more than a few thousand strong, and often smaller \u2013 not insignificant in a country where a 30-year-old emergency law effectively criminalises any sort of public expression of dissent, but not enough to panic Mubarak&apos;s entrenched political elite. Online, however, it was a different story. Kolina Khaled Said, a Facebook group meaning &quot;We are all Khaled Said&quot;, quickly gathered hundreds of thousands, of supporters, who swapped information on other examples of inhumane police treatment and helped organise small-scale acts of civil disobedience. Along with a loose network of more explicitly political online activist groups, the anonymous administrators behind Kolina Khaled Said \u2013 one of whom turned out to be Google&apos;s regional marketing executive, Wael Ghonim, who attended to the web page from his home 1,500 miles away in Dubai \u2013 tried to find creative ways to get round Egypt&apos;s suffocating legal prohibitions on collective action in an effort to make their voices heard on the ground. Sometimes small groups of youths would &quot;spontaneously&quot; gather in city centres and sing the national anthem; on other occasions individuals wearing black would walk to the Nile at an appointed hour across the country and stand separately by the river in silence, an innocent routine that still managed to provoke a violent response from the security services. This vague but energetic new wave of dissent was leaving behind the moribund landscape of formal opposition politics in Egypt, where paper-democrats had long been scrabbling for crumbs of power tossed down by a regime keen to keep up the facade of a pluralist democracy. Now a new alternative avenue of resistance was on the cards and it was led from below, by those who had never known anything other than Mubarak&apos;s autocratic rule. With a demographic time-bomb ticking below the surface \u2013 two-thirds of Egypt&apos;s population is below the age of 30, and each year 700,000 new graduates chase 200,000 jobs \u2013 conditions were ripe for a social explosion. Into this combustible mix entered Kolina Khaled Said, the creators of which took great pains to cast their movement as not party-political, not backed by shadowy foreign forces, and dedicated primarily to encouraging Egyptians not to be afraid. The ingredients for massive social unrest may have been falling into place, but still in the way stood the firmest obstacle of all: fear. Through a prodigious web of overlapping security agencies ranging from armed riot police to plain-clothes informants to the baltagiyya \u2013 casually-employed ex-prisoners and local thugs \u2013 Mubarak&apos;s ruling clique had effectively instilled a sense of hopelessness in an overwhelming proportion of the population, whose instincts lay in avoiding the state, not defying it. But there was never any doubt that frustration at the status quo was deep and potent in every geographical and social corner of Egypt. If ever a critical mass of street protests were to develop and individuals thought the state&apos;s gendarmerie was no longer impregnable, it was likely that a full-scale uprising would quickly balloon. But something was needed to break down that initial aversion to open disobedience. Tunisia provided it. Arab neighbours had faced down their own security forces and won; perhaps now Egyptians could do the same. But a change of tactics was essential if the omnipresent state security agencies were to be outwitted; 25 January, the date of a national holiday devoted to celebrating the achievements of the police force, was selected as the &quot;day of rage&quot; to exploit growing public resentment against Mubarak&apos;s security forces which had been fuelled so successfully by Kolina Khaled Said. An umbrella coalition of youth activists formed small cells and spent the preceding weeks meeting in secret, plotting a series of devolved, localised protests designed to put maximum strain on the state security resources. In Cairo, 20 protest sites in densely populated, largely working-class neighbourhoods were selected and publicised. One extra location, in the warren of back streets of the Giza neighbourhood of Bulaq Al-Duqrur, was never broadcast \u2013 and took police completely by surprise. &quot;Usually we rally in one place and immediately get kettled in by hundreds or thousands of riot police,&quot; said Ahmed Salah, who was involved in planning for 25 January. &quot;This time we were determined to do something different \u2013 be multi-polar, fast-moving, and too mobile for the amin markazi [central security forces], giving us the chance to walk down hundreds of different roads and show normal passers-by that taking to the streets was actually possible.&quot; The plan worked better than they could ever have imagined. Throughout the capital and across the country, pockets of protest sprung up and overpowered the thinly stretched riot police, who had no choice but to let the marches continue. Later, when the different strands rallied in city centres \u2013 including Cairo&apos;s symbolic Tahrir Square \u2013the police used guns and tear gas to disperse them. But it was already too late. By destroying the smokescreen of police invincibility, even for only a few hours, the youths had pierced Mubarak&apos;s last line of defence \u2013 the fear his subjects felt at the thought of confronting him \u2013 and a fatal blow was struck to a 30-year dictatorial regime. Nevertheless, Mubarak would prove to be a mightier force than Tunisia&apos;s Ben Ali. He knew he could rely upon the support of the Americans, who had long granted him premier status in the region not just as guarantor of peace with Israel but also the bulwark against Islamist militancy. And, as a fabled military hero, he was not just the creature of the all-powerful armed forces but for decades their own guarantee of stability and continuity. It was only as the demonstrators refused to desert Tahrir Square or accept Mubarak&apos;s concessions for as long as they fell short of his departure, and as Washington dithered and flip-flopped, that the army began to have its doubts about continuing to back him. Repeatedly over the past two weeks the Obama administration, the State Department, CIA and the Pentagon had been unsettled and confused by the situation in Egypt. Caught unawares at the prospect of the protests actually succeeding, they reacted too slowly, then too quickly and, finally, were rescued by events on the ground. But few should be surprised; American strategy was caught between a rock and a hard place. There was an urgent need to respond to the pro-democracy movement, but at the same time that movement was aimed at unseating one of America&apos;s most trusted Arab allies, a man who had been a friend to five presidents over three decades. At the start the crisis only rippled slowly through Washington. On 26 January, a day after protests began in Egypt, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs called Egypt a &quot;strong ally&quot;. The impression of support for a president whose army soaks up more than one billion dollars of US aid a year was strengthened a day later when vice-president Joe Biden said Mubarak was not a dictator. American policy appeared in total disarray. Obama&apos;s envoy in the crisis, old school diplomat Frank Wisner, travelled to the country. On 5 February he expressed public support for Mubarak staying on, yet such was the confusion in US policymaking now that, mere hours later, both the White House and the State Department disavowed his comments. As the protests refused to die down after Mubarak said that he would resign in September, US policy hardened again. It coalesced around the figure of new vice-president Omar Suleiman. For American \u2013 and Israeli \u2013 interests, Suleiman seemed ideal. He was known as a strong man and someone who wanted to preserve the strategic status quo, yet also a figure who had made the right noises, in public at least, about making the transition to democracy. He was seen as someone who could avoid the nightmare American scenario of a popular anti-Israeli government taking power in Egypt or, worst of all, an Islamist-influenced one. On 8 February, Biden spoke to Suleiman by phone and stressed the need for an orderly, and swift, transition of power. That convinced many in Washington that it was only a matter of time. Yet the impact of the Egyptian unrest was spiralling out into the rest of American diplomacy. Last Wednesday Obama spoke to Saudi Arabia&apos;s King Abdullah in a reportedly testy exchange in which the ageing Saudi royal argued for Mubarak to not be humiliated. When news of the conversation leaked it created a flurry of speculation that the revolt in Egypt was exposing the weakness of American power. On Thursday CIA chief Leon Panetta told Congress that he imminently expected Mubarak to announce that he was likely to stand down. As Mubarak took to the TV screens that evening, Obama watched the speech on Air Force One as he made his way back from an event in Michigan. Yet Mubarak fell short of the expectations of those in Tahrir Square and of the army generals when he announced he was transferring his remaining powers to Suleiman but remaining as president, if in name only to save his pride. It was a move that stunned many and seemed to threaten a complete unravelling and a blood bath, with the demonstrators noisily hatching plans to march on the presidential palace in the morning, a move which would force the Army, thus far maintaining a politically detached posture, into choosing sides. And so it did, the military&apos;s supreme council shepherding the defeated Mubarak onto a plane to take him to a luxurious internal exile at his Red Sea palace. It was an extraordinary finale to 18 days of rage; the army had staged a coup with the backing of the people. Like a swan looking graceful on the surface while kicking its legs furiously underneath, Obama was able to take to the airwaves and welcome in the changes. &quot;The wheel of history turned at a blinding pace,&quot; Obama said.

Trainers under scrutiny over controversial non-runner certificates After many years of trainers producing veterinary certificates, often for dubious reasons, to explain why their horses \u2013 frequently those with a bad draw \u2013 were non-runners, in 2008 the British Horseracing Authority introduced a new system. Trainers were able to self-certify a horse as a non-runner although it could not run again for six days after the race it was withdrawn from. But it appears that this system has also proved open to abuse and it is believed a handful of trainers suspected as frequent offenders are to be told they will no longer be allowed to produce self-certificates.

The former world No1 was paid a reported $3m (\u00a31.9m) to play the tournament \u2013 more than seven times what the winner received. The money bought Woods&apos;s presence but it could muster up only a vague reminiscence of the player he once was as a three-over-par 75 cost him his chance of a first victory in more than a year. He began the day one shot off the lead and finished seven shots behind, in a tie for 20th \u2013 well beaten in the main event and also beaten in the much hyped, and ultimately over-hyped, meeting of the world&apos;s top three ranked players. Lee Westwood won that contest with a round that vaulted him into contention before three dropped shots on the last two holes cost him his chance. Still, Westwood was happy with his 72 and the retention of his No1 ranking. &quot;Not bad considering I came home in an ambulance,&quot; he said afterwards. What a smiling contrast the Englishman made with Woods, who left the scene surrounded by a coterie of security guards after mouthing familiar platitudes about the progress he is supposedly making as he rebuilds his swing under his new coach, Sean Foley. &quot;There were quite a few positives this week but a couple of glaring examples of what I need to work on,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s like anything. All my old feels [for the clubs] are out the window when the winds blow. That&apos;s the thing when you are making change. It&apos;s fine when the wind is not blowing. But when you have to hit a shot when the wind blows ... the new swing patterns get exposed.&quot; Woods, whose last win in a tournament came at the Australian Masters in 2009, might want to ask himself if he really believes this stuff and, while he is at it, he might also want to ask himself how much its serves the cause of his post-scandal rehabilitation to be broadcast around the world spitting on the green as he prepared to putt on the 12th green. Golf&apos;s moral guardians were out in force as the YouTube video of the incident attained &quot;viral&quot; status and for once it was hard to disagree with those who took offence. Yet if the American&apos;s contribution to the event ultimately left a bitter taste, Quir\u00f3s&apos;s victory was the ultimate expression of everything that is good about golf and the Spaniard&apos;s modern interpretation of the game. He is an unashamed bomber who gives the ball a lash, goes looking for it and then gives it another lash. It is an uncomplicated formula, delivered with a smile, which sometimes works and sometimes does not. This was one of those days when everything came good in the end, even if the journey was circuitous. Starting the day one shot behind the leaders, Rory McIlroy, Thomas Aiken and Anders Hansen, the Spaniard made his move early, eagling the short par-four 2nd. Two quick birdies cemented his lead but he followed those with a triple-bogey at the 8th, where his ball became lodged in a tree. Typically, Quir\u00f3s responded with a smile and a birdie. It was an adventuresome round and it got even more so at the par-three 11th, where his &quot;half-wedge&quot; tee shot ended up in the cup for a hole-in-one. This proved the decisive blow as he came home in 68, good enough for a one-shot victory over Denmark&apos;s Hansen and James Kingston of South Africa. &quot;I have to recognise that the 11th might be one of the more exciting moments in my career,&quot; Quir\u00f3s said. &quot;I am very proud of myself. I think I managed very well with difficult situations.&quot; The 70th-ranked Hansen, who had his best finish since coming second at last year&apos;s Singapore Open, was left to rue his missed chances. &quot;Obviously a little disappointed,&quot; he said. &quot;I gave myself a chance after leading and got myself out of it early but brought myself back in it.

Just wasn&apos;t thinking and want to say I&apos;m sorry,&quot; he said in rare posting on Twitter. The former world No1 was seen during Sunday&apos;s final round of the Dubai Desert Classic spitting on the 12th green at the Emirates golf club \u2013 an act immediately seized on by television commentators, who described Woods as arrogant and petulant. &quot;It doesn&apos;t get much lower than that,&quot; said Sky TV&apos;s Ewen Murray. Within minutes the European Tour&apos;s own website had received dozens of complaints and with the opprobrium showing no sign of diminishing officials were forced to act. &quot;The tournament director, Mike Stewart, has reviewed the incident and feels there has been a breach of the Tour code of conduct and consequently Tiger Woods will be fined. The Tour will not be publicising the amount,&quot; the tour said in a statement. Under the code a player can be fined between \u00a3250 and \u00a310,000 for a &quot;minor breach&quot;, as Woods&apos;s behaviour is likely to have been deemed. Such financial penalties mean nothing to a man once declared golf&apos;s first billionaire and who received a reported $3m appearance fee for turning up in Dubai. But with the video of the incident threatening to become viral and with some of the major American news networks and websites picking up the story it was evident Woods was facing a public relations disaster. He is not due to play again until next week&apos;s Accenture World Match Play Championship in Tucson. Ironically, he is schedule to play Thomas Bjorn, chairman of the European Tour players&apos; committee \u2013 the Tour&apos;s ultimate court of discipline \u2013 in the first round of the knockout tournament. Away from the course, Woods will inevitably face questions about his demeanor and conduct. It promises to be yet another uncomfortable occasion for the golfer, who a year on from his infamous televised &quot;apology&quot; in the wake of his personal scandal now finds himself assailed by critics of his behaviour and, increasingly, his abilities as a player. He is also being shunned by corporate America \u2013 dumped by most of his former sponsors and seemingly no longer an attractive proposition to businesses that once lined up to attach his name to theirs. Four months after his agent Mark Steinberg claimed he was &quot;close&quot; to signing new deals for his client nothing has been announced. Sunday&apos;s 20th-place finish in Dubai marked the 17th successive event in which Woods has failed to win. It is the longest run he has gone without a victory. Woods was fired by his long-time instructor Hank Haney last May and, after a succession of poor results, started to work in August with the Canadian coach Sean Foley, who also teaches Justin Rose and the USA Ryder Cup player Hunter Mahan. His results showed a marked improvement but with expectations high at the start of this season, his 44th-place finish at the PGA Tour event in Torrey Pines \u2013 where he had won seven times \u2013 followed by a weak performance in Dubai over the weekend, when he played himself out of contention with rounds of 74 and 75, have been a disappointment. Woods continues to insist his game is making progress, pointing out he embarked on significant swing changes in 1998 and 2004, and on both occasions his form dipped before he started winning again. &quot;All of my old feels are out of the window when the wind blows, that&apos;s the thing when you&apos;re making a change,&quot; he said in Dubai. &quot;I went through this with [former coaches] Butch Harmon and Hank Haney. It&apos;s fine when the wind is not blowing but when I have to hit [different] shots and the wind blows, the change of feels and the new swing patterns get exposed. I have been through this before.

But there are also difficult types. Is hereditary peer Viscount Waverley of Westdean one of them? Yesterday Rachel Reeves, the democratically elected MP for Leeds West, arrived at the Lords for a meeting with Lord McKenzie of Luton. They thought the room had been pre-booked. Both were accompanied by officials from leading charities anxious to discuss the aged and their pensions. Perhaps the room had been double booked, for in it was Viscount Waverley recording a TV interview. Unfortunate, but hardly unusual. Yet something about the interruption so infuriated the peer that he quite forgot himself and had a tantrum. &quot;Who on earth are you?&quot; he raged at the MP and her guests. &quot;What are you doing here? I don&apos;t care who you are, or who you think you are. Just get out of this room.&quot; Everyone was a bit shocked, especially as he also turned on a second group that arrived with Lord McKenzie moments later. And particularly as Viscount Waverley is, he tells us, a man for respect and courtesy. &quot;It&apos;s sad,&quot; he said afterwards. Sad that it happened.&quot; So it was. Hope he came over better on the telly. \u2022 Trouble for Dr Liam Fox, with siren voices intent on undermining the hard man of the Tory right and acolytes in his constituency. The tears we shed, we shed for him. Even so, David Cameron seems relaxed about it all, not least because he knows that the Ministry of Defence is in good hands: for whenever there is a problem, we are told, he calls his man in the ministry, Nick Harvey, the Liberal Democrat, to find out what the unlovable secretary of state is up to. Harvey is usually able to reassure him. A funny arrangement but it works out well. \u2022 Elsewhere, the cuts are beginning to bite and the politicians are getting ready to rumble. This is Amina Lone, of Manchester city council, declaring the Labour group&apos;s undying opposition. &quot;Manchester is fortunate to have an exemplary Labour leadership team whose members are preparing to resist,&quot; she said, rousing the troops in Tribune magazine. &quot;We will stand shoulder to shoulder with the people in our communities. Navel gazing will be no use and is not an option.&quot; Lone goes on to say: &quot;Labour&apos;s responsibility to the people of the city is to fight back at each and every stage.&quot; And the manifestation of this never say die approach? Sorry, comrades; 2,000 jobs to go. \u2022 It&apos;s not their fault or hers. It is all the result of Big Dave&apos;s plan to make us leaner and fitter. Still, there is debate about the extent to which Labour councils should be willing to pass cuts on. And already it is reaching fever pitch in Lambeth, south London, where Labourites come under the steely gaze of &quot;Red Ted&quot; Knight, who famously led the authority in the Thatcher era when it defied the government and refused to set a rate. &quot;You act as the axe-wielders for the coalition,&quot; raged Ted, now 77, his tour de force reported by councillor Mark Bennett. And you are stuck in the past, responds Bennett in his equally feisty blog. And the headline? Knight of the Living Dead. \u2022 Exciting times in Barnes, west London, where Supermum, aka Nicola Horlick, continues to circulate her letter seeking investors for a restaurant/private club business. These things are never exact science. But we can tell her about the 92-year-old woman who received the letter via a care home. She&apos;s not nearly rich enough, Nicola. Assume she&apos;s not interested. \u2022 Finally, as a downtrodden people look to a brighter future, a thoughtful commentary. &quot;Egypt is on the move. Once people start protesting in those kind of numbers the politicians have to listen. What I can&apos;t get my head around is everyone saying democracy is the way forward. I don&apos;t think it is. Look at us. I lived in Dubai. They have a ruling family and all&apos;s well. Giving the people a right to choose who governs them is a stupid thing to do.&quot; And yet, against all the evidence, people continue to seek the benefits of universal suffrage.

Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, codenamed Curveball by German and American intelligence officials who dealt with his claims, has told the Guardian that he fabricated tales of mobile bioweapons trucks and clandestine factories in an attempt to bring down the Saddam Hussein regime, from which he had fled in 1995. &quot;Maybe I was right, maybe I was not right,&quot; he said. &quot;They gave me this chance. I had the chance to fabricate something to topple the regime. I and my sons are proud of that and we are proud that we were the reason to give Iraq the margin of democracy.&quot; The admission comes just after the eighth anniversary of Colin Powell&apos;s speech to the United Nations in which the then-US secretary of state relied heavily on lies that Janabi had told the German secret service, the BND. It also follows the release of former defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld&apos;s memoirs, in which he admitted Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction programme. The careers of both men were seriously damaged by their use of Janabi&apos;s claims, which he now says could have been \u2013 and were \u2013 discredited well before Powell&apos;s landmark speech to the UN on 5 February 2003. The former CIA chief in Europe Tyler Drumheller describes Janabi&apos;s admission as &quot;fascinating&quot;, and said the emergence of the truth &quot;makes me feel better&quot;. &quot;I think there are still a number of people who still thought there was something in that. Even now,&quot; said Drumheller. In the only other at length interview Janabi has given he denied all knowledge of his supposed role in helping the US build a case for invading Saddam&apos;s Iraq. In a series of meetings with the Guardian in Germany where he has been granted asylum, he said he had told a German official, who he identified as Dr Paul, about mobile bioweapons trucks throughout 2000. He said the BND had identified him as a Baghdad-trained chemical engineer and approached him shortly after 13 March of that year, looking for inside information about Saddam&apos;s Iraq. &quot;I had a problem with the Saddam regime,&quot; he said. &quot;I wanted to get rid of him and now I had this chance.&quot; He portrays the BND as gullible and so eager to tease details from him that they gave him a Perry&apos;s Chemical Engineering Handbook to help communicate. He still has the book in his small, rented flat in Karlsruhe, south-west Germany. &quot;They were asking me about pumps for filtration, how to make detergent after the reaction,&quot; he said. &quot;Any engineer who studied in this field can explain or answer any question they asked.&quot; Janabi claimed he was first exposed as a liar as early as mid-2000, when the BND travelled to a Gulf city, believed to be Dubai, to speak with his former boss at the Military Industries Commission in Iraq, Dr Bassil Latif. The Guardian has learned separately that British intelligence officials were at that meeting, investigating a claim made by Janabi that Latif&apos;s son, who was studying in Britain, was procuring weapons for Saddam. That claim was proven false, and Latif strongly denied Janabi&apos;s claim of mobile bioweapons trucks and another allegation that 12 people had died during an accident at a secret bioweapons facility in south-east Baghdad. The German officials returned to confront him with Latif&apos;s version. &quot;He says, &apos;There are no trucks,&apos; and I say, &apos;OK, when [Latif says] there no trucks then [there are none],&apos;&quot; Janabi recalled. He said the BND did not contact him again until the end of May 2002. But he said it soon became clear that he was still being taken seriously. He claimed the officials gave him an incentive to speak by implying that his then pregnant Moroccan-born wife may not be able to travel from Spain to join him in Germany if he did not co-operate with them. &quot;He says, you work with us or your wife and child go to Morocco.&quot; The meetings continued throughout 2002 and it became apparent to Janabi that a case for war was being constructed. He said he was not asked again about the bioweapons trucks until a month before Powell&apos;s speech. After the speech, Janabi said he called his handler at the BND and accused the secret service of breaking an agreement that they would not share anything he had told them with another country. He said he was told not to speak and placed in confinement for around 90 days. With the US now leaving Iraq, Janabi said he was comfortable with what he did, despite the chaos of the past eight years and the civilian death toll in Iraq, which stands at more than 100,000. &quot;I tell you something when I hear anybody \u2013 not just in Iraq but in any war \u2013 [is] killed, I am very sad. But give me another solution. Can you give me another solution? &quot;Believe me, there was no other way to bring about freedom to Iraq.

As US secretary of state, Colin Powell gathered his notes in front of the United Nations security council, the man watching \u2014 Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, known to the west&apos;s intelligence services as &quot;Curveball&quot; \u2014 had more than an inkling of what was to come. He was, after all, Powell&apos;s main source, a man his German handlers had feted as a new &quot;Deep throat&quot; \u2014 an agent so pivotal that he could bring down a government. As Curveball watched Powell make the US case to invade Iraq, he was hiding an admission that he has not made until now: that nearly every word he had told his interrogators from Germany&apos;s secret service, the BND, was a lie. Everything he had said about the inner workings of Saddam Hussein&apos;s biological weapons programme was a flight of fantasy - one that, he now claims was aimed at ousting the Iraqi dictator. Janabi, a chemical engineering graduate who had worked in the Iraqi industry, says he looked on in shock as Powell&apos;s presentation revealed that the Bush administration&apos;s hawkish decisionmakers had swallowed the lot. Something else left him even more amazed; until that point he had not met a US official, let alone been interviewed by one. &quot;I had the chance to fabricate something to topple the regime,&quot; he told the Guardian in a series of interviews carried out in his native Arabic and German. &quot;I and my sons are proud of that, and we are proud that we were the reason to give Iraq the margin of democracy.&quot; His interviews with the Guardian, which took place over two days, appeared to be partly a purge of conscience, partly an attempt to justify what he did. It also seems to be a bid to resurrect his own reputation, which might help him start again in Iraq \u2014 a country that eight years later is still reeling from more than 100,000 civilian deaths and the aftermath of a savage sectarian war. The man who pulled off one of the greatest confidence tricks in the history of modern intelligence was not easy to pin down. He arrived at a hotel in his adopted home town of Karlsruhe, looking haggard after a sleepless night spent emailing. Heavy set, with plaintive eyes, smelling strongly of cigarettes, and shuffling with nervous energy, he slunk into a chair to begin answering questions, a process he seemed very familiar with. &quot;Colin Powell didn&apos; t say I was the only reason for this war,&quot; he said. &quot;He talked about three things. First of all, uranium; secondly, al-Qaida; and thirdly, my story. &quot;I don&apos;t know why the other sources, for the uranium and al-Qaida, remained hidden and my name got out. I accept it, though, because I did something for my country and for me that was enough.&quot; Since the fall of Baghdad, Curveball&apos;s identity had been sought throughout Iraq and Europe. He was finally outed in late 2007 as the main source for Powell&apos;s speech, but has tried to keep a low profile ever since, refusing \u2014 under the orders of the BND \u2014 the approaches of the few reporters who had tracked him downto Karlsruhe. The only other time Curveball has agreed to be interviewed was in late 2007, when he told CNN that he had been set up as a fall guy by the BND and had never breathed a word to them about WMD. Last year, he called the police on a Danish documentary crew who came knocking. Curveball claims he was granted asylum by the German government on 13 March 2000, less than six months after arriving in Germany and before he had even been asked a question about biological weapons. He emphasises this point, aware that he could be seen as a simple opportunist. &quot;The story about the biochemical weapons had nothing to do with my asylum claim. The German state \u2014 well, the BND, or someone from Germany, have said that I told them about the chemicals, because I wanted to claim asylum. That&apos;s not true.&quot; He says that around three weeks after he was granted asylum, a German official, whom he identified as Dr Paul, came to see him. On his application, he had said he had worked as a chemical engineer, a fact that attracted extra attention. &quot;He told me he needed some information about my life. He said it was very important, that Iraq had a dictator and I needed to help.&quot; At this point, according to Curveball, he decided to let his imagination run wild. For the next six months, he sat with Paul \u2014 the BND&apos;s resident expert on weapons of mass destruction - and calling upon his knowledge of chemical engineering from university and from his work in Baghdad, he manufactured a tale of dread. This period was the genesis of Powell&apos;s fateful speech; what Curveball told Paul became the key pillar of Powell&apos;s UN presentation \u2014 the diagrams he displayed of mobile weapons trucks that could dispense biotoxins into the wind. &quot;We have first-hand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels,&quot; Powell said. &quot;The source was an eyewitness \u2014 an Iraqi chemical engineer who supervised one of these facilities. He was present during biological agent production runs. He was also at the site when an accident occurred in 1998. Twelve technicians died.&quot; The effect at the UN was dramatic. Here was a detailed first-hand account from an insider of the sinister and deceptive inner workings of Saddam&apos;s regime. It was tangible evidence; far more compelling than the other two elements of Powell&apos;s case for war, which seemed scant in detail and unlikely to persuade the invasion&apos;s naysayers. Even now, Curveball seems bemused that his lies got as far as they did. He says he thought the game was up by the end of 2000. By that point, the BND had flown to Dubai to interview his former boss at Iraq&apos;s military industrial complex, Dr Basil Latif, who had told them that his former underling was a liar. Several British intelligence officers were present at the meeting with Latif. Their German counterparts left Dubai seeing their prized source in a new light. According to them, Curveball had claimed that Latif&apos;s son, who was then at school in Britain, was a procurer of WMD. That information was easily proven wrong by the British spooks. The BND then returned to Germany and sent an officer to confront their source. &quot;He says &apos;there (are) no trucks&apos; and I say, ok, when (Dr Basil says) there are no trucks then (there are none),&quot; Curveball recalled in broken English. &quot;I did not speak to them again until (the) end of May 2002.&quot; By the time the BND came calling again, Curveball says he had fended for himself for almost 18 months. He had been paid a monthly stipend by his handler, but had not been asked to do anything for the state. &quot;When he come back to me, he don&apos;t ask me (the same questions),&quot; he says of the 2002 meetings. &quot;He ask me, for example, the name of signs, the name of establishment, do you know this person.&quot; He admitted continuing to lie to his interrogators throughout the year. Curveball suggests that the BND implied that his then-pregnant wife, who was at that point trying to get to Germany from Spain, would not be able to join him unless he co-operated. &quot;He says, you work with us or your wife and child go to Morocco.&quot; According to his account, there were at least a dozen meetings in 2002. He says none of the new round of questions dealt with a birdseed purification plant, in Djerf al-Nadaf in south-east Baghdad, that he had claimed was where Saddam&apos;s bioweapons programme was based. This was supposed to be where the mobile trucks were loaded up. &quot;The BND did not ask me about this project, because they knew I was not right.&quot; But in January 2003, several weeks before Powell&apos;s speech, the interrogation returned to trucks and birdseed. &quot;That was the first time they had talked to me about this since 2000.&quot; Curveball says it was clear to him that the drums of war were beating ever louder, but he maintains that he still thought his story about the mobile trucks had been discounted. Then came the UN speech. He says the BND had told him that everything he had told them would stay in Germany and that he was shocked to see Powell holding up diagrams that he knew had been prepared from his fraudulent descriptions. &quot;So I call the person that is responsible for me. I tell him that I see what Colin says, and he says &apos;ok, this ist ein klein&apos;, a small problem. You come ... tomorrow, and you speak with me. (He said) you must go now from this home because this flat is very dangerous for you and for your family. From 9 April you can return.&quot; For the next two months, Curveball claims he was in virtual lockdown, prevented by the BND from watching TV and having limited contact with anyone outside his hotel. He said he knew the war had begun from snatched conversations with strangers. Asked about how he felt as the bodycount among of countrymen mounted and Iraq descended into chaos, Curveball shifted uncomfortably in his chair, then said: &quot;I tell you something when I hear anybody \u2013 not just in Iraq but in any war \u2013 (is) killed, I am very sad. But give me another solution. Can you give me another solution? &quot;Believe me, there was no other way to bring about freedom to Iraq. There were no other possibilities.&quot; &quot;Saddam did not [allow] freedom in our land. There are no other political parties. You have to believe what Saddam says, and do what Saddam wants. And I don&apos;t accept that. I have to do something for my country. So I did this and I am satisfied, because there is no dictator in Iraq any more.&quot; Curveball&apos;s reinvention as a liberator and patriot is a tough sell to many in the CIA, the BND and in the Bush administration, whose careers were terminally wounded as mystery surrounding the whereabouts of the missing bioweapons in the post-invasion months turned into the reality that there were none. His critics \u2014 who are many and powerful \u2014 say the cost of his deception is too difficult to estimate, even now. As the US scales back its presence in Iraq it is leaving behind an unstable country, whose allegiance \u2014 after eight years of blood and treasure \u2014 may not be to the US and its allies after all. For Curveball though, it&apos;s time to reinvent himself. He has returned twice to Iraq and started a political party, winning a modest 1,700-odd votes in the general election last March. He has also written a manuscript about his past 10 years and is looking for a publisher. In the meantime, things seem to be turning increasingly sour with the BND. The spooks helped him, his wife and two children get German citizenship in 2008. At the same time they cut off his stipend of \u20ac3,000 (\u00a32,500) per month and told him to fend for himself. That has proved difficult around Karlsruhe, a medium-sized university town near the French/German border where his reputation as a fantasist travels ahead of him. On the first day of our interviews, an official at the town hall told him he and his family are forbidden from leaving the country. He now spends his days in a rented flat on the outskirts of town with a doting wife \u2014 who says she only learned of her husband&apos;s exploits three years ago \u2014 and two young children. He no longer has the Mercedes Benz that the BND had supplied him with. And he is well aware that the secret service \u2014 and his new homeland \u2013 seems to be fast tiring of him. &quot;I will be honest with you. I now have a lot of problems because the BND have taken away my flat, taken my mobile phone: I&apos;m in a bad position. But if I could go back to 2000, if someone asked me, I would say the same thing because I wouldn&apos;t want that regime to continue in our country.&quot;", "title": "Curveball: How US was duped by Iraqi fantasist looking to topple Saddam", "sentences": ["By that point, the BND had flown to Dubai to interview his former boss at Iraq&apos;s military industrial complex, Dr Basil Latif, who had told them that his former underling was a liar.", "Their German counterparts left Dubai seeing their prized source in a new light."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-15T17:13:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/feb/16/the-fiver-gattuso-jordan-arsenal-barcelona", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "WE ARE THE PIGS The Fiver has desperately been trying to educate itself about the beautiful game for some time now. But no matter how hard we try to improve ourselves by studying videos of golden-era Brazil, or poring over Helenio Herrera&apos;s chalkboards from the 1963-64 season (not including cups because one-off ties skew the data), it&apos;s no good. We are nothing more than pigs. Ignorant swine who roll around in filth. See, you can keep your 20-pass moves that win World Cup finals, and complex defensive systems that conquer Europe: when push comes to shove, literally, we always find ourselves back at base level, enjoying nothing more than matches which descend into saloon brawls. So imagine how happy the Fiver was last night to see Gennaro Gattuso performing random shuttle runs back and forth across the San Siro pitch, smoke coming out of his ears as he displayed all the tactical awareness of the ghosts from Pac Man, his entire reason for living reduced to a pointless desire to wind up Peter Crouch. Imagine our glee at watching Gattuso, having failed dismally in his task, flicking quickly through the main stages of impotent anger - 1) Scrappy Doo; 2) Jay Kay in full and frank exchange of views with photographer; 3) James Finlayson upon having his grand piano dropped down six flights of stairs by delivery men Laurel and Hardy \u2013 then taking Spurs assistant Joe Jordan by the throat and softly sticking the nut on him, those early years in Glasgow clearly formative. Have you imagined our happiness? And our glee? Yes you have, yes you have. In fact, so high was the Fiver&apos;s state of amusement, we almost reached the same levels of contentment attained by Sky pundit Graeme Souness, who seconds after the Jordan spat was seen with a large smile playing across his chops, vigorously rubbing his thighs like Vic does in Shooting Stars, the most spiritually sated he&apos;s been since Hibs-O&apos;Rangers in 1986. As you&apos;d expect from such an incident, there&apos;s been fallout today, with Uefa promising to open disciplinary proceedings whether the referee mentions the brouhaha in his report or not. &quot;The incident would not necessarily need to be mentioned in the reports,&quot; it announced. &quot;From time to time it can happen that things are not mentioned but we are made aware of incidents through media reports,&quot; continued Uefa, in no way pre-empting the administrative accuracy of that clown who was refereeing last night, or assuming he&apos;ll have misjudged the entire carry-on much like he did when Mathieu Flamini went for a wander up Vedran Corluka&apos;s leg. Unlike the flying thug Flamini, the Fiver retains some fondness for Gattuso, who is more of a cartoon eejit than anything truly sinister. At the very least, he appears to have quickly come to his senses and realised that he acted like a complete balloon. Gattuso&apos;s Mr 15% has suggested former Milan striker Jordan busted his client&apos;s balls by calling him an &quot;[eff]ing Italian [bee]&quot;, but the player doesn&apos;t appear to be looking for an out, issuing a trenchant apology instead. &quot;I lost my head,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I did things I should not have done and I take responsibility for that. Jordan busted my balls for the whole second half, but I should not have reacted like this. I apologise, and if a ban arrives I will accept it.&quot; So that&apos;s that sorted, then. No harm done. Now, what&apos;s next? Arsenal and Barcelona, is it? Don&apos;t worry about the tiki-taka, lads, can one of you just start a punch-up, please? QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;These are people who have no friends. If me and you want to have a chat about something then we&apos;ll do that after work at the pub. But the people who spend 10 hours a day on the internet have no one to talk to. They are the same people who go on X Factor. You know right away they are useless singers but they didn&apos;t have any mates to tell them the truth. If I told my mate I was going on X Factor he&apos;d say, &apos;Are you [effing] kidding? Don&apos;t be so stupid&apos;. But these people don&apos;t have friends to keep them right. So they go on X Factor, get four &apos;no thanks&apos; and are laughed off stage. So they go home disappointed they didn&apos;t make it on X Factor and think, &apos;What will I do now? I know, I&apos;ll get my computer out and write stuff on messageboards about [Queen&apos;s] Celtic and [Pope&apos;s O&apos;] Rangers. It&apos;s the same people&quot; - Wee Gordon Strachan embarks on a typically meandering rant and makes a ground-breaking link between people that comment on blog talkboards and rubbish singers. PASS MASTERS The more fervent the anticipation, the more frustrating the anti-climax. That tends to be the way of things, as the Jonas Brothers&apos; future wives may learn. Yet even with that knowledge nagging away like, perhaps, the Jones Brothers&apos; future wives, it is hard not to get excited about tonight&apos;s Big Cup bout between Arsenal and Barcelona.

In case you haven&apos;t yet overdosed on the hype leading up to this match, let the Fiver remind you that Arsenal and Barcelona play football &quot;the right way&quot;. It is clear from the many previews that here are two teams who represent a blissful union of science and faith, their methods meticulous, their intentions saintly. &quot;We&apos;ve got to change our game a bit to play against Barcelona,&quot; chirped new England darling Jack Wilshere, veering alarmingly off message. &quot;We need to be a bit nasty,&quot; added the schemer, though whether being nasty is really such a radical departure for a team that has perpetrated more fouls in the Premier League this season than supposed cloggers Stoke, Wolves and Lee Cattermole is open to studs-up, elbows-and-all debate. &quot;We will certainly be aggressive,&quot; growled Samir Nasri after declaring that he will be fit enough to start. &quot;That is something new we&apos;ve got this season, we are not the naive Arsenal of the past,&quot; continued the Frenchman, hopefully before sticking a loaf on all those jaded guff-spewers who insist Arsenal must triumph tonight because they have no chance of winning the return leg given the vastness of the Camp Nou pitch, which, in fact, is exactly the same size as the Emirates one.

You doubted Palacios \u2013 a tireless hero closing down Milan, not allowing them to play. You doubted Crouch \u2013 composed under constant fouling, energetic and crucially there at the end. You doubted Spurs&apos; tactics \u2013 attack and we won&apos;t have to park the bus. In short, you ensured that only one result was possible.\u00a0And for that I thank you&quot; - Sam Hedges (and 1,056 other Spurs fans). &quot;Re: apologising for calling people names (yesterday&apos;s Fiver letters).\u00a0Perhaps once Noble Francis has said sorry to everyone he went to secondary school with, he can call his parents and request an apology from them too?&quot; - Neil Speight. &quot;Re: yesterday&apos;s last line.

This afternoon stages the first two legs of the challenge and Richard Hughes can get off to a good start on Kavango (3.40), who faces a closely-matched bunch of rivals in the mile Tapeta handicap. He was a close second over course and distance behind Frankie Dettori&apos;s mount Mufarrh last time out but should have improved for that outing and can reverse the placings here. William Buick, who is returning from injury, can also go close on Godolphin&apos;s unexposed Quick Wit, who tries this trip for the first time. The second leg of the challenge is over 11 furlongs and again Godolphin have a strong hand, with the Japanese jockey Hiroyuki Uchida&apos;s mount Prizefighting having gone close in two course-and-distance starts already this term. However, preference is for the Ryan Moore-ridden Emirates Champion (4.55), who is a course-and-distance winner and has gone well fresh in the past. The official feature is the Group Two Al Fahidi Fort, over a mile on Turf, and on paper it looks an open renewal. Derbaas has been hugely progressive this term and won well in handicap-company over course and distance last time but he may be vulnerable to the classy Raihana (5.35), who gets a pull at the weights over all but one rival and makes a quick reappearance after her easy success a week ago. The longest race of the night is the Listed Nad Al Sheba Trophy over just short of two miles and this looks a good opportunity for Opinion Poll (4.15) to regain the winning thread. Proving last time out that he handles Meydan&apos;s fast track when a late-closing second behind Whispering Gallery, he is the class act here, although Drunken Sailor and Star Empire are also sure to give good accounts. Earlier on the card, the Hong Kong Sprint winner JJ The Jet Plane makes his Meydan debut in the six furlong Tapeta handicap but has to concede upwards of six kilos to his rivals. Therefore watch for Alazayab (3.05), eye-catching in second on his seasonal return, to upset the likely favourite. Mares Invincible Ash and Alo Pura can also go close. Tomorrow&apos;s card features the last two heats of the Meydan Masters and Johnny Murtagh, riding in the unfamiliar blue of Godolphin, has a strong chance in the penultimate leg. He has drawn Calvados Blues (3.50), a good second last time after making the running, who can go close again. Hughes, on the quirky Age Of Reason, looks the danger. The final leg of the event is wide open, so it may pay to side with Buick, who has drawn a familiar ally in Kal Barg (17.05). A Meydan Masters winner last season in the hands of Christophe Lemaire, he should be too good again here. Tomorrow&apos;s pattern event is the Group Two Balanchine, over nine furlongs, and it can go the way of River Jetez (6.20), who looked unlucky behind the reopposing Aspectoflove in the Cape Verdi last time. Stablemate Reem, utterly dependable so far in two starts on the all-weather, receives weight and can also feature on her return to turf.

What ingenious or world-changing object will capture the zeitgeist this year, I asked myself as I strolled through. Last year I was one of the judges and we awarded the prize to a folding plug by an unknown student. It felt like a good decision. No famous designers, no grand narratives. It was a vote for the small and perfectly formed, for the overlooked, for the everyday. The shortlist feels weaker this year, and I&apos;m not saying that because I&apos;m not on the panel. For one thing, there&apos;s less of the social and political engagement that has become the hallmark of the design of the year award. Previous years have seen it go to a laptop for children in the developing world and the Obama &quot;Hope&quot; poster. And while those may have been crowd-pleasers, there were entries last year forcing bankers to confront the cost of food in Bangladesh or highlighting inflation in Zimbabwe. This show falls back on the idea of design as refined objects \u2013 as stuff. On those terms, the question is which ones stand out in this land of plenty.     Mimosa by Jason Bruges Studio. Photo: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images    Any prize that aims to collect the best across the varied fields of design \u2013 from architecture to furniture, from graphic design to transport \u2013 presents its judges with an unenviable task. It feels arbitrary pitting a Renault concept car against a new edition of Tristram Shandy. Neither does it make for the most coherent exhibition. What is inspiring about this annual snapshot approach, however, is the sense it offers of watching the design world evolve. Gradually, almost imperceptibly,\u00a0our material environment gets better, smarter and lighter. Especially lighter. In the 80s and 90s, everyone thought that the future was tiny. Led by the Japanese, we assumed our electronic appliances would miniaturise until we had cameras the size of wine gums. Today, we seem to be more preoccupied with lightness. New superlight materials such as carbon fibre \u2013 of which the exhibition&apos;s delicate display system is made \u2013 allow designers to achieve seemingly impossible feats. As a material property, lightness is not just elegant, it&apos;s more sustainable. The show features no category for something called &quot;sustainability&quot; \u2013 a good thing because, as I wrote recently, this should be a prerequisite of all design, not an add-on label. It was certainly the more mercurial ones to which I was drawn. And so if this year&apos;s judges find themselves furrowing their brows about the task ahead, perhaps they should simply choose the lightest. But which will the judges really go for? Let&apos;s start with the heaviest of the disciplines \u2013 architecture. The judges may quickly find themselves down to two candidates: Dubai&apos;s Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, and Thomas Heatherwick&apos;s wildly popular UK Pavilion from last year&apos;s Shanghai Expo. There is no social imperative here. Both are frivolous pieces of national branding, and yet both have the capacity to leave the viewer awestruck. I&apos;m certain the judges will opt for Heatherwick to top this category, as this is not the moment to be celebrating a boom-and-bust white elephant like the Burj. However, a less orthodox and virtually weightless choice would be a series of experimental structures by the Croatian-Austrian collective Numen/For Use, which look like a silken cocoon or cobweb. You can imagine them as sci-fi architectural parasites strung buoyantly between the skyscrapers of a Miss Haversham city, its rigid glass and steel gradually returning to the chaos of nature. Of course, one hopes that it would be made of something a bit more sophisticated than sticky tape. How about the furniture category? Will the judges be seduced by an office chair inspired by a suspension bridge, designed by the ubiquitous Yves B\u00e9har, or a beautifully turned wooden chair by Industrial Facility? I found myself captivated, again, by the light choice \u2013 a featherweight stool by recent Royal College of Art graduate Seongyong Lee. Lee created an entirely new material by laminating wood veneer to produce a lighter, stronger and much more beautiful version of cardboard. Picking it up, it&apos;s as though the stool is full of helium. It&apos;s not just that he&apos;s created a perfect archetypal object, but a material that feels almost immaterial, and that can be used to make anything from tables to pavilions. The only object in the exhibition that stands out as a potential overall winner is in the product design category: the iPad. So successful has this game-changing piece of technology been that it should have its own category \u2013 indeed it pretty much does, since most of the entries in the interactive design section are apps for the iPad, displayed on iPads. But it&apos;s possible that the judges will avoid the obvious, popular, zeitgeisty choice and stick it to Apple \u2013 especially since one of the judges confessed, to me, &quot;I don&apos;t like the internet&quot;. I rather liked Ingo Maurer&apos;s Flying Future hanging light, a diaphanous membrane inserted with organic LEDs (OLEDs). So energy efficient that they last almost indefinitely, these films of organic semiconductor are the light source of the future. They hold the potential for light to be treated as a material in itself, like cloth, draped as luminous surfaces. With the relentless march of digital technology, the graphic design section of the show seems to be retreating into a world of nostalgia. It is wonderful to see the beauty of printed books reasserted, though I wondered why so many of those here are new editions of 18th- and 19th-century novels. Ironically, the work that jumps out here does so because it&apos;s miniscule (and, yes, light): Irma Boom&apos;s Boom. The most respected book designer in the world has produced a 704-page catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of her work, but it&apos;s just two inches high. One doesn&apos;t see that kind of modesty often. Or perhaps it&apos;s not modesty at all, but mystical devotion to her craft. The book is reminiscent of one of those medieval miniature Qur&apos;ans written with a horse&apos;s hair. Of all the disciplines, lightness is most a virtue when it comes to transport. For all the talk of electric cars and high-speed rail, we are realising now that only by reducing the weight of our modes of transport so that they consume less energy can we make them more sustainable. Here, there&apos;s another clear winner: an aluminium bicycle by Dutch brand Vanmoof. I&apos;ll take it any day over the YikeBike, an electric penny-farthing that could have been designed by HR Giger and appears, like some Sinclair C5 of bikes, to be dead on arrival. The fashion category is anyone&apos;s guess. There&apos;s a reason why the Design Museum calls on an international panel of experts to nominate all the entries, and that&apos;s because design is a bewilderingly broad field and no one&apos;s an expert on all of it. As a show, it&apos;s hit and miss and there may be no agenda, but I recommend you go and see it. There&apos;s bound to be something there that will surprise you.", "title": "Light is right at the Brit Insurance Design awards 2011 \u2013 review", "sentences": ["The judges may quickly find themselves down to two candidates: Dubai&apos;s Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, and Thomas Heatherwick&apos;s wildly popular UK Pavilion from last year&apos;s Shanghai Expo."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-17T09:51:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/feb/18/tiger-woods-spitting", "tags": ["Tiger Woods", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "In The Friends of Richard Nixon, his book about the Watergate inquiry, lawyer-novelist George V Higgins is highly critical of the 37th president&apos;s swearing. It&apos;s not the frequent use of expletives that offends the author \u2013 who deployed plenty in his own fiction \u2013 but the amateurish way they are scattered about. Nixon&apos;s blaspheming and cursing sounds forced to Higgins, like a Sunday schoolteacher trying to impress rough boys. If you want to know what real swearing in the White House sounded like, Higgins observes, you should have listened to Nixon&apos;s predecessor Lyndon Johnson. LBJ was a swearing natural. He then quotes one of Johnson&apos;s fruitier similes. The crimewriter&apos;s point is forcefully made, too, because even today, close to half a century later, I would struggle to get the line past the Guardian&apos;s editors. Suffice to say that the big Texan compares a rival&apos;s impact on the political landscape to that which the arrival of ladies&apos; tights has had on the sexual habits of the nation. It&apos;s not big or clever, but it certainly sticks in your mind longer than anything Nick Clegg&apos;s ever said. I felt somewhat like George V Higgins\u00a0myself this week when I finally got around to watching the Tiger Woods Dubai spitting incident. Now, I\u00a0admit that I&apos;m slightly jaundiced on this topic, because I had to spend my school holidays in Dubai as a surly teenager and frankly anyone who spits on the place has my sympathy, but even so \u2013 it\u00a0was a whole lot of fuss over what was,\u00a0gobbing-wise, a damp squib. I mean, the bloke didn&apos;t even attempt to drag his nostrils first. I doubt there was enough tack in that grolly to hold up even the weakest putt. &quot;Call that spitting?&quot; I said to myself as Woods&apos;s lukewarm floss flopped listlessly earthwards. &quot;Hell&apos;s teeth, these people would have cacked themselves if they&apos;d seen Gecko&quot;. Gecko was in my school football team. He was tall and angular, with the outsize hands and feet of a fairground prize. His facial features were almost impossible to discern because his skin was permanently enraged. (And to be honest, if you&apos;d been stuck to Gecko&apos;s face 24 hours a day you&apos;d have been pretty cross yourself). Gecko played somewhere around the halfway line. He ran about irrationally and threw himself into tackles like they were foxholes, but he reserved most of his energy for spitting. Unlike Tiger, the lad really put his heart into it. And quite a lot of his lungs as well. Gecko&apos;s spit was not nebulous. It flew across the air like a Spanish omelette made from Evo-Stik, smacked its target with the squelching, pulpy slap of Jonny Wilkinson tackling the Kraken, and stuck as firmly as some carnivorous alien plant on to the face of a space marine. Wherever Gecko ran he deposited one. After 90 minutes the playing surface was a viscous minefield.\u00a0If Barcelona or Spain had attempted their short-passing game against us they&apos;d have got nowhere, I\u00a0can tell you. The walls of the boys&apos; changing rooms were likewise decorated with Gecko&apos;s throaty-nasal effluvia. Neither soap nor solvents could remove it. The caretaker had to chip it off with a cold chisel. Sputum, the tar of frequent No6s, catarrh, Spangles slivers and the reddish dye of aniseed balls gave the splotches the look of abstract expressionist artworks. Gecko was the Jackson Pollock of phlegm. Tiger Woods&apos;s flobbing was entirely feeble by comparison, but it has furthered the former world No1 golfer&apos;s fall from grace. According to my colleague Lawrence Donegan, &quot;[Woods&apos;s] image is a lost cause&quot;. Well, maybe, but only if he is intent on trying to make people think he is a nice\u00a0chap. This would now seem nigh on\u00a0impossible, so\u00a0surely the best course\u00a0for Woods&apos;s image consultants is to head in completely the opposite direction and attempt the sort of rehabilitation through recklessness achieved by Ossie Osborne? Golf is crying out for a genuine bad boy, someone the fans can truly loathe. Every other sport has them \u2013 even bowls managed to dig up Griff Sanders. Yet golf has lagged behind. OK, John Daly is a beer-swilling oik, but there&apos;s a fine line between evil and stupid, and Daly staggers across it in a cloud of king-size smoke, in much the same manner as Paul Gascoigne did. No, what golf needs is a smart-casual equivalent of boxing&apos;s H\u00e9ctor &quot;Macho Man&quot; Camacho, a preening lightweight who memorably observed, &quot;My girlfriend boos me when we make love because she knows it turns me on&quot; (well, that&apos;s why she told him she did it anyway), or Paul Nicholson, the dark star of darts who rightly observed, that some viewers get more interested in the\u00a0game if there&apos;s somebody to hate: &quot;If\u00a0you watch a soap opera for instance or a pantomime there&apos;s always the good\u00a0and the bad.&quot; Clearly this will not come naturally to\u00a0Woods, but if he can remodel his swing he can surely take a similar approach to restructuring his image.He could start by employing Gecko as his spitting coach.

I&apos;ve been doing some coaching. Do tell us more, Ian It&apos;s a Standard Chartered coaching clinic. We&apos;ve got loads of visually impaired kids, aged from eight to 14, and we&apos;re teaching them some basic skills. It&apos;s about connecting to local communities. It&apos;s good to see the kids running around with smiles on their faces \u2013 that&apos;s what it&apos;s all about at the end of the day. That is a very beautiful thing. Any plans to take it around the world? There are as it happens. I think we&apos;re going to Korea, India and Dubai. I&apos;ve already been out in Kenya. These people don&apos;t get the chance to go to Liverpool Football Club, so we&apos;re taking Liverpool Football Club to them. We tell them a little about the history of the club, what it&apos;s all about. You give them the atmosphere at Anfield. How many of these eight-to-14-year-olds know who Ian Rush is? Mainly it&apos;s the parents who remember me. But the kids today, what they do is go and Google you. A lot of them turn up and they know everything about me. They say: &quot;You scored 346 goals&quot; or &quot;You wore the No9 shirt for Liverpool&quot;. You&apos;re Liverpool&apos;s Soccer Schools Ambassador, but there was talk of you joining the first-team coaching setup under Kenny Dalglish. How close was that to happening? At the moment Kenny&apos;s still caretaker manager. I&apos;m happy with what I&apos;m doing, and until something happens, a new manager comes in or Kenny takes the job permanently, we&apos;ll just wait and see. What do you make of Kenny&apos;s impact at Anfield? I&apos;ve been very impressed. To win four and draw one out of the last five [league] games is very good. I think he&apos;s a great man-manager, but tactically he&apos;s fantastic as well. Were you surprised when he got the job? He wanted it, and he still wants it I think. He didn&apos;t get it in the summer because they thought he was so much a legend, and his ambassadorial role was important \u2013 but he was very highly thought of. The club&apos;s not going to make a rash decision but if the results carry on as they are, and the fans keep singing his name, you can see him staying. What happened to your own managerial ambitions? I managed Chester for a while, and Wales Under-17s. I&apos;ve done my coaching badges, I&apos;ve got my Pro Licence, but I enjoy what I&apos;m doing now. I&apos;m also the elite performance director of the Welsh FA. The main thing for me was always Liverpool Football Club and my country, Wales \u2013 and I&apos;m lucky enough to still be involved with both of them. Do you still keep an eye out for decent vacancies, though? Is your CV ready? Three or four years ago, yes, but now I&apos;m probably past that stage. I&apos;m very happy doing what I&apos;m doing, and I&apos;ll just see what happens. You never thought about leaving football behind and moving to Dubai (other retirement destinations are available)? Not really. The best thing you can possibly do is playing, and the next best thing is coaching or managing. When you finish playing you&apos;ve got to make a plan, because otherwise you&apos;ll never get over it. When I finished playing it took me two years to get over it, and then I did the coaching badges. You&apos;ve got to keep on improving. If you keep looking behind you get stuck in the past, and certain players have never got over the fact that their career is over. Has Fernando Torres&apos;s move to Chelsea stirred up memories of your own departure from Liverpool in 1987? It has a bit, yeah. Is it hard to see yourself getting replaced by the club you once loved? When I left, Kenny had a year to prepare [the deal with Juventus was agreed in 1986] and he did that by getting three players in \u2013 John Barnes, Peter Beardsley and John Aldridge. No one&apos;s bigger than the club, that&apos;s the truth. It&apos;s harder this time because he hasn&apos;t had a year to prepare, but he has replaced one world-class player with two players who have the potential to be as good as, or better than, Torres. I think Liverpool got the better deal. Kenny&apos;s not looking to the present, he&apos;s looking to the future. There were lots of rumours, as your move to Juventus approached, that you considered backing out. How close did you come to calling it off and staying in England? As my time at Anfield was coming to an end I did get a bit sentimental. I wondered what I was doing, leaving this great club. There was a campaign by the fans to keep me, and that made me think twice. But the deal was done, that&apos;s why I left. And I had the opportunity to make myself financially secure for life. That&apos;s where the money was at that time, in Italy. The fans offered to pay an extra 25p each per match so the club could afford to keep you ... I would have actually stayed, that&apos;s the thing. But Liverpool probably needed the \u00a33.2m. It was a lot of money for the club then, and it would have been hard to get out of my contract at that stage. Did anything good come out of your time in Italy? I learned how to grow up. I realised I&apos;d been spoiled at Liverpool. We were used to winning. In Italy I grew up as a person. I didn&apos;t enjoy the football, mind. It was very defensive, but I became a better player because of the work I had to do around the box. Off the pitch, I learned about what to eat and what to drink to be successful, and I learned about life. Did you bring those lessons back home with you? Yeah, I did. I wasn&apos;t a big pasta eater before that. Before I&apos;d be drinking beer, but in Italy they taught us that we could have a glass of wine so long as we had a glass of water with it as well. You can enjoy yourself, but you need to look after yourself as well. And I played until I was 38 because of that. You were never tempted to go out at the top? People say you should go out at the top but I was enjoying my football so much. Robbie Fowler&apos;s exactly the same: he&apos;s not playing for money any more, he&apos;s playing for enjoyment. Why go out at the top if it&apos;s going to make you miserable? I just wanted to play as long as I could. When you stop playing, you&apos;re not going to get it back. When you don&apos;t enjoy it, that&apos;s the time to pack it in. I had one year left on my deal at Wrexham but I wasn&apos;t enjoying it, and I told them I&apos;d prefer to go. Have you developed any hobbies since you retired? I love horse racing, I play golf, and I love travelling. With my job I spend a lot of time travelling in the Middle and far East, learning about the cultures of different countries, by being there. I&apos;ve got tremendous respect for different cultures, for the food and everything. Where&apos;s your favourite destination? Malaysia \u2013 I go there every year. The people are friendly, the scenery&apos;s lovely. You have to go. I took my family last year and they fell in love with it as well. We&apos;ll bear that in mind in the unlikely event of the Guardian&apos;s cellarmaster unchaining us. Where do you get the best food? I like Thai food, the rice and everything and the curries and all the different things. I wouldn&apos;t say I&apos;m a very spicy person, and if I&apos;d just been in England I most probably would never have tried it, but that&apos;s one of my favourites now. What&apos;s your favourite pasta shape? I like the little tubes. The penne? I&apos;m absolutely useless at cooking, though. I can do a Welsh rarebit and that&apos;s about it. Welsh Rarebit? Very patriotic ... Yeah, I learned that out of national pride. And I liked it as a kid. What about the horse racing \u2013 have you ever owned one? Yeah, I&apos;ve had a couple. I&apos;m about to get one in Ireland. I had one by myself which was no good and one with Jan Molby that won a few things, Great Marquess [Small Talk has looked it up \u2013 it won five races, which The Guardian&apos;s racing editor assures us makes it quite good]. I never made any money out of it, mind. What&apos;s the last record you bought? I bought my wife a record for Valentine&apos;s Day called From Me to You, I think. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s any good. When I was younger my hero was David Bowie, and being Welsh I like Stereophonics and Manic Street Preachers. Especially the Stereophonics, because Kelly&apos;s a friend of mine as well. What&apos;s in your pockets right now? Some money and a pen for autographs. How many autographs do you think you get through in an average week? I dread to think. I&apos;ve got a whole table of stuff in front of me right now. Well into four figures. What&apos;s the last film you saw in the cinema? The King&apos;s Speech. I loved it. Who would win a fight between a lion and a tiger? I&apos;d have to say the lion, because they&apos;re bigger, I think. Just a guess. King of the jungle, isn&apos;t it? Lastly, can you tell us a joke? Not really, no. Nothing comes straight to mind. Not one you can print, anyway. Fair enough. Thanks for the chat, Rushy. You&apos;re very welcome, Small Talk.

Formula One&apos;s commercial rights holder sounded more confident early on Friday that the Bahrain grand prix would go ahead despite the protests in Manama, which have put the race on 13 March at serious risk. But amid reports of renewed unrest in Manama&apos;s Pearl Square, with shots fired and reports of at least 20 injuries, Ecclestone later said the situation\u00a0remained fluid. &quot;From a realistic point of view it appears that things are changing hourly,&quot; he said. &quot;I feel the most important thing now is to wait until after the weekend, to see what happens over the next few days, and then make a decision next Tuesday or Wednesday.&quot; Ecclestone, having sought to expand the Formula One calendar into new, profitable parts of the world in recent years, sidestepped questions about whether the sport should travel to countries that meet protests for democratic change with violent crackdowns. &quot;It seems as if people thought it was democratic a few weeks ago,&quot; he said. &quot;We have never, ever, ever been involved in religion and politics. We don&apos;t make decisions based on those things.&quot; Four protesters were killed and 231 wounded when riot police drove activists from a makeshift camp in Bahrain&apos;s capital on Thursday. Dozens were detained. Several thousand mourners turned out on Friday for the funerals of three of those killed. Races scheduled for the Sakhir circuit this weekend have been cancelled. &quot;We pulled the GP2 race; it&apos;s the Asian series so it&apos;s not terribly important,&quot; Ecclestone said. &quot;We don&apos;t want to take any chances. Yesterday we decided to do that. Probably today, if we had to make the same decision on the information I&apos;ve got, we probably wouldn&apos;t do that. &quot;Let&apos;s hope this all just blows away. In these parts there have always been skirmishes. This is perhaps a bit more than that.&quot; The teams say they will follow guidance from Ecclestone and motor sport&apos;s world governing body, the FIA. Speaking on behalf of the Formula One Teams Association after a two-hour meeting, Red Bull&apos;s team principal, Christian Horner, said: &quot;It&apos;s obviously a really difficult situation in Bahrain. &quot;But we have complete trust in Bernie, FOM [Formula One Management] and the FIA to make the right decision. They will only send us there if it is safe. &quot;It would be a great shame to lose the race, but it&apos;s not the teams&apos; decision - it&apos;s down to the promoter. &quot;Bernie and the FIA will have much more information than us and we will trust their decisions.&quot; Meanwhile, Barcelona&apos;s Catalunya Circuit said it would be ready to stage the final pre-season test session if Bahrain were unable to host it. The circuit&apos;s director, Salvador Servia, said the track would be available to hold the three-day event from 6 March after Fota asked about a potential switch. &quot;Consultations are taking place on the whole logistic possibilities and what is happening in Bahrain,&quot; Fota&apos;s general secretary, Simone Perillo, said. &quot;If things don&apos;t calm down then we&apos;ll have to consider the possibilities.&quot; If the Bahrain race was cancelled, the Melbourne grand prix on 27 March would be the first in a truncated 19-race season, but it is not thought that Ecclestone would be out of pocket, with the costs of up to $60m (\u00a337m) in race fees being swallowed by the Bahraini organisers. But cancellation would be a blow for both the sport and Bahrain, which became the first Middle East country to host a round of the championship in 2004 in an attempt to transform itself into a tourist destination as well as a business hub.

The queasiness grew when he moved into a flat opposite a homeless hostel, on a noisy street in St Kilda beach \u2013 a 20-minute tram ride from the city \u2013 where the partying carried on until 3am. &quot;My initial impressions weren&apos;t very good,&quot; said Jowett, who arrived in October, having successfully responded to an ad in the Guardian placed by SMS Management &amp; Technology, an Australian consultancy company, which is sponsoring him. He is now weighing up whether to stay or return to his family home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. At the age of 50, Jowett had decided it was now or never to test the waters Down Under \u2013 an idea he and his wife, Suzanne, 49, had toyed with for some time. There were sound economic reasons. His consultancy projects at GCHQ, the eavesdropping centre in Cheltenham, and for the Serious Organised Crime Agency, were coming to an end in a tightening job market. Nor was he too thrilled at the prospect of living under a Conservative-Lib Dem government. &quot;I felt quite depressed at the election,&quot; says Jowett, as we chat on the 41st floor of an office tower with sweeping views of Melbourne. &quot;The political situation is not in line with my allegiances.&quot; Jowett&apos;s decision to give the southern hemisphere a try reflects the contrasting economic fortunes of Britain and Australia. As the British economy splutters \u2013 it shrank 0.5% in the last quarter of 2010 \u2013 Australia&apos;s is motoring and is expected to grow by 3.5% this year. Unlike the UK and US, Australia has weathered what Australians call &quot;the GFC&quot; (global financial crisis), thanks to solid banking supervision. Now it is riding high on the back of China&apos;s explosive growth and its demand for raw materials. Iron ore, coal, copper and wool account for more than 70% of Australia&apos;s exports to China \u2013 easily its biggest market. So while Britain&apos;s economy flounders, Australia&apos;s is flourishing \u2013 although some commentators caution that it could suffer should China&apos;s economy go off the boil. For the time being, Australia&apos;s boom brings its own problems. It has a skills shortage and is eager to recruit a wide range of professionals and tradespeople, from secondary school teachers to architects, computer experts to nurses and civil engineers to cartographers. It is a long list and the regional areas, in particular, suffer from shortages. The recent floods and hurricane damage in Queensland have only sharpened the need for construction workers. Older professionals such as Jowett should benefit from changes in Australia&apos;s points-based visa system due to come into force in July. The changes \u2013 which continue to give top priority to employers who want to sponsor individual migrants \u2013 will focus on better English language skills, more extensive skilled work experience, higher-level qualifications obtained in Australia and overseas and different age ranges. Australia realises that many people in their mid to late 40s are just reaching the peak of their careers, acquiring the level of expertise it needs. Australia has been a draw for Brits ever since the \u00a310 Poms, an Australian government scheme of assisted passage that brought more than 1 million British migrants. These days programmes such as the BBC&apos;s Wanted Down Under and Relocation: Phil Down Under on Channel 4 serve to pique British curiosity about moving to Australia, although as some of the programmes make clear, the roads in Australia are not necessarily paved with gold. Still, as recession bites, more Brits may be tempted to move abroad for work. It is not just Australia that wants skilled British workers. Singapore touts itself as a unique blend of east and west, a multicultural society with a global outlook where it is easy to adjust and adapt. After establishing itself as a centre for finance and IT, it is now seeking to attract those working in interactive and digital media, biomedical sciences and green technology. It has done a fair job in luring foreign labour, as about one in four skilled workers on the island come from overseas. In recent years, China has also attracted skilled British workers. A report last year called Global Brit, from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), estimated that the percentage of Britons living in China since 2006 jumped by 30% \u2013 albeit from a low base \u2013 and the British population in the UAE grew by 20% in the same period, probably reflecting the greater job opportunities, although Dubai&apos;s bubble burst during the 2008 financial crisis. Meanwhile, other countries such as Brazil, Argentina and South Africa are also in the market for skilled expats. Glotel, a recruitment firm for telecommunications engineers and project managers, finds a big demand in those countries for its experts. &quot;At present we are seeing a surge in opportunities within South America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina,&quot; says Lee Wilsher, managing director of Glotel. &quot;We have seen a 25% increase year-on-year in the last three years of permanent placements in Brazil, while both Shanghai and Singapore are active markets and there are some great opportunities for the right candidates.&quot; While there are communities of more than 1,000 Britons in more than 100 countries around the world, the big expat populations are in Australia (more than a million), Spain, the US, Canada and France. The IPPR report says most British emigrants move abroad primarily to work \u2013 55% in 2008. They also tend to be younger, better educated and in higher-earning jobs than the general British population. In fact, latest figures show that emigration among professionals and the highly skilled has slowed recently, with greater numbers returning home \u2013 but the UK is still experiencing &quot;brain drain&quot;. On the plus side, though, the UK received about \u00a34.5bn in remittances from abroad in 2006 \u2013 which represents 0.3% of GDP. The drop reflects a waning in a British emigration boom that began in 2000. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show the number of people leaving the UK for 12 months or more fell from 427,000 in 2008 to 368,000 in 2009, while an estimated 140,000 British citizens emigrated in 2009, the lowest number since 1999, down from 173,000 in 2008. The IPPR finds that people choose to emigrate mainly because they see opportunities. In other words, it is positive &quot;pull factors&quot; that encourage them to emigrate, not negative &quot;push factors&quot; such as the economic or political situation in the UK. Jowett says, however, that both apply to his case. He loves Melbourne and feels at home after his less than auspicious start in this fast-growing city of 4 million people, with its myriad bars, cafes and restaurants and its terrific, if overburdened, tram system. &quot;It feels very cosmopolitan and very European,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s a bit cliched but everybody is friendly. I&apos;m a big sports fan, I&apos;ve watched the Ashes and I&apos;m a keen golfer, so this place really does appeal.&quot; His wife and two children came to visit for three weeks at Christmas and loved it, so the pressure is on him to stay, Jowett says. But there are downsides. Although his salary is higher than in the UK, he finds it counteracted by the cost of living, particularly the high rent. In fact, Melbourne is suffering from its success. A recent survey of housing affordability around the world listed Melbourne near the bottom \u2013 321st out of 325 markets. The Demographic International Housing Affordability Survey put the median Melbourne house price at $565,000 (\u00a3353,823) with the median household income at $63,000. Such prices have prompted some analysts to say Australia has gone from the exemplar of modestly priced, high-quality, middle-class housing to the least affordable housing market in the English-speaking world. A big emotional wrench The popularity of Australia has fluctuated over recent decades. After a drop in popularity during the 1990s, it rose in the 2000s. Australian immigration records show nearly 2,000 Britons a month settled permanently in Australia during the first half of 2006, accounting for one in five long-term immigrants to Australia and more than doubling the British arrival rate of 10 years ago. In 2008-09, 31,882 Britons settled permanently there, but the number dropped to 25,439 in 2009-10. So in thinking of settling permanently in Australia, Jowett is bucking the trend, although if the UK economy is stuck in the doldrums, others may follow his example. Going so far can be a big emotional wrench. Olivia Stuart moved to Australia with her Australian husband in 2009 from Linlithgow, Scotland, mainly for the sake of their three boys, aged nine, six and four. She works as a GP in Wangaratta, two-and-a-half hours from Melbourne. They love the outdoor life, Stuart enjoys her work and they feel relieved to be in a strong economy, unlike their friends and family back home. &quot;Every GP clinic in town would like another doctor,&quot; says Stuart. &quot;The hard bit is it&apos;s a long way back and it&apos;s expensive. We miss family and friends, but you just have to accept that.&quot; She also warns that dealing with the paperwork is an ordeal. &quot;If you don&apos;t like paperwork don&apos;t emigrate,&quot; she says. &quot;It took three months to become a GP, even though there is a big shortage. There are a lot of bureaucratic hoops.&quot; Jowett, who was born in Barnsley, says he misses walking in the Yorkshire Dales and Peak District and most of all watching Barnsley, his football team, where he had a season ticket. But overall, he has not been disappointed. &quot;We always wanted to travel and have done a lot of travelling,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;d been thinking of moving here and at this time of my life, it was either moving to Australia or buying a motor bike.&quot; How countries compare Singapore Population: 4.8 million. Outlook: Economy estimated to have expanded by 14.7% in 2010, surpassing even China&apos;s rate. Expansion in 2011 expected to be a more restrained 4.3%. Who they need: Digital media experts; bioscientists/engineers; accounting/financial managers. System of entry: Advance job offer needed to get a work permit or an employment pass. Downside: The government doesn&apos;t brook much argument over its policies. Canada Population: 33.4 million. Outlook: Recovering from recession, but strong growth forecasts threatened by a looming population shortage. Hence the urgent requirement for more workers and citizens generally. Who they need: Who don&apos;t they need? Healthcare, IT and skilled tradespeople among the most sought-after, but many more on the list. System of entry: Points-based. Downside: Isolation can be a problem in the world&apos;s second-biggest territory. Qatar Population: 1.4 million. Outlook: Has one of the world&apos;s highest per capita GDP rates and a fast rate of economic growth. Who they need: Healthcare workers; engineers to work on gas field expansion and 2022 World Cup stadiums. System of entry: Similar to Singapore \u2013 but spouses must get their own employment pass if they want to work too. Downside: 40C temperatures are common in the summer months. China Population: 1.3 billion. Outlook: Nouriel Roubini, the economist who saw the 2008 financial crisis coming, believes the world&apos;s second-biggest economy is overheating. Only a stronger yuan can help cool the economy and bring down inflation, he says. Who they need: English teachers; entrepreneurial people who can facilitate trade with western companies. System of entry: Z visa, normally issued once job has been offered. Downsides: As Singapore but worse; difficult language to learn.", "title": "Looking for a top job?

Mischa Hiller&apos;s suspense-filled second novel is narrated by an undercover PLO operative posing as a student in London, in a paranoid underworld of coded messages and dead-letter drops. Yet just as Hiller&apos;s affecting debut Sabra Zoo set a teenage coming-of-age novel against the 1982 massacres carried out by Lebanese Phalangists during Israeli invasion, this PLO agent&apos;s origins in the Beirut refugee camps make Shake Off more than a spy thriller. Though the title alludes to the intifada against Israeli occupation of the late 80s, when the novel is set, it deals with the narrator&apos;s efforts to shake off not only the agents tailing him \u2013 whether Mossad, MI5 or rival Palestinian factions \u2013 but his own fake identities, debilitating memories and dependencies. Michel is an orphan of Sabra, expensively schooled by adoptive Lebanese parents, then groomed by a PLO father-figure, an acquaintance of the &quot;Old Man&quot; Yasser Arafat, as an undercover agent, trained in East Berlin and Moscow. A gifted linguist who collects such colloquialisms as &quot;piece of piss&quot; and &quot;fly in the ointment&quot;, he can pose as easily as the Jewish Italian Roberto Levi as the Lebanese Christian Michel Khoury. But he relies on painkillers to dull flashbacks to the massacre he survived as a teenager. His role in intelligence is as a foot-soldier, courier and fixer, scouting a Cambridge location for secret status talks between Palestinian and Israeli mavericks who favour a &quot;secular, democratic state for Jews, Christians and Muslims&quot;. The talks for a one-state solution ostensibly rival the Oslo process that led to the 1993 accords. When Michel is pursued for the mysterious contents of an envelope smuggled out of the Occupied Territories, his enemies are not only Mossad \u2013 ironically dubbed &quot;the competition&quot;, despite their great superiority \u2013 but also the scions of Palestinian in-fighting. His father and uncles resent &quot;how their right to return had been written off by the PLO&quot;. Despite his wariness of honeytraps (&quot;it&apos;s easier to believe that a woman finds you irresistible than that she is trying to ensnare you&quot;), Michel falls for Helen, his housemate at a bedsit in London&apos;s Tufnell Park. A doctoral student in anthropology, she brings the added complication of a jealous ex-lover, the married Greek professor Michel facetiously dubs &quot;Zorba&quot;. When Michel&apos;s boss, code-named Abu Leila, is killed in a drive-by shooting by Arabic-speaking gunmen in Berlin, Michel goes on the run, ending up at Helen&apos;s mother&apos;s house, on the west coast of Scotland. As he begins to penetrate levels of subterfuge in which he has been a pawn, Helen assails his painkiller addiction and his own masks. Michel, who practices counter-surveillance moves in Foyles and Harrods, feels safe in bookshops. Among his mentors are Khalil Gibran, Mahmoud Darwish and Primo Levi. While there are salutary reminders of real covert operations \u2013 the 1987 killing of Palestinian cartoonist Naji al-Ali on a South Kensington street; the abduction of the Israeli nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu \u2013 among the most interesting aspects of the novel are its asides. Michel resents the account of a Jewish boy in a Polish pogrom for taking away the &quot;uniqueness of my experience&quot;. His affair with a vapid estate agent in Cambridge, which tilts into ugly hatred, hints at the danger of becoming one&apos;s oppressor \u2013 like a beaten child, Abu Leila tells him, &quot;who will probably also beat his children&quot;. The suspense is well maintained, and the denouement packs a punch, though the run-up can seem a bit heavy on the homework, as though the author \u2013 like the KGB trainees Michel meets \u2013 studied John Le Carr\u00e9 &quot;for the tradecraft&quot;. Yet the outrage expressed in Hiller&apos;s debut persists in these pages, not least at the Phalangist butchers of 1982 having become respectable members of the Lebanese government. In its memorialising of the 1982 massacres, Hiller&apos;s fiction joins great Arabic novels such as Love in Exile (1995) by Bahaa Taher, Egyptian winner of the inaugural &quot;Arabic Booker&quot; prize in 2008, and Elias Khoury&apos;s Gate of the Sun (1998). His own strengths are understated humour and an eye for irony. Arab regimes, Michel notes, were preoccupied with spying on their own people, since the last thing they wanted was &quot;subversive ideas of democracy or free speech trickling into their own populations&quot;.

But a less recognised reason for the turmoil in Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Yemen, Jordan and now Iran has been rising food prices, directly linked to a growing regional water crisis. The diverse states that make up the Arab world, stretching from the Atlantic coast to Iraq, have some of the world&apos;s greatest oil reserves, but this disguises the fact that they mostly occupy hyper-arid places. Rivers are few, water demand is increasing as populations grow, underground reserves are shrinking and nearly all depend on imported staple foods that are now trading at record prices. For a region that expects populations to double to more than 600 million within 40 years, and climate change to raise temperatures, these structural problems are political dynamite and already destabilising countries, say the World Bank, the UN and many independent studies. In recent reports they separately warn that the riots and demonstrations after the three major food-price rises of the last five years in north Africa and the Middle East might be just a taste of greater troubles to come unless countries start to share their natural resources, and reduce their profligate energy and water use. &quot;In the future the main geopolitical resource in the Middle East will be water rather than oil. The situation is alarming,&quot; said Swiss foreign minister Micheline Calmy-Rey last week, as she launched a Swiss and Swedish government-funded report for the EU. The Blue Peace report examined long-term prospects for seven countries, including Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, the Palestinian territories and Israel. Five already suffer major structural shortages, it said, and the amount of water being taken from dwindling sources across the region cannot continue much longer. &quot;Unless there is a technological breakthrough or a miraculous discovery, the Middle East will not escape a serious [water] shortage,&quot; said Sundeep Waslekar, a researcher from the Strategic Foresight Group who wrote the report. Autocratic, oil-rich rulers have been able to control their people by controlling nature and have kept the lid on political turmoil at home by heavily subsidising &quot;virtual&quot; or &quot;embedded&quot; water in the form of staple grains imported from the US and elsewhere. But, says Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East programme at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic Studies, existing political relationships are liable to break down when, as now, the price of food hits record levels and the demand for water and energy soars. &quot;Water is a fundamental part of the social contract in Middle Eastern countries. Along with subsidised food and fuel, governments provide cheap or even free water to ensure the consent of the governed. But when subsidised commodities have been cut, instability has often followed. &quot;Water&apos;s own role in prompting unrest has so far been relatively limited, but that is unlikely to hold. Future water scarcity will be much more permanent than past shortages, and the techniques governments have used in responding to past disturbances may not be enough,&quot; he says. &quot;The problem will only get worse. Arab countries depend on other countries for their food security \u2013 they&apos;re as sensitive to floods in Australia and big freezes in Canada as on the yield in Algeria or Egypt itself,&quot; says political analyst and Middle East author Vicken Cheterian. &quot;In 2008/9, Arab countries&apos; food imports cost $30bn. Then, rising prices caused waves of rioting and left the unemployed and impoverished millions in Arab countries even more exposed. The paradox of Arab economies is that they depend on oil prices, while increased energy prices make their food more expensive,&quot; says Cheterian. The region&apos;s most food- and water-insecure country is Yemen, the poorest in the Arab world, which gets less than 200 cubic metres of water per person a year \u2013 well below the international water poverty line of 1,000m3 \u2013 and must import 80-90% o f its food. According to Mahmoud Shidiwah, chair of the Yemeni water and environment protection agency, 19 of the country&apos;s 21 main aquifers are no longer being replenished and the government has considered moving Sana&apos;a, the capital city, with around two million people, which is expected to run dry within six years. &quot;Water shortages have increased political tensions between groups. We have a very big problem,&quot; he says. Two internal conflicts are already raging in Yemen and the capital has been rocked by riots this month. &quot;There is an obvious link between high food prices and unrest [in the region]. Drought, population and water scarcity are aggravating factors. The pressure on natural resources is increasing, and the pressure on the land is great,&quot; said Giancarlo Cirri, the UN World Food Programme representative in Yemen. &quot;If you look at the recent Small Arms Survey [in Yemen], they try to document the increase in what they call social violence due to this pressure on water and land. This social violence is increasing, and related deaths and casualties are pretty high. The death tolls in the northern conflict and the southern conflict are a result of these pressures,&quot; said Cirri. Other Arab countries are not faring much better. Jordan, which expects water demand to double in the next 20 years, faces massive shortages because of population growth and a longstanding water dispute with Israel. Its per capita water supply will fall from the current 200m3 per person to 91m3 within 30 years, says the World Bank. Palestine and Israel fiercely dispute fragile water resources. Algeria and Tunisia, along with the seven emirates in the UAE, Morocco, Iraq and Iran are all in &quot;water deficit&quot; \u2013 using far more than they receive in rain or snowfall. Only Turkey has a major surplus, but it is unwilling to share. Abu Dhabi, the world&apos;s most profligate water user, says it will run out of its ancient fossil water reserves in 40 years; Libya has spent $20bn pumping unreplenishable water from deep wells in the desert but has no idea how long the resource will last; Saudi Arabian water demand has increased by 500% in 25 years and is expected to double again in 20 years \u2013 as power demand surges as much as 10% a year. The Blue Peace report highlights the rapid decline in many of the region&apos;s major water sources. The water level in the Dead Sea has dropped by nearly 150ft since the 1960s. The marshlands in Iraq have shrunk by 90% and the Sea of Galilee (Lake Kinneret) is at risk of becoming irreversibly salinised by salt water springs below it. Meanwhile, says the UN, farm land is becoming unusable as irrigation schemes and intensive farming lead to waterlogging and desalination. Some oil-rich Arab countries are belatedly beginning to address the problem. Having drained underground aquifers to grow inappropriate crops for many years, they have turned en masse to desalination. More than 1,500 massive plants now line the Gulf and the Mediterranean and provide much of north Africa and the Middle East&apos;s drinking water \u2013 and two-thirds of the world&apos;s desalinated water. The plants take salty or brackish water, and either warm it, vaporise it and separate off the salts and impurities, or pass it through filters. According to the WWF, it&apos;s an &quot;expensive, energy intensive and greenhouse gas-emitting way to get fresh water&quot;, but costs are falling and the industry is booming. Solar-powered plants are being built for small communities but no way has been found to avoid the concentrated salt stream that the plants produce. The impurities extracted from the water mostly end up back in the sea or in aquifers and kill marine life. Only now are countries starting to see the downsides of desalination. Salt levels in the Arabian Gulf are eight times higher in some places than they should be, as power-hungry water plants return salt to an already saline sea. The higher salinity of the seawater intake reduces the plant&apos;s efficiency and, in some areas, marine life is suffering badly, affecting coral and fishing catches. Desalination has allowed dictators and elites to continue to waste water on a massive scale. Nearly 20% of all Saudi oil money in the 1970s and 80s was used to provide clean water to grow wheat and other crops in regions that would not naturally be able to do so. Parks, golf courses, roadside verges and household gardens are all still watered with expensively produced clean drinking water. The energy \u2013 and therefore water \u2013 needed to keep barely insulated buildings super-cold in Gulf states is astonishing. A few Arab leaders recognise that water and energy profligacy must be curbed if ecological disaster is to be avoided. In Abu Dhabi, which is building Masdar, the $20bn futuristic city to be run on renewable energy, the environment agency is spearheading a massive drive to reduce water use. Concrete is replacing water-hungry grass verges and new laws demand water-saving devices in all buildings. &quot;We cannot go on giving free water and energy. It&apos;s not benefiting anyone. We have to change and we will change. We know we must find common solutions,&quot; says Razan Khalifa al-Mubarak, assistant head of the environment agency. &quot;Allah does not like those who waste,&quot; says Talib al-Shehhi, director of preaching at the ministry of Islamic affairs. &quot;Safeguarding resources and water especially is central to religion. The Qu&apos;ran says water is a pillar of life and consequently orders us to save [it], and Muhammad instructs us to do so.&quot; Water awareness is definitely growing, says Kala Krishnan, member of an eco club at the large Indian school in Abu Dhabi. &quot;People were amazed when we showed them how much they use in a day. We stacked up 550 one-litre bottles and they refused to believe it. Now schools are competing with each other to reduce water wastage.&quot; More than 2,000 mosques in Abu Dhabi have been fitted with water-saving devices, which is saving millions of gallons of water a year when people wash before prayer. Other UAE states are expected to follow. The more drastic response to the crisis is to shift farming elsewhere and to build reserves. Saudi Arabia said in 2008 it would cut domestic wheat output by 12.5% a year to save its water supplies. It is now subsidising traders to buy land in Africa. Since the troubles in Egypt and north Africa, it has said it aims to double its wheat reserves to 1.4m tonnes, enough to satisfy demand for a year. Countries now recognise how vulnerable they are to conflict. The UAE, which includes Abu Dhabi and Dubai, has started to build the world&apos;s largest underground reservoir, with 26,000,000m3 of desalinated water. It will store enough water for 90 days when completed. The reasoning is that the UAE is now wholly dependent on desalination to survive. &quot;Wars can erupt because of water,&quot; said Mohammed Khalfan al-Rumaithi, director general of the UAE&apos;s National Emergency and Crisis Management Authority last week. &quot;Using groundwater for agriculture is risky. If it doesn&apos;t harm us it will harm other generations,&quot; he told the Federal National Council. &quot;We suffer from a shortage of water and we should think about solutions to preserve it rather than using it for agriculture,&quot; he said. Water shortages, concludes the Blue Peace report, are now so alarming that in a few years opposing camps will have little choice but to co-operate and share resources, or face ruinous conflict. That way, it says, instead of a potential accelerator of conflict, the water crisis can become an opportunity for a new form of peace where any two countries with access to adequate, clean and sustainable water resources do not feel motivated to engage in a military conflict. It sounds optimistic, but the wind of change blowing through the region suggests everything is possible.", "title": "What does the Arab world do when its water runs out?", "sentences": ["The UAE, which includes Abu Dhabi and Dubai, has started to build the world&apos;s largest underground reservoir, with 26,000,000m3 of desalinated water."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-20T00:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/feb/21/horse-racing-tipping-competition", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Horse racing tips", "Sport"], "article": "Carlisle 3.40 race is stopped midway through contest 6pm: The Cumberland Show 16 July Handicap Chase claimed the limelight for all the wrong reasons at Carlisle after an unfortunate incident led to the race being abandoned at halfway. Star Player collapsed on the flat in the early stages of the three-and-a-half mile test with what turned out to be a fatal injury. It was soon realised that the field would be unable to go around the stricken horse, who had suffered a broken leg, and the remaining jockeys were waved around the 11th fence before the race was stopped.

Well, me and about 50 other journalists, broadcasters, writers and hangers-on. Adamant that we will see a better performance in the Sportingbet.com Champion Chase than he produced at Ascot last month, Nicholls nominated Master Minded as his bet of the Festival, with Pistolet Noir nominated as his best outsider in the Coral Cup. Nicholls&apos; assistant, Dan Skelton, selected Rock On Ruby as his banker in the Neptune Novices&apos; Hurdle, with Join Together a live outsider in the Albert Bartlett Hurdle. &quot;I think he is still going to be the one to beat,&quot; said Nicholls of Master Minded. &quot;For various reasons he wasn&apos;t at his best last month, but we still nicked a Grade One. That isn&apos;t the time of the year to be at your peak though \u2013 it&apos;s March when it counts and I am really happy with him again.&quot; Nicholls will run both Master Minded and Woolcombe Folly \u2013 with Daryl Jacob and Nick Schofield among the possible jockey options for the latter \u2013 in the Queen Mother, with Tataniano rated &quot;50-50&quot; to join them after pulling muscles in exercise three weeks ago. Joining Kauto Star and Denman in the Gold Cup will be Neptune Collonges and What A Friend, although testing ground could see the last-named kept back for either the Totesport Bowl or Grand National at Aintree the following month. &quot;You could see after a couple of fences that he wasn&apos;t going at all,&quot; he reflected of What A Friend&apos;s second to Noland (who will also wait for Aintree) in the Aon Chase at Newbury last Friday. &quot;He&apos;s always been a bit of a character, but I think he has become more ground-dependent as he has got older and he would appreciate it quicker. I&apos;ll put him in the Scottish National too in case it comes up quick there. We&apos;ll stick blinkers on him next time. They&apos;re something we&apos;re always talking about.&quot; Others to attract particular attention from Nicholls were Pepe Simo (Grand Annual Chase) \u2013 &quot;I always thought he&apos;d be the sort of horse to go well in that race&quot; \u2013 and Aiteen Thirtythree (RSA Chase) \u2013 &quot;He&apos;s had little issues but he seems a different horse this season, both Noel Fehily and Nick Schofield have got off him and said he feels like one of the nicest horses they have sat on&quot;. Nicholls was also particularly keen on the prospects on Big Buck&apos;s against Grands Crus in the Ladbrokes World Hurdle, saying that the emergence of the David Pipe-trained rival had left Big Buck&apos;s &quot;a bigger price than he should be&quot;. Interestingly, however, Nicholls admitted that he had been a fan of Grands Crus long before the horse emerged as a contender to depose Big Buck&apos;s of the champion stayers&apos; crown. &quot;From the day I saw him at the sales at Saint-Cloud when he was sold in his stall, I liked the look at him,&quot; he said. &quot;As soon as I saw him win at Cheltenham first time this season, I thought &apos;I know where you&apos;ll be going&apos;. You can&apos;t buy them all and it will be good for the race to have a bit of competition for Big Buck&apos;s, particularly as I have always felt that the harder the race, the better Big Buck&apos;s will be. &quot;If we get beat, so be it, but on the upside, maybe then I will be able to persuade Andy Stewart to let me try him over fences again and aim him at the Gold Cup next year!&quot; Richard Hughes to pursue Flat title again 2pm: Richard Hughes has confirmed his intention to have another serious attempt at winning the Flat jockeys championship. The 38-year-old went close to landing the title in 2010, his prolonged duel with Paul Hanagan brightening up the last weeks of the Flat season. It went all the way through until the last day of the season at Doncaster in November with Hughes eventually going down by two (191-189) to his rival. Richard Hannon&apos;s stable jockey is keen to have another go, having recharged his batteries with a month off and spells in India and Dubai. &quot;I enjoyed every minute of it. Every horse you went out on had a chance, if you were riding no-hopers then it would be tiring,&quot; he told Racing UK Radio. &quot;I got a taste for it last year. You always see how you are going after Ascot or nearer Goodwood and see how you are going, but you&apos;d like to have 100 winners up by Goodwood if you have any chance. I&apos;m as fit as a fiddle. I&apos;ve nothing else to do so I may as well ride horses.&quot; Hughes is particularly looking forward to riding Canford Cliffs on whom he won three Group Ones last season. &quot;I can&apos;t wait to take on Goldikova with Canford Cliffs. Everyone knows how highly I&apos;ve rated him, but he&apos;ll probably be better as a four-year-old if he keeps healthy,&quot; he went on. &quot;We also have Dick Turpin. They will probably clash which won&apos;t help me but they are two fine horses to have in the yard.&quot; Hughes is fourth favourite at around 7-1 behind the evens market leader Ryan Moore for the jockeys&apos; title. PA Paul Jones&apos; daily Cheltenham Festival countdown stat The Grand Annual market is starting to take some shape but there is one strong statistic to bear in mind before punting. All bar one of the last 10 winners fell inside a tight ratings band from 129 to 134. That is unquestionably one of the strongest official ratings statistics of the entire season, let alone the Festival, and up popped good old Pigeon Island (or the &quot;rotting corpse&quot; as he was tastefully described at one Cheltenham Festival preview evening) off 129, one of just six qualifiers on this count last season. Not only that but 129-134 rated horses also paid out winning straight forecasts in 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2008. As far as weight carried is concerned, horses carrying over 11st are 0 from 46 since Edredon Bleu ran them ragged in 1998, with McCoy firing him at every fence. Edredon Bleu went on to win a Champion Chase and a King George. It would be surprising if there was a horse as good in this year&apos;s field. Paul Jones is author of The Cheltenham Festival Betting Guide published by Weatherbys. The guide is published on 25 February and you can find details on how to order here. Today&apos;s best bets, by Will Hayler I&apos;m hoping that two of my favourite trainers can supply me with a winner at Carlisle. No matter what kind of stakes you play for, from fun money to thousands, I think all punters have their personal favourites when it comes to trainers and jockeys. Without trying to psycho-analyse myself, my preferences probably result from the good turns that horses trained or ridden by them must have done me in the past, although a decent strike rate of winners to runners is always a must too. Firmly on course to register his best-ever season since taking over the licence from his famous dad, Donald McCain&apos;s strike rate has been impressively high throughout the last four months and Storming Gale (2.10) can maintain the stable&apos;s fine recent record. A potentially interesting contender for Cheltenham&apos;s Albert Bartlett Hurdle (for which he might well be worth a bet at 33-1 before today&apos;s race), he scored with plenty in hand at Ffos Las last month and ought to handle the testing conditions well enough. Richard Lee has been around for more than 20 years, but is on course for one of his best-ever seasons and with eight of his 11 runners in the last fortnight having made the frame, the signs are still encouraging. Victory Gunner (3.40) struck on his first start for the stable at Towcester at the start of the month and gets his favoured conditions again this afternoon. He hasn&apos;t been clobbered by the handicapper despite that victory (still rated a stone below his highest rating) and although he enjoyed being ridden aggressively there, he doesn&apos;t have to lead to show his best form. Lee must also have decent chances with Stoway (4.40) later on the card. A useful hurdler in France in his youth, a variety of problems have heavily restricted his appearances on course since, but there was plenty of encouragement to be taken from his recent return over an inadequate trip at Taunton. Tipping competition \u2013 a new week Congratulations to Waltersobchak, who picked Recession Proof (12-1) in Friday&apos;s totesport Trophy to win last week&apos;s competition.

But this was Idex 2011, the Middle East&apos;s biggest arms fair. The show of arms was choreographed for the benefit of thousands of arms dealers in dark suits and sunglasses, who marvelled at how it was all synchronised to a booming hip-hop soundtrack. Inside the exhibition hall, brimming with weapons \u2013 from Predator drones to the latest digital camouflaged assault rifle, few could ignore the real violence happening in Libya and Bahrain. In the British pavilion, the UK delegation angling for arms contracts, led by Gerald Howarth, the defence minister, came under growing pressure to explain the UK&apos;s role in arming dictatorial and repressive regimes in the region after the government revoked 44 licences to sell arms to Bahrain and eight licences for Libya. British companies offer a range of products useful for controlling hostile crowds \u2013 two stands were selling teargas grenades, stun grenades and rubber bullets. A British officer on the government&apos;s UK Trade and Industry stand could be heard pitching the benefits of a camera-guided 6kg fragmentation bomb to a major-general from the Algerian military, while out in the midday heat, the arms giant BAE Systems showed off a formidable armoured personnel carrier that it has sold to Dubai&apos;s police force. The government had already faced calls to withdraw from the event. &quot;Nothing to say today,&quot; Howarth told the Guardian as he waited, fruitlessly as it turned out, to greet Abu Dhabi&apos;s Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, whose attention had been drawn to a handgun on a rival stand. &quot;I am absolutely wall-to-wall with meetings. I am here as the minister for national security strategy, supporting this important exhibition.&quot; Labour MP Denis MacShane has called for an immediate stop on all arms exports to Bahrain. Amnesty wants a ban extended across the region. Defence contractors said they felt &quot;battered and bruised&quot; by the condemnation that they had received, following the violence throughout the Middle East and north Africa. Analysis by the Guardian of export licence records held by the Department for Business shows that the UK government issued 20 licences between July and September last year for export to Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman of riot control weapons including teargas, smoke and stun grenades. It also granted or amended licences worth up to \u00a3182m to sell products to Libya, including &quot;crowd control ammunition&quot;, &quot;teargas/irritant ammunition&quot; and training in teargas/irritant ammunition. A licence has been issued to supply shotguns to Bahrain, and sniper rifles to Oman and Qatar. &quot;The Middle East was a growing market until a few weeks ago,&quot; said one arms trader who, like most, asked not to be named. &quot;It&apos;s a question now of who do we want to sell to. Do we want to sell hi-tech equipment to [Egypt&apos;s] Muslim Brotherhood? I don&apos;t think so.&quot; Louise Robson, representing BAE, agreed the turmoil had thrown the market up in the air. &quot;It is too early to say where it will end up,&quot; she said. &quot;Given what is going on at the moment, nobody is likely to be talking about how to spend their defence procurement budget.&quot; Meanwhile, British firms in the spotlight for offering crowd control weaponry defended their right to do so. Rupert Pittman, a spokesman for Hampshire-based Chemring, which is selling CS gas shotgun cartridges and stun grenades at Idex, said the government licensing system determined what countries they sell to. &quot;Beyond that, we have an ethical policy in place and look closely at the countries we are considering exporting to and see if they fit that,&quot; he said. Simon Martyr, director of Primetake, a Lincolnshire firm selling rubber ball shot, teargas cartridges for shot guns and rubber baton rounds, said his firm&apos;s &quot;bedrock&quot; was bird-scaring cartridges. &quot;We are a very respectable organisation and we take very careful advice from the Ministry of Defence and the business department,&quot; he said, adding that it was difficult to export CS gas because of the strict licensing controls. A senior defence industry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said calls for the UK government to withdraw from the show were plain wrong and threatened a long-term relationship with the United Arab Emirates&apos;s military. He said UK export controls were the strongest in the world and stressed that the UK defence industry is worth \u00a335bn a year, employing 300,000 people. &quot;You can&apos;t legislate for how the buyers will use the product,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to rely on the police doctrine and operational discipline in how they use it.&quot; ADS, the body that represents UK arms companies, estimates that UK defence exports are worth \u00a37.2bn a year, half of which are sold to the Middle East. &quot;The UK contingent at Idex 2011, of nearly 90 organisations clearly demonstrates how seriously the UK defence and security sectors take the region,&quot; said Rees Ward, chief executive of ADS. British firms at the fair ranged from the huge BAE, showing off its Eurofighter Typhoon jet plane, to BCB International, offering a stainless steel billy can for \u00a34 and Toye, Kenning and Spencer, formal military outfitters for more than 300 years. The arms fair also provided a snapshot of a world perpetually preparing for war. The Guardian watched the Azerbaijani defence minister peruse a South Korean riot van, Ethiopia&apos;s chief of defence staff take a tour of a Ukrainian tank and Arabs in dishdashas take aim with American M-16 rifles on a computer simulated rifle range. The defence world&apos;s jargon was also well in evidence. Sometimes it was blunt: &quot;Drash \u2013 the warfighter&apos;s choice&quot;. At other times it was euphemistic, describing &quot;battlefield management&quot; and &quot;security solutions&quot;. The show&apos;s 1,000 stands, which are expected to be visited by 50,000 people this week, were often a queasy mix of violence and car showroom bonhomie. Models in full riot body armour and chemical survival suits waved cheerily for photographs, while one stall holder demonstrated a black breathing mask for use in a nuclear attack next to a tray of boiled sweets and a pot of free pens.", "title": "Abu Dhabi arms fair: Tanks, guns, teargas and trade at Idex 2011", "sentences": ["A British officer on the government&apos;s UK Trade and Industry stand could be heard pitching the benefits of a camera-guided 6kg fragmentation bomb to a major-general from the Algerian military, while out in the midday heat, the arms giant BAE Systems showed off a formidable armoured personnel carrier that it has sold to Dubai&apos;s police force."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-21T20:56:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lawrence-donegan-golf-blog/2011/feb/22/wgc-accenture-world-match-play", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport"], "article": "The tyranny of 72-hole strokeplay tournament golf is broken this week by the WGC-Accenture Match Play in Tucson, the first world golf championship event of the 2011 season. The good folks who broadcast golf in the United States are not big fans of this format for the simple reason that the big names are often long gone by the time Sunday&apos;s final comes around. No Tiger or Phil means smaller ratings in Peoria, Illinois. Fortunately, the rest of us don&apos;t need to worry about ratings and can instead sit back and enjoy a festival of unpredictability. Wednesday&apos;s first round, which will consist of 32 head-to-head contests between the world&apos;s top-64 ranked players, is by far the best day outside of the major championships. Only a fool would risk his reputation by confidently predicting the outcome of all 32 matches, so here goes:1 Lee Westwood (England) v 64 Henrik Stenson (Sweden) The world No1 arrives in Tucson with something to prove to his legion of (mostly American-based) doubters. He will be motivated. That is the good news. The bad news is this is a wide-open course with daft greens which doesn&apos;t play to his strength of grinding accuracy. Nor does he have a great record in this event. Still, he should have enough beat Stenson. 32 Nick Watney (US) v 33 Anthony Kim (US) A contest between two young(ish) Americans in which most people will pick the one they have heard of \u2013 Kim. This is a mistake. Watney isn&apos;t quite blessed with his countryman&apos;s talent but he has had a good start to the PGA Tour season, while Kim has been mediocre, to be kind. Watney advances. 16 Retief Goosen (South Africa) v 49 KJ Choi (South Korea) It says something about Goosen&apos;s talents that he is still hanging around the world&apos;s top 20 despite losing the gift \u2013 superlative putting \u2013 that won him major championships. Choi was once a &quot;good outside bet&quot; for every event he entered. These days he looks like a PGA Tour pro on the way down. Expect Goosen to win. 17 Francesco Molinari (Italy) v 48 Ryan Moore (US) The Italian has just become a father \u2013 a joyous event in anyone&apos;s personal life but perhaps not the best preparation for a world championship. Throw in a transatlantic flight, a touch of jet lag and a decent opponent in Moore and my guess is he&apos;ll be reunited with the new baby sooner than planned. 8 Steve Stricker (US) v 57 Matteo Manassero (Italy) Stricker will win this. The American doesn&apos;t have a great record in this tournament (at least not since he won it in Australia in 2002) but he will have too much guile and competitiveness (remember his performance in beating Westwood at the Ryder Cup?) for the Italian teenager. 25 Charl Schwartzel (South Africa) v 40 Ryo Ishikawa (Japan) There now has to be some doubts about Ishikawa. He is still young, and he still wins regularly in Japan, but doesn&apos;t appear to travel that well. Schwartzel might well be South Africa&apos;s best golfer by the end of the year. An easy win for the 25th seed. 9 Luke Donald (England) v 56 Charley Hoffman (US) Donald arrived in Los Angeles last week with hopes of winning at Riviera and departed having missed the cut \u2013 a rare event for the consistent Englishman and definitely not the best preparation for a match against Hoffman, who usually plays well in the desert. An American win. 24 Edoardo Molinari (Italy) v 41 Martin Laird (Scotland) Laird&apos;s progression up the world rankings has been one of the few bright spots for Scottish golf in recent times, even if few people outside Scotland have noticed. He is a consistently good player. Molinari, on the other hand, is mercurial, to say the least. Reason suggests Laird wins but the Italian is a great putter when it matters. Molinari wins. 4 Phil Mickelson (US) v 61 Brendan Jones (Australia) Taxi for Mr Jones. 29 Rickie Fowler (US) v 36 Peter Hanson (Sweden) Hanson is underrated and Fowler, one suspects, is just a little overrated (or at least he will be until he wins a tournament as a professional). Still, the Ryder Cup proved the young American has some guts to go with his flashy game. Fowler wins. 13 Matt Kuchar (US) v 52 Anders Hansen (Denmark) Kuchar is coming off a career season, while Hansen is still recovering from the Dubai Desert Classic, a tournament he should have won. Hard to pick a winner but Hansen is perhaps a little gutsier, so he might just edge it. 20 Louis Oosthuizen (South Africa) v 45 Bo Van Pelt (US) Bo Van Pelt is ranked one of the world&apos;s best 64 players? Not for long, one suspects. Oosthuizen to advance. 5 Graeme McDowell (Northern Ireland) v 60 Heath Slocum (US) McDowell will beat Slocum. The question is how far will he go after that? He hasn&apos;t played competitively for a month, otherwise he would be a healthy favourite to win the whole thing. He putts brilliantly (of course) and the high altitude in Tucson will alleviate the one &quot;weakness&quot; in his game \u2013 a lack of distance relative to the longest hitters. 28 Robert Allenby (Australia) v 37 Ross Fisher (England) Fisher has a good matchplay record but there is a sense his game is beginning to level off; that he has overachieved in the past two or three years. Allenby, on the other hand, is one of golf&apos;s great underachievers \u2013 a brilliant ball-striker who has been undone by an awful short game. His putting has improved over the past year, as have his results. Allenby wins. 12 Ian Poulter (England) v 53 Stewart Cink (US) This is the most intriguing match of the first round. It is hard to believe Poulter, the defending champion, will go quietly but his form in the Middle East was mediocre and his opponent Cink is a very, very good matchplay competitor. Close, but Poulter will win. 21 Alvaro Quir\u00f3s (Spain) v 44 YE Yang (South Korea) Quir\u00f3s&apos;s big-hitting, risk-taking style of play is perfect for matchplay, where a triple bogey will cost you just a hole and not an entire tournament. Yang is not to be underestimated \u2013 he outlasted Tiger Woods over the final round of the 2009 PGA Championship, remember \u2013 but expect the Korean to be overpowered. 2 Martin Kaymer (Germany) v 63 Noh Seung-yul (South Korea) There is a school of thought which suggests Noh in a future world No1. We will see. For the moment he is a brilliant young talent in need of a bit of seasoning. Kaymer was lacklustre in his last outing, in Dubai, where he looked distinctly uncomfortable in the limelight alongside Woods and Westwood. Noh wins in the biggest shock of the first round. 31 Zach Johnson (US) v 34 Justin Rose (England) Johnson is a tidy player, a fine putter and feisty competitor but he has been injured and \u2013 to say the least \u2013 this course does not suit his game. Rose had a top-10 finish in Los Angeles at the weekend, suggesting he has found a bit of form. An English win. 15 Robert Karlsson (Sweden) v 50 Hiroyuki Fujita (Japan) Karlsson is one of the most under-estimated players in the game, probably because he is not from the States or England. Such is the lot of Scandinavian golfers. A long hitter and a consistent putter. Likely to win at least a couple of matches. 18 Hunter Mahan (US) v 47 Sean O&apos;Hair (US) The two Americans are long-time pupils of Sean Foley (who is helping Tiger Woods &quot;rebuild&quot; his swing) and have had starkly different degrees of success. Mahan is progressing, albeit at a rate some feel isn&apos;t a true reflection of his great talent. O&apos;Hair, meanwhile, is going backwards fast. Mahan to win easily. 7 Rory McIlroy (Northern Ireland) v 58 Jonathan Byrd (US) Like Poulter, McIlroy could have done with an easier first-round draw. Byrd is the quintessential PGA Tour money machine \u2013 straight and steady. He has also won this year. It will be closer than most people think but McIlroy should prevail. 26 Adam Scott (Australia) v 39 Ben Crane (US) Scott is golf&apos;s great enigma, Crane is golf&apos;s slowest player. Can&apos;t imagine this will receive much television coverage. Scott to advance. 10 Jim Furyk (US) v 55 Ryan Palmer (US) Does anyone care? Furyk has a reputation of being one of the games scrappiest competitors, when the evidence \u2013 in matchplay events like this at least \u2013 suggest otherwise. He should beat Palmer but don&apos;t expect him to go much further. 23 Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez (Spain) v 42 Yuta Ikeda (Japan) Two players who win a lot. Ikeda is largely unknown outside of Japan but eight victories in the last two years is testimony to his abilities. A Japanese victory. 3 Tiger Woods (US) v 62 Thomas Bjorn (Denmark) This would be a fascinating encounter in normal circumstances but given Woods&apos;s current struggles \u2013 with his game and his image \u2013 it could be a great contest. Woods will be the favourite but if Bjorn steps up to the 1st tee believing he can win then he has a chance. Woods to win, but only just. 30 Geoff Ogilvy (Australia) v 35 Padraig Harrington (Ireland) If this was contest of erudition, extra holes would be guaranteed. Two of the smartest players on tour, but perhaps only one of them is playing well enough to go far in this event. Ogilvy, twice a winner of this tournament, looks to be running into form. Harrington is lost in a dense fog of swing tinkering. An Aussie win. 14 Dustin Johnson (US) v 51 Mark Wilson (US) The big-hitting, athletic Johnson is the prototype modern golfer, Wilson is a old school &quot;plodder&quot; \u2013 an American Luke Donald. No doubt the &quot;smart&quot; money will be on Wilson, who has already won on the PGA Tour this year but this course might have been designed with his opponent in mind. Johnson to win. 19 Bubba Watson (US) v 46 Bill Haas (US) A contest of contrasting styles, with Watson cast as the unorthodox genius and Haas as the rather anonymous PGA drone. The truth is rather more complex than that, and the outcome might be surprise. Haas, a terrific player, will advance. 6 Paul Casey (England ) v 59 Richard Green (Australia) Casey is the choice of many to win the tournament outright and for good reason. He has a good track record here and he is in decent form. This should be one of the easier victories of the first round. 27 Kim Kyung-tae (South Korea) v 38 Jason Day (Australia) One for the trainspotters. Day to win. 11 Ernie Els (South Africa) v 54 Jeff Overton (US) Els will be expected to win, though it is hard to work out why this is so. He has an appalling recent record in this tournament, is not a particular fan of the course and, in Overton, has an opponent who, as he proved at last year&apos;s Ryder Cup, is more than a little fond of the this format. An American victory. 22 Tim Clark (South Africa) v 43 Camilo Villegas (Colombia) This won&apos;t attract much of a gallery but it threatens to be a decent contest, not least because the South African and the Colombian have such contrasting styles. They are well matched but when all other things are equal in matchplay the best putter usual wins.

Professor Tim Niblock, a specialist in Middle Eastern politics at the University of Exeter, has identified a gap of several billion dollars a year between the amount Libya makes from its oil reserves and government spending \u2013 a shortfall he expects has contributed greatly to the wealth of Muammar Gaddafi and his nine children. &quot;It is very, very difficult to work out with any degree of certainty just how much they have because the ruling elite hides it in all sorts of places,&quot; said Niblock, who is also vice president of the British Society for Middle Eastern Studies (BRISMES). &quot;But at the very least it would be several billion dollars, in whatever form and it could potentially be a lot higher although I wouldn&apos;t want to predict just how much it might be.&quot; Alistair Newton, senior political analyst at Nomura, the Japanese bank and president of BRISMES, agreed that it was difficult to establish the extent of the Gaddafis&apos; wealth but said he &quot;would be surprised if it didn&apos;t run into billions&quot;. Where the Gaddafis have hidden their vast funds is anybody&apos;s guess, although Niblock expects that most of it is &quot;in bank accounts and liquid assets in Dubai, the Gulf and south-east Asia&quot; rather than in relatively transparent countries such as the UK, where the Libyan state has invested in London properties and in companies such as Pearson Group, owner of the Financial Times. In addition to squirrelling away much of their income, the Gaddafis have spent fortunes over the years propping up various African regimes, with Zimbabwe&apos;s president, Robert Mugabe, widely acknowledged to be one of the recipients, Niblock said. In the 1990s Gaddafi is thought to have given money to the Zaghawan tribe in Darfur, &quot;and I suspect some of them are among the African mercenaries fighting the civilians in Libya&quot;, Niblock added. [See footnote for clarification.] Libya&apos;s breakneck growth has enabled the country to build up myriad investments overseas. In addition to the Gaddafis&apos; private holdings, the state is thought to have invested close to \u00a361.8bn in assets across the globe. Their investments in the UK include an eight-bedroom home in Hampstead, north London, with a swimming pool and suede-lined cinema room. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the Libyan leader&apos;s second son, bought it in 2009 for \u00a310m. Most of the state&apos;s investments are made by the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), a &quot;sovereign wealth fund&quot; set up in 2006 to spend the country&apos;s oil money, which has an estimated $70bn of assets. LIA bought 3% of Pearson last year for \u00a3224m, making it one of the group&apos;s biggest shareholders, and had a 0.02% stake in RBS, although this was recently sold. Its UK property investments include Portman House, a 146,550 sq ft retail complex in Oxford Street, London, which houses retailers such as Boots and New Look, and an office at 14 Cornhill, opposite the Bank of England in the City. Aside from the Hampstead home, which is not primarily an investment, the only two direct investment projects that the Gaddafi family are known to be involved with both involve water. In 2009, when Silvio Berlusconi hosted the summit of G8 leading economies, he invited the Libyan leader as a special guest. Speeding towards the earthquake-stricken city of L&apos;Aquila, which Berlusconi had chosen as the venue, Gaddafi&apos;s motor cavalcade stopped in a remote town by a river at the bottom of a deep gorge. Not many people find their way to Antrodoco, let alone a &quot;Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution&quot;. Such was the welcome he received that shortly afterwards a Libyan delegation returned to the town to announce that the colonel wanted to plough money into it. Agreement was reached on a complex involving a luxury spa hotel and water bottling plant. Last September, Antrodoco\u00eds mayor, Maurizio Faina, said the \u20ac15m (\u00a312.7m) scheme was &quot;firming up&quot;. Whether it survives the current turmoil in Libya, however, remains to be seen. A similar question mark hangs over the established, if struggling, spa town of Fiuggi, south of Rome where pope Boniface VIII, among others, took the waters. In January, the Corriere della Sera reported that Gaddafi&apos;s family had formalised a proposal to sink \u20ac250m (\u00a3211m) into a conference centre with an airstrip and a complex that, once again, involved a spa and a water bottling plant. The paper said the deal was being brokered, not through Libyan channels, but by the Italo-Iraqi chamber of commerce. Fiuggi&apos;s mayor, along with his counterpart from Antrodoco, was a guest at a party thrown by Silvio Berlusconi in honour of the Libyan leader when he visited Rome last September. Gaddafi and Berlusconi have a famously warm personal relationship. Less well-known, however, is the fact that Berlusconi is in business with one of the Libyan state&apos;s investment vehicles. In June 2009, a Dutch-registered firm controlled by the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company, took a 10% stake in Quinta Communications, a Paris-based film production and distribution company. Quinta Communications was founded back in 1990 by Berlusconi in partnership with Tarak Ben Ammar, the nephew of the late Tunisian leader, Habib Bourguiba. The Italian prime minister has a 22% interest in the company through a Luxembourg-registered subsidiary of Fininvest, the firm at the heart of his sprawling business empire. Last September, the Libyans put a director on the board of Quinta Communications to sit alongside Berlusconi\u00eds representatives. Libyan investors already hold significant interests in several strategic Italian enterprises. They reportedly own around one per cent of Italy&apos;s biggest oil company, Eni; the LIA has an acknowledged 2% interest in the aerospace and defence group, Finmeccanica; Lafico is thought to retain more than 2% of Fiat and almost 15% of a quoted telecommunications company, Retelit. The Libyans also own 22% of the capital of a textile firm, Olcese. Perhaps their best-known investment is a 7.5% stake in the Serie A side Juventus. But undoubtedly the most controversial is another 7.5 per cent interest in Italy\u00eds largest bank, Unicredit. Last September, the bank&apos;s chief executive, Alessandro Profumo, walked out after a row over his willingness to let the Libyans build up that stake. The Northern League, Berlusconi&apos;s key allies in Italy&apos;s rightwing government, was known to be particularly queasy about the emergence of such a powerful Libyan presence. Experts say if Gaddafi is overthrown, the investments made by Libya&apos;s state funds would probably be unaffected, since a new government would have more pressing matters to attend to, and any sudden movements could damage their reputation. However, it is thought more likely that a new regime in Libya could look to freeze the assets of the Gaddafi family, as the new government in Egypt did with the assets of deposed Hosni Mubarak and his family. Since most of these are held in liquid form \u2013 and in country&apos;s outside Europe and the US \u2013 this would have no significant ramifications for business, they argue. UK interests About 150 British companies have established a presence in Libya since the US and Europe lifted economic sanctions in 2004, after the country renounced terrorism, ceased its nuclear weapons programme and handed over two suspects in the Lockerbie bombing case. The most high profile have been the oil companies, keen to tap Libya&apos;s vast reserves of fossil fuels. In a deal brokered in 2007 by Tony Blair, BP signed a \u00a3560m exploration agreement allowing it to search for oil and gas, offshore and onshore, in a joint venture with the Libya Investment Corporation. Shell is also exploring for oil in Libya as western companies seek to capitalise on a country with the largest oil reserves in Africa and substantial supplies of gas. High street retailers such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Next, Monsoon and Accessorize have also set up in the country to serve the growing middle-class population, as oil revenues have &quot;trickled down&quot; into the broader Libyan population. Companies such as AMEC, an engineering firm, and Biwater, a waste treatment company, have supplied services to Libya, which is using its oil revenues to reshape the country through an infrastructure spending spree that will cost about \u00a3310bn over the next decade. British exports to Libya have soared to about \u00a3930m in recent years, while the business momentum in post-sanctions Libya is so great that the economy managed to grow by about 5% last year, while much of the rest of the world struggled. Many British and foreign companies \u2013 including M&amp;S, BP and Shell \u2013 are evacuating staff from Libya and it could be some time before they return.

Safi Qurashi, feted as one of Britain&apos;s most successful businessmen after paying \u00a343m for a man-made island in the Gulf in the shape of Great Britain, was found guilty in the United Arab Emirates of signing two cheques with insufficient funds and cancelling another. A 115-page case review written by Tarique Ghaffur, the former assistant commissioner of the Met, claims that Qurashi and two colleagues who have also been imprisoned are the victims of a &quot;miscarriage of justice&quot;. &quot;They have stood little chance of proving their innocence particularly as the investigations and trials appeared so one-sided and biased \u2026 They have been the victim of circumstances brought on by the property recession, the actions of criminals and gross negligence by court officials,&quot; he said. However, Qurashi and his colleagues were not without fault and had allowed ambition to colour their judgment, Ghaffur noted in the report commissioned by Qurashi&apos;s family. &quot;Mr Qurashi and his colleagues were at times complacent, naive and even reckless in their business dealings,&quot; he said. Qurashi, 41, rose to fame as the owner of the 4.5-hectare island that is part of The World, a man-made archipelago of 300 reclaimed sandbanks in the Gulf, fashioned into the shape of the globe&apos;s land masses. The case raises difficult questions for the Royal family in the troubled kingdom. Last Monday, Britain&apos;s consul general to the UAE, Guy Warrington, took the unusual step of warning Britons that they are more likely to be arrested in Dubai \u2013 statistically and proportionally \u2013 than anywhere else in the world apart from Thailand. Dozens of Britons have been caught out in Dubai by laws that hand down jail sentences for cheque fraud, which have been strictly enforced in the midst of collapsing house prices, negative equity and reduced credit. Dubai&apos;s absence of banking laws meant much reliance was put on investments being secured on cheques whether issued as a security cheque or as a postdated cheque, the report claims. Investors soon started to make complaints that fraudsters had run off with their money, and the number of cases of bounced cheques reported by the banks and individuals rocketed to 5,000 a day in July 2009. The review by Ghaffur, the former head of the Met&apos;s specialist crime directorate, has been shown to the Guardian as part of a campaign by Qurashi&apos;s family. A number of people are named in the report as guilty of criminal acts. The report also calls for a fresh investigation into the case by the Dubai authorities and British police. Ghaffur spent three months working on the review, including several weeks in Dubai interviewing witnesses and lawyers. Police are reviewing criminal allegations raised within the report against a British businessman, it was confirmed last week. Qurashi, from Balham, south London, moved from London to Dubai in 2004 with wife, Huma, and children Sara, 12, Maaria, nine, and Yousuf, five. The son of a Pakistan-born travel agent, he had developed one of the first internet cafes in Soho, central London. In 2008, his property firm was turning over \u00a3400m a year and employed 80 staff. After he bought the island, Qurashi was interviewed by the journalist Piers Morgan for an ITV programme as one of Dubai&apos;s success stories. He claims he was denied access to a lawyer and handcuffed to a chair for 16 hours after being arrested with his business partner in January 2010. After using up all his legal options for appeal against his sentence, handed down in July, he petitioned the Queen. In a letter to a newspaper last year, he said his wife had suffered a miscarriage and his mother a heart attack while he has been in jail. He has had to close his property firm, Premier Real Estate Bureau. His daughter, Sara, has set up a website as part of the campaign to free him and appealed for help to meet Dubai&apos;s ruler. The islands, praised by some as an architectural miracle and condemned by others as an environmental disaster, were built in 2003 two and a half miles from the coast of Dubai and can be seen from space. They have become a symbol of Dubai&apos;s fading economic power in the global downturn. Built during the boom to be used as secluded playgrounds for the super-rich, they remain largely unused.

MAURICE PARKER FOR REASONS 1.4 (b) AND (d) 1. (S) SUMMARY: In December 2008, the GKOS sought to purchase approximately 60 million USD worth of military equipment, including helicopters, vehicles, weapons, and ammunition from a British weapons manufacturer. The British government denied the request over end-use concerns. In documents requesting permission to purchase the equipment, Swaziland&apos;s Ministry of Defense stated that the equipment was for use by the Umbutfo Swaziland Defense Force (USDF) on United Nations peacekeeping deployment in Africa. It is unclear whether this was the intended purpose, or whether GKOS was attempting to build up domestic capability to deal with unrest, or was possibly acting as an intermediary for a third party. END SUMMARY 2. (S) In December 2008, the GKOS sought to purchase approximately 60 million USD worth of military equipment from British weapons manufacturer Unionlet Limited (please protect). The British government denied the request over end-use concerns. A senior level contact with the British High Commission in Pretoria (please protect) recently provided Ambassador Parker with documentation on the attempted purchase. 3. (S) The purchase application, signed by XXXXXXXXXXXX, included requests for 3 Bell Model UH-1H helicopters, FN Herstal 7.6251mm Minimi light machine guns, blank and tracer ammunition, armored personnel carriers, command and control vehicles including one fitted with a 12.7x99mm M2 Browning heavy machine gun and others fitted with the FN Herstal light machine guns, military ambulances, armored repair and recovery vehicles, weapon sights, military image intensifier equipment, optical target surveillance equipment, 620 Heckler &amp; Koch G36E assault rifles, 240 Heckler &amp; Koch G36K assault rifles, 65 Heckler &amp; Koch G36E rifles, 75 Heckler &amp; Koch UMP submachine guns 9x19mm, and 35 Heckler &amp; Koch USP semi-automatic pistols. SwazilandQs Ministry of Defense stated in the purchase documents that the equipment was for use by the Umbutfo Swaziland Defense Force on United Nations peacekeeping deployment in Africa. 4. (S) COMMENT: Post is disappointed that XXXXXXXXXXXX did not disclose anything about this request to Ambassador Parker or DATT Langdorf in one of several very candid and private discussions since this order was placed. If XXXXXXXXXXXX were coerced into making the order, he might have been embarrassed to discuss it, though from his experience, one would think he would assume we would find out about it and that he might have wanted to do damage control. 5. (S) The array of weapons requested would not be needed for the first phases of peacekeeping, although it is possible someone tried to convince the Swazi government they were required. The GKOS may have been attempting to build up domestic capability to deal with unrest, or was possibly acting as an intermediary for a third party such as Zimbabwe or a Middle Eastern country that had cash, diamonds or goods to trade. XXXXXXXXXXXX, traveled to Iran and later to Libya, and several GKOS Ministers made trips to Kuwait, Dubai, and other Arab nations. We also understand that an Iranian ambassador, resident in either Pretoria or Maputo, recently presented his letters of credence to King Mswati to establish formal diplomatic relations with Swaziland. 6. (S) We are not aware of subsequent purchase requests. XXXXXXXXXXXX 7. (S) Please protect information on the identity of the British weapons manufacturer. The British contact providing documentation for this purchase informed Ambassador Parker that if the information becomes public, the manufacturer could sue the British Government for violating confidentiality.

The well-bred Khawlah has won over a mile and finished third in the Group Three Oh So Sharp Stakes at Newmarket and could throw down a challenge under Frankie Dettori. The Listed Meydan Classic, over a mile, looks an open contest and Godolphin are capable of taking it for the third year on the bounce with Janood (4.55).

Mahmood Al Zarooni&apos;s Introvert and Fawzi Nass&apos;s Krypton Factor look next best. De Kock is again well represented in the 11-furlong Tapeta handicap and his Star Empire (3.00) looks dangerous down in trip after not quite seeing out a mile and six last time. Prizefighting, who has run well in all three attempts over course and distance, looks the main danger. The six-furlong Tapeta handicap is a tricky contest and the trip may just stretch Walter Swinburn&apos;s admirable Monsieur Joe, so he is overlooked in favour of the bottom weight Orife (3.40), who made an encouraging local debut last week and can make the most of a good draw here. Atlantic Sport, stepping down in trip, can also feature under Kevin Shea. The concluding mile turf handicap can provide the British raiding party with another success courtesy of Ed Dunlop&apos;s Fareer (6.15). The 2009 Royal Ascot Britannia Stakes winner looked to have recovered from travelling setback when a good fourth behind Famous Warrior last week and it is interesting that connections have reached for the headgear.

Money talks for Fifa The Fifa president Sepp Blatter is in Sudan for the Confederation of African Football congress, hailing last year&apos;s World Cup&apos;s success in swelling the world governing body&apos;s reserves to $1.2bn from $1.06bn. A little over three months before the presidential elections take place, Digger smells a whiff of electioneering. If you look closely at the Fifa accounts from 2009, that $140m influx is precisely what Fifa anticipated 12 months ago. The 2009 annual report states: &quot;The result for the four-year period [between the South Africa and Brazil World Cups] will be $200m and accordingly, taking account of depreciation, there will be a moderate increase in equity, as planned, of $140m by the end of 2014.&quot; Let us spray \u2013 officially  Along with goal-line technology, one of the less-documented items on the agenda during the meeting of the International Football Association Board at Celtic Manor next week is for referees to be permitted to carry &quot;vanishing spray&quot;.

Fifa has brought it to the IFAB table for a more in-depth discussion.

Redknapp&apos;s squad flew out on Thursday to join the manager, who had arrived earlier to attend a horse racing meeting, for the week-long session in the emirate. Bale has now been out for a month, having not featured for Spurs since the 1-1 draw at Newcastle United on 22 January and missed the opening game against Milan at San Siro, which Redknapp&apos;s team won 1-0 after a late goal from Peter Crouch. Speaking in Dubai Redknapp was asked if the warm weather would aid Bale&apos;s recovery for the visit of Milan next month. He said: &quot;Hopefully. He&apos;s back in training today so we&apos;ll look at him tomorrow. &quot;He&apos;s started to run, which is good, so he could be available. He&apos;s an important player for us. Hopefully there will be a bit of sunlight, Bale is back and a few of the others.&quot; All of Tottenham&apos;s squad have flown to Dubai, including Rafael van der Vaart, Tom Huddlestone, Alan Hutton, Ledley King, Vedran Corluka and Jonathan Woodgate, who are all recovering from injuries. Despite holding the advantage over Milan, Redknapp does not view Tottenham as favourites to advance to the Champions League quarter-finals. &quot;We had Young Boys of Bern first up [in the qualification round], and we were 3-0 down after 20 minutes and I thought: &apos;That&apos;s it for us.&apos; But we came through that and have hung in there,&quot; he said. &quot;Milan will still be difficult. They&apos;ve got forwards that can hurt you, they can still be dangerous. You&apos;ve just got to keep going. But I&apos;m looking forward to the game, it should be a great game.&quot; Redknapp believes that the two Spanish clubs are the teams to beat if the competition is to be won. &quot;It&apos;s all to play for, but you&apos;ve got to say the two favourites would be Barcelona and Real Madrid,&quot; he added.", "title": "Harry Redknapp hopeful Dubai break will aid Gareth Bale's recovery", "sentences": ["Harry Redknapp is hopeful that Tottenham Hotspur&apos;s warm weather training break in Dubai will ensure Gareth Bale returns for the Champions League last-16 second leg against Milan at White Hart Lane on 9 March.", "Speaking in Dubai Redknapp was asked if the warm weather would aid Bale&apos;s recovery for the visit of Milan next month.", "Hopefully there will be a bit of sunlight, Bale is back and a few of the others.&quot; All of Tottenham&apos;s squad have flown to Dubai, including Rafael van der Vaart, Tom Huddlestone, Alan Hutton, Ledley King, Vedran Corluka and Jonathan Woodgate, who are all recovering from injuries."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-24T19:51:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2011/feb/24/dont-libyan-protesters-care-about-r-and-b-stars", "tags": ["Beyonc\u00e9", "Mariah Carey", "Music", "Celebrity", "Life and style", "Muammar Gaddafi", "Libya", "Africa"], "article": "Like everyone, Lost in Showbiz has spent this week looking aghast at events in Libya: the violence, the bloodshed \u2013 and Gaddafi&apos;s insistence that everyone taking part in the demonstrations is on &quot;hallucination pills&quot;, as if the whole thing is being orchestrated by Hawkwind. And, with every news report that arrives, the same unanswered question presents itself. Will these people not think at all of the\u00a0careers of Lionel Richie, Beyonc\u00e9 and Mariah Carey? Standing up and courageously fighting for freedom, human rights and democracy in the face of almost unimaginable horror is all well and good, but what about the human right of the world&apos;s leading r&apos;n&apos;b stars to make vast sums by performing at the behest of a tyrannical dictator and his family? If the Gaddafi regime falls, who will bankroll enormous gigs of the kind played by Richie in the grounds of the Bab al-Azizia barracks in 2006? Wouldn&apos;t it be a terrible pity if his son were too distracted by political events to arrange the annual New Year&apos;s Eve gig on St Barts that in 2009 paid Beyonc\u00e9 a reported $2m for five songs and the year before played host to Carey and Timbaland? Let&apos;s have a little perspective here! Lost in Showbiz looks the Libyan protesters sternly in the eye and asks: Are you sure your struggle to free yourself from the yoke of tyranny is worth disrupting Beyonc\u00e9&apos;s schedule for? Perhaps you should ruminate on the recently expressed opinion of noted political philosopher Jim Davidson and reconsider: &quot;Once people start protesting in those kind of numbers the politicians have to listen. What I can&apos;t get my head around is everyone saying democracy is the way forward. I don&apos;t think it is. Look at us. I\u00a0lived in Dubai. They have a ruling family and all&apos;s well. Giving the people a right to choose who governs them is a stupid thing to do.&quot; You see? You&apos;re screwing everything up for Carey in pursuit of something the greatest socio-political mind of our epoch thinks is stupid! Lost in Showbiz is well aware of the carping voices that suggest Richie, Beyonc\u00e9 et al should have thought twice about associating themselves with the Gaddafi regime in the first place. To them, it can only say: the benefit of hindsight is a wonderful thing, isn&apos;t it? Perhaps it&apos;s worth reminding yourself that Richie&apos;s Tripoli gig \u2013 a concert that ended with a group of children dressed as angels singing We Are The World \u2013 took place five years ago, an era when there was no sign that the Brother Leader might be the kind of crazed despot who would bomb his own people, unless you count the website set up that year that listed 343 victims of murder and political assassination under Gaddafi, the ongoing imprisonment of the late democracy campaigner Fathi el-Jahmi and the Human Rights Watch report that detailed &quot;the continued arrests and incarceration of political prisoners, some of them &apos;disappeared&apos;; the absence of a free press; the ban on independent organisations; violations of the rights of women and foreigners; and the torture of detainees&quot;. Come on! You think Richie&apos;s got time to read every human rights report in the world? He&apos;s got a busy touring schedule \u2013 it&apos;s not just genocidal autocrats who are gagging for a fix of Dancin&apos; On the Ceiling \u2013 and those Walkers crisps don&apos;t advertise themselves! &quot;The hospitality in Libya is\u00a0unbelievable,&quot; he told a press conference, which is certainly one way of describing a country where the regime&apos;s methods of torture allegedly include &quot;clubbing; applying electric shock; applying corkscrews to the back; pouring lemon juice in open wounds; breaking fingers and allowing the joints to heal without medical care; suffocating with plastic bags and hanging by the wrists&quot;. But why dwell on the whole corkscrews-to-the-back/lemon-juice-in-open-wounds aspect of Gaddafi? He liked Say You, Say Me, and that&apos;s the important thing! And in the case of Beyonc\u00e9 and Carey, it wasn&apos;t even Gaddafi himself who organised the gig: it was his sons, most notably the delectable Hannibal Gaddafi, who has put some clear blue water between himself and his father by rigorously avoiding behaving like the violent, spoilt son of a dictator. In 2001, he was arrested for attacking three Italian policemen with a fire extinguisher, then demanded diplomatic immunity. In 2005, his then-girlfriend Aline Skaf filed an assault lawsuit against him for punching her: he then allegedly brandished a 9mm handgun and went on a furniture-smashing rampage in his hotel suite. In 2009, after screams were heard from their London hotel room, police discovered Skaf, now his wife, with facial injuries including a broken nose, which she claimed she had sustained in a fall: three of his security staff were arrested for obstruction. A year previously, the pair had been held for two days in Switzerland after allegedly beating their servants. In what you have to say is a fairly unique approach to the business of parenting, his father responded by shutting down local subsidiaries of Swiss companies, cancelling most commercial flights between the two countries, announcing that if he had nuclear weapons he would &quot;wipe Switzerland off the map&quot;, then submitting a proposal to the UN that the country be dissolved and partitioned between Italy, France and Germany. Lost in Showbiz has a positive message for the performers involved: nil desperandum! The Gaddafi family might not be organising any high-paying gigs for the foreseeable future, but there&apos;s plenty more music-loving murderous dictators in the sea!

The arrest came at the start of the murder trial of another American held in Pakistan, the CIA agent Raymond Davis. Peshawar police arrested Aaron DeHaven, a contractor who recently worked for the US embassy in Islamabad, saying that his visa had expired. Little was known about DeHaven except that his firm, which also has offices in Afghanistan and Dubai, is staffed by retired US military and defence personnel who boast of direct experience in the &quot;global war on terror&quot;. It was unclear whether his arrest was linked to escalating tensions between the Inter-Services Intelligence and the CIA, triggered by the trial of Davis, who appeared in handcuffs at a brief court hearing in a Lahore jail. The 36-year-old former special forces soldier, whose status as a spy was revealed by the Guardian, refused to sign a chargesheet presented to him by the prosecution, which says he murdered two men at a traffic junction on January 27. Davis instead repeated his claim of diplomatic immunity \u2013 a claim supported by President Barack Obama, who called him &quot;our diplomat&quot;. The press and public were excluded from the hearing in Kot Lakhpat jail, where Pakistani officials have taken unusual measures to ensure Davis&apos;s security amid a public clamour for his execution. The furore has also triggered the most serious crisis between the ISI and the CIA since the 9/11 attacks. A senior ISI official told the Guardian that the CIA must &quot;ensure there are no more Raymond Davises or his ilk&quot; if it is to repair the tattered relationship of trust. &quot;They need to come clean, tell us who they are and what they are doing. They need to stop doing things behind our back,&quot; he said. There are &quot;two or three score&quot; covert US operatives roaming Pakistan, &quot;if not more&quot;, he said. CIA spokesman George Little said that agency ties to the ISI &quot;have been strong over the years, and when there are issues to sort out, we work through them. That&apos;s the sign of a healthy partnership&quot;. Pakistani civilian officials warned that the ISI was amplifying fallout from the Davis crisis through selective media leaks to win concessions from the US. &quot;They&apos;re playing the media; in private they&apos;re much more deferential to the Americans,&quot; said a senior government official, who added that the two agencies had weathered previous disagreements in private. The crisis has sucked in the military top brass from both countries. On Tuesday, a Pakistani delegation led by General Ashfaq Kayani met US generals, led by Admiral Mike Mullen, at a luxury resort in Oman to hammer out the issues. The US stressed that it &quot;did not want the US-Pakistan relationship to go into a freefall under media and domestic pressures&quot;, according to an account of the meeting obtained by Foreign Policy magazine. The ISI official agreed that future co-operation was vital. &quot;They need us; we need them,&quot; he said. &quot;But we need to move forward in the right direction, based on equality and respect.&quot; The media furore over Davis has fuelled scrutiny of other American security officials in Pakistan and their visa arrangements, and may have led police to Aaron DeHaven in Peshawar on Friday. DeHaven runs a company named Catalyst Services which, according to its website, is staffed by retired military and defence department personnel who have &quot;played some role in major world events&quot; including the collapse of the Soviet Union, the military mission to Somalia and the &quot;global war on terror&quot;. Services offered include &quot;full-service secure residences&quot;, protective surveillance and armed security. One prospective customer who met DeHaven last year described him as a small, slightly-built man, who wore glasses and had broad knowledge of Pakistani politics. DeHaven said he had lived in Kandahar, Afghanistan, for one year, had married a Pakistani woman along the border with Afghanistan, and spoke Pashto fluently. He said he moved his base from Peshawar to Islamabad last year over suspicions that he worked for Blackwater, the controversial US military contracting firm. His business partner is listed on company documents as Hunter Obrikat with an address in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Guardian was unable to contact either men at listed numbers in Pakistan, Afghanistan, the US and Dubai. US embassy spokeswoman Courtney Beale said DeHaven was &quot;not a direct employee of the US government&quot; but added that details could not be confirmed until a consular officer had met him. The arrest is another sign of brittle relations between the two countries. US officials in Washington argue that Davis is a registered diplomat who should be immediately released under the provisions of the Vienna convention. But that plea has fallen on deaf ears in Pakistan, where the papers have been filled with lurid accounts of the spy&apos;s alleged activities, including unlikely accounts of him working with the Taliban and al-Qaida. The US has also struck some blows in the covert public relations war. After a lull of three weeks, the CIA restarted its drone campaign in the tribal belt last Monday, with near-daily attacks on militant targets since then. &quot;It&apos;s their way of showing who&apos;s in charge,&quot; said a senior Pakistani official. And at the Oman meeting, Mullen warned Kayani he would apply &quot;other levers&quot; to the Pakistanis if a solution to the case was not found, the official added. Since Davis&apos;s CIA status was revealed, US officials have told Pakistani officials that their best hope is in offering compensation to the families of the two men Davis shot in Lahore. Religious parties, however, have pressured relatives not to accept money. Meanwhile, the Zardari government says it will settle the issue of Davis&apos;s diplomatic status at a court hearing scheduled for 14 March.", "title": "Pakistan arrests US security contractor as rift with CIA deepens", "sentences": ["Little was known about DeHaven except that his firm, which also has offices in Afghanistan and Dubai, is staffed by retired US military and defence personnel who boast of direct experience in the &quot;global war on terror&quot;.", "The Guardian was unable to contact either men at listed numbers in Pakistan, Afghanistan, the US and Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-25T17:24:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/25/gianfranco-ferre-milan-fashion-week", "tags": ["Milan fashion week", "Fashion", "Fashion weeks", "Life and style", "Europe", "Dubai", "Italy", "World news", "Milan fashion week autumn/winter 2009", "Milan fashion week autumn/winter 2011"], "article": "Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9, one of the grand masters of Italian fashion, was a name set to vanish into the footnotes of history before it was dramatically saved by a Dubai-based investor just in time for Friday&apos;s catwalk show in Milan. The Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9 label went into bankruptcy a year ago, three years after the death of the founding designer. It has since continued to function under government-backed bankruptcy protection, but a deal with a potential new owner fell through in December. When the company cancelled a menswear show a month ago at the eleventh hour many thought the label was at risk of imminent closure. But fortunes at Ferr\u00e9 have changed dramatically. Friday&apos;s show was a celebratory affair, attended by proud new owner Abdulkader Sankari and his son Ahmed Sankari of the Paris Group, a fashion distributor and franchisee which runs 250 stores in the Middle East. At the show the Sankaris confirmed that the deal, a 100% buyout, although still in its technical phase, was &quot;effectively done. We are very excited. We want to take Ferr\u00e9 back to what it used to be.&quot; Ahmed Sankari will become president of the Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9 label. The price was not disclosed, but Womenswear Daily estimated that the Dubai investors had spent between \u20ac10m and \u20ac20m. Recent fashion history has proved that it is entirely possible for a label of faded glories to propel itself back from the outskirts of fashion to the centre. Burberry has reinvented itself over the past decade, while the best-reviewed collections in the past two years have been those by Phoebe Philo at Celine, a label which had previously been languishing in obscurity. Friday&apos;s collection, designed by Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi, will probably have pleased the label&apos;s new owners. This was a solid, commercially-minded collection which pushed all the right buttons for fashion&apos;s current obsession with a feminine reinterpretation of minimalism. Sleek grey single-breasted coats were unembellished save for a flash of black leather at the collar; an ivory shift dress was lifted from the pedestrian with slivers of contrasting fabric. There were few entirely fresh ideas to be seen here. But it was elegant, beautifully tailored in superb fabrics and will no doubt sell. Aquilano and Rimondi wove into the collection tributes to the work of Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9 himself, suggesting that they might be able to use the Ferr\u00e9 heritage as a building block for a rejuvenated label. In his 1980s heyday Ferr\u00e9 dressed Elizabeth Taylor, Sophia Loren and Princess Diana. He practised as an architect before becoming a fashion designer, and became known as the &quot;modernist architect of fashion&quot;. His trademark was the white shirt, reinvented each season. In the programme notes for the show the current designers forged a direct link to Ferr\u00e9 by saying they had taken the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright as the starting point for this collection. But Milan fashion will never be all about minimalism, and Donatella Versace redressed the balance with a punchy, colourful collection aimed squarely at pleasing the moneyed, gym-honed women who wear her clothes. No expense was spared on the most luxurious fabrics: python, feather-coated chiffon, felted cashmere, leather and suede were used to adorn floor-length evening gowns, body-conscious shifts and smartly-tailored double-breasted coats, in jewel shades of ruby and emerald.", "title": "Milan fashion week: Investor rescues Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9 label at last minute", "sentences": ["Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9, one of the grand masters of Italian fashion, was a name set to vanish into the footnotes of history before it was dramatically saved by a Dubai-based investor just in time for Friday&apos;s catwalk show in Milan.", "The price was not disclosed, but Womenswear Daily estimated that the Dubai investors had spent between \u20ac10m and \u20ac20m."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-25T19:10:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/27/aerotropolis-greg-lindsay-john-kasarda-review", "tags": ["Art and design", "Society", "Architecture", "Books", "Business", "Culture"], "article": "The old city is no more. The future belongs to places such as New Songdo in South Korea, a wholly new city being built on an artificial island and linked by road bridge to Incheon international airport. And to 500 cities of the same size, as yet unborn, that China needs. And to Memphis, Tennessee, home of Fedex, and the UPS city of Louisville,\u00a0Kentucky. These, says Greg Lindsay, showing a suitably 21st-century indifference to the ancient Greek plural of &quot;polis&quot;, are &quot;aerotropoli&quot;. An aerotropolis is a city with an airport at its centre, rather than its periphery, &quot;a new kind of city, one native to our era of instant gratification \u2013 call it the instant age&quot;. It is &quot;a new phenomenon\u2026 reshaping the way we live and transforming the way we do business&quot;. Cities such as London, forever dithering over a third runway at Heathrow, and Los Angeles, where nimbies keep blocking the expansion of LAX, and New York, with sclerotic links from the city to its airports, are in trouble. Lindsay is a journalist fascinated by air travel. His co-author is John Kasarda, a business school professor with presumably lucrative consultancies telling countries, cities and businesses how to prepare for this new age. Lindsay wrote and did much of the exploration for Aerotropolis; Kasarda supplied much of the wisdom. The book tells how the world is rearranged by the logic of time, distance and cost. In 1974, for example, the Japanese Airlines executive Akira Okazaki used the spare capacity on cargo flights to fly whole chilled tuna around, leading to the world-wide consumption of sushi, with the result that bluefin tuna is now endangered in the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean. When political protests closed Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport, hotels ran out of imported milk and fish, but filled with orchids that could no longer be flown out. The authors address obvious counter-arguments. They do not accept that electronic communication will reduce demand for flying, instead pointing out that increased communication and increased travel have always gone together. If people make friends through Facebook, they may want to fly to meet up. Amazon stirs up a whirl of airborne goods, and business deals arranged by email need eye-contact and handshakes to be consummated. As for ecological objections, they argue that air transport causes a relatively small proportion of emissions. Roses imported to Britain from Holland, for example, are far more carbon-hungry than those from Kenya, because the hothouses and fertiliser needed to grow them outweigh the savings on fuel costs. Aerotropolis also describes the kinds of space formed by flight, the concourses and hubs that Douglas Coupland called &quot;an in-between place, a &apos;nowhere&apos;, a technicality\u2026 an anti-experience\u2026 like what happens to you just after you die and before you get shipped off to wherever you&apos;re going\u2026 pure neutrality made concrete&quot;. The patron saint of such places is George Clooney, as the flying, heartless, corporate assassin in Up in the Air. Walter Kim, author of the book on which the film was based, has contributed a plug for the front cover of Aerotropolis. &quot;Throw out your old atlas,&quot; it says. &quot;The new one is here.&quot; I have to say, I have heard much of this before: in Martin Pawley&apos;s Terminal Architecture of 1998, in Rem Koolhaas&apos;s S,M,L,XL(1995), in Deyan Sudjic&apos;s The 100 Mile City (1993), in Marc Aug\u00e9&apos;s Non-Places (1992), in the writings of JG Ballard, even in Alexander Korda&apos;s 1936 film of HG Wells&apos;s Things to Come. Despite all this historic futurology, there seem to be quite a lot of boring old cities around still doing reasonably well. The really interesting question is why the true aerotropolis, despite compelling reasons for its existence, is taking so long to get off the ground. The examples cited in the book are not completely convincing, and form an unintentional anti-prospectus for Kasarda&apos;s consultancy business. There is the city that was to be built next to Bangkok&apos;s airport, with advice from Kasarda, but didn&apos;t happen. Reunion, a development close to Denver international airport, &quot;a community specifically created for the pursuit of happiness&quot;, ended up with one of the highest foreclosure rates in the region. Wilmington, Ohio, lavishly wooed DHL with public money, only to be dumped when the company&apos;s profits went the wrong way. Memphis, despite the blessing of Fedex, &quot;still has a long way to go&quot;. There is the growth around Washington&apos;s Dulles airport, which owes as much to vast contracts from the Pentagon as to the airport. There\u00a0is\u00a0Dubai. It is hard, yet, to find a true aerotropolis, a thriving, rich city formed around an airport, outside the promotional spiels that promise New Songdo will be &quot;A cool city! A smart city!&quot;. Human factors, such as the fear of planes falling on your head, or attachment to a place, or political manoeuvring, or the persistence of non-aeronautic networks, counteract that other human factor, the desire for eye-contact, which seems to drive the immense machinery of air travel. The less spectacular truth is that cities have always relied on transport, but not on transport alone. Airports are a powerful force among others, and it is the interaction of these forces that makes cities interesting. Aerotropolis is straining too hard to be a smartypants bestseller of the the type produced by Malcolm Gladwell to explore this complexity. It is hectoring, breathless, over-persuading, a boring book with an interesting one struggling to get out. And it undermines itself in the authors&apos; biographical note: Lindsay lives not in Memphis or any other aerotropolis, but in Brooklyn, in the dinosaur city of New York \u2013 not, presumably, because of its airports.", "title": "Aerotropolis: The Way We'll Live Next by Greg Lindsay and John Kasarda \u2013 review", "sentences": ["There\u00a0is\u00a0Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-27T00:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/feb/27/istanbul-minarets-and-martinis", "tags": ["Istanbul holidays", "Turkey holidays", "Europe holidays", "Short breaks", "City breaks", "Travel", "Nobel prize in literature", "Awards and prizes", "Books", "Cultural trips", "Music", "Culture", "Hip-hop"], "article": "In the lobby of the cinema in Istanbul&apos;s Nisantasi district, salon-tanned kids stretch out on sofas overlooking the lights of the city, before a blue-lit cocktail bar. It takes me a while to realise that these glamorous teenagers aren&apos;t here to see Public Enemies or Ghosts of Girlfriends Past; they&apos;ve come to the cinema lobby just to make the scene. I&apos;d heard for years that Istanbul, which was one of the European Capitals of Culture for 2010, calls itself &quot;Europe&apos;s coolest city&quot;. It&apos;s certainly one of the most complex \u2013 the centre of a country that is 98% Islamic yet increasingly famous for its watermelon martinis. Here is a place whose Blue Mosque has an LCD screen flashing the time in Paris and Tokyo. Turkey&apos;s most cosmopolitan metropolis has more billionaires than any city other than New York, Moscow and London, and when I\u00a0went to its Istinye Park mall, it was to see Aston Martin DB9s and Bentleys jammed outside a gilded avenue of fortresses labelled &quot;Armani&quot;, &quot;Gucci&quot;, &quot;Vuitton&quot; and &quot;Dior&quot;. To my friends in business, and to many proud Istanbulians, this city is where the Islamic world meets the global order, serving as a bridge \u2013 literal and metaphorical \u2013 between Europe and the outer edges of Asia. But still nothing had prepared me for the flash and glitter of it all. We foreigners like to recall that Istanbul is the only city on earth with one shore in Asia and one in Europe. But its real heart, according to its eloquent son, Orhan Pamuk, in his evocative memoir Istanbul: Memories of a City, lies rather in the division between the old (which is usually the local and the Islamic) and the new (generally the western and the secular). The relation between the two is still tense: I had to walk through a security machine just to go to the movies. And Pamuk himself, though Turkey&apos;s most famous modern citizen, was brought to trial in 2005 simply for mentioning his country&apos;s brutal treatment of Armenians in 1915 (the next year, perhaps in response, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature).     The Basilica Cistern. Photograph: Yadid Levy/Alamy    Istanbul today seems as compressed and vital a model of the larger globe as you could find; one morning, when I\u00a0awoke just before dawn, I could hear the call to Islamic prayer from every minaret, even as I could faintly make out the sound of hip-hop pounding along the streets. I&apos;ve always been something of a global creature: I was born in England to parents from India and I grew up in California, though I\u00a0now live in Japan \u2013 and for much of my life I&apos;ve sought out global places that are trying to piece together, as I\u00a0am, disparate cultures and identities, to make a stained-glass whole. Istanbul is most attractive to many for its complex, layered past \u2013 its harems and mosques and cemeteries and bazaars; but for me it&apos;s intriguing as an image of the future. It was no surprise, I thought, that President Obama visited the city within three months of taking office. The minute I arrived in town \u2013 my first trip back in more than 20 years \u2013 I could feel the contemporary excitement that makes Istanbul one of the hottest destinations around. The narrow, cobblestoned streets around Ortak\u00f6y Mosque were so crowded on a\u00a0Saturday evening, close to midnight, that I could hardly walk. Little boys were letting off neon-blue paper dragonflies, like homemade fireworks, and local girls whose tiny skirts and wild blonde tresses suggested Shakira were slipping past black-clad doormen at the Angelique nightspot. A small stall was offering tarot readings and tattoos, and behind it the Bosphorus Bridge was bathed in red hues, then blue, then yellow, so it seemed more a giant Slinky than a thoroughfare between two continents.     Restaurants lining the Galata Bridge. Photograph: Jorg Greuel/Getty Images    The particular promise and confidence of the city today lies to some extent in the fact that it has been three times the centre of the world; for centuries it has known how to talk and trade with Russia to the north, Iran to the east, Central Asia just behind and Europe all around. Unlike, say, a Dubai or an Abu Dhabi it can be in tune with the future precisely because it has so rich a sense of the past and such seasoned wisdom about the cycles of culture and history. I walked into the spice bazaar one day and found LCD signs in Japanese (though the merchants there were fast-talking in French and Portuguese and Spanish). And the most commonly seen couples in the backpacker area of the old district of Sultanahmet were beaming young Korean women on the arms of leather-jacketed young Turks who&apos;d just won them over. Around them, the handful of restored Ottoman boutique hotels that had greeted me in 1986 now numbered 200. Everywhere there seemed to be a natural savoir faire that reminded me of cities such as Mumbai and Shanghai, able to rise from every setback to put themselves in sync with the moment. Even the 6th-century caverns at the Basilica Cistern are lit now in nightclub colours with &quot;Summertime, and the livin&apos; is easy&quot; piped incongruously around its Medusa columns.     Istinye Park mall. Photograph: Peter Horree/Alamy    Yet for all the racy Italian fashion ads (on the Asian side of town) and for all the salesmen (on the European side) laying down carpets on the streets at 9pm from which to sell toys and electric shavers, the city can seem to the anxious as if it&apos;s on its way to becoming the next trendy, but perennially torn, Beirut. To this day, more than 97% of Turkey is Asian, which makes Istanbul an anomaly as well as a beacon. And a city of 500,000 souls in 1920 now contains up to 25\u00a0times that many as people flood in from the Anatolian heartland, perhaps unsure themselves whether the economic opportunities the city offers are worth embracing if they also bring with them secular European values. The newspapers were all talking, when I visited, about a new &quot;hip&quot; mosque in the \u00dcsk\u00fcdar area, said to be the first such building designed by a\u00a0woman. But it seemed a fair guess that the silent majority across the country, away from the imported surfaces, still saw &quot;hipness&quot; and mosques as pointing in opposite directions. &quot;It&apos;s the most eastern part of the west and the most western part of the east,&quot; a Turkish student said when I asked a class in the smallish city of Isparta (through its American teacher) what they thought of Istanbul. He didn&apos;t add that that could result in collision as much as in collusion. I kept trying to remember how Istanbul might look to a Turk, for whom it is an invigorating model of the future. If foreigners are always drawn to what is &quot;Turkish&quot; about the place, the Turks who pour in from the interior are, for equally good reason, drawn towards everything that seems cutting-edge and international. One of the students I&apos;d questioned told me: &quot;People in Turkey say: &apos;The earth of Istanbul is made of gold.&apos;&quot;     Taksim neighbourhood. Photograph: Peter Turnley/Corbis    It certainly can seem that way around the boutiques and caf\u00e9s of the privileged quarters. After staying across the street from the Blue Mosque in Sultanahmet, I moved one day over to the Bentley Hotel, near Nisantasi, and walked into a\u00a0minimalist white-and-black lobby with fashion magazines from Sweden laid out on a table. A framed letter next to the front desk expressed the thanks of a cardinal who had stayed here recently while travelling with the Pope. And after checking into a designer room there, I took a\u00a0taxi down to the Istanbul Modern Art Museum, whose in-your-face canvases shout out that Turkey today refuses to be boxed inside a\u00a0foreigner&apos;s quaint notions of it. Since the summer day was buoyant and warm, I boarded a cruise ship travelling up the Bosphorus, and as we passed the yali summer houses set along the water, I was forcibly reminded that affluence and style are nothing new here; novelist Gustave Flaubert, visiting in 1850, had said that Istanbul, a century hence, would be the capital of the world. At the Sakip Sabanci Museum, much of fortunate Istanbul was reclining on the museum&apos;s lawns listening to live jazz as men in polo shirts picked nonchalantly at slices of watermelon; the museum&apos;s restaurant had, in 2007, been named by Wallpaper* magazine as one of the hottest new eateries on the planet. In the old wooden houses of Arnavutk\u00f6y, not far away, trendy couples were dining on terraces filled with bright flowers, as if posing for a vision of what many young Turks in the countryside might see as the good life. &quot;Turkey managed to live through, in 2007, the paradox of an elected party rooted in Islamic tradition stating that it wishes to maintain the secular republic set up by Kemal Atat\u00fcrk in 1923,&quot; Manoutchehr Eskandari-Qajar, a political science professor in California, told me, and it survived the further paradox of the nation&apos;s military, determined to protect that secularism, refraining from taking over the new government by force. If Turkey could maintain such a balance, my friend, an expert on the Middle East, had said, he had high hopes for it. But culturally the whole country seems to be perched on a tightrope. Just three weeks before I arrived, the city had placed a ban on smoking in its coffeehouses and eating places; this seemed about as plausible as banning red wine in Paris or noodles on the streets of Beijing. By the time I began walking around, angry proprietors were already launching loud protests in the streets, claiming that the ruling had stripped them of up to 80% of their business. And for those who love Istanbul, the small change seemed symptomatic of a city that was eager to show how European and modern it was, even though its heart \u2013 and character \u2013 lie in its very pungency and closeness to its eastern roots. &quot;Istanbul has always been about raw life, from the murderous driving and yawning potholes in the roads to the street brawls and the smoke-filled teahouses,&quot; Nigel McGilchrist, a sometime resident of Turkey and author of the Blue Guide Greece: The Aegean Islands told me of the city he has known for more than 30 years. &quot;It&apos;s not Belgium or suburban Gloucestershire; it&apos;s the nearest thing to India in the west.&quot;     The city's modern art museum. Photograph: Jordi Cami/Alamy    Even as Turkey cherishes its almost half-century-long wish to become a formal part of Europe, it seems reluctant to leave behind the ancient identity it still so proudly maintains. For centuries Istanbul has taken in Greeks and Armenians and Jews, and in areas such as Balat and Fener the echoes of their presence are what give the streets their savour. Yet none of those groups seems to have affected &quot;Turkishness&quot; at the core or coloured the city&apos;s sense of itself. After a week visiting every corner, I realised I had not seen a\u00a0single woman working in a\u00a0hotel or restaurant or caf\u00e9. &quot;I worry,&quot; McGilchrist went on, &quot;that Turkey wants to become European in all the stale, bureaucratic ways, without embracing important, deep-rooted values of Europe, such as respecting the rights of dissenting writers to express their views.&quot; And as I walked past the Robinson Crusoe bookshop, boasting its large selection of English-language books, as I sat in a little room in the orthodox area of Fatih, where a sheikh was leading followers in passionate Sufi chants to the sound of a tambourine, I began to feel that the power of the city lay precisely in the fact that its next move could never be anticipated. The true nature of Istanbul seems always in dispute \u2013 or in passage, at least, like the boats constantly crisscrossing its waterways.     Asmalimescit, with its hip cafes.  Photograph: Alamy    I had seen more chadors and head scarves here than I had noticed in Syria or Egypt \u2013 but the women with blonde ponytails were still sipping $20 cosmopolitans among the trendy caf\u00e9s of Asmalimescit. There were few signs of the poverty I was used to in places like Jakarta or Marrakech. Yet outside the glamorous areas, Istanbul did not seem a wealthy city \u2013 especially for the millions who stream in and end up in drab apartment blocks without the new lives they dreamed of. Statistically it claims to be one of the safest cities in Europe, but it didn&apos;t strike me as particularly friendly. Watchful and guarded, Istanbul seemed the place where the age-old reserve of Greece runs into the very different kind of foreignness of Pakistan. Pamuk had been similarly circumspect in his evocation of the hometown he has been exploring all his life. &quot;This is indeed a city moving westward,&quot; he had written, &quot;but it&apos;s still not changing as fast as it talks.&quot; One day while I was there, phone lines back home to Japan went down for 24 hours. In the internet caf\u00e9s I found that Turkish-language keyboards prevented me from logging on to AOL. And as I checked out of my fairly fancy hotel in Sultanahmet, a gracious desk clerk asked me to write in a tip (a first, in my 30 years of travel). I did so \u2013 but when he gave me back the bill I saw that he had doubled the amount on the sly. On my very last night in Istanbul, I decided to put all my ideas and thoughts of a global future away. What really excited me about the place, I came to realise, was simply the sense of ceaseless movement, the way the energies of an Asian metropolis pulsed through largely European streets, so that the whole place seemed, intoxicatingly, a work in perpetual progress. And nowhere was the habit of making hard-and-fast distinctions dissolve more apparent than on the water. So I stepped on to a ferry in Emin\u00f6n\u00fc, in Europe, and went across to \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, in Asia. On arrival, I passed through the turnstiles, turned around and bought another token for a ferry passing through the Golden Horn, back to Europe. The sun was starting to set, and the late-afternoon light turned every face to gold. Lovers were courting on the white wooden benches, waiters jounced past us carrying trays holding glasses of orange juice and apple tea. I watched secretaries in high heels teeter home through the sharpened dusk and giggling schoolgirls trying out their French on captive tourists on the boat. From every bridge we passed, men had thrown down fishing lines, which I&apos;d never seen from the ferries of Hong Kong or New York. To one side of us, the Bosphorus Bridge was turning red and blue and\u00a0yellow again; to the other, the minarets and mosques of Sultanahmet looked more unearthly than ever, illuminated against a\u00a0blue-black sky. As soon as you begin to know a place, I thought, all talk of\u00a0&quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; or &quot;east&quot; and &quot;west&quot; becomes redundant. Just the movements inside it, the way it comes\u00a0closer and then slips away: that&apos;s all the excitement you need.

He is the only home-grown developer at Gamesblog Live \u2013 Slightly Mad Studios is based in London \u2013 Tudor revealed the complexities of making an ultra-realistic racer, and argued passionately about how mathematical realism in games falls flat unless it is complemented by emotional engagement. What level of detail do you have to go into to make a modern racing game realistic? Starting from scratch, with the cars in the game, we get the CAD data from the manufacturers. We have great relationships with the manufacturers, and they want to be in our game. Of course, we want them just as much, to showcase these amazing cars that most of us can&apos;t afford to buy. They give us all their assets, and when you look at those amazing cars, there&apos;s craftsmanship in terms of the technical side of things \u2013 how fast they go, their acceleration and so on \u2013 and then the aesthetic side. So the craftsmanship that they put into the real cars, we try to recreate as accurately as possible, in 3D as well. And it&apos;s the same with the tracks. We try to get as many tracks in as possible, and to get them mathematically correct, but we also take the guys out to track days, so they can drive the tracks themselves. Because what you find is that what looks correct on a Google Earth map doesn&apos;t necessarily give you the same sensation when you drive it. You find yourself thinking things like: &quot;Oh my God, that&apos;s way steeper than I thought it would have been, or than the mathematical height elevation tells me it is.&quot; What are your favourite cars and tracks? In Shift 2, we&apos;ve got variety, which people want. It&apos;s like if you ask me what my favourite game is, I wouldn&apos;t be able to answer that, because I like one from each genre \u2013 one last-generation game, one handheld one, one MMO and so on \u2013 so when it comes to my favourite cars, I personally drive a muscle-car, but other people may hate that. The new Pagani, which we announced today, is absolutely stunning. But then there are lots of people who like old retro machines. Do you have tracks such as the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife in Shift 2? Absolutely: we&apos;ve got fifty unique locations in the game now, including the Nordschleife and the N\u00fcrburgring GP circuit. Then we&apos;ve included the Bathurst circuit. Again, speaking to variety, Bathurst is something we really wanted in the game \u2013 it&apos;s out in Australia, there&apos;s an epic event there every year, and the scenery stretches out over an amazing vista, which you won&apos;t get somewhere smaller, like Hockenheim. I think Bathurst is one of my favourites, as is the new Shanghai circuit. In technical terms, what does Shift 2 have that other racing games don&apos;t? The simulation genre, really, is just a numbers game at the moment; it&apos;s all about &quot;We&apos;ve got the greatest physics engine, and we&apos;re going to add 1,000 cars, tracks etcetera.&quot; Which is quite a dry experience. We want to turn that on its head, by adding in social features, such as Autolog, for example: which lets you compete with your friends, even if they&apos;re not online right now. But having that thing, where I can see all your lap times, and spend half an hour or an hour trying just to beat you is great. And we&apos;re continuing to pioneer in new areas. Many games have night racing, for example, but nobody has night racing like we do it, because previous games have always done it the same as normal, just with darker lighting \u2013 there&apos;s no new gameplay in there at all. What we do is strip away all the lights and now you&apos;ve just got your headlights to guide you, which is a scary place. That&apos;s based on feedback which has been given to us by real drivers: they say: &quot;We&apos;ve got these high-beams on, but as powerful as they are, we still can&apos;t see the next corner coming up.&quot; Is Shift 2: Unleashed finished yet? We&apos;re so close to finishing \u2013 we&apos;re just adding the last 5% of polish, making sure that things are stable and everything is as polished as it can be, and it will be released on 1 April. Where can simulation games go in the future? What lies beyond complete realism? One thing is that graphics will always get better and better: cars will look smoother, tracks will have more spectators and detail \u2013 every single blade of grass will be modelled and all that. So we can sort of discount that: that will naturally happen. Where we feel it&apos;s going to go is adding in the real feeling you get when you&apos;re driving: the emotional response, the G-forces. When you&apos;re sat at home on the couch with a gamepad, that&apos;s already one step removed from a wheel, which is one step removed from actually being in a car with suspension and so on. We feel that rather being just a mathematical simulation, we need to be an emotional simulation of what&apos;s happening. So with the helmet cam, for example, the physics from the track are transferred to the tyres, which are transferred to the suspension, which goes to your body, which goes to your head, and that&apos;s where the helmet cam comes in. Your head moving around simulates the stuff you can&apos;t actually feel with just a gamepad in your hands. What can you tell us about the racing drivers you used as consultants? I&apos;m sure lots of other games say they had feedback from drivers, but in Need for Speed&apos;s case, we have a racing team, Team Need for Speed. They&apos;re out there \u2013 they won the Dubai 24-hour race, running a BMW Z4 GT3 car. And another team are winners of the Formula D Drift championship. Those guys are winners, the best in their field, and they are driving under the Need for Speed flag. They&apos;ve been giving us feedback on how the cars feel, how they handle, what angles the lights should be at, how powerful they should be, how hard the handbrake should be, what angle your head should be at going into a corner and so on. That kind of feedback is probably unprecedented. How do you reckon Shift 2: Unleashed stacks up against Gran Turismo 5? I&apos;ve gone on record before saying GT5 and Forza are on pedestals at the moment: everyone believes they are the games to beat. They are great products, but they stop at being a numbers game, a mathematical simulation of great physics, whereas we go beyond that with the emotional and social aspects. This has happened previously in games, when FIFA was trying to keep up with Pro Evolution Soccer and Dante&apos;s Inferno with God Of War: it&apos;s the same kind of sparring we have with our competitors. We&apos;ll see where we go, but we&apos;re in it for the long haul.", "title": "Gamesblog Live: Need for Speed Shift 2's Andy Tudor on simulation versus emotion", "sentences": ["They&apos;re out there \u2013 they won the Dubai 24-hour race, running a BMW Z4 GT3 car."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-28T09:05:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/28/working-classes-migration", "tags": ["Immigration and asylum", "UK news", "The far right", "World news", "Race issues", "Communities", "Society", "Migration"], "article": "I have a suggestion to make to 48% of the British population who, according to the anti-fascist organisation Searchlight&apos;s new report, would support an anti-immigration party: what if the party was also anti-emigration? Seeing as we have an ageing population, no working-age British person would be permitted to move elsewhere in search of a better life for themselves or their families, as we&apos;ll all be needed to prop up the economy and pay for pensions. A British country for British people, where British people pick vegetables, pack chickens, work in old people&apos;s homes, do auxiliary nursing, wash pots in hotel kitchens and all those other pleasant minimum-wage jobs everyone&apos;s dying for their children to do. Canada&apos;s off-limits; Spain&apos;s out of bounds; Dubai&apos;s a pipe-dream. In the big, all-British, society, we&apos;d all muck in and do our share of the difficult jobs. As Paul Merton would say, innit marvellous? Immigrants move to places where workers are needed: in Liverpool, for instance, where jobs are scarce and are about to get scarcer, you are likely to find Liverpudlians working in Costa and Pret and cleaning hotel rooms. Immigrants don&apos;t bother going to places where there is no work to do; ergo, they don&apos;t steal jobs, but fill vacancies that are otherwise hard to fill. All the twaddle about raising the St George&apos;s flag outside any public building is yet another diversion from a basic truth, which is that working-class people get diddled whatever their race or religion, whether they arrived in the country five minutes ago or whether they&apos;ve been here, supposedly, since the dawn of time. The frustration and anger that comes from feeling trapped too regularly gets directed at anyone, or anything, that&apos;s different, as difference is conflated with advantage. Anyone like you must be in the same boat, and therefore anyone who appears not to be like you must be getting a bigger slice of cake. What rubbish. I grew up in a place where the population at the time, though not much different now, was 97% white. However, this total included so many people of Irish and Welsh extraction that if &quot;English&quot; had been elevated as an identity over that of other British Islanders, and the Celts expelled, there wouldn&apos;t have been that many people left. In my 18 years there I witnessed and experienced the full gamut of human behaviour, from knee-buckling kindness to wretched cruelty. Much of that cruelty was based on casual racism, particularly against Asian people, who were perceived to have &quot;benefited&quot; from moving into the inner-city areas from which most people on our 1960s estate had moved. It was never clear how living in condemned housing was meant to give people advantages, though it was clear that much of the rage expressed had more to do with nostalgia for a sense of community that was disrupted by moving to the estate. This was rarely acknowledged: instead, it was always about &quot;Them&quot;, and never made much room for what a larger sense of &quot;Us&quot;, based on common class interests rather than perceived cultural differences, could mean. The racists&apos; complaint has always been the same, whether it&apos;s been the 1960s, 1980s or 2010s: I&apos;d have a great life if it wasn&apos;t for that person over there who has about as much influence over the social and economic structure as I do. (As to the survey&apos;s discovery that more Asian than white British people feel that immigration should be stopped, all that proves is that human prattishness knows no boundaries, racial or otherwise.) At 18 I moved to a place in which no racial or religious grouping was in the majority, and guess what: in my 13 years living there, I continued to witness the full gamut of human behaviour, from tenderness expressed between people with little in common except their postcode (which, of course, counts for a lot), to wretchedness expressed between people who looked and sounded alike. Yes, there was racism: bitter people love to blame others. But what struck me there, and what has always struck me, in 35 years of living in this perplexing, simultaneously mean-spirited and large-hearted country, is that we can get along. Anyone who says that we can&apos;t \u2013 that divisions are too wide and that somehow this project of living together must be stopped, or reversed \u2013 can only be speaking for themselves, out of the illness of their own hearts. Migration is natural in an urbanised society. Cities wouldn&apos;t exist if people hadn&apos;t moved in from the country, and in that sense, with only a few exceptions, we are all immigrants and we all have roots in the working class. The world&apos;s population is moving, almost as one, towards towns and cities. To say that it&apos;s somehow politically engineered is missing the point: it&apos;s economically engineered, to the extent that people move towards capital. That&apos;s why British people work in Dubai, and Polish people work in Britain. Both Jon Cruddas, who has faced down the BNP in Dagenham at successive elections, and David Miliband, writing in the Guardian today, are right to say that the mainstream parties are ignoring the concerns of a large proportion of the electorate, but he needs to be clearer that what they are ignoring is the fact of class as it is lived, rather than some people&apos;s foolish need to have flags to wave.", "title": "Migration is about economics, not politics | Lynsey Hanley", "sentences": ["Canada&apos;s off-limits; Spain&apos;s out of bounds; Dubai&apos;s a pipe-dream.", "That&apos;s why British people work in Dubai, and Polish people work in Britain."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-28T13:07:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/feb/28/jermain-defoe-ankle-injury-tottenham", "tags": ["Tottenham Hotspur", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Jermain Defoe has suffered a further blow in his stuttering season by breaking down with ankle trouble during Tottenham Hotspur&apos;s warm-weather training break in Dubai.

Defoe, who has failed to score in 13 Premier League appearances this season, spent 10 weeks out due to an ankle ligament injury he suffered on England duty against Switzerland on 7 September. He spoke of having cut no corners in his rehabilitation and his intention was to make an impact over the second half of the season. But the news that he was forced out of the session at Al Ahli&apos;s Rashid Stadium on Sunday has brought more frustration. Defoe&apos;s goal tally at club level in all competitions stands at five. Redknapp has to hope the setback is not a recurrence of Defoe&apos;s previous problem but his choice of words suggested that he feared the worst. &quot;Defoe has an injury again,&quot; he said. &quot;He&apos;s had a problem with his ankle before and it didn&apos;t feel too good. We&apos;re trying to finish in the top four and it&apos;s so close.

The Scot has not featured since a poor performance in the 4-0 FA Cup defeat at Fulham on 30 January. &quot;Alan had a groin strain but he&apos;s fit now,&quot; Redknapp said. &quot;I changed it after Fulham; I brought Corluka back in and we won four games on the spin, went to Milan and won 1-0.

An archivist at the John Murray Archive at the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh showed me three letters from a Murray author \u2013 James Raymond Wellsted. Wellsted was a lieutenant in the Indian Navy and travelled extensively around the Arabian Peninsula in the 1830s, while the Indian Navy was employed in surveying the region. In the post-Bonaparte era, Britain was still licking her wounds after losing several ships to a lack of good charts during wartime. In addition, the French were strong in Egypt, which made Britain extremely interested in nearby nations to promote what they considered &apos;balance in the region&apos;.  None of this was what originally grabbed me, of course. Wellsted&apos;s voice was fresh and the accounts of his time on the Peninsula were unencumbered by prejudice. In his letters to Murray he sounded almost breathless \u2013 like a schoolboy. I went on to read the books that he wrote and again, in a more tempered form, there was that voice \u2013 naive, enthusiastic and open-minded. In particular, there were a couple of intriguing sentences \u2013 mentions that made me sit up and take note, not of the actual historical detail, but of ideas that were coming to me. In particular, Wellsted mentioned a slave girl called Zena. Zena was Abyssinian (current day Ethiopia and Eritrea). She was young. And Wellsted spoke to her \u2013 in fact, Zena told Wellsted about her Abyssinian home. A few weeks into their journey (for Wellsted travelled disguised as a slave trader) Zena was stolen from his caravan and he never saw the girl again. Completing the &apos;character square&apos;      Writer Sara Sheridan    I&apos;m accustomed to reading Georgian and Victorian letters and diaries and sometimes you simply know in your gut that a blithe sentence is covering up deeper emotion. In my view Wellsted wouldn&apos;t have mentioned Zena if she wasn&apos;t important to him. In my view he completely understated how important. I decided that it was Zena who would be my female lead.  So I went on and I researched William Wilberforce and the Abolitionists and read the accounts of freed slaves from the period. British history focuses heavily on the slaves of the Middle Passage. When you visit the Slavery Museum in Liverpool, for example, no mention is made of the flourishing slave trade in the opposite direction. But Arab and Turkish slave traders ferried their human cargo around India and Ceylon and all over the Gulf and for those poor souls the conditions were no less appalling than the Ghana to Jamaica route westwards. I decided to make up two Arab slave traders to complete the &apos;character square&apos; I was creating - Wellsted, Zena, Kasim and Ibn Mohammed. Then I went to London on a research trip and in between one archive and another I ended up in the offices of Anti Slavery International. To my mind this was an historical problem, not a current one but I thought they might have information from the period.  I had been researching William Wilberforce and his acolytes and reading up on the legislation that was drafted in the 1830s. When I walked through the door into the office, I realised I was completely naive. If anything the problems of what we call human trafficking today (rather than slavery) are more acute than at any time before. The route that Zena had taken from Abyssinia to Oman (where Wellsted bought her) is still open \u2013 in fact the Arabian Peninsula is one of the world&apos;s slavery blackspots to this day.  Now the issues are around indentured labour \u2013 na\u00efve economic migrants, the poor of eastern Africa, are tempted to make the trip of their own free will by unscrupulous agents who offer them employment in decent conditions. When they arrive in Oman or Dubai or Saudi Arabia or Yemen, their passports are confiscated and they are locked up, treated every bit as much as human vermin as the poor souls who undertook the middle passage in the 1800s. Anti Slavery International had accounts and pictures. I was horrified. To Wigtown  After London I headed northwards to the Wigtown Book Festival. I was talking about a previous novel there \u2013 The Secret Mandarin set in 1840s China \u2013 but the questions from the audience came round to the more general subject of history. I was asked about how morally wrong I felt the British Empire was and if personally I suffered from post-Colonial guilt. My mother is Jewish and my father is Catholic, I quipped, there is no form of guilt from which I do not suffer. The audience laughed and I went on to talk about &apos;standards of the day&apos; and imposing present-day morality onto historical figures.  On reflection, what I should have said, is that many of our forbears may have ignored the suffering of others. It seems unbelievable to us now that children as young as five worked full days in cloth factories in the most evil conditions or that 200 souls might be crammed aboard a sailing ship and starved and beaten all the way across the Atlantic. That it took so long for anyone to say or do anything about it is shameful. But today we, as a society, are just as bad, if not worse. Most people don&apos;t think about indentured labour in the Far East (until recently I certainly didn&apos;t) I would often shop in supermarkets or discount stores for clothes that were almost certainly produced in conditions at least as grim as those in early-Victorian Manchester.  We are today in a far better position than our forbears to be informed \u2013 which is more than can be said of the Georgian and early Victorian middle classes. In fact, as soon as information was generally available the changes were relatively rapid. Today you can watch YouTube videos of the abuse and read government reports readily available online. The question shouldn&apos;t be &apos;are we guilty about our Colonial past&apos; it should be &apos;why aren&apos;t we more guilty about our corporate present&apos;? As a novelist it is my job to tell stories that inspire and entertain but I am increasingly mindful that many of these historical tales (which of themselves are fascinating) relate directly to issues in our society today. As I become more experienced I&apos;m learning to keep my eyes open as I look not only backwards in time but also at our world today.  Sara Sheridan lives in Edinburgh.

I visited with York City in January 2008 and several residents could be seen in their living rooms, watching Tottenham&apos;s 5-1 demolition of Arsenal on TV rather than the crucial FA Trophy replay outside their window. They don&apos;t know what they were missing.&quot; Ross Camp Stadium, Bulawayo &quot;In Zimbabwe teams do not own stadia, mostly City councils do,&quot; begins Tinashe Shoko. &quot;The councils then levy a percentage of the gate takings, usually 20%. In the late 80s clubs in Bulawayo felt this was too much and moved to play at Ross Camp Stadium located in a police camp by the same name where you could watch from the comfort of your home! For free! If you stayed at a couple of flats next to the stadium! Of course, when Zimbabwe Saints qualified for the CAF competitions next season they moved back to city council owned 30,000 seater Babourfields.&quot; Stark&apos;s Park, Raith Rovers &quot;The neighbouring houses on Pratt Street (mostly flat conversions) look straight over the wall as our &apos;main&apos; stand (our smallest, ironically) doesn&apos;t extend the full length of the pitch,&quot; writes Kirkcaldy&apos;s very own Iain Wallace. &quot;People are often seen at their living room window enjoying the match, and some have even installed Velux windows in what are presumably turnstile-dodging attic conversions.&quot; Millerntor Stadium, St Pauli &quot;FC St Pauli have a famous old WW2 anti aircraft bunker behind one end of their Millerntor Stadium,&quot; writes Andrew Guest. &quot;This is a big, castle keep-style concrete building built by the Nazis as part of a series of city defences. Nowadays it contains a famous nightclub on the topfloor, which can only be accessed by elevator. Up until 2 seasons ago the &apos;ends&apos; of the stadium were small, uncovered terraces, and games certainly used to be watched from the top of this bunker, with access through the nightclub. It was even common to see flags draped off it. Recently, however, a new stand has been erected with a second tier and a roof. I&apos;d guess that has put a stop to the practice, but I could be wrong.&quot; Stadion Galgenwaard, Utrecht &quot;I&apos;d like to make a point for Dutch Eredivisie club FC Utrecht,&quot; writes former Utrechter Victor van Werkhooven. &quot;Their stadium, Stadion Galgenwaard (24,500 seats) not only has three-storey office blocks in every single corner with a clear view on the field below, but also an apartment building towering over it just a couple of meters away from the stands. Although the majority of the windows faces the other side, there&apos;s still plenty to see from the top floors.&quot; Gr\u00fcnwalder Stadion, Munich There was an interesting story relating to this in an issue of German football magazine 11Freunde a few months back,&quot; begins David Tunnicliffe. &quot;After 1860 Munich fans caused a bit of trouble [let off some fireworks] at the match between 1860&apos;s second team and SpVgg Weiden, the German FA decided to fine the club and force 1860 II to play a Regionalliga S\u00fcd match behind closed doors. This match would be against Darmstadt 98. Darmstadt fans had been looking forward to a trip to Munich&apos;s Gr\u00fcnwalder Stadion and a chance to watch their team in a proper old ground. They were obviously gutted at the news. One particular supporters group thought about ways of trying to watch the match, including dressing up as members of the Red Cross and using a ladder to watch over the wall. They eventually decided to ring around the people living in the surrounding apartments and finally found someone willing to let them watch the game. They ended up having a perfect view (although Darmstadt lost 4-0) and it only cost them \u20ac 70.&quot; Plenty more of these next week. In the meantime, keep them coming to knowledge@theguardian.com HOLIDAY-BASED INCENTIVES &quot;Leyton Orient have been promised a holiday to Las Vegas after drawing with Arsenal,&quot; writes Eamonn Loach in the second of two Orient-inspired questions this week. &quot;Have any other teams used holidays as an incentive?&quot; While Orient are headed to Nevada, Spain, Dubai and the Algarve have also been used as carrots to coax the best out of players. &quot;Back in 2007 Danish side AGF Aarhus were promised a combined holiday/training camp in Dubai if they were promoted to the Superliga in 2007,&quot; writes Mikkel Andreas Beck. &quot;They were successful in June that year and had the holiday/training tour the following January with girlfriends and wives also invited.&quot; Peter Newbitt points us in the direction of Paulo Futre, who offered a personal incentive to his West Ham team-mate John Moncur. &quot;All through my career I&apos;d played in the 10 shirt, then I saw the shirt hanging up in the dressing room and it said: &apos;Futre 16&apos;,&quot; said the Portuguese player of his arrival at Upton Park. &quot;I didn&apos;t play and I left. I went to a hotel, saw my friend and then Peter Storrie spoke to the Premier League and we changed the number of the shirt. &quot;John Moncur had the 10 shirt. But I went to John Moncur and said: &apos;John, I&apos;m so sorry, you can come to my villa in the Algarve, stay as long as you want, play golf.&apos; He agreed.&quot; But the inside scoop on this subject comes from former Clydebank midfielder Peter Sermanni. &quot;In season 1990-91, we were struggling near the foot of the table after a horrendous run of results in the new year,&quot; begins Peter, whose team lost nine out of 10 league fixtures in January and February. &quot;With 10 games remaining to avoid relegation, the then owner (and renowned tight-arse) Jack Steedman, put an end-of-season trip to Spain on the table if we stayed up, and furthermore, he would throw in \u00a3200 for every point we collected in the final 10 games. &quot;From memory we went unbeaten for the next seven games and finished with five wins, four draws and a single defeat to finish mid-table. The icing on the proverbial was the final day of the season when we smashed Partick Thistle 7-1, the talismanic Ken Eadie scored four second half goals to clinch the Daily Record Golden Boot, pipping Gordon Dalziel. To top it off, Thistle, who were also going to Spain that night, had their trip cancelled by management for getting such a tonking. Ouch. It&apos;s fair to say there were a few beers consumed at the airport that evening as we waited for the flight. Lovely. Pity is was only 2 points for a win back then\u2026&quot;   THE MANAGERIAL MERRY-GO-ROUND HITS WARP FACTOR 5 &quot;With Micky Adams being the third permanent Sheffield United manager this season, and his reign looking shakier by the minute, what team has been through the most permanent managers in one season?&quot; wondered Liam Blizard a few weeks ago. Adams, despite his failure to win any of his 12 matches in charge, is hanging in there at Bramall Lane. It&apos;s a good job he&apos;s not in Bulgaria, as Joel Sked reports:  CSKA Sofia had six different managers in 2010. However that was spread over two seasons with their (2009-2010) season running from August to May. Luboslav Penev served from March 2009 to 13 January 2010. Ioan Andone replaced him four days later until 30 March. Adalbert Zafirov immediately took over until 14 May. Then Pavel Dochev came in on 1 June. He lasted until 16 August and his replacement, Gjore Jovanovski was gone by 21 October after taking over on 17 August. Then we come to the current manager Milen Radukanov who took over from Jovanovski. That&apos;s six in the calender year.  JAY TABB: TRANSPORT MAVERICK Last week we looked at footballers using public transport to get to games and relayed the story of Coventry City&apos;s Jay-Tabb-guided Tube trip to Loftus Road. It seems, though, that the diminutive midfielder wasn&apos;t quite the expert guide his manager thought. &quot;This is nuts,&quot; begins Ger Sugrue, not beating about the Bush. &quot;Hangar Lane is on the Central line, and so are Shepherd&apos;s Bush and White City - the two nearest stations to Loftus Road. It&apos;s three stops from Hangar Lane to White City. Going via Hammersmith starting from Hangar Lane, you&apos;d have to change at Notting Hill (having passed White City) - take the District to Hammersmith and then get the Hammersmith and City line to the (other) Shepherd&apos;s Bush station - now called Shepherd&apos;s Bush Market. A case of going three sides of a square if I ever heard one. &quot;More likely, they took the Piccadilly from North Ealing (close to Hangar Lane - despite what the Tube map implies) - hence the need to change at Hammersmith. And while we&apos;re discussing the geography of London - what were all these West Ham and Fulham fans doing - Fulham is by the river and West Ham is (still) in east London.&quot;  KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;In the recent match between FC Twente and Vitesse in the Dutch league, Vitesse took off their left-back Haim Megrelishvili after only six minutes due to his poor defending, as the manager later explained,&quot; wrote Rutger Ijzermans back in the sepia-tinged days of 2008. &quot;Is this the quickest ever substitution that was not due to injury?&quot; It&apos;s a decent effort Rutger, but we&apos;ve got two quick-fire substitutions that can beat six minutes. For the first we head to the Wolds and Sincil Bank, where both Scott Walden and Harry Winckworth have highlighted the case of Lincoln City&apos;s Grant Brown. Harry picks up the tale on a drab Tuesday night in March 1998 when Swansea City were the visitors. &quot;It proved to be John Beck&apos;s last game in charge of Lincoln,&quot; he writes. &quot;To illustrate how Beck was losing the plot, his original line-up that night contained four centre-backs, two full-backs, two nut-job midfielders and two strikers. After just two minutes of play, Beck replaced the club captain and Imps record-appearance holder Grant Brown - a central defender - with the enigmatic and speedy midfielder Steve Brown, to the cat-calls of a bemused home support. &quot;I remember Beck claiming afterwards that he&apos;d been expecting Swansea to play three up front. However, the Swans lined up with a five-man midfield, much to Beck&apos;s surprise, so rather than push one of our six defenders higher up the pitch, he instead made the earliest tactical substitution I ever recall seeing.&quot; Scott has a more conspiracist explanation, suggesting rather tentatively that the early substitution may have been to embarrass the defender after a previous poor performance. Andreas Marienborg, though, can just about trump that. &quot;In 2006 Bryne played Tromsdalen in the Norwegian First Division,&quot; he writes. &quot;Bryne were going through a horrible period injury-wise and had almost no defenders available in their senior squad. But because of Norwegian regulations they weren&apos;t allowed to play their unlicensed under-18 players from start, though they were allowed to put them on the bench. So the injured striker H\u00e5vard Sakariassen started as a central defender, only to be substituted after one minute so that young Oddgeir Salte could get his debut.&quot; For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the cobwebbed corridors of the Knowledge archive Can you help? &quot;This week Danish tennis world No1 Caroline Wozniacki \u2013 a Liverpool fan as I \u2013 warmed up in her Liverpool shirt before beating Nadia Petrova in Doha,&quot; writes Mikkel Andreas Beck. &quot;Could the good readers of The Knowledge give more examples of other high-profile athletes who in similar ways supports a football team?&quot; &quot;Has any league season, anywhere in the world, ever finished with the teams finishing in alphabetical order?&quot; wonders Owen Amos Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com", "title": "At which grounds can you watch football for free? | The Knowledge", "sentences": ["&quot;Have any other teams used holidays as an incentive?&quot; While Orient are headed to Nevada, Spain, Dubai and the Algarve have also been used as carrots to coax the best out of players.", "&quot;Back in 2007 Danish side AGF Aarhus were promised a combined holiday/training camp in Dubai if they were promoted to the Superliga in 2007,&quot; writes Mikkel Andreas Beck."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-02T00:09:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/02/deficit-cuts-banks-robin-hood-tax", "tags": ["Banks and building societies", "Banking", "Business", "Tax and spending", "Politics", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "World news", "Economics", "Global economy", "Angela Merkel", "Nicolas Sarkozy"], "article": "When you&apos;ve been going on about something for a while, it is always satisfying to discover that other people agree with you. I have been arguing for the last year that the banks, hedge funds and other titans of the City of London whose gambling got us into this trouble should pay to clean up the mess they caused. Now, no less a figure than Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, has laid the blame for cuts in public services and welfare squarely at the door of the City. &quot;The price of the financial crisis is being borne by people who did absolutely nothing to cause it.&quot; The evidence supporting him is overwhelming. The International Monetary Fund has warned that British government debt will be 40% higher as a result of the financial crisis. That&apos;s equivalent to a total of \u00a328,000 for every taxpayer in the country. But King&apos;s subsequent comment that he was &quot;surprised that the degree of public anger has not been greater than it\u00a0has&quot; suggests that either he had a very high expectation, or that he has misread the public mood. I&apos;m an ambassador for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, which calls for a tiny tax of just 0.05% on every casino-style financial transaction in order to help poor people, reverse public service cuts at home and abroad, and tackle climate change. In this role I&apos;ve seen how people&apos;s sense of fairness has been stretched to the limits by the continued spectacle of huge pay increases and bonuses in big companies while ordinary people suffer. Every time people turn on the television news they are bombarded with stories of job losses, disabled children forced into care, public sector cuts or young people left without a future. Meanwhile one of the country&apos;s leading bankers claims &quot;the time for remorse and apologies needs to be over&quot;. If there has been any remorse it has escaped my notice. Of course people are angry! Project Merlin, George Osborne&apos;s agreement with the banks last month, was widely ridiculed because people are too angry to accept a backroom deal that does not address the fundamental issue of fairness. Our campaign is supported by Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, along with 250,000 Facebook users and 113 organisations from Oxfam to the Salvation Army. When, last week, I challenged bank chief executives Stephen Hester, Bob Diamond and the others, to visit people at home and abroad hit by the economic crisis, I was inundated with messages of support. More dramatically, Barclays \u2013 which recently announced a \u00a36bn profit and a 20% increase in pay and bonuses \u2013 found 40 of its branches occupied by protesters on the day it was revealed that it pays just \u00a3100m in tax. Polls show this anger is felt by supporters of all political parties. A ComRes survey, carried out in January before the UK bonus season, found that 80% of people, including 76% of Conservative voters, want additional taxes on bankers&apos; bonuses. Polls regularly show majority support for a Robin Hood tax \u2013 it could be the most popular tax in history. Mervyn King is right, though, that this anger has not yet forced politicians to make banks pay their fair share. Perhaps this is unsurprising: many MPs have spent years seeing the excessive profits and bonuses of the City as a sign of economic health. But this does not mean it will not happen. French president Nicolas Sarkozy and German chancellor Angela Merkel have both responded to public anger by promising to go ahead with transaction taxes. Perhaps the biggest barrier to the UK\u00a0following suit is the fear, endorsed\u00a0by many commentators, that\u00a0a\u00a0higher tax burden would encourage banks to up sticks and leave. But this doesn&apos;t bear scrutiny. According\u00a0to the Bank of England, the banks benefit from our taxes and the subsidy afforded them by the government to the tune of \u00a3100bn every\u00a0year. They also benefit from the\u00a0City&apos;s excellent infrastructure. The\u00a0idea that they are about to give this up\u00a0to\u00a0move to Dubai or the Cayman Islands is incredible, especially when you realise we already have a 0.5% tax on share transactions.

In his absence, the trainer Mike de Kock fields the 2010 UAE Derby winner Musir (6.05), who has been re-routed from the Burj Nahaar. Second in Listed company last time out behind Skysurfers, he has race fitness on his side and looks the one to beat. Saeed bin Suroor&apos;s new recruit Prince Bishop, the dual Champion Stakes winner Twice Over and the Pacific Classic winner Richard&apos;s Kid also have leading credentials in a wide-open contest, while Win For Sure was eye-catching last time and can go well again. Luca Cumani&apos;s Presvis (6.45) bids to make history and become the first horse to win back-to-back Jebel Hattas, the prep for the Dubai Duty Free on the World Cup card. A facile winner of the Group Two Al Rashidiya last time, he can take this en route to a third stab at the Duty Free, although his number one draw may not be ideal for a horse who needs plenty of cover. Le Drakkar, who has been knocking at the door, the Qatar-based Hearts Of Fire and the progressive Wigmore Hall also make plenty of appeal, while the thrice-second Kavango surely deserves a change of luck. The Listed Al Bastakiya, over an extended nine furlongs, is a weak affair and is missing the likely UAE Derby favourites Zanzamar and Splash Point. In their absence, De Kock&apos;s tough filly Reem (3.05) can gain just reward for some excellent runs in Pattern company. David Simcock&apos;s Ahlaain, who makes his all-weather debut, can chase her home on the pick of his turf form. The following 1,000-metre conditions event on turf, a warm-up race for the Group Two Al Quoz Sprint, looks a good opportunity for Walter Swinburn&apos;s Monsieur Joe (3.45) to get on the scoresheet. Visored for the first time, he drops back to his optimum trip here and can gain recompense for three good runs here to date. The straight-track specialist Prohibit and the speedy mare Invincible Ash look the dangers. A maximum field of 12 take to the Tapeta for the Mahab Al Shimaal, over the Golden Shaheen course, including three trained by the in-form Ali Rashid Al Raihe. Of these Alazeyab (4.10), the pick of Richard Hills, is half a kilo better off with stablemate Green Beret and is fancied to reverse the form of their last meeting. The consistent Silaah and Godolphin&apos;s Global City are also respected, but the latter needs to overcome a wide draw. Saeed bin Suroor collected a treble on this card last year and Mendip (4.55) should ensure he doesn&apos;t go away empty-handed this time. A smooth winner over course and distance in Group Three company in January, he looks the class act again, although stablemate Sangaree and the front-running As De Trebol should also give good accounts. Godolphin have a great record in the Dubai City of Gold, the warm-up for the Sheema Classic, and Mahmoud al-Zarooni saddles three, including recent winner Calvados Blues.

Indeed, he is anything but ordinary, with his vast wealth and his companies, his proteges and his connections. He has the goods on everyone \u2013 watch out David Cameron. But much as we think we know him, he does retain the capacity to surprise with what one might kindly call his lack of awareness. And so yes, that was Lord Ashcroft, who for so long kept us all in the dark about his adherence to the terms and conditions of his peerage, quizzing the government about the secret process surrounding other people&apos;s peerages. &quot;To ask Her Majesty&apos;s government whether in the past five years an honour has been given on the direct recommendation of a premier (or equivalent) of a British overseas territory,&quot; wrote Lord Brass Neck. To his credit Lord Howell, the Foreign Office minister, told him to get lost. \u2022 A letter to the Times. No to the HS2 high-speed rail link, it says. Not least because we will need that land for food. &quot;&apos;Lifeboat Britain&apos; is already grossly overcrowded and dependent upon other nations for vital food and energy. This situation will only get worse as immigration runs unchecked and the overseas food producers, on whom we are so dependent, rightly focus upon meeting the increasing demands of their own populations.&quot; It is, therefore, &quot;not only unwise but criminal to contemplate covering any area of green Britain with yet more steel and concrete, whether it&apos;s for wider roads, extra airport runways or indeed trains that go faster than anyone needs to. This insane proposal should be halted right now.&quot; So says Noel Edmonds. \u2022 Yes, that Noel Edmonds \u2013 presenter, broadcaster, creator of Mr Blobby. He has opinions; strong ones by the look of it. It&apos;s not just Geldof and Bono, you know. Agriculture and food production generally are things that get his juices flowing: law and order, the curse of wind farms, etc. Harmless stuff perhaps; but what to make of the claim that in the not-so-distant past he has been formally approached to stand as a political candidate by two, perhaps three, major parties? Scary. Still, he&apos;d be more credible than many Lib Dems. \u2022 He&apos;s not the only one sticking his head above the parapet. The comedian Jim Davidson, having pronounced on democracy in Egypt, now turns his laser eye on Europe \u2013 one of the delights of reading Torquay&apos;s Herald Express. &quot;The European court of human rights. Hmm, what can we say about this,&quot; asks Jim. &quot;Shut it!&quot; And what if we just upped and flounced away from the whole European thing? &quot;Would it mean we&apos;d be worse off? I can&apos;t see how that&apos;s possible. Would it mean that we can make our own laws? Will Europe give us our gold back? Would we be able to govern our island and our own people without some interfering foreign sod telling us what to do? Sounds good to me!&quot; Is it time, asks Jim, &quot;to bring our troops home and raise the drawbridge&quot;. Maybe it is. But given that Jim spends many of his days in Dubai, can he be sure that we&apos;d let him back in? \u2022 Continuing turmoil, meanwhile, at the London School of Economics, where shell-shocked academics are taking fire for their links with the Gaddafi regime. Each day they wake eager to see who next will be embarrassed by suggestions that they made nice with Gaddafi and his unlovely regime. The list of shame it grows and \u2013 according to a leaked document listing all the exciting things that were to occur under the Gaddafi-funded study programme \u2013 Professor Danny Quah, the LSE head of economics, was expected to be a player here, &quot;enthusiastically accepting the invitation to be the first speaker to visit Libya&quot;.

But before the 26-year-old can put his name forward for the next IPL auction \u2013 his destruction of England having come a month too late to put him in contention for the 2011 competition, which begins immediately after the World Cup \u2013 he is keen to return to county cricket this summer. O&apos;Brien, who awoke after a heavy night of celebrations to find pictures of his pink hair plastered over the front pages of most of the newspapers, had a spell with Nottinghamshire in 2009, making a single first-class appearance and 13 in the one-day competitions. But he stayed at home in Dublin last summer after failing to match the impact made by his elder brother Niall with Kent and now Northamptonshire. However, within hours of his match-winning heroics against England, counties were being notified of his availability for 2011. &quot;The world is his oyster now,&quot; said Wayne Noon, the Nottinghamshire assistant coach who worked closely with O&apos;Brien during his stint at Trent Bridge. &quot;IPL all of a sudden could become an attractive option. If he puts himself in the next auction reasonably cheap, a couple of franchises could easily bid up his value. He&apos;s put himself in the shop window both for that and for county cricket. We&apos;ve got our staff sorted for the summer and there isn&apos;t much money knocking around at many counties to be honest. But a few have decided not to go down the overseas route, so I&apos;d expect his agent to be getting a few offers.&quot; David Capel, the former England all-rounder who is now the coach at Northamptonshire, confirmed that the possibility of bringing the O&apos;Brien brothers together at Wantage Road &quot;has definitely gone through my mind. When you see a performance like his against England, you take a great deal of notice. &quot;Having Niall might give us an advantage and he&apos;s always kept me posted on his brother \u2013 and crikey, what an asset he could be in Twenty20 cricket. The only issue for us is budget and how we spend the little we&apos;ve got left. Our priority is to reinforce our fast bowling, so it would mean juggling things around. But I definitely wouldn&apos;t rule it out.&quot; Leicestershire&apos;s first-team coach Phil Whitticase revealed that he had been considering O&apos;Brien as an early-season replacement for Andrew McDonald, the Australian all-rounder whose arrival at Grace Road will be delayed until May because of his IPL commitments, even before his innings against England. He is awaiting a response from Matthew Hoggard, the county&apos;s captain who is away in Dubai, before formalising an offer. &quot;His fielding surprised a lot of people when he was with us, because for a big lad he&apos;s pretty agile,&quot; Noon said. &quot;We were also impressed with the way he batted under pressure considering he hadn&apos;t played a great deal of cricket. He was probably a bit unfortunate in that he was coming in a bit lower down and not getting the opportunities he does with Ireland. But the main reason he didn&apos;t come back was that he had a lot of commitments with Ireland and he&apos;s very proud of representing his country.&quot; Everyone involved in Ireland cricket is enjoying basking in the glow of O&apos;Brien&apos;s innings.

He plays the organ and the lute, composes music and has his own highly regarded symphony orchestra. The vulgarity of Dubai and the brutality of Iran are simply not his style. He is also a long-standing friend of the west, and of Britain in particular. In his younger days he served in the British army and later donated sports pavilions bearing his name to his old college, Sandhurst, and the RAF officers&apos; college, Cranwell. With a tiny population (no more than 3 million) and reasonable amounts of oil, Oman is \u2013 or has been until recently \u2013 a fairly prosperous place. All this results in Oman and its sultan generally getting a sympathetic press. &quot;I have never encountered a place in the Arab world so well-governed as Oman, and in such a quiet and understated way,&quot; Robert Kaplan wrote the other day in an article for Foreign Policy headed &quot;Oman&apos;s renaissance man&quot;. Last weekend, though, overshadowed by events in Libya, there were disturbances in Sohar (Oman&apos;s second city) along with more peaceful demonstrations elsewhere in the country. Protesters&apos; complaints were the familiar ones heard these days in most of the Arab countries: government corruption, cronyism and youth unemployment. Oman has an exceptionally young population \u2013 43% are under the age of 15 \u2013 and even those who buy the line that Oman is well governed recognise that the authorities face an uphill struggle in providing jobs. &quot;The problem is evolving faster than they can provide solutions,&quot; one person who is familiar with the country (and asked not to be identified) told me this week. But there&apos;s another problem too. Even if Qaboos is a Britain-friendly, music-loving ruler with benevolent intentions he is none the less a despot. He doesn&apos;t tolerate criticism and his citizens have very few rights. They can&apos;t, for instance, hold a public meeting without the government&apos;s approval. Anyone who wants to set up a non-governmental organisation of any kind needs a licence. To get it, they have to demonstrate that the organisation is &quot;for legitimate objectives&quot; and not &quot;inimical to the social order&quot;. On average, that takes two years \u2013 assuming permission is granted at all. Here are a few other things, not from the sultan&apos;s harshest critics but from his friends in Washington, courtesy of the state department&apos;s latest human rights report:  \u2022 The law prohibits criticism of the sultan in any form or medium.\u2022 The law does not provide citizens with the right to change their government.\u2022 The sultan retains ultimate authority on all foreign and domestic issues.\u2022 Public officials are not subject to financial disclosure laws.\u2022 Police do not need search warrants in order to enter people&apos;s homes.\u2022 Libel laws and concerns for national security have been used to suppress criticism of government figures and politically objectionable views. \u2022 Publication of books is limited and the government restricts their importation and distribution, as with other media products.  And here are some more, from Reporters Without Borders:  \u2022 The state decides who can or cannot be a journalist and this permission can be withdrawn at any time\u2022 Censorship and self-censorship are a constant factor.\u2022 Access to news and information can be problematic: journalists have to be content with news compiled by the official news agency on some issues\u2022 Through a decree by the sultan, the government has now extended its control over the media to blogs and other websites.  Merely mentioning the existence of such restrictions can land you in trouble. Two years ago, a web publisher was fined and given a suspended jail sentence for revealing that a supposedly live TV programme was actually pre-recorded in order to eliminate any criticisms of the government. Because of this, it is very difficult to judge what Omanis really think of their sultan. His supporters tend to express their devotion in exaggeratedly fulsome terms: &quot;His Majesty \u2013 gift of God to residents of Oman&quot;, &quot;We salute His Majesty&apos;s wise leadership&quot; and &quot;I would be willing to lay out my life on the line for him&quot;. Of course, there were people saying similar things about President Ben Ali in Tunisia until just a few days before he fled and in Libya we have Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s own word that all his people love him. Meanwhile, those who are more critical of Qaboos have been nervous about sticking their necks out \u2013 though possibly, encouraged by events in other parts of the region, they are now losing that fear. Faced with so many restrictions, Omanis have sometimes resorted to unconventional methods for expressing their views. Writing about Gulf rulers in 2001, Dale Eickelman observed: &quot;Only in Oman has the occasional donkey \u2026 been used as a mobile billboard to express anti-regime sentiments. There is no way in which police can maintain dignity in seizing and destroying a donkey on whose flank a political message has been inscribed.&quot; In a way, Robert Kaplan is right about Sultan Qaboos being a &quot;renaissance man&quot;.

An estimated 180,000 have already fled. The number of people crossing the border fell from 10,000-15,000 a day earlier this week to fewer than 2,000 on Thursday. Andrew Mitchell, the British international development secretary, who visited the border on Friday, said: &quot;It&apos;s an artificial and abrupt stop. We have no idea why, but we&apos;re trying to find out.&quot; Mitchell referred to satellite images obtained by the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) that are believed to show thousands of would-be evacuees being held about 10 miles from the border. Mitchell had not seen the images himself, and said they had not yet been thoroughly analysed. But, he said, &quot;the break in numbers doesn&apos;t feel right&quot; and added there could be a surge of evacuees in the coming days if people managed to reach the border. &quot;We need to plan to be able to scale up rapidly,&quot; he said. The picture was &quot;highly fluid&quot;. The main UN body for refugees, UNHCR, said it was concerned that people were being prevented from leaving. &quot;The border on the Libyan side is now manned by heavily armed pro-government forces,&quot; it said in a statement. &quot;From those that did manage to cross the border, we have heard that mobile phones and cameras were being confiscated en route. Many people appear to be frightened and are unwilling to speak.&quot; M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res workers at the border at Ras Ajdir also said they were concerned about a blockage of people trying to leave Libya. Evacuees were reporting large numbers waiting on the Libyan side of the border, they said. Satellite images published by the UN on Thursday showed &quot;multiple concentrations of people within different waiting and processing sites&quot; in Libya. A steady stream of evacuees are crossing into Tunisia, from countries including Bangladesh, Sudan and Vietnam. Hundreds of men dragged suitcases and carried baggage on their heads along the road between Ras Ajdir and a UN transit camp a few kilometres from the border. Most of the Egyptian workers who have left Libya over the past 10 days have now flown home, including 3,135 on board 12 UK evacuation flights between Djerba and Cairo. But there was concern about more than 10,000 Bangladeshis, who have been offered little assistance by their government. &quot;I am very conscious that the Bangladeshis need support,&quot; said Mitchell. The UK was &quot;looking at ways of helping them to get home&quot;, he said, but added that did not necessarily include an airlift operation. The transit camp, organised by the UNHCR and the Tunisian army, has capacity to house at least 20,000 people, with more tents arriving each day. Although the overwhelming majority of evacuees are men, a separate section has been set up to house women and children. A mobile hospital is in place and T\u00e9l\u00e9coms Sans Fronti\u00e8res, a French NGO, has established a station where people are permitted to make a three minute call to anywhere in the world to let relatives know of their whereabouts. Meals and refreshments are being provided by Tunisian volunteers. &quot;The Tunisian people have taken things from their own homes or purchased items with their own money \u2013 food, water, clothing, blankets,&quot; said Mitchell. &quot;I have never seen anything like it in my life. The extraordinary generosity and compassion of the Tunisian people is humbling.&quot; He described the current situation as a &quot;logistical challenge&quot; rather than a humanitarian crisis, but warned a crisis could develop in the coming days. &quot;We need to prepare for further surges of people who may be on the other side of the border.&quot; Stanley Ysiosefe, 24, a Nigerian who had been waiting in the camp for five days, said conditions were passable but he had no idea when he would get home. There were evacuees from sub-Saharan countries including Cameroon, Guinea, Mali, Ghana and Nigeria, he added. &quot;We&apos;ve lost everything,&quot; said Ysiosefe, a professional footballer who had spent three years in Libya trying to establish a football club. The UN had given him the coat he was wearing, he said. The Department for International Development said that additional supplies from its warehouse in Dubai are expected to arrive in Ras Ajdir shortly. Over a thousand tents and 2,000 blankets will follow an earlier contingent of 36,000 blankets and tents that arrived on Tuesday. The DFID has also dispatched two logistics experts to assist with the airlift from Djerba airport, 100 miles from the border.

Gareth Bale, who has not played since injuring his back on 22 January, returns to full training on Saturday and may be rewarded with a place on the bench at Wolverhampton on Sunday.

Redknapp anticipates both being able to start Wednesday&apos;s Champions League last-16 second leg against Milan. Ledley King, who has been out of action since October, has also resumed training, as has Jonathan Woodgate, who is not as severely injured as initially feared when he hobbled off after the first-leg victory over Milan three weeks ago. Younes Kaboul is also close to returning following his knee injury and Tom Huddlestone should be back before the end of the season. &quot;We&apos;re close to having an awful lot of players back fit,&quot; said Redknapp. &quot;Within another two weeks we&apos;ll have about five or six coming back, which will make a big difference to the squad.

Although Spurs are only one point behind fourth-placed Chelsea he believes the only one of the teams currently above them that they could catch is Manchester City. Spurs secured their qualification at City&apos;s expense last season by winning at Eastlands in the second-last match of the campaign and Redknapp says he would not be surprised if this season&apos;s denouement was similar \u2013 which is why he is so enthused about the prospect of having a fully fit squad by the time Spurs go back to Eastlands on April 17. &quot;I can&apos;t ever see Chelsea not finishing in the top four.

Seven or eight of Europe&apos;s eastern countries, so recently liberated from the Nazis, now found themselves under Soviet oppression, and the so-called iron curtain divided the continent, as Churchill put it, from Stettin to Trieste. Everywhere was shabby. Everything was threadbare. Famous old cities of history lay ravaged, still in ruins. Travelling in this disordered region was not easy. Currencies were hard to come by, visas were necessary almost everywhere, food was often scarce, trains were grimy and unreliable and for the most part air travel was only for privileged officialdom. And always there loomed over the continent, if only in one&apos;s mind, the baleful presence of Soviet communism. The iron curtain was like a prison wall, and crossing it from east to west, from St Petersburg (then Leningrad) to Helsinki, say, or from one half of Berlin to the other, really was like a personal liberation. I&apos;m sorry to have to say it, because those times were cruel indeed for many Europeans, but I greatly enjoyed my travelling then. It was an excitement just being on the long-forbidden continent, as we called it then, and travel in Germany had a peculiar fascination for me. I used vividly to think as I sat at a cafe in Hamburg or strolled a Bavarian meadow that only the other day our own thudding bombers had been killing people in these very streets, and only the other day, if I had gone for a walk here, in no time I would have been bundled off to a prison camp. As it was, no single German seemed to bear a grudge against me, but even now, six decades on, I can still summon the sensation into my mind, if I try hard enough. But it was the miserable iron curtain that enthralled me most, in those early wanderings of mine. I always loved allegory, and to come across it almost anywhere, from a stretch of barbed wire or a line of pillboxes to its ultimate obscenity, the Berlin Wall, seemed to me a tremendously allegorical moment of history. I enjoyed the impassive faces of the border guards, when I crossed the curtain by one frontier or another, and they with infinite slow suspicion turned the pages of my passport. I relished the feeling of disquiet that accompanied me everywhere, a western journalist meandering through hostile police states, and I welcomed the moments when murky strangers asked me to take messages home to Britain for them, or played the agent provocateur with black market inducements. It was all grist for my mill, after all, and when a diplomat of my acquaintance once asked me to deliver an unexplainable package to an unidentifiable recipient, I carried it across the Chain Bridge at Budapest feeling childishly like somebody in a spy novel. And now, in another century, almost in another world? Now I can potter around a spanking new Europe as I will, crossing its frontiers almost without producing a passport, and I can even go to the United States without a visa. Of course I relish these new freedoms, which have vastly broadened my horizons and enlarged my opportunities. I am no longer travelling to report for newspapers, but only to gather material for books. As age has caught up with me, too, I no longer pine for those frissons of the cold war, and don&apos;t in the least want to be interrogated by armed guards with Kalashnikovs in the interior of Africa. It is a wonderful thing, of course it is, that any of us should be able to travel, wherever we like, whenever we want, pop down to St Pancras and take a train to Avignon, pop up to Manchester airport and be off to Valpara\u00edso. I have to admit that with the ease and general safety of travel, it has lost a little of its excitement for me. Partly, I am almost ashamed to admit, this is because now everybody else does it too! Everyone has thrilled to Manhattan now. Everyone seems to have been to the Great Barrier Reef. One of my neighbours lately went on a package tour to Lhasa. Even the most beautiful city in the world, Venice, undeniably loses some of its wow factor when you can hardly see San Marco for the massed multitudes of its visitors, and every few minutes the Campanile is dwarfed by the passing of another obese cruise ship. And every one of us, if we haven&apos;t actually been to the forests of Borneo or the Amazon jungles, have certainly experienced them via television. And yet, and yet \u2026 during my 60-odd years of the wandering life I really have been to most of the places I want to go to, have been in most of the world&apos;s great cities and experienced the wild world from the Himalayas to the Empty Quarter. For much of the time I am perfectly content to stay in my own incomparable corner of Wales. Nevertheless, the moment those engines burst into life and I fasten my seat belt, the moment I glimpse the Andes through the clouds or watch the blue Adriatic tilting through our windows \u2013 the moment I step out into a revivified Berlin or a fabulous Dubai, or find myself once again upon the Honolulu beach with a mai tai in my hand \u2013 at every such moment I think once again, as I did when I was young, how marvellous the great world is, and how rich the rewards of travelling it. Pico Iyer     Photograph: Geraint Lewis/Alamy    The world is just as interesting \u2013 as unexpected, as unvisited, as diverse \u2013 as it ever was, even though the nature of its sights has sometimes changed. I am fascinated to see Thai tourists, for example, at a sleek new hotel in Jaipur, and to go to Mauritius to find Russian fat cats trying (in vain) to entertain their molls. I am interested in what &quot;Indo-Pak&quot; Chinese food in Toronto might taste like, and what a McVeggie with Cheese amid the ancestral swarm of Varanasi will offer. I once spent two weeks living in and around Los Angeles airport and, although it wasn&apos;t a peaceful holiday, it offered as curious and rich a glimpse into a new century of crossing cultures as I could imagine. And when I walk around the Old City of Jerusalem after dark, as I did six weeks ago; or visit the beach in Thailand, as I did two weeks after that; or wander among the &quot;gods&apos; messengers&quot; that are the 1,200 roaming deer which still more or less run the old Japanese capital of Nara, I find these classic beauties as rich as ever they were. Places are like people for me and, as with people, the wise, rich, deeply rooted places never seem to change too much, even though they might lose some hair or develop wrinkles. Damascus, Zurich, Lalibela are as pristine as they were generations ago. And even as the tides of history keep washing against a Havana or a Beirut, their natural spiritedness or resilience or sense of style never seems greatly diminished. My talisman as a traveller has always been that old chestnut from Proust, that &quot;the real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new sights, but in seeing with new eyes&quot;. A place is boring only if you bring uninterested eyes to it. Some people say that democratic travel has removed the magic of places, but to me that magic is just as strong as ever (in Petra, in La Paz, even in my hometown of Oxford) if it is real. Garbo never grows old, nor Dylan young. When we worry that a place we love has changed \u2013 &quot;Bali isn&apos;t what it used to be,&quot; I sometimes hear myself saying, &quot;It&apos;s usually because we have changed.&quot; Fascination is in the eye of the beholder.Pico Iyer is the author of The Open Road: The Global Journey of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama (Bloomsbury, \u00a38.99) The explorer: Benedict Allen      Photograph: Murdo Macleod    The last great journey on Earth was perhaps Wally Herbert&apos;s trek to the North Pole in 1969. Until the end of the last century, explorers were finishing up the scraps \u2013 Mike Fay trekked across the Congo, I walked the Namib, and so on. And now, the world is open to us all. You don&apos;t need to read accounts by someone like me, the specialist; we&apos;re all doing it. Grab your camera or pen and hike! So these couldn&apos;t be better times for the average person \u2013 we may all share in the privilege. Is it exploration? Well, if it&apos;s not advancing knowledge, no. Those who today flog to the Poles are not explorers, they are simply athletes. Inspiring \u2013 and, I&apos;m afraid, irrelevant. Yet, man is not, in the end, a rational creature; exploration isn&apos;t entirely about assembling proven fact. Dr David Livingstone made many discoveries in Africa but his biggest role was actually as communicator, giving the Victorians a picture of the continent for his day. Take Ed Stafford&apos;s recent walk along the length of the Amazon. A pointless journey in itself, and 2,000 miles of it along what is in fact a shipping lane. Yet the journey was saved from irrelevance and self-indulgence because along the way he documented the Amazon for his time, which is our time. This task of accurately conveying our threatened world is more urgent than ever.benedictallen.com The internet traveller: Vicky Baker      Vicky Baker.    It&apos;s become easy \u2013 even fashionable \u2013 to be negative about social networking. Yet amid all the nostalgia and cynicism, it&apos;s also easy to lose sight of the positive aspects that have come along too, especially for travellers. Personally, I love the fact that we can now make new contacts all around the world at the click of a button; that sometimes just sending an email can open a door to getting welcomed like an old friend; that we can stay in touch with the people we meet; that we can discover places we may not have found by chance, and yet still leave room for plenty of haphazard wandering too. Does the internet take away all the spontaneity? I don&apos;t think so. It can still be exciting to follow a random tip you saw on an obscure blog or to wait for the arrival of an unknown, online contact in a cafe. Sure, it&apos;s a bit different to what came before, but one day these will be a generation&apos;s &quot;good old days&quot; too. There&apos;s no need to be online 24/7 or constantly slaving to a smartphone to get the benefits. If you want to take a trip without logging in once, you can do so. That&apos;s the great thing about travelling in 2011, you can opt in or opt out. And if you have the time and the money to go off into the back of beyond without so much as a guidebook and without seeing (or rarely seeing) another tourist, those days aren&apos;t over either.vickybaker.co.uk The blogger: Rolf Potts     Photograph: Fritz Liedtke    The world is as interesting for travellers as it&apos;s always been \u2013 but as wanderers we need to balance the utility of new travel technologies with the quieter, more organic rewards previous generations of travellers discovered on the road. Interestingly, this whole now-versus-then argument was a topic of debate when I first started vagabonding 15 years ago. Many of the older travellers I met back then \u2013 some of them veterans of the 1970s hippy trail across Asia \u2013 argued that my travel experiences were tainted by luxuries such as email and credit cards. These days I am myself tempted to look at a younger generation of travellers and suggest that smartphones and micro-blogging are compromising their road experiences. I have to remind myself that this isn&apos;t a new conversation \u2013 that technology has been altering the travel experience since at least the dawn of the steamship and the railroad engine. Any technology that makes travel easier is going to connect aspects of the travel experience to the comforts and habits one might seek back home \u2013 and can make travel feel less like travel. George Orwell tackled this issue in his 1937 essay The Road to Wigan Pier. &quot;Everyone who has travelled by primitive methods in an undeveloped country knows that the difference between that kind of travel and modern travel in trains \u2026 is the difference between life and death,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The nomad who walks or rides, with his baggage stowed on a camel or an ox-cart, may suffer every kind of discomfort, but at least he is living while he is travelling; whereas for the passenger in an express train or a luxury liner his journey is an interregnum, a kind of temporary death.&quot; Here Orwell seems to argue that technology is destroying the true experience of travel \u2013 but he goes on to assert that restoring the travel experience is not as simple as refusing the technology: &quot;So long as the railways exist, one has got to travel by train \u2026 Here am I, 40 miles from London. When I want to go up to London why do I not pack my luggage on to a mule and set out on foot, making a two days of it? Because, with the Green Line buses whizzing past me every 10 minutes, such a journey would be intolerably irksome. In order that one may enjoy primitive methods of travel, it is necessary that no other method should be available.&quot; What in Orwell&apos;s day was a matter of rail transit is now an issue of constant connectedness \u2013 what I like to call the &quot;electronic umbilical cord&quot;. At one level the ubiquity of smartphones and wireless internet makes travel more accessible: apps such as image recognition search Google Goggles can be more dynamic than guidebooks, and sites like couchsurfing.com help travellers connect with local hosts. On another level, part of travel&apos;s charm has always been its disorienting uncertainty \u2013 and it can be hard to stumble into serendipity when all your travel decisions are filtered through your iPhone. Thus the importance of balance. Just as Orwell wasn&apos;t going to walk to London when there were Green Line buses available, most of us aren&apos;t going to discard our smartphones and internet access for aerograms and hand-drawn maps. That said, there are times when a far-flung post office encounter or directions scribbled on to the back of a grocery sack can lead a person into the kind of experiences that make travel so surprising and worthwhile. That means 21st-century travellers must be aware of when their gadgets are enhancing new experiences, and when those gadgets are getting in the way of new experiences. If in doubt, unplug the electronic umbilical cord and throw yourself at the mercy of your exotic new surroundings. This time-honoured travel strategy can be daunting if you&apos;re not used to it, but you&apos;ll soon come to discover that unplugged travel carries its own, often more rewarding, set of possibilities.rolfpotts.com", "title": "Has technology robbed travel of its riches?", "sentences": ["Nevertheless, the moment those engines burst into life and I fasten my seat belt, the moment I glimpse the Andes through the clouds or watch the blue Adriatic tilting through our windows \u2013 the moment I step out into a revivified Berlin or a fabulous Dubai, or find myself once again upon the Honolulu beach with a mai tai in my hand \u2013 at every such moment I think once again, as I did when I was young, how marvellous the great world is, and how rich the rewards of travelling it."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-05T00:07:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/06/insurance-middle-east-turmoil", "tags": ["Insurance industry", "Business", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "  Insurers have been inundated with requests for cover from wealthy individuals, oil traders and multinationals in North Africa and the Middle East amid fears that civil unrest will spread further across the region. Andrew Brooks, chief executive of Ascot Underwriting, a Lloyd&apos;s of London insurer, said the company had received 40 enquiries from the region in a morning last week: &quot;Ascot has seen a substantial up-tick for insurance enquiries in the Middle East. Initially, these were mainly from individuals trying to protect their personal assets such as fine art and property in Egypt and Bahrain, but as the unrest has spread into Libya, we have seen oil companies and oil traders enquiring about the availability of insurance products to protect their assets.&quot; He recounted that one person wanted extra cover for an art collection worth $3m (\u00a31.84m) in Cairo while oil traders in Libya fear stocks being seized as the country edges towards civil war. Some oil and gas companies are scrambling to get forced abandonment cover for their mobile equipment, such as rigs. Ascot&apos;s chairman, the former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove, said the security situation posed the most severe challenge since 9/11: &quot;The potential for those accustomed to benign market conditions to take losses on a scale not seen since the period after 9/11 will be severe. A shake-up in the [insurance] market, which is overdue, looks imminent.&quot; Underwriters and brokers expect premiums to go up as a result of the turmoil. Stephen Ashwell, head of Global Response at insurer Hiscox, said: &quot;Last week we had a queue from our box at Lloyd&apos;s that stretched all the way down Lime Street. I haven&apos;t seen such an upsurge in business since 9/11.&quot; He said clients were looking for broader cover that protects them against any eventuality from political violence to war and terrorism. One problem is that reinsurers, the majority of which moved to exclude terrorism from their standard policies after the 9/11 attacks, are now likely to restrict their riots and strikes coverage to minimise their losses. London is the centre of the global terrorism and political violence insurance market. Hiscox said most of the enquiries were coming from local companies and multinationals operating in Bahrain, but also Egypt and Libya and, interestingly, Saudi Arabia, Dubai and the United Arab Emirates, which have yet to encounter any political unrest. Similarly, Alex Clayton, executive director of brokerage Willis&apos; Global Markets International division, said enquiries from Bahrain had doubled, in particular from hotel and shopping mall operators, and insurance rates are &quot;definitely going up&quot;. &quot;We are seeing more of the banks and financiers who lend money to big oil and infrastructure projects insisting companies have political violence cover in the event a property is attacked.&quot; Clayton said most of Willis&apos; clients have civil commotion cover under their All-Risk insurance policies, but those that don&apos;t are rushing to get standalone political violence insurance. He also noted that last year&apos;s riots in Thailand were defined as terrorism by the Thai government, so if the Egyptian government decided to go down the same route, some companies would not be covered for terrorism under their All-Risk policies. Brooks said: &quot;Some insurance companies only look at aggregation on a country-by-country basis, but now all markets will have to look at cross border exposure.&quot; He added the situation was highly unpredictable and could easily implode. He drew an analogy with the break-up of the former Yugoslavia and its civil war following the end of the Soviet Union, saying tribal groups could come to the fore, resulting in a &quot;Balkanisation of the Middle East&quot;.", "title": "Rich rush for insurance cover amid Middle East turmoil", "sentences": ["Hiscox said most of the enquiries were coming from local companies and multinationals operating in Bahrain, but also Egypt and Libya and, interestingly, Saudi Arabia, Dubai and the United Arab Emirates, which have yet to encounter any political unrest."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-06T00:03:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/mar/06/us-hard-courts-andy-murray", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Roger Federer", "Tennis", "Sport"], "article": "Andy Murray returns to tennis this week at Indian Wells, not far from the original Disneyland, but the BNP\u00a0Paribas Open is no Mickey Mouse event. It is the first ATP Masters 1000 tournament of the year, and one that could stir bad memories for the Scot. It was here a year ago that Murray&apos;s spiral towards despair began. Beforehand, he was content and confident after briefly being restored to No3 in the world rankings, before dropping back a place. He was mixing with the elite on merit and talk of his breaking through to win a slam was spreading through the game. He was the coming man. Murray described the first hard\u2011court swing of the American circuit as &quot;my favourite part of the tour&quot;. He spoke about the sunshine, the nearby golf course, the excellent hotel, the fine food and the wonderful practice facilities \u2013 all of the comfort-zone extras that make the life of a modern international athlete bearable. &quot;I feel good,&quot; he said. Within a month, after bad losses there and in Miami, he was moved to remark: &quot;I need to start enjoying my tennis again. This has been going on for a few weeks now.&quot; It was widely written that Murray had &quot;fallen out of love&quot; with tennis. He said this misrepresented his state of mind but it was obvious that something was seriously wrong with his game and his head; the damage had been done. It got worse before it got better, too. He knows, if he goes out early again at Indian Wells, that he will be staring at a reprise of his 2010 nightmare. His performance in America over the next few weeks will also tell him, and us, if he is finally in the right mental and physical condition to reach again for his first slam win. He will never have a better chance. With Roger Federer&apos;s prospects of overtaking Rafa Nadal at the summit of the game again sliding by the month, this is the perfect time for the world No5 and half a dozen contenders to make their move. If Murray doesn&apos;t take it, there are others in the mood to hunt down Nadal, not the least of them Andy&apos;s friend and conqueror in the Australian Open, Novak Djokovic, who last weekend dismissed Federer in straight sets in the Dubai final, his 12th consecutive win of the year. Given his submissive performance against Djokovic at the height of his powers in Melbourne this year, Murray will wonder if this is part of a cycle or a coincidence. He said after his most recent big setback that he might go away from tennis &quot;for a few months, or a week. Who knows?&quot; He was in a dreadful funk, having lost his third slam final out of three in straight sets. We learned soon enough that he was to play Rotterdam, as he had promised the sponsors. He lost miserably in the first round, complaining of a wrist problem, then withdrew from Dubai, which angered the organisers no end. It is often tough to tell what Murray is thinking. Naturally shy, he internalises his doubts and fears, sharing his worries with a small group of confidants, including his mother, Judy, his brother Jamie, and long-time travelling friend and hitting partner Dani Vallverdu. There are plenty of experts who argue he should get a full-time coach and ban his mother from courtside. They may be right about the coach. They are wrong about Judy. She is a calming presence in the life of a sometimes turbulent talent. At least tennis now has a diverting new conundrum to ponder. Who will next win a grand slam: Murray or Federer? The Swiss may not add to his 16 slams. His aura has faded dramatically. Murray? He played six very good matches before folding against Djokovic at his best \u2013 just as he did the previous year before losing to Federer. What has changed in that time is everyone in the top 10 now fancies his chances against Federer, even in the slams, where he channels most of his energy. In the past year, Robin Soderling utterly destroyed him on the clay of Paris, the long-shot Alejandro Falla nearly beat him in the first round of Wimbledon before Tomas Berdych stopped him reaching his eighth final there on the spin, and Djokovic accounted for him easily in Melbourne. Something else has changed recently. Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, the forgotten Argentinian, last weekend won his first tournament since 2009, at Delray Beach. His injured wrist has mended and his mind seems to be in the right place. Having seriously contemplated quitting the game, he has rediscovered his love of tennis and adds his name to that of Murray and the other pretenders \u2013 but he is no sure bet to rediscover the magic that made him such a threat only two years ago. What a snake pit of psychological demons this maddening, fascinating game is. Atherton revels in his second calling When he was England captain in the grinding years of Australian hegemony (with West Indies not far behind), Mike Atherton attended press conferences with all the enthusiasm of Marie Antoinette being dragged to the guillotine. At the Sports Journalists&apos; Association awards in London tomorrow night, Atherton, in his third year as the cricket correspondent of the Times as well as an experienced and intelligent broadcaster, will be on the shortlist for the second time. A unanimous choice as sports writer of the year in 2010, he has clearly gone some way to being as good a hack as he was a cricketer (which is saying something, because he was a fine batsman and a pretty good captain) and our trade is all the richer for his elegant and thoughtful contributions. Atherton is also an accomplished author, as anyone who has read his book on gambling will agree. Nevertheless, as someone who once batted for 10 hours and 43 minutes to save a Test match against South Africa, Athers knows the virtue of patience. So he may appreciate the paradox of his lightning ascent in his second calling \u2013 not to mention the mutterings of those press-box colleagues who have toiled diligently for years without recognition from their trade&apos;s association and remember the days when they called him Captain Grumpy, a soubriquet he did his best to live up to.", "title": "US hard courts will reveal if Andy Murray's lapses are part of a cycle | Kevin Mitchell", "sentences": ["If Murray doesn&apos;t take it, there are others in the mood to hunt down Nadal, not the least of them Andy&apos;s friend and conqueror in the Australian Open, Novak Djokovic, who last weekend dismissed Federer in straight sets in the Dubai final, his 12th consecutive win of the year.", "He lost miserably in the first round, complaining of a wrist problem, then withdrew from Dubai, which angered the organisers no end."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-06T00:21:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/06/liam-fox-sas-unit-libya", "tags": ["Libya", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Liam Fox", "Military", "UK news", "Africa"], "article": "The defence secretary, Liam Fox, has confirmed that a &quot;small diplomatic team&quot; is in Benghazi to talk to Libyan rebels but refused to confirm reports that any British nationals had been detained. According to Guardian sources, a suspected British intelligence and special forces unit, which arrived by helicopter about four days ago, was caught near the town of Khadra, about 20 miles west of Benghazi. A senior member of Benghazi&apos;s revolutionary council said: &quot;They were carrying espionage equipment, reconnaissance equipment, multiple passports and weapons. This is no way to conduct yourself during an uprising. &quot;Gaddafi is bringing in thousands of mercenaries to kill us, most are using foreign passports and how do we know who these people are? &quot;They say they&apos;re British nationals and some of the passports they have are British. But the Israelis used British passports to kill that man in Dubai last year.&quot; Rebel leaders claimed the captives were being treated well and would be released as soon as the British government vouched for their identity with the rebel command. The news follows Sunday Times claims that an SAS unit was being held by rebel forces it had approached in an attempt to open up diplomatic channels to opponents of Muammar Gaddafi. Fox refused to give any more details on the diplomatic team&apos;s mission in the eastern area of the country, which is controlled by rebel forces: &quot;We are in touch with them but I&apos;m not going to be giving further comment on that.&quot; Whitehall sources said on Friday it needed to learn more about the leadership of the anti-Gaddafi forces and find out what logistical support they needed, but would not give arms to the rebels, as an international arms embargo was in place. Fox said: &quot;It is a very difficult situation to be able to understand in detail. There are a number of different opposition groups to Colonel Gaddafi in Libya who do seem relatively disparate. &quot;We want to clearly understand what the dynamic is here because we want to be able to work with them to ensure the demise of the Gaddafi regime, to see a transition to greater stability in Libya and ultimately to more representative government. &quot;So getting a picture of that is relatively difficult, as is widely reported. Communications are being interrupted, there are difficulties with mobile phones, with the internet potentially being interfered with. &quot;So we are trying to build a picture \u2013 it&apos;s essential that the government does that and it&apos;s essential that all western governments do that so we are able to get a clearer idea of what we are able to do in terms of helping the people of Libya.&quot; The Sunday Times reported Libyan and British sources confirming the SAS unit had been detained by rebel forces it had approached to secure a meeting with a junior diplomat to offer help in their fight against Gaddafi. The mission backfired when rebel leaders in Benghazi objected to foreign interference from governments which had not yet formally recognised them as Libya&apos;s legitimate rulers, it said. Spokesmen for the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office refused to confirm or deny the Sunday Times report. The international development secretary, Andrew Mitchell, refused to comment about the SAS unit when questioned on Radio 5 Live. When asked if it was possible a diplomat was there for talks, he replied: &quot;It is perfectly possible that the Foreign Office will be trying to open links with all the rebel forces there.&quot; The foreign secretary, William Hague, urged Gaddafi to put an &quot;immediate stop&quot; to the use of armed force against Libyans. &quot;Given the continued levels of illegitimate violence within Libya we call upon Colonel Gaddafi to put an immediate stop to the use of armed force against the Libyan people,&quot; he said. &quot;He must hand over power without delay to a government which fully recognises the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people. &quot;The UK reiterates its support for the transition to a government that will deliver greater democracy, justice, transparency, human rights and accountability in Libya.&quot; Heavy gunfire has erupted in Tripoli, with hundreds of Gaddafi&apos;s supporters pouring into the streets.

Tottenham might be fifth and in the Champions League, but they&apos;ve still had their say in the relegation battle. Their last game saw them lose 3-1 to Blackpool, presumably to the considerable annoyance of all the other strugglers. Beat Milan, lose to Blackpool. Such are the ups and downs of a Harry Redknapp side. Only one thing, however, is stopping them from earning the mantle as the most inconsistent side in the country: Wolves. Now this lot are baffling. They&apos;ve beaten Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United, and have lost to, among others, Wigan, West Ham and Blackpool. They are arguably the only side in the country who feel more comfortable facing one of the top teams than a rival, to the extent that their victory over Blackpool last week was more of an upset than when they ended United&apos;s unbeaten record. Another &apos;shock&apos; is on the cards today. With Tottenham carrying their fair share of injuries and surely keeping one eye on Wednesday&apos;s game against Milan, this could be the perfect time for Wolves to play them. It&apos;s that sort of good fortune that keeps a side up. Managers sometimes write off these games, looking to games against fellow strugglers for points, but Wolves don&apos;t have that luxury today. Although Blackburn, Birmingham and Wigan all lost yesterday, West Brom and West Ham won, leaving Wolves in the bottom three.  Team news: Wolves are without Jamie O&apos;Hara due to the terms of his loan, so Nenad Milijas comes in, with Kevin Doyle on his own up front. Dave Edwards is injured and is replaced by Stephen Ward. Despite scoring twice against Blackpool, Sylvan Ebanks-Blake is only on the bench. To be fair, even Dirk Kuyt could score against Blackpool these days. What? Oh. As for Tottenham, they line up in an ENGLISH 4-4-2. The good news for them is that Gareth Bale is back and on the bench. The bad news is that Rafael Van der Vaart is injured, so Harry Redknapp starts with his BFF Roman Pavlyuchenko alongside the Amazing Non-Scoring Jermain Defoe. The clearest sign that Redknapp considers this game less important than Milan is that Aaron Lennon is on the bench. We wouldn&apos;t have been saying that a few months ago. Wolves (4-5-1): Hennessey; Foley, Stearman, Berra, Elokobi;Hammill, Henry, Ward, Milijas, Jarvis; Doyle. Subs: Hahnemann, Craddock, Ebanks-Blake, Fletcher, Mouyokolo, Griffiths, Doherty. Tottenham (4-4-2): Gomes; Hutton, Dawson, Gallas, Assou-Ekotto; Pienaar, Jenas, Sandro, Modric; Defoe, Pavlyuchenko. Subs: Cudicini, Bale, Lennon, Palacios, Crouch, Bassong, Kranjcar. Referee: Mark Halsey (Lancashire)  Pre-match plugging dep&apos;t: Floating brain in a jar Jonathan Wilson (yes, that one) has started a new football magazine. You really should buy it. It&apos;s magnificent. (I might be biased here. But it is.)  The managers have just been interviewed on Sky. &quot;Have you seen their bench today?&quot; says Mick McCarthy. Just to make it clear, he has seen Tottenham&apos;s bench. It was rhetorical. Harry Redknapp hopes Tottenham are focused on this game  , which is interesting .  Dean Richards, of course, played for both of these sides. There will be a tribute to him before the match, and Sky have just had a lovely piece on him, interviewing former team-mates and managers. You should also read this fine piece by Rob Bagchi.  The teams emerge from the tunnel. Wolves are in their gold strip, while Tottenham are in white.  &quot;Deano! Deano!&quot; rings out around the ground. Ledley King (representing Tottenham), Claus Lundekvam (representing Southampton) and Matt Murray (representing Wolves) bring three shirts with Richards&apos; name on to the pitch, before his family come on to. They&apos;re followed by Dave Jones, James Beattie and Don Goodman. There&apos;s a poignant silence as the PA reads out Richards&apos; playing achievements, before a minute&apos;s applause from the crowd. &quot;Deano! There&apos;s only one Deano!&quot;  1 min: And we&apos;re off, Wolves getting us under way and kicking from left to right. There&apos;s a slightly subdued atmosphere understandably. Tottenham attack straight away, but neither Pavlyuchenko are able to make anything out of a very decent cross from Hutton from the right. Tottenham stay on the front foot though, and Modric glides in from the left before slipping a lovely pass across the area to Pavlyuchenko. He&apos;s got a clear sight of goal 15 yards out, but instead of striking it hard, he opens up his body and looks to place a shot into the corner. In the end, he makes a complete mess of it, partly due to the presence of Berra putting him off, and the ball slithers apologetically wide.  3 min: It&apos;s very quiet in Molineux, save for the chants of the Tottenham fans. Wolves have started nervously; the wins for West Ham and West Brom yesterday have really put pressure on them.  4 min: As I&apos;ve discussed below, the problem for Wolves this season has been when expectations are high. Bizarrely this is one of those games, and may play into Tottenham&apos;s hands.  5 min: This is better, a thrusting run from the lone striker, Doyle, as he holds off challenges on the left, before winning a corner off Hutton. Hammill takes the corner and Gomes charges through the bodies to punch the ball clear. He doesn&apos;t get it too far though, and is relieved that Milijas was unable to control his right-footed volley from inside the D, the ball shanked high and wide.  6 min: How&apos;s this for symmetry? Tottenham have scored 19 goals at home, 19 goals away and 19 goals in the main stages of the Champions League. They probably won&apos;t mind if some of that symmetry is lost today though...  8 min: It&apos;s been a quiet start. Assou-Ekotto pumps the ball down the line, looking for Defoe. Goal-kick to Wolves.  9 min: An aimless ball forward suddenly has Defoe interested, and Hennessy races off his line, just reaching the pass before the Tottenham striker, sliding in and getting it away. Defoe was inches away from getting that. One touch and he would have had an open goal, albeit with his left foot and 30 yards out. So maybe not a proper open goal. A half chance.  11 min: The first glimpse of the dangerous Jarvis, who spins beautifully away from Hutton on the left and whips in a lovely cross that Gomes catches before any Wolves player can get his head on it. &quot;The Wolves pitch looks awful,&quot; says  Arsene Wenger  Chris Bond. &quot;Can all MBMers also watching this match sing &apos;Are you Wigan&apos;s playing service in disguise?&apos; at the TV please? Ta.&quot;  13 min: Tottenham definitely have at least one eye on Wednesday night. They don&apos;t look particularly bothered about this match so far. They&apos;ve been away in Dubai for the last fortnight. Maybe they&apos;ve got the holiday blues.  14 min: I wonder how Alan Hutton enjoyed Dubai.  16 min: Foley comes in off the right flank, and spots Milijas making a clever run behind the Tottenham defence. Foley has the right idea and plays a pass through to Milijas, but Gallas anticipates it well, gets his body in between the man and the ball and ushers it back to Gomes. Excellent defending from Gallas. But this isn&apos;t, as this time he lets Milijas get the better of him, the midfielder peeling off him from Hammill&apos;s cross from the right. Eight yards from goal, Milijas can only loop a header over the bar - in fairness to him, the cross was a bit too high for him.  18 min: More pressure from Wolves, as Milijas swings in a corner from the right. It&apos;s not very good though and is cleared at the near post.  19 min: Tottenham&apos;s respite was only momentary. On the right flank, Defoe conceded a needless free-kick, allowing Wolves to keep up their pressure. Milijas swung the free-kick and once again it led to a corner. Jarvis took it from the right, but Gomes punched clear under severe pressure.  GOAL! Wolves 1-0 Tottenham (Doyle, 20 min): Tottenham have been asking for this and the defending here is absolutely dreadful. Wolves had been banging on the door, forcing a succession of corners and free-kicks and their pressure has paid off. They won another corner, as Jarvis raced on to a lovely pass down the inside-right channel and into the area. He hit his shot first time but a Spurs defender managed to deflect it into the side netting. Milijas took the corner from the right again, and although it was headed clear, Henry showed great awareness to spread the play back out to Milijas. He wasn&apos;t closed down quickly enough, so he cut back on to his left foot, curled the ball into the six-yard box and Doyle, with no Tottenham defender anywhere near him, flicked the ball past Gomes, who was all over the place, and into the empty net.  22 min: Nearly an instant reply from Tottenham! Pienaar finds space on the edge of Wolves&apos; area, skips past Jarvis and then fires a low shot past Hennessy&apos;s near post and into the side netting. A warning for Wolves, who went to sleep there.  25 min: Wolves are giving Tottenham no time at all on the ball and so far, their pressing has worked. That said, Tottenham&apos;s response since the goal has been excellent. Pienaar&apos;s off-the-ball run from the left - rather like Freddie Ljungberg at Arsenal - goes unchecked, and Modric spots his team-mate. Pienaar then produces a glorious pirouette to throw his marker off-balance, but as he shoots, Stearman manages to recover and get the block in. The ball deflects back to the edge of the area, where Modric runs on to it ominously ... and skews his shot around six yards wide of the left post. But Wolves have reason to be worried.  28 min: It&apos;s been all Tottenham since the goal.  29 min: Oh, what a waste. Jenas picks up possession in the centre circle and then goes on a lovely surging run into the heart of Wolves&apos; territory. He easily outstrips the wheezing Henry, but instead of passing to the unmarked Defoe, he decides to shoot and, well, it was rubbish.  GOAL! Wolves 1-1 Tottenham (Defoe, 30 min): What a way to score your first league goal of the season! Tottenham have monopolised possession since going behind, so this isn&apos;t that big a surprise. It looked they were going nowhere in this move, Pavlyuchenko getting bogged down just outside Wolves&apos; box, with a clutch of defenders surrounding him. He did really well to shift the ball to Defoe though, not that there was much danger for Wolves. Or so it seemed. Defoe had nothing on, so just darted to the right and then bent an absolutely superb shot past Hennessy and high into the top right corner. That is unstoppable. Where&apos;s he been all season then?  33 min: That goal was greeted with cheers in Birmingham, Wigan and east London too.  GOAL! Wolves 1-2 Tottenham (Defoe, 35 min): This is extraordinary! Defoe has done it again. His first goal was brilliant, but this one&apos;s even better. It all stemmed from a Wolves attack which Tottenham broke up on the edge of their own area. A few touches later and in a flash they were breaking forward at speed, Defoe running down the left flank at the backtracking Wolves defence, which is suddenly terrified of the striker. He darted inside and then laid the ball off to Modric on the edge of the area. Again it looked like the move was about to peter out when a Wolves midfielder got a foot in to rob Modric, but unfortunately for the home side, the ball ran straight back to Defoe who hit a marvellous first-time curler with his right foot past Hennessy and into the same spot where he put his first goal. The amount of curl he got on that was incredible.  39 min: PENALTY TO WOLVES! Doyle&apos;s deflected shot from 25 yards out spins through into the area and Milijas is hauled down by Hutton six yards from goal! Hutton could be off.  GOAL! Wolves 2-2 Tottenham (Doyle pen, 40 min): Two for Doyle, two for Defoe. There was outrage from the home crowd before the penalty was taken as Halsey somehow decided only to book Hutton, an absolutely scandalous decision. Hutton clearly denied a goalscoring opportunity, bringing down Milijas who was only six yards out and poised to equalise. How on earth has Halsey not sent Hutton off? Anyway, no matter, because Wolves are level. Gomes goes to his left, so Doyle simply rolls the ball casually to his right. A superbly cool penalty and it&apos;s all square again.  43 min: Modric curls a free-kick in from the left but it&apos;s under-hit and put on to the head of the first man.  44 min: Despite Halsey awarding the penalty, the home crowd are still annoyed he didn&apos;t send off Hutton, who is being booed whenever he touches the ball. Does anyone understand the rules of football any more? Back to the action, Tottenham zip forward again. Pienaar leaves a pass from Pavlyuchenko for Defoe, who&apos;s on his hat-trick. On the right side of the area, Defoe works the ball on to his deadly right foot, but Elokobi does excellently to deflect his effort behind.  45 min: Dawson gets his head on Modric&apos;s corner but can only direct a weak header straight at Hennessy.  45 min+1: There will be two more minutes of this. Hammill&apos;s cross loops up to the edge of the area, and Henry heads it down for Milijas who turns and slices a volley miles over the top. I can&apos;t be sure, but I don&apos;t think he meant to do that.  Peep! Peep! Wolves have been much the better side, but two moments of genius have undone them. Boos ring out as the teams go down the tunnel, Wolves fans still annoyed that Hutton wasn&apos;t sent off. Someone needs to explain that decision to me.  Half time: Wolves 2-2 Tottenham.  Half-time emails: &quot;&apos;Hutton clearly denied a goalscoring opportunity&apos; Eh?&quot; says Colin Leeds. &quot;He shot, therefore not a sending off offence. It isn&apos;t difficult.&quot; I think you&apos;re the one who&apos;s finding it difficult - it doesn&apos;t matter if Milijas got the shot away. Using your logic, he shouldn&apos;t have given a penalty. By fouling him, Hutton made it difficult for Milijas to score and he didn&apos;t score. He was six yards out and he pulled him back, trying to stop him from shooting. A clear red card. &quot;If there was an referee ombudsman, they would be quite busy after this weekend, given some of the decisions,&quot; says Jamie Ayres. &quot;Arshavin&apos;s disallowed goal and blatant penalty not being given in the Arsenal vs Sunderland, Carragher staying on the pitch in the Man U vs Liverpool game and now Tottenham&apos;s Hutton staying on the pitch have my eyebrows raised to Roger Moore heights.&quot; If you lower your expectations of all referees, you won&apos;t end up disappointed when they blunder.  On Defoe&apos;s first goal, Ray Wilkins makes an interesting point, saying that Hennessy was too far off his line. That&apos;s a fair point, as the first goal wasn&apos;t right in the corner, although I don&apos;t agree that he should have saved the immense second goal.  46 min: Here we go again, Tottenham taking their third kick-off of the day. In the Sky studio, Souness and Wilkins were cooking over the decision not to send off Hutton. It&apos;s excellent when Souness gets angry. Anything could happen! Gattuso&apos;s headbutt on Joe Jordan was the best thing he&apos;d seen since this. The commentary is brilliant in that clip: &quot;That is a booking!&quot; Imagine the reaction now.  GOAL! Wolves 2-3 Tottenham (Pavlyuchenko, 48 min): For the third time today, what a finish, but that decision not to send off Hutton is looking more and more pivotal. Jenas was allowed too much room to burst through the non-existent Wolves midfield, before flicking a pass to Pavlyuchenko. He had his back to goal on the edge of the area, but shook off his marker with a canny turn into the area, before absolutely lashing the ball past Hennessy with his left boot from 16 yards out. He got a bit lucky as it took a nick off Ward, but take nothing away from the finish. This is a great game.  50 min: And Wolves nearly equalise again! Jarvis checks on to his right foot on the left and whips a teasing cross into the six-yard box. Ward races on to it and gets in front of Gallas, but can only glance a skimming header wide of the left post.  52 min: Mick McCarthy&apos;s comments are going to be interesting if it stays like this. Expect some gruff, no-nonsense Yorkshire musings.  53 min: &quot;A few weeks back, Redknapp said that a penalty and yellow card in that situation is punishment enough,&quot; says Phill Wainwright. &quot;What do you think? I know some will say that a pen could be missed, but I&apos;d be inclined to agree.&quot; Well I wrote this last year, which should make it clear. In this case, I&apos;d say Hutton should have walked as his foul was cynical in the extreme.  54 min: Dawson barges into Hammill off the ball on the right, and when the advantage disappears, Halsey brings play back. Dawson is quite rightly booked. More cynicism, although hardly the worst foul you&apos;ll ever see, right Jamie?  55 min: Milijas&apos;s free-kick is dire but Tottenham&apos;s attempt to clear it is even worse, Sandro and Jenas contriving to mess up the situation between them, the ball bobbling off Sandro&apos;s shoulder in comical fashion. It breaks to Hammill on the right of the area, but just as he seemed poised to shoot, the ball sat up awkwardly for him, forcing him to loop a cross into the six-yard box instead. Tottenham get it clear, but only momentarily. Henry sends in another dangerous cross, but Gomes does excellently to come off his line and catch it.  58 min: &quot;Any true Wolves supporter should be well pleased that Hutton is still on the pitch,&quot; says Ian Markey. &quot;It almost guarantees another few easy opportunities to equalise/win...&quot;  58 min: This is far from over. Redknapp is fuming on the touchline, steam coming out of his ears, as Gallas goes on a foray into Wolves&apos; half. And loses the ball to Doyle. Doyle immediately sprays the ball out to Jarvis on the left, and he goes racing up the left flank ominously, only to ruin it all by cutting inside on to his right foot and curling the ball high and wide from the edge of the area. He&apos;s no Defoe.  59 min: Everyone wants to be Defoe today: Pavlyuchenko goes for the curler, but fares no better than Jarvis.  60 min: Gallas hands Wolves another free-kick 30 yards from goal with a pointless foul on Doyle. Before it&apos;s taken though, Sylvan Ebanks-Blake comes on for Stephen Ward, Wolves changing to a 4-4-2 presumably.  61 min: Hammill stands over the free-kick, but it&apos;s the left-footer, Milijas, who takes it and bends his shot a few yards wide of the left post.  64 min: Excellent defending from Sandro, who dives full-length to head Foley&apos;s dangerous cross over the bar, with Doyle lurking behind him. He goes down, apparently injured, but just seems to be suffering from cramp. Milijas takes the corner again but a lot of his set-pieces have been really poor, hit straight to the first man, and this is no exception.  65 min: What a save from Gomes to preserve Tottenham&apos;s lead! Milijas found a bit of space in midfield and took the opportunity to amble forward, with Tottenham backing off. No Tottenham defender bothered to close him down - Sandro trying to belatedly - and Milijas cracks a fine low effort towards the bottom right corner, only for Gomes to dive and get the most vital of fingertips on the shot, diverting it on to the post and out for a corner. Which Wolves mess up totally. They tried to take it short and gave it away instantly.  66 min: For a moment it looks like Defoe&apos;s about to get his hat-trick as he races clear of the Wolves defence, but again Hennessy gets to the loose ball before him to smother the danger.  69 min: Here&apos;s trouble. Tottenham make their first change, Gareth Bale on for Steven Pienaar. Now Wolves really have something to be worried about on the break.  70 min: Here&apos;s Bale! Immediately he speeds down the right flank and tries to play a one-two with Modric, only for the flag to go up as Bale drifts offside. &quot;Alan Hutton&apos;s comedy performances - it shows what a bad move it was to loan out Kyle Walker to Villa,&quot; says Mark Cruise. &quot;Doesn&apos;t it?&quot; Perhaps, although remember that Hutton is only playing because Vedran Corluka is injured.  71 min: &quot;I don&apos;t necessarily disagree with Phill Wainwright&apos;s point of view, but it&apos;s not the referee&apos;s job to apply a value judgement on what would be a &apos;fair&apos; outcome,&quot; says Thomas Hopkins. &quot;His job is to apply the rules which, rightly or wrongly, say that denying a goalscoring opportunity in the area results in both a penalty and a red card. I can understand why he might not want to send someone off in those circumstances, but I can&apos;t understand why he didn&apos;t do it.&quot; I agree, although I don&apos;t necessarily agree with the rule.  72 min: Bale has given Tottenham a new lease of life. It&apos;s like a new signing! He&apos;s playing on the right at the moment and has just torn Elokobi a new one, getting to the byline with consummate ease. He cuts the ball back into the six-yard box, leading to an almighty scramble. Wolves get it half-clear, the ball breaking loose to Modric, who can&apos;t quite get the shot away. He cuts it back to Defoe, who surprisingly decides to pass to a Wolves defender.  73 min: Dear me. A terrible miss. Milijas finds Jarvis on the overlap on the left, and the winger slides the ball into the area for Ebanks-Blake. Right in front of goal, it looked like had to equalise, but got it all wrong, and ended up shanking the ball comically past the left post with his left foot, which we shall generously refer to as his standing foot from now on.  74 min: Wolves bring on Stephen Fletcher for Adam Hammill. Tottenham bring on Aaron Lennon for Roman Pavlyuchenko.  75 min: Tottenham escape again. A cross from the right evades everyone and bounces into the path of Milijas. On the stretch, however, he can only volley over from six yards out - he should have tried to head it.  77 min: William Gallas, you&apos;ll be surprised to hear, has lost his head, as Ebanks-Blake rolls away from him 25 yards out and is immediately hauled back by the Frenchman. He&apos;s booked.  78 min: But, as it must be pointed out, Gallas is a terrific defender and does superbly to prevent a Wolves equaliser from the free-kick. It was straight from the training ground, Milijas pretending to shoot and then slipping the ball to the unmarked Jarvis on the left. Jarvis fizzes the ball into the near post, where Gallas puts it behind.  80 min: GOAL! OR NOT? NO! WHAT&apos;S GOING ON HERE? Mark Halsey is not going to be very popular in Wolves tonight - the home side have had a perfectly good goal disallowed here. Milijas swung a deep free-kick into the six-yard box, and once again Gomes was flapping all over the place as he tried to claim it. He made a complete hash of it as Stearman jumped with him fairly, and the ball squirted loose and squirted off into the box. Wolves celebrate, Tottenham appeal, Halsey gives it. The crowd celebrates, stops celebrating, starts celebrating again, and then reacts with complete disbelief as Halsey disallows it for a foul on Gomes by Stearman!  82 min: Just before the disallowed goal, Wolves had a penalty appeal waved away as Jarvis&apos;s crossed was blocked by Hutton&apos;s back and not (NOT) his arm. Tottenham broke up the pitch and Henry made a complete mess of dealing with Bale, who suddenly found himself one-on-one with Hennessy, who just got something on his shot to stop Tottenham from wrapping up the points.  83 min: So close to the hat-trick for Defoe! Sandro seizes on another error in the Wolves defence and cuts the ball back to the edge of the area for Defoe, whose firmly-struck right-footed shot beats Hennessy but thwacks away off the base of the left post. That was a wonderful shot, but not quite wonderful enough.  84 min: Tottenham make their final substitution, Niko Kranjcar coming on for Luka Modric.  86 min: &quot;There are no rules in football, only laws,&quot; points out Terry Land. &quot;I am always dubious about any conversation around the same that omits that most basic knowledge.&quot;  GOAL! Wolves 3-3 Tottenham (Fletcher, 87 min): Justice is done! Ebanks-Blake pulls out to the left, and plays the ball down the line for Jarvis, who once again cuts on to his right foot and crosses to the far post where Fletcher hangs in the air and plants a perfectly judged header back across goal, past Gomes and into the far corner! Tottenham&apos;s marking was dreadful, Dawson hardly covering himself in glory there. Their defending has been appalling.  89 min: Tottenham break, Lennon leading the charge up the left. He offloads the ball to Jenas, whose attempted drive from 30 yards out is blocked by Berra.  90 min: Wolves will still be fuming, mind you, as Andrew Wiese points out here: &quot;I&apos;ll wait until Wolves are winning before I claim justice has been done here...&quot; I was just about to write that, but I&apos;ll give you the glory. There will be four minutes of stoppage time.  90 min+2: Bale lines one up on the edge of the area but cracks his shot straight at Hennessy.  90 min+3: So, one final twist?  90 min+4: Kranjcar finds Bale in behind Tottenham&apos;s defence, but his cross is blocked behind for a corner, which comes to nothing.  Peep! Peep! Boo!  Football? Bloody hell.  Post-match thoughts: &quot;You&apos;re not fit to referee,&quot; chant the Wolves fans. That&apos;s a shame, really, as usually Mark Halsey is very capable but he&apos;s had a nightmare here, failing to send off Alan Hutton and disallowing a perfectly good Wolves goal. Still, what a breathless game that was. Let&apos;s focus on the positives, a never-say-die performance from Wolves, a fine header from Stephen Fletcher and two superb goals from Jermain Defoe. The point doesn&apos;t do much for Wolves, who remain 19th, but surely they aren&apos;t going down. Tottenham go level on points with Chelsea, but with a worse goal difference and having played one game more. They could do with learning how to defend, but ahead of Milan, they didn&apos;t pick up any injuries and Gareth Bale returned. Thanks for reading and thanks for emailing.

The six SAS troops and two MI6 officers were seized by Libyan rebels in the eastern part of the country after arriving by helicopter four days ago. They left on HMS Cumberland, the frigate that had docked in Benghazi to evacuate British and other EU nationals as Libya lurched deeper into conflict. The diplomatic team&apos;s departure marked a perfunctory end to a bizarre and botched venture. &quot;I can confirm that a small British diplomatic team has been in Benghazi,&quot; said William Hague, the foreign secretary. &quot;The team went to Libya to initiate contacts with the opposition. They experienced difficulties, which have now been satisfactorily resolved. They have now left Libya.&quot; Audio of a telephone conversation between the UK&apos;s ambassador to Libya, Richard Northern, and a senior rebel leader was later leaked. Northern suggested in the call that the SAS team had been detained due to a misunderstanding. The rebel leader responded: &quot;They made a big mistake, coming with a helicopter in an open area.&quot; Northern said: &quot;I didn&apos;t know how they were coming.&quot; Despite the failure of the mission, Hague indicated that Britain would continue to try to make contact with the opposition. &quot;We intend, in consultation with the opposition, to send a further team to strengthen our dialogue in due course,&quot; he said. &quot;This diplomatic effort is part of the UK&apos;s wider work on Libya, including our ongoing humanitarian support. We continue to press for Gaddafi to step down and we will work with the international community to support the legitimate ambitions of the Libyan people.&quot; According to Guardian sources, the British intelligence and special forces unit were caught near the al-Khadra Farm Company, 18 miles (30km) south-west of Benghazi. A senior member of Benghazi&apos;s revolutionary council said: &quot;They were carrying espionage equipment, reconnaissance equipment, multiple passports and weapons. This is no way to conduct yourself during an uprising. &quot;Gaddafi is bringing in thousands of mercenaries to kill us, most are using foreign passports and how do we know who these people are? &quot;They say they&apos;re British nationals and some of the passports they have are British. But the Israelis used British passports to kill that man in Dubai last year.&quot; Rebel leaders said claimed the captives had been treated well and would be released as soon as the British government vouched for their identity with the rebel command. The news follows Sunday Times claims that an SAS unit was being held by rebel forces it had approached in an attempt to open up diplomatic channels to opponents of Muammar Gaddafi. Whitehall sources said on Friday it needed to learn more about the leadership of the anti-Gaddafi forces and find out what logistical support they needed, but would not give arms to the rebels, as an international arms embargo was in place. British officials during the day declined to comment on reports that special forces were being held but defended the objective of the mission. The defence secretary, Liam Fox said: &quot;It is a very difficult situation to be able to understand in detail. There are a number of different opposition groups to Colonel Gaddafi in Libya who do seem relatively disparate. We want to clearly understand what the dynamic is here because we want to be able to work with them to ensure the demise of the Gaddafi regime, to see a transition to greater stability in Libya and ultimately to more representative government. &quot;So getting a picture of that is relatively difficult, as is widely reported. Communications are being interrupted, there are difficulties with mobile phones, with the internet potentially being interfered with. &quot;So we are trying to build a picture \u2013 it&apos;s essential that the government does that and it&apos;s essential that all western governments do that so we are able to get a clearer idea of what we are able to do in terms of helping the people of Libya.&quot; David Cameron, speaking at the Tory party spring conference in Cardiff, repeated his call for &quot;Gaddafi to go&quot;. &quot;On Libya, our strategy is clear,&quot; he said. &quot;We will continue to intensify pressure on the regime. We will continue to state clearly that international justice has a long reach and a long memory, and that those who commit crimes against humanity will not go unpunished. We will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to those affected by this crisis, and continue to demand access for aid agencies to reach those in need. And we will continue to plan, with our allies, for every eventuality. &quot; The Sunday Times reported Libyan and British sources confirming the SAS unit had been detained by rebel forces it had approached to secure a meeting with a junior diplomat to offer help in their fight against Gaddafi. The mission backfired when rebel leaders in Benghazi objected to foreign interference from governments which had not yet formally recognised them as Libya&apos;s legitimate rulers, it said.", "title": "SAS-backed Libyan diplomatic mission ends in humiliation", "sentences": ["But the Israelis used British passports to kill that man in Dubai last year.&quot; Rebel leaders said claimed the captives had been treated well and would be released as soon as the British government vouched for their identity with the rebel command."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-06T18:27:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/mar/06/jim-davidson-stand-up-be-counted", "tags": ["Comedy", "Theatre", "Culture", "Television", "Race issues", "Comedy", "Jim Davidson"], "article": "The young black comedian fixes Jim Davidson with a contemptuous glare. &quot;I grew up feeling inadequate because of your comedy,&quot; he says. &quot;You old-school guys got laughs from feeding people&apos;s prejudices.&quot; Davidson, chunkier than we remember him, bespectacled and grey-haired, listens on as the comedian continues to berate him. &quot;Has it ever occurred to you that all the stereotyping you do is negative? You just don&apos;t get it \u2013 you&apos;re such a fucking prick.&quot; It is an extraordinarily dramatic moment, rendered even more remarkable when one learns that the entire encounter is in fact a scene from a new stage play written by the target of the abuse: Jim Davidson. The play Stand Up and Be Counted sees Davidson playing a bigoted, middle-aged comedian who envies and despises the new generation of politically correct comedians who dismiss him in\u00a0turn as a hateful dinosaur. &quot;So this Eddie Pierce character you play \u2013 he&apos;s basically you, isn&apos;t he?&quot; I ask during a pause in the run-through, which takes place in a basement under a large church on London&apos;s Tottenham Court Road. Davidson peers down his glasses, pauses and says, &quot;This guy is a racist, homophobic bigot \u2013 how could it be based on me?&quot; There&apos;s an uncomfortable silence before he bursts out laughing. We think we know Jim Davidson; the south London, Page 3 girl-dating, Thatcher-loving, Our Boys-supporting, gay-baiting, hard-drinking, racist standup comedian. In the 80s his routine was infamous for his depictions of the character Chalky \u2013 a\u00a0slow-witted and stereotypical black character with a weed habit and Jamaican accent. Watching him as a child, to my eyes Davidson didn&apos;t seem a hardcore bigot like Bernard Manning. With his breezy manner and cheeky-chappy air, Davidson reminded me of a weak-minded schoolboy who goes along with the bullying as he knows it will make him popular. In the 90s, Davidson reinvented himself as the BBC&apos;s Mr Saturday Night, with Big Break and The Generation Game. Both programmes were eventually cancelled and Davidson found himself out of fashion. He hasn&apos;t been on television since, apart from a disastrous appearance on ITV reality show Hell&apos;s Kitchen, which he was thrown off for referring to &quot;shirt-lifters&quot; in front of the gay former Big Brother contestant Brian Dowling. That appearance confirmed to his critics that Davidson was an\u00a0unreconstructed bigot and it is that\u00a0public perception he explores in Stand Up and Be Counted. &quot;I\u00a0dipped into the perception of me and thought,\u00a0let&apos;s write about it,&quot; he says. &quot;It was like having a conversation with\u00a0myself.&quot; The origins of the play go back to the winter of 2005, when Davidson was performing in Southend and decided to venture to a tiny comedy venue where a black comedian was playing to a small audience. &quot;I really liked the guy&apos;s material,&quot; Davidson recalls, &quot;so I went up to him and introduced myself. He looked at me and said it was because of me and my racist jokes that he had been tormented at school.&quot; The black comedian was 41-year-old Matt Blaize and the pair ended up talking about the impact Davidson&apos;s comedy \u2013 specifically Chalky \u2013 had had on a generation of black and Asian people. Inspired by the conversation, Davidson wrote the play and offered the part of Earl T Richards \u2013 a hip young black comedian who is one of Eddie Pierce&apos;s nemeses \u2013 to Blaize. &quot;The play is about how the old-school comedians \u2013 guys like myself \u2013 resent the new school because they think they are successful without being funny,&quot; says Davidson, &quot;and the new school look at the old school as representing everything they want to\u00a0overturn.&quot; So how much of Jim Davidson is in Eddie Pierce? Davidson says Pierce is more from the Bernard Manning school of comedy. &quot;I have never classed myself as a racist comedian,&quot; he says. &quot;Bernard didn&apos;t understand racism \u2013 I\u00a0do. For Bernard, if a joke made people laugh that was enough. He didn&apos;t think a joke could have consequences. I&apos;m not like that. I talk about racist issues and I make fun of black people but I&apos;ve never wanted to make it racist.&quot; However, both Eddie Pierce and Davidson share a disdain of modern comedians. &quot;Ricky Gervais? Fucking hell \u2013 he is not funny at all!&quot; he splutters. Michael McIntyre, meanwhile, is &quot;posh \u2013 sounds like Ronnie Corbett on speed&quot;. As for Jimmy Carr, &quot;he professes to write his own material but I&apos;ve seen Laurel and Hardy do some of his jokes&quot;. The crucial difference between Eddie and Jim is that Davidson is far more self-aware than his fictional creation. Audiences have become used to stars playing thinly disguised versions of themselves. Some, such as Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm, do it in search of laughs. Others, such as Les Dennis in Extras \u2013 another old-school comic \u2013 do it to reinvent themselves. What makes Stand Up and Be Counted so compelling is that it is not Ricky Gervais (who on stage jokes, &quot;one false move and I&apos;m Jim Davidson&quot;) writing the dialogue but Davidson himself. During the course of the play, every character \u2013 the sharp\u00a0black comedian, the gay television presenter, the talent-show celebrity \u2013 find their prejudices challenged. Earl, the black comedian, is forced to concede that his comedy also has victims, and the audience is asked to judge whether it is more acceptable to make fun of white people\u00a0and Americans than black people and Asians. The taxman&apos;s taken all his homes In person, Davidson is hugely likable and far more thoughtful than his reputation suggests. He doesn&apos;t seem bitter that he&apos;s no longer on television: &quot;I miss the money, but you have a shelf-life.&quot; He launches a predictable attack on new comedians as an &quot;awful, jealous, socialist bunch of cunts&quot; but also rails against &quot;the fat, white Oldham boys who sit on their arses and say, &apos;Send them home because they&apos;ve all got our jobs,&apos; but when you ask what job they do they say, &apos;I&apos;ve never had a job \u2013 I&apos;ve had a bad back for six years.&apos;&apos;&apos; He thinks political correctness fuels bigotry but speaks fondly of hearing the\u00a0call to prayer from the mosque down the street from where he lived in\u00a0Dubai. He returned to Britain seven months ago, having lived in Dubai for six years. &quot;I ran out of money,&quot; he says, and it was Lord Ashcroft who made me think of coming back to Britain when he said to me, &apos;Don&apos;t you have to be rich to be a tax exile?&apos;&quot; Davidson now lives in Hampshire with his fifth wife and two dogs. The need to generate income coupled with the fact that television is no longer an option were both factors in writing the play. Having surrendered\u00a0his last seven homes to the taxman, he is financing and directing the new play on his own, and he admits to many sleepless nights ahead of its opening. &quot;I have put myself out there to be shot down,&quot; he says, &quot;and there will be some people who will come to see the play just to see Jim Davidson get his comeuppance on stage.&quot; In the flesh, it&apos;s clear that Davidson has regrets about his past, but racist jokes, he says, were &quot;the norm back then. If I could apologise to every black\u00a0person who was offended I would, but I doubt it would make any difference.&quot; The fact is it shouldn&apos;t only be Davidson who ought to apologise: the television bosses who put him on and the millions who laughed at him are surely as culpable as the comedians. Stand Up and Be Counted ends with Eddie Pierce realising that his comedy does have consequences and that if he wants a career he is going to have to adapt to the new world. &quot;In the play, my character is made to realise that he can&apos;t just carry on as he was,&quot; Davidson says, &quot;but the question is whether he is genuinely remorseful or\u00a0just faking it\u00a0to be famous.&quot; I wonder whether this was Davidson acknowledging and apologising for his past and seeking some kind of rehabilitation: has he turned from hateful bigot to soft liberal? He laughs. &quot;Well, by the end of the play,&quot; he says, &quot;it&apos;s the Guardian one, the Sun nil.&quot; \u2022 Stand Up and Be Counted is at the Mayflower, Southampton (02380 711811) until Saturday.

The group was immediately flown to the frigate HMS Cumberland, which remains stationed off the coast of Libya. Seven of the group had been inserted by helicopter into farmland near the rebel capital Benghazi on a mission to establish contact with anti-regime forces. The eight Britons had been detained and questioned since Thursday by rebel leaders who had suspected they were mercenaries. Challenged by guards at a wheat farm, they were forced to open bags containing weapons, reconnaissance equipment, and multiple passports, then herded into a dormitory before they were handed over to the rebels. William Hague confirmed the &quot;diplomatic team&quot; had left Libya after experiencing &quot;difficulties&quot;. He said another team would be sent in after consultation with the opposition leadership. The group&apos;s capture is a major embarrassment to the British government and could potentially undermine the rebels&apos; claims that the revolution, which has rippled through Libya for the past fortnight, has had solely domestic roots. Officials in Benghazi&apos;s organising committee, which is trying to organise civilian and military affairs, criticised the British team&apos;s decision to make a clandestine entry to the country, claiming it had fuelled doubts about their intentions. &quot;We don&apos;t want new enemies, but this is no way to make contact,&quot; said a senior member of the committee, Essam Gheriani. &quot;Dropping in in the dead of night with espionage equipment, recording devices, multiple weapons and passports. In Dubai the Israelis used British passports to kill that man, [Hamas commander Mahmoud] al-Mabhouh. It&apos;s a matter of verification. At a time of revolution, suspicion is greater than trust.&quot; A recording of a telephone conversation between the UK&apos;s ambassador to Libya, Richard Northern, and a senior rebel leader has been leaked by Libyan authorities. Northern suggested the SAS team had been detained due to a &quot;misunderstanding&quot;. The rebel leader responded: &quot;They made a big mistake, coming with a helicopter in an open area. I didn&apos;t know how they were coming.&quot; The Guardian can reveal that the helicopter group&apos;s contact was a British national named Tom, who is believed to be an MI6 officer. He had worked for the past five months as an administrator in the Al-Khadra Farm Company, 18 miles south-west of Benghazi. The group&apos;s cover was blown by suspicious guards as soon as they arrived at their staging point inside the farm courtyard, which was adjacent to Tom&apos;s living quarters. &quot;This could play into Gaddafi&apos;s hands,&quot; said Ahmed al-Bira, the director of the Al-Khadra Farm Company. &quot;From the beginning this has been from the people here. It is not about foreigners.&quot; The British government had last week indicated it was prepared to send advisers to link up with the rebels in an attempt to intensify pressure on Colonel Gaddafi, who has fought to remain in power after being routed from the east of the country during a violent three-day revolt. &quot;I can confirm that a small British diplomatic team has been in Benghazi,&quot; Hague said in a statement. &quot;The team went to Libya to initiate contacts with the opposition. They experienced difficulties, which have now been satisfactorily resolved. They have now left Libya. &quot;We intend, in consultation with the opposition, to send a further team to strengthen our dialogue in due course,&quot; the foreign secretary added. &quot;This diplomatic effort is part of the UK&apos;s wider work on Libya, including our ongoing humanitarian support. Gaddafi has blamed the uprising on al-Qaida and foreign powers who he says are after Libya&apos;s oil. Rebel attempts to move towards western Libya and the capital, Tripoli, have so far been stymied by forces loyal to the dictator, who were battling rebel units west of the oil town of Ras Lanuf, about 250 miles from Benghazi. Gaddafi&apos;s air force jets have been the scourge of the rebels and a key reason for their willingness to seek foreign help. On Sunday, jets intensified their attacks bombing rebel positions in the centre of the country and causing dozens of casualties. One of the guards who arrested the Britons described their clandestine arrival and the mysterious Briton who had worked at the farm. &quot;His name was Tom and he worked in administration,&quot; said the guard, named Rafah. &quot;At 3am on Thursday he said he was going to Benghazi and drove out the gate.&quot; A second foreign national drove another car. The guards heard helicopters landing in a nearby field and soon after, both cars returned to the farm, driving through a gate and into a large gravel staging yard, near Tom&apos;s living quarters. &quot;They were taking large bags into the house and we walked over to them,&quot; said Rafah. &quot;We fired one shot into the air and told them they were under arrest.&quot; Rafah and several other guards said they cooked the Britons eggs for breakfast and gave them bread and coffee. Soon after, the director Mr al-Bira arrived and phoned the rebel leadership asking what to do with the men. He was told to bring them to Benghazi.Rebel leaders said they were anxious to put the rocky start to the liaison behind them and secure supply lines for their forces, which they claim are ill-equipped to fight Gaddafi loyalists in any protracted campaign.", "title": "SAS and MI6 officers released by Libya's rebel commanders", "sentences": ["In Dubai the Israelis used British passports to kill that man, [Hamas commander Mahmoud] al-Mabhouh."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-07T01:25:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/07/prince-andrew-decide-trade-role-vince-cable", "tags": ["Prince Andrew", "UK news", "Vince Cable", "Politics", "Monarchy"], "article": "Pressure is mounting on Prince Andrew over his trade envoy role for Britain amid claims he has become &quot;a national embarrassment&quot;. The business secretary, Vince Cable, said the prince would have to judge whether he should carry on as UK trade envoy following further revelations over the weekend about his controversial dealings with discredited business figures. Ministers indicated over the weekend that a review of the Duke of York&apos;s role as Britain&apos;s trade ambassador would be used to lower his profile, amid growing unease in Downing Street and ministerial circles. Ministers have been alarmed by the prince&apos;s links with Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire US financier who served a prison sentence for soliciting an underage girl for prostitution. The Mail on Sunday reported that the FBI is to reopen its investigation into Epstein over allegations of his involvement with underage girls. Cable told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that conversations would be taking place with Prince Andrew over his future role as Britain&apos;s special trade representative: &quot;He is a volunteer, he has offered to perform these roles, and I think it is down to him essentially to judge the position he wants to be in. &quot;Obviously there are conversations that will take place with him about what he is to do in future. That is simply a matter of managing the relationship.&quot; A picture was released last week of the prince with his arm around Virginia Roberts, then aged 17, who claims she was sexually exploited by Epstein and his friends. The teenager said she met the prince, who allegedly enjoyed regular massages at Epstein&apos;s home. The prince categorically denies any wrongdoing or impropriety. Chris Bryant, a Labour MP and former foreign minister, said the royal had become &quot;a national embarrassment&quot; who should no longer be used as a trade ambassador. Bryant, who was chastised by the Commons Speaker last week for raising the issue on the floor of the house , told BBC Breakfast: &quot;I am sure there are some countries in the world where having a visiting royal makes a difference, it makes it possible to have some meetings which wouldn&apos;t otherwise be possible. But I am afraid he has now just become a national embarrassment. &quot;My worry is that, sometimes when he goes on these trips, I am not sure whether he is helping us out or he is just helping himself. &quot;The truth is we shouldn&apos;t be using him for these delegations anymore.&quot; It was reported on Monday that the prince was shortly planning to lead a trade mission to Saudi Arabia, which has been identified as one of the most attractive potential markets for British companies. Prince Harry last week cancelled a charity polo match in Dubai due to concerns it would appear insensitive amid rising political instability in the Middle East. But the Duke of York is reportedly pressing ahead with the tour after cancelling earlier plans to visit Tunisia, according to the Financial Times. The prince faced embarrassment over the weekend when the Guardian reported that he hosted a leading member of the deposed Tunisian dictatorship at Buckingham Palace three months before the regime collapsed. Sakher el-Materi, the son-in-law of Tunisia&apos;s deposed president, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, attended a lunch with more than a dozen executives from British multinationals hoping to win business in Tunisia. Materi, 29, fled Tunisia after Ben Ali was ousted. One cabinet minister said a hard-headed assessment of Prince Andrew&apos;s role would be made during a &quot;tasking review&quot;, which is held every six months to assess his work as Britain&apos;s special trade representative. &quot;The gas can be turned up and the gas can be turned down,&quot; the minister said, but stressed there was no question of removing the prince. &quot;The royals go on, that is what they do,&quot; he said. There were suggestions over the weekend that Prince Andrew could be given more of a ceremonial role rather than his official position as trade envoy on behalf of the government body, UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI). Government sources indicated that they would be relieved to see the back of the prince as special trade representative. &quot;It really is up to him,&quot; one senior source said. &quot;Will many people be shedding tears if he decided to go? I doubt it.&quot; It has been reported that Epstein helped to pay off debts owed by Sarah Ferguson after an alleged intervention from the prince, her former husband. Epstein is said to have given \u00a315,000 to a former assistant of Feguson&apos;s after the prince allegedly made an appeal as part of efforts to help her avoid bankruptcy. As unease grew at senior levels in Whitehall about the prince&apos;s links with a convicted sex offender, the prince held talks last week with Sir John Cunliffe, the prime minister&apos;s most senior adviser on overseas business and Europe. The meeting was used to assess his future as part of the tasking review. William Hague, the foreign secretary, said the government remained fully supportive of the prince. &quot;I&apos;ve seen a lot of benefits that he has brought in countries that I have visited where he&apos;s been performing that role,&quot; Hague told the Politics Show on BBC1. Asked about the prince&apos;s embarrassments, Hague said: &quot;I&apos;m not an expert on what you say are the embarrassments, I haven&apos;t had time, with everything going on in the Middle East, to look at those things. But certainly I&apos;ve seen around the world a lot of good that he has done for this country.&quot; Other Tories were privately less supportive of the prince, reflecting unease in Downing Street about his conduct. One senior Tory source said: &quot;There appears to be no discernible mental activity upstairs as far as the duke is concerned. I feel sorry for him. He has no friends and so is surrounded by these vile people.&quot; But Ed Perkins, the prince&apos;s press secretary, has pleaded with Whitehall in an email to show some support. In the email, leaked to the Telegraph, Perkins said of the disclosure that the prince had hosted a relative of the then Tunisian president: &quot;[I] am deploying the line that he [Materi] was vice-chairman of the chamber of commerce. Will UKTI stand behind him? We need some government backing here.&quot; Alastair Watson, the prince&apos;s private secretary, also took the unusual step of commenting in public to defend his reputation. In a letter to the Times, Watson wrote: &quot;The duke has known Mr Epstein since being introduced to him in the early 1990s. The insinuations and innuendos that have been made in relation to the duke are without foundation.&quot;", "title": "Prince Andrew must decide whether to continue in trade role, says Vince Cable", "sentences": ["Prince Harry last week cancelled a charity polo match in Dubai due to concerns it would appear insensitive amid rising political instability in the Middle East."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-07T09:22:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/07/facebook-twitter-revolutionaries-cyber-utopians", "tags": ["Arab and Middle East unrest", "World news", "Social networking", "Media", "Facebook", "Internet", "Technology", "Twitter", "Blogging"], "article": "Tweets were sent. Dictators were toppled. Internet = democracy. QED. Sadly, this is the level of nuance in most popular accounts of the internet&apos;s contribution to the recent unrest in the Middle East. It&apos;s been extremely entertaining to watch cyber-utopians \u2013 adherents of the view that digital tools of social networking such as Facebook and Twitter can summon up social revolutions out of the ether \u2013 trip over one another in an effort to put another nail in the coffin of cyber-realism, the position I&apos;ve recently advanced in my book The Net Delusion. In my book, I argue that these digital tools are simply, well, tools, and social change continues to involve many painstaking, longer-term efforts to engage with political institutions and reform movements. Since the internet&apos;s cheerleaders can&apos;t bury cyber-realism any more than they can secede from history, they&apos;ve had to design their own straw-man interpretation of the cyber-realist position, equating it with a view that the internet doesn&apos;t matter. This is a caricature of the cyber-realist worldview that doesn&apos;t really square with parts of my book that very explicitly state \u2013 here is just one quote \u2013 that &quot;the internet is more important and disruptive than [its greatest advocates] have previously theorised&quot;. Or take the ongoing persecution of Malcolm Gladwell, who is increasingly painted as some kind of a neo-Luddite. In an online chat that Gladwell did for the New Yorker&apos;s website shortly after his infamous attack on the notion of &quot;Twitter Revolution&quot; was published last October, he explicitly stated (no less than three times) that the internet can be an effective tool for political change when used by grassroots organisations (as opposed to atomised individuals). Thus, simply showing that the internet was used to publicise, and even organise protests in the Middle East does nothing to counter his argument (which, by the way, I do not entirely endorse). To refute it, cyber-utopians would need to establish that there was no coordination of these protests by networks of grassroots activists \u2013 with leaders and hierarchies \u2013 who have forged strong ties (online or offline or both) prior to the protests. What we have seen so far suggests otherwise. True, the principal organisers of Egypt&apos;s Facebook movement may not be revolutionary leaders in the conventional understanding of the term. (And how could they be, given the grim track-record that former president Hosni Mubarak compiled \u2013 with Washington&apos;s complicity \u2013 in dispatching such leaders?) However, they did exercise leadership and acted strategically \u2013 even going into hiding a few days before the actual protests \u2013 just as leaders of a revolutionary cell would. The collaborations between Tunisian and Egyptian cyber-activists \u2013 so widely celebrated in the press \u2013 were not virtual, either. In the space of a week in May 2009, I crashed two (independently organised) workshops in Cairo, where bloggers, techies, and activists from both countries were present in person, sharing tips on how to engage in advocacy and circumvent censorship; one of the attendees was the Tunisian blogger Slim Amamou, who went on to become Tunisia&apos;s minister of sport and youth. One of these events was funded by the US government and the other by George Soros&apos;s Open Society Foundations (with which I&apos;m affiliated). There were many more events like this \u2013 not just in Cairo, but also in Beirut and Dubai. Most of them were never publicised, since the security of many participants was at risk, but they effectively belie the idea that the recent protests were organised by random people doing random things online. Those who believe that these networks were purely virtual and spontaneous are ignorant of the recent history of cyber-activism in the Middle East \u2013 to say nothing of the support that it&apos;s received, sometimes successful but most often not, from western governments, foundations and corporations. In September 2010, to take just one recent example, Google brought a dozen bloggers from the region to the freedom of expression conference the company convened in Budapest. Tracing the evolution of these activist networks would require more than just studying their Facebook profiles; it would demand painstaking investigative work \u2013 on the phone and in the archives \u2013 that cannot happen overnight. One reason we keep talking about the role of Twitter and Facebook is that the immediate aftermath of the Middle Eastern spring has left us so little else to talk about; thoroughgoing political analysis of the causes of these revolutions won&apos;t be available for a few years. This points us to the real reason why so many cyber-utopians got angry with Gladwell: in a follow-up blog post to his article that appeared as the crowds were still occupying Tahrir Square, he dared to suggest that the grievances that pushed protesters into the streets deserve far more attention than the tools by which they chose to organise. This was akin to spitting in the faces of the digerati \u2013 or, perhaps worse still, on their iPads \u2013 and they reacted accordingly. And yet Gladwell was probably right: today, the role of the telegraph in the 1917 Bolshevik revolution \u2013 just like the role of the tape-recorder in the 1979 Iranian revolution and of the fax machine in the 1989 revolutions \u2013 is of interest to a handful of academics and virtually no one else. The fetishism of technology is at its strongest immediately after a revolution but tends to subside shortly afterward. In his 1993 bestseller The Magic Lantern, Timothy Garton Ash, one of the most acute observers of the 1989 revolutions, proclaimed that &quot;in Europe at the end of the 20th century, all revolutions are telerevolutions&quot; \u2013 but in retrospect, the role of television in those events seems like a very minor point. Will history consign Twitter and Facebook to much the same fate 20 years down the road? In all likelihood, yes. The current fascination with technology-driven accounts of political change in the Middle East is likely to subside, for a number of reasons. First of all, while the recent round of uprisings may seem spontaneous to western observers \u2013 and therefore as magically disruptive as a rush-hour flash mob in San Francisco \u2013 the actual history of popular regime change tends to diminish the central role commonly ascribed to technology. By emphasising the liberating role of the tools and downplaying the role of human agency, such accounts make Americans feel proud of their own contribution to events in the Middle East. After all, the argument goes, such a spontaneous uprising wouldn&apos;t have succeeded before Facebook was around \u2013 so Silicon Valley deserves a lion&apos;s share of the credit. If, of course, the uprising was not spontaneous and its leaders chose Facebook simply because that&apos;s where everybody is, it&apos;s a far less glamorous story. Second, social media \u2013 by the very virtue of being &quot;social&quot; \u2013 lends itself to glib, pundit-style overestimations of its own importance. In 1989, the fax-machine industry didn&apos;t employ an army of lobbyists \u2013 and fax users didn&apos;t feel the same level of attachment to these clunky machines as today&apos;s Facebook users feel toward their all-powerful social network. Perhaps the outsize revolutionary claims for social media now circulating throughout the west are only a manifestation of western guilt for wasting so much time on social media: after all, if it helps to spread democracy in the Middle East, it can&apos;t be all that bad to while away the hours &quot;poking&quot; your friends and playing FarmVille. But the recent history of technology strongly suggests that today&apos;s vogue for Facebook and Twitter will fade as online audiences migrate to new services. Already, tech enthusiasts are blushing at the memory of the serious academic conferences once devoted to the MySpace revolution. Third, the people who serve as our immediate sources about the protests may simply be too excited to provide a balanced view. Could it be that the Google sales executive Wael Ghonim \u2013 probably the first revolutionary with an MBA \u2013 who has emerged as the public face of Egypt&apos;s uprising, vowing to publish his own book about &quot;Revolution 2.0&quot;, is slightly overstating the role of technology, while also downplaying his own role in the lead-up to the protests? After all, the world has yet to meet a Soviet dissident who doesn&apos;t think it was the fax machine that toppled the Politburo \u2013 or a former employee of Radio Free Europe or Voice of America who doesn&apos;t think it was western radio broadcasting that brought down the Berlin Wall. This is not to suggest that neither of these communications devices played a role in these decades-old uprisings \u2013 but it is to note that the people directly involved may not have the most dispassionate appraisals of how these watershed events occurred. If they don&apos;t want to condemn themselves to a future of tedious bar-room arguments with the grizzled, and somewhat cranky holdouts from the 1989 fax glory days, or the true believers of the Radio Free Europe Revolution, then today&apos;s cyber-utopians need to log off their Facebook accounts and try a little harder.", "title": "Facebook and Twitter are just places revolutionaries go | Evgeny Morozov", "sentences": ["There were many more events like this \u2013 not just in Cairo, but also in Beirut and Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-07T15:31:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/mar/09/france-meals-sas-knitwear-rich", "tags": [], "article": "If the French are worried that &quot;pork and wine&quot; meals might be confrontational (Outlawed on the street, in shops, at banks, in theatres ...

There are already widespread concerns about China&apos;s booming property market and the threat it poses to the country&apos;s expanding economy. China would spend nearly $200bn (\u00a3123bn) on an affordable homes and social housing scheme, said deputy housing minister Qi Ji in Beijing . The pledge came a few days after premier Wen Jiabao promised to &quot;resolutely&quot; curb speculation to tackle excessively rapid price increases. The authorities have taken various steps since spring last year to dampen the property market. These include raising interest rates, increasing the minimum downpayment required on second homes and restricting the rights of foreigners to buy property. Two Chinese cities are now imposing sales tax on property deals. While the measures have slowed growth, many fear it remains too high. In March 2010, urban housing prices shot up by 11.7% year-on-year, according to figures from the national bureau of statistics. December saw the lowest increase in more than a year, but it still stood at 6.4%. Economists are watching for the latest data anxiously: independent research from SouFun suggested a month-on-month increase of around 1% in January: the biggest such increase for half a year. Bears on the financial markets have long warned that China is in the grip of a property bubble, predicting that when it bursts it could knock the economy off course \u2013 and in doing so hamper the global recovery. More than a year ago, hedge fund king Jim Chanos described the sector as &quot;Dubai times 1,000 \u2013 or worse&quot;. Though few see it in quite such apocalyptic terms, many echo his concern. Others suggest that despite serious structural issues the situation is controllable, pointing to Beijing&apos;s careful monitoring of the situation. &quot;It won&apos;t be easy for prices to fall in the near future, but the bubble will break eventually,&quot; said Yi Xianrong, a real estate researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS). &quot;If it is broken gradually, through the government&apos;s efforts, it won&apos;t bring much harm; if it explodes all of a sudden, it will bring financial and social crisis.&quot; Duncan Innes-Ker of the Economist Intelligence Unit added: &quot;The size of the market means that the world needs to be paying attention because what happens in the Chinese property market affects everything from steel outputs in Brazil to iron ore exports from Australia.&quot; He said his biggest concern was the gap between construction and sales that had emerged in the last year, as the government stimulus package kicked in. He added: &quot;Negative [real] deposit interest rates are stoking demand. There is clearly a lot of money flowing round the Chinese economy searching for a purpose, and housing is traditionally regarded as a safe haven in times of uncertainty.&quot; But he warned that like any speculative market it could be highly volatile. Authorities do not want investors to lose their shirts; at the same time, they are seeking to ensure that the less well-off can get a foot on the ladder. Rosealea Yao, principal analyst at Beijing-based Gavekal Dragonomics, suggested the cost of housing was now a bigger concern for many people than rising food prices. &quot;About 70 million people in the emerging middle class find themselves without hope of affording a decent house after more than 10 years of hard work,&quot; she said. Although speculation has pushed up prices, there are also underlying issues. As China urbanizses, around 15 million people are moving into the cities each year. Existing homes also need to be replaced; last year Qiu Baoxing, deputy minister of construction, said that most buildings had a lifespan of only 25 to 30 years. And incomes have risen steadily. IMF research published in December suggested that prices were broadly in line with underlying fundamentals. But it said there were signs of overvaluation in the mass market in several coastal cities, particularly Shanghai and Shenzhen, and in the luxury sector in Beijing and Nanjing. It also argued that house price corrections in China appeared to be relatively rapid, particularly when compared to -, say, - the US before 2008. Price increases appear to be spilling over, however; according to the National Bureau of Statistics, January&apos;s price rises were greater in second and third tier cities than the first tier locations, in relative terms. While housing prices in Beijing rose 6.8% year-on-year, AP reported that the southern city of Haikou saw a 21.6% rise and central Ganzhou saw a 12.3% rise. Most experts believe that many in China will have to put aside aspirations to home ownership. The government has said it will increase rental accommodation, Yao pointed out. Innes-Ker believes that predictions of doom in the housing market are over-egged: &quot;When push comes to shove, the government has the power to arrest any fall and I think it would take the action necessary to do so,&quot; he said. But others stress the weaknesses in Beijing&apos;s response to the housing issue to date. Yi of CASS said that restrictions on purchases were ineffective \u2013 there have even been reports of couples divorcing or faking divorce so they can buy extra properties \u2013 and that while the government had reined in credit, it had failed to use taxation as a tool. Chongqing and Shanghai have announced new sales taxes on properties, to much fanfare. But they apply to only a fraction of buyers and Yi pointed out that they are set at well below 0.5% \u2013 while Hong Kong has a property tax of 5%.", "title": "China attempts to deflate its unstable property bubble", "sentences": ["More than a year ago, hedge fund king Jim Chanos described the sector as &quot;Dubai times 1,000 \u2013 or worse&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-09T19:24:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/09/prince-andrew-foreign-trips-support", "tags": ["Prince Andrew", "UK news", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Politics"], "article": "The Duke of York is not alone in deciding it is a good thing to glad-hand foreign dictators, sheikhs and princes on behalf of British companies. His official trips abroad as a UK trade envoy are planned and sanctioned by powerful figures from the British establishment. Prince Andrew&apos;s programme of overseas visits \u2013 in which he travelled to Davos, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Dubai and China last year \u2013 is determined by the Foreign Office and UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI), the government&apos;s export promotion arm, and approved by the royal visits committee. This cabinet committee meets every six months and is chaired by Simon Fraser, the permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, and includes the private secretaries to the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York, a representative from 10 Downing Street, the chief executive of UKTI and the director of protocol at the Foreign Office. When a trade visit is approved by this committee it is, in effect, backed by the government at the highest level. Prince Andrew also has regular contact with British ambassadors and senior mandarins. Only last week, after calls for his resignation from the role of UK trade envoy over his friendship with the American billionaire and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, he was briefed at the Cabinet Office and held talks with Jon Cunliffe, David Cameron&apos;s adviser on international economic affairs and Europe. Cameron and George Osborne, the chancellor, have offered the prince their full support this week. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said the ideas for places to visit came from a wide range of sources, including &quot;the government, lords lieutenant [the Queen&apos;s representatives in the counties], direct from business, and ideas generated in the office as follow-up to the duke&apos;s activities \u2013 for example, visiting significant inward investors in the UK from key markets&quot;. All requests are reviewed in the Duke of York&apos;s quarterly programme planning meeting, which takes place every three months. In some cases, the duke acts on his own behalf, still as the government&apos;s special representative for international trade and investment, but not at the behest of UKTI or the Foreign Office. It is sometimes a subtle difference, but in recent days it has allowed the government to distance itself from some of his more controversial activities. One such case was his decision to invite Sakher el-Materi, a son-in-law of the deposed Tunisian dictator, to lunch at Buckingham Palace in October. Materi, a businessman, has since fled Tunisia and is under investigation for money laundering. The duke had recently been to Tunisia, and Buckingham Palace said this had prompted the idea of hosting Materi. UKTI then offered a list of possible attenders from major UK-based firms. When confronted with the allegations now ranged against Materi following the January revolution in Tunisia, a spokesman for UKTI was able to say the lunch was not a UKTI event. Neither is it simple who funds the prince. The cost of a two-day trip to Saudi Arabia in September, still in his role as the government&apos;s trade ambassador, was not financed by UKTI, with accommodation provided by the duke&apos;s Saudi hosts. UKTI only paid \u00a3400 in communication costs. However, his charter flight from Farnborough to Jeddah and back was billed to the taxpayer at \u00a328,767, paid out of the royal travel grant. The blurring of the finance for the trip led to concerns that his Saudi hosts may have expected something in return for their hospitality, and that could have jeopardised his independence, although this was strongly denied by a spokesman for the duke. In other cases he makes private trips abroad. For example, he made three trips to Azerbaijan \u2013 in 2008, 2009 and 2010 \u2013 that were not sponsored by the government, and at least one private trip to Kazakhstan, where he has also made numerous trade visits sponsored by the UK government. This has further blurred the boundary between the duke&apos;s personal interests and his public role as trade ambassador. The palace has always strenuously denied that there is any overlap or conflict of interest. Prince&apos;s back officeExperts behind the scenes The back-office support Prince Andrew receives for his UK trade promotion duties includes experts seconded from both the private and public sector. Several are from influential financial and management consultancy firms. Their salaries are understood to be paid by their companies; the cost does not fall on the royal household. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: &quot;Currently, there is one secondee from KPMG [the auditing and tax advisory business], one from the military as equerry and, until recently, one from LEK [a global strategy consulting firm].&quot; The latter adviser, who left in the past two weeks, was Amit Patel, a former surgeon who is understood to have returned to LEK. He was styled as a &quot;special adviser to HRH the Duke of York&quot;. Prince Andrew has met LEK officials recently. &quot;The Duke has known LEK as a major UK advisory firm for some time,&quot; the palace spokesman said. &quot;HRH visited LEK to understand more about their business. As a follow-up to that visit, LEK attended a meeting at Buckingham Palace to discuss ideas to enhance future visit programmes,&quot; the palace spokesman said. &quot;It is important to note that LEK do not get preferential treatment in any of the duke&apos;s activities.&quot; Owen Bowcott", "title": "Prince Andrew's foreign trips as UK trade envoy supported at top level", "sentences": ["Prince Andrew&apos;s programme of overseas visits \u2013 in which he travelled to Davos, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Dubai and China last year \u2013 is determined by the Foreign Office and UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI), the government&apos;s export promotion arm, and approved by the royal visits committee."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-09T21:17:53Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/mar/10/opinion-poll-dubai-carnival-godolphin", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Meydan hosts the final Carnival meeting of the season on Thursday and it offers a last chance for horses on the brink of a World Cup night run to sneak into the fields for 26 March.

Several bring winning form into the race, with Navajo Chief, whose trainer, Alan Jarvis, won this in 2008 with Wise Dennis, fancied to go well again. However, preference is for Marco Botti&apos;s Fanualter (5.45), who was an eye-catching second over nine furlongs last time and will be better suited returned to a mile. Perennial bridesmaid Kavango will also be suited by a drop in trip and can go close, as can Ed Dunlop&apos;s Fareer. A tough bunch of stayers line up in the Group Three DRC Gold Cup, over two miles, which has gone to Godolphin in both of its previous runnings. Last year&apos;s winner Sabotage is back again but has been overlooked by Frankie Dettori in favour of Whispering Gallery, who beat the reopposing Opinion Poll (4.30) by a neck over one mile four on his latest outing. Ahmed Ajtebi&apos;s mount, an unlucky second behind Claremont since, has a little more class than his stablemates and can reverse those placings this time. Mikhail Glinka, another proven over this trip, can also make the frame in an open contest.

The now Saudi Arabia-based filly Electric Waves is also respected after an excellent run last time over much further than this. Godolphin field a strong team throughout and they can take the 11-furlong Tapeta handicap with the progressive Emirates Champion (3.15). Penalised six pounds for a comfortable course-and-distance success last time, he does not look badly treated and can get the better of the consistent Mr Brock, who is dropped in grade after an excellent run in Group Two company last week.

It&apos;s signed with a lipsticky kiss, and a handwritten dedication &quot;to all my friends on the wassisname&quot;. Last Friday, Greig was being interviewed by one of them. &quot;Once most female actors hit their 40s, the parts start to dry up,&quot; noted Emine Saner. &quot;Yet Greig, 44, seems to be busier than ever. She has just finished starring in Episodes on BBC2 and is currently in the new comedy Friday Night Dinner.

Oh, very ouch.&quot; \u2712 On Monday Sarfraz Manzoor talked to a less-loved figure. &quot;We think we know Jim Davidson,&quot; Sarfraz wrote, &quot;the south London, Page 3 girl-dating, Thatcher-loving, Our Boys-supporting, gay-baiting, hard-drinking, racist standup comedian. In the 80s, his routine was infamous for his depictions of the character Chalky \u2013 a slow-witted and stereotypical black character with a weed habit and Jamaican accent.&quot; Now, however, Davidson has written a play about a bigoted comedian, and seems to be examining his conscience. &quot;It&apos;s clear that Davidson has regrets about his past,&quot; Sarfraz reported. At theguardian.com/g2, parse was unwilling to extend the benefit of the doubt: &quot;Davidson cannot and will not be forgiven or rehabilitated for his brainless, unamusing and self-enriching racism.&quot; On Twitter, @joemuggs reckoned the comedian had been given &quot;a REALLY easy ride&quot;. megra thought there was &quot;still a way to go on the road to Damascus. Let&apos;s hope he&apos;ll write another confessional play about vicious misogyny.&quot; CordwainerBird, however, was moderately impressed. &quot;An actor friend of mine once remarked that there were two kinds of people. Those who think Jim Davidson is a complete c***, and those who haven&apos;t met him yet. But to be fair to the bloke, he could have come back to the UK [from Dubai] and earned a living doing exactly the same act. He sounds like he&apos;s done some growing up, so I&apos;m willing to give him a chance.&quot; \u2712Tuesday, of course, was International Women&apos;s Day (with a side order of pancakes for Shrove Tuesday). G2 celebrated with a list of 100 inspirational women, ranging from Aung San Suu Kyi to Jane Goodall, via Martha Lane Fox, Oprah Winfrey and Lady Gaga. &quot;We wanted to focus on role models from all over the world and from all walks of life,&quot; explained women&apos;s editor Jane Martinson. &quot;The women on this list have largely achieved astonishing feats in their own right, but most have also in some way, we hope, helped their fellow women. As Madeleine Albright said: &apos;There&apos;s a special place in hell for women who don&apos;t help other women.&apos;&quot; On the website, quite a few of you objected to the inclusion of one woman in particular. &quot;Oh please,&quot; pleaded zetkin. &quot;Margaret bloody Thatcher as inspirational? Is this for real?&quot; Howardthefascist suggested she belonged on a &quot;list of 100 ogres&quot;. riggas, however, thought they should all grow up. &quot;I can&apos;t stand her party, her politics or most of the policies she implemented, but I can still see her as an inspirational figure who shows that women can get to the very top.&quot; MisterMulder also had a good word for her: &quot;I guess Thatcher inspires people not to be evil. A bit like Satan. But with more evil.&quot; \u2712 And she&apos;s probably got impeccable table manners, unlike Sienna Miller. On Wednesday Andrew Dickson had to dodge soy sauce as he shared a meal with the actor. &quot;I&apos;m grateful it&apos;s just sauce,&quot; Andrew wrote. &quot;Miller once chucked urine at journalists who were hounding her. And although today she&apos;s on her politest behaviour, there is a goofy, fidgety energy about her, a curious combination of steely and shy.&quot; In 2008, he reminded us, &quot;Miller won a case against a photographer who had snapped her doing a nude scene on set, then achieved a legislation-changing victory against a paparazzi agency. Last year, she became one of the first people to take legal action against News International, accusing journalists of hacking into her mobile phone . . . &quot;Not only did Miller take the fight to the paparazzi, she turned the tables. She grins. &apos;I was secretly filming [them] on cameras that looked like lighters, all covert and exciting. It was funny, gathering evidence.&apos;&quot; The girl done good, was JohnRennie&apos;s verdict. &quot;I know f*** all about acting but it appears that this was the first person, after our marvellous royalty of course, that took on a real monster, Murdoch. We are all in her debt.&quot; But HalfEmptyAndHalfFull thought she might have got a little carried away. &quot;It was the Wednesday before things get into full swing at Glasto a few years back. I sat down to eat my frozen yoghurt while watching a mildly amusing punk folk band. I noticed I was sitting next to an attractive blonde wearing some elaborately decorated wellies. Next thing I know, out of the corner of my eye, I realise she is rather blatantly photographing me with her mobile phone. As I moved on I heard muttering in the crowd that the young lady in question was none other than SM. Since then I had wondered if, perhaps, she fancied me or something . . .

I like them for letting that news filter out in the slipstream of the bigger royal wedding. When Mother Teresa died in 1997, a friend of mine&apos;s mother (a staunch Catholic) said, &quot;How typical of her, to die the week after Princess Diana. So humble, to do it when everyone&apos;s attention is elsewhere.&quot; I laughed; I&apos;m not quite superstitious enough to believe that Mother Teresa was able to time her death so as not to hog the headlines. But Phillips and Tindall really could choose a wedding date, and they&apos;ve gone for one that hides sweetly behind two other big royal unions: the future king&apos;s marriage to a commoner, and Prince Andrew&apos;s love affair with a series of dodgy international businessmen. Photos of Randy Andy in bed with shady Kazakhs and wealthy sex offenders were sure to push Mike and Zara&apos;s news to the back of the paper. The couple must have wanted a low profile, to announce it now. And just to make sure the whole thing remains quiet, sober and free from controversy of any kind, they&apos;re having a rugby player as best man. Seriously, though, the fact that they chose their wedding date so quickly that Canongate Kirk was already booked, and they were only able to have it because another couple volunteered to move, shows that the discreet timing is deliberate. We like them for that, don&apos;t we? It&apos;s not secretive, like hooking up with a teenager in a billionaire&apos;s private &quot;massage wing&quot;, it&apos;s just pleasantly and unfashionably non-attention-seeking. I bumped into Zara Phillips once, in the kitchen of a Cardiff TV studio where Mike Tindall was playing poker. Zara, who had come to watch, asked very shyly if she might make herself a cheese sandwich. So the modesty rings true for me; I will like her forever, after that. I know, I know, it&apos;s sycophantic to admire a royal just for being normal. But in this context, it wasn&apos;t normal. Poker players being what they are, the place was full of men complaining about their hotel rooms, demanding that steaks be brought for them from local restaurants, turning up late and keeping everybody waiting. You&apos;d think it was a gathering of the Dubai royal family, not a bunch of shifty card-sharps with borrowed cash. Zara Phillips was the only person in the building prepared to show any deference at all, to anybody. Put out the welcome mat I&apos;m surprised they are having the wedding in Scotland, though. The Queen is the head of the Church of England, I thought all her family had to get married in it? Turns out Her Majesty worships at Canongate Kirk all the time. Perhaps she enjoys not being the boss. Going to a Church of England service, she must feel like Stelios flying easyJet. Relaxing in the Church of Scotland, the Queen can think: &quot;The seats are cramped and they fleece you on the drinks, but so what? Not my problem.&quot; (Is that what happens in church? I don&apos;t go very often.) If Zara&apos;s wedding venue is a snub to the Church of England, fair enough \u2013 it is being idiotic at the moment. All this nonsense about refusing gay weddings. Regular readers might remember that I&apos;m a big fan of the Archbishop of Canterbury, but I do wish he&apos;d have the confidence to lead his church in a warm, welcoming and inclusive direction, as Christianity is meant to be, and risk a smaller flock in the short term to become a better, stronger place in the future. They&apos;re too scared of those evangelical Africans. It doesn&apos;t seem very Jesus-like, pandering to the loudest and angriest voices who shout for exclusion. While we&apos;re talking about humility, the Church of England might do well to remember its roots. Terribly strict about who may and may not get married, eh, Church? Can&apos;t change the rules? Got to stick with tradition? Perhaps they have forgotten why the institution was set up in the first place. Flexibility was the founding principle. If Henry VIII had happened to be gay, rather than adulterous, it would be only same-sex couples who got married there. Smokescreens don&apos;t work With nothing more important to think about, the government is busy arguing for plainly-packaged cigarettes. I thought fags couldn&apos;t get any more appealing \u2013 what with their seductive ability to kill me, one smouldering tube at a time \u2013 but a wordless, steel-grey, Communist-chic box would certainly do it. Do our leaders understand nothing about design? Plain is cool. Simple is beautiful. Subtle is classy. If they had only insisted on such pared-back aesthetics for the Olympic logo, we might not have spent \u00a3400,000 on something that looks like a clown has vomited on a topiary experiment after too much blancmange. (Having said that, I much prefer the logo now Iran says it spells &quot;Zion&quot;; I love a secret code.) The idea is that hiding cigarettes in plain boxes, then hiding the boxes under the counter, will stop children wanting them. That is an excellent idea. Unless you&apos;ve ever actually met any children. Yes, but... I was interested to read about a new book which tells the story of Irene Brann, a Jewish refugee who was saved from the gallows by George VI. But is it just me, or is there something strange about this snippet from a newspaper review of the story? &quot;Irene emigrated to Australia after the war, where she lived in New South Wales. She married a Swiss national, Adolf Schleiss, in 1955. They changed their surname to Tell, because they didn&apos;t like to be reminded of Germany.&quot; www.victoriacoren.com", "title": "Zara: A big cheese with a small ego | Victoria Coren", "sentences": ["You&apos;d think it was a gathering of the Dubai royal family, not a bunch of shifty card-sharps with borrowed cash."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-13T00:04:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/13/catherine-bennett-kate-middleton", "tags": ["Royal wedding", "UK news"], "article": "To put it mildly, the career of Gary Goldsmith, the uncle of Kate Middleton, has had its ups and downs, leading to fears that the presence of Uncle Gary \u2013 Gary! \u2013 would cast a distinctly rough and common-looking shadow over the royal wedding. Could the tattooed proprietor of La Maison de Bang Bang, Mr Goldsmith&apos;s home in Ibiza, be trusted, for instance, to mingle responsibly with guests including the Sultans of Bahrain and Oman? Would he undo all the good work of The King&apos;s Speech? As if the commoner Middletons were not worrying enough to royal scholars such as James Whitaker, there had to be a risk that Goldsmith, a property developer, might, with his record of upstart hedonism actively contaminate an occasion featuring a King of Saudi Arabia, their Tonganese highnesses and the hardly less eminent royal broadcaster, ITN&apos;s Tom Bradby. Goldsmith&apos;s failings were not, like the Middletons&apos; table manners, a matter for nervous conjecture, they had been recorded on tape by the News of the World&apos;s fake sheikh, posing on that occasion as a businessman. Goldsmith had vouchsafed, for example, that his first words to Prince William when the latter came to stay in the Bang Bang, were: &quot;Oi, you fucker, did you break my glass pyramids?&quot; (Mr Goldsmith collects glass pyramids.) In mitigation, Goldsmith was hospitable to a fault. He had, as an internet search will speedily reveal, offered the reporters cocaine and the number of a dependable pimp, a specialist in \u00a3600-a-night Brazilians. Hence, interested foreign journalists have been calling him things like &quot;le mouton noir&quot; or &quot;l&apos;oncle trash&quot;. As it is, following various acts of contrition, Kate Middleton&apos;s uncle, her mother&apos;s brother, will after all be invited to every part of the celebrations, along with all her fiance&apos;s uncles, Prince Edward, Viscount Althorp and, at the time of writing, Prince Andrew, that boon companion to eastern European tyrants and, when in America, the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged procuress Ghislaine Maxwell. Risky, perhaps, but at least it will be someone for Prince Andrew to talk to and vice versa. Although there is no suggestion that Prince Andrew has ever shown any interest in using prostitutes he is evidently happy to mix with men and women who do so. Moreover, having sold his former home for \u00a33m more than its asking price, he might appreciate Goldsmith&apos;s professional knowledge of the property market. And yet Mr Goldsmith must be wondering, their legendary rudeness aside, does he really want to mix in this company? True, William appears to be a thoroughly blanc mouton and has overcome dreadful setbacks, but what can you say about his relations? Goldsmith is rich. What if a royal attempts to touch him for a free holiday in Ibiza, or even a loan? It happened with Epstein, who paid \u00a315,000 towards Sarah Ferguson&apos;s debts. Present at this wedding will be at least two of the Windsors&apos; financial incompetents, currently known to include: William&apos;s aunt-in-law, Sophie Rhys-Jones, whose RJ-H PR company left debts of \u00a31.7m; another aunt-in-law, Sarah Ferguson, whose creditors have subsidised her \u00a35m losses; lastly, William&apos;s uncle, the Earl of Wessex, whose investors were left with nothing when his film company, Ardent, went into voluntary liquidation, with assets of \u00a340. Then there is the question of Mazher Mahmood, a person Goldsmith might want to forget. How can he when Kate&apos;s new family again features three of the fake sheikh&apos;s celebrated victims: Sophie Rhys-Jones, Sarah Ferguson and, in 2005, Princess Michael of Kent, who confided when Mahmood posed as a potential buyer for her house, that Charles had, in William&apos;s mother, married &quot;a womb&quot;. If Mahmood bought, she told him, by way of an inducement, she would open a supermarket in Dubai for \u00a325,000. Goldsmith&apos;s misgivings must be as nothing, however, compared with those of the Middletons. Yes, Kate is 28 and must think for herself, but it is only normal that decent parents like this, strangers to both bankruptcy and dependency, would wonder until the last minute if there is a way to stop their personable, carefully educated daughter marrying into a family where everyone, including the older males, relies on handouts from an elderly matriarch or the state. Hardly surprising, given their lifetime of dependency, that so many of William&apos;s relations have become resentful, infantilised, irresponsible. Not just Andrew \u2013 one thinks, in particular, of Princess Anne, repeatedly convicted for speeding, and once for owning a dangerous dog, Dotty, which having been acquitted in court of canine &quot;malice&quot; after biting two children, went on to kill one of her mother&apos;s corgis. That William&apos;s father does not so far as we know have any similar previous, cannot be much comfort to the Middletons as they contemplate their big fat Windsor wedding. Prince Charles&apos;s alternative thinking is harmless enough, until she falls ill, and no doubt William will prove a more reliable husband: a passion for Saudi Arabian royalty is less easily ignored. We can only speculate on the reasons why British royals are so dazzled by princes from despotic, corrupt, viciously misogynistic Arab states in which the routine torture, public executions and repression equal anything witnessed in the English middle ages, but the family weakness has certainly made life easier for Mazher Mahmood. For Kate, on the other hand, these tyrants will become cherished family friends, as they already are for her mentor and Diana&apos;s nemesis: Camilla. Factor in the Windsor family&apos;s divorce rate, its binge-drinking princesses, racist grandad and trashy oncles, and the only comfort for the Middletons is that this parasitic, feckless, ferociously right-wing family from hell, emblematic of so much that is amiss with Broken Britain, is not actually moving in next door. But that is only half of William&apos;s genetic inheritance. Possibly his non-royal uncle, Viscount Althorp&apos;s company will prove more congenial to a family such as Kate Middleton&apos;s, whose fortunes \u2013 as the doors-to-manual joke at least concedes \u2013 are all their own work? It was Charles Spencer who pledged as Diana&apos;s &quot;blood family&quot; to let William and Harry&apos;s souls &quot;sing openly&quot;. It still remains to be seen whether they will rival his own, uninhibited example, featuring two marriages followed by two engagements, the second still scheduled for consummation in June. On the other hand, Spencer has no known connection with any dictators or sex offenders, is no longer friends with the convicted robber, Darius Guppy, and is thought once to have worked for a living, making him very nearly respectable. In any case, like King Lear, they have left a daughter. Simply because Kate has been led astray, like so many nice girls before her, does not mean that Pippa will go the same way. But they might, to be on the safe side, want to send her somewhere tyrant-free, such as Uncle Gary&apos;s Maison de Bang Bang.", "title": "Look what you're marrying into, Kate | Catherine Bennett", "sentences": ["If Mahmood bought, she told him, by way of an inducement, she would open a supermarket in Dubai for \u00a325,000."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-13T00:09:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/15/algeria-arab-and-middle-east-protests", "tags": ["Algeria", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Africa"], "article": "Nobody was particularly surprised when Algeria&apos;s state-operated radio channel announced that court clerks, who had been on strike for the previous month, had been awarded a 110% pay rise.

New rules requiring payment by cheque of sums exceeding $7,000 have been dropped. After a week of violent clashes between youths and police in January, relative calm has been restored. The price of staple foodstuffs is down and business is picking up. People in Algiers seem more inclined to go shopping than take part in a protest. For the best deals, shoppers head for a new market in the Bab Ezzouar quarter known as Dubai, due to the source of many of the goods. Here the &quot;trabendo&quot; vendors (from the Spanish contrabendo) rule the roost.

Many come from poor areas of the country and spend the night in hostels. Sidna hammam, one of the city&apos;s oldest Moorish baths, puts up a dozen men for $1.50 a night. Some operate on a very small scale, turning over about $400 a month, but for some it leads to better things.

Become famous for something completely unrelated to travel You don&apos;t need to be an experienced travel presenter to present a travelogue. Or a presenter. You don&apos;t even need to particularly enjoy travelling, for that matter. Here, more or less, is how the modern travelogue commissioning process works: one bag contains the names of people off the telly (Griff Rhys Jones, Piers Morgan, Robbie Coltrane, Joanna Lumley, Caroline Quentin, Martin Clunes), and another contains some locations (Dubai, India, the B roads of the United Kingdom, Guernsey, all of Africa as seen from a hot air balloon). Then they get drawn together, FA Cup-style. Have a clear reason for making the travelogue Covering the battle of Anzio for the British army&apos;s Film and Photo Unit instilled in Alan Whicker a deep love of capturing the world on camera. It was this love that prompted him to become an international reporter for BBC&apos;s Tonight, which in turn spurred him on to make a beloved travel-based documentary series of his own. Meanwhile, in the first episode of Channel 5&apos;s recent travelogue Turning Japanese, Justin Lee Collins unveiled a different, but no less worthwhile, motivation: &quot;I&apos;m not particularly well-travelled, I&apos;ve never really been outside of my comfort zone ... I don&apos;t like robots&quot;. Which is basically the same thing if you think about it. Please don&apos;t think about it. Where possible, link travel with food  If you want to see a country, look at its food. This is why so many travelogues shine a light on the cuisines of far-flung lands. And, if you&apos;re after a food-based travelogue, it&apos;s important to find your niche. There are presenters who&apos;ll eat anything, such as Anthony Bourdain. There are presenters who&apos;ll drink anything, such as James May and Oz Clarke. There are presenters who&apos;ll eat everything, such as Adam Richman from the brilliant Man v Food. However, there has never been a presenter who goes abroad, only ever orders chips regardless of location and still somehow manages to contract an explosive form of food poisoning that rears up at spectacularly inopportune moments. Commissioning editors, call me. Develop advanced condescension skills A great deal of your travelogue will be taken up by your interaction with real locals, and your experiences with a culture that you might not be familiar with. And, while it&apos;s important not to directly judge them, you are allowed to be a bit condescending. Just like Caroline Quentin during her travelogue A Passage Through India, really \u2013 especially the moment when she meets a housewife who has to cook for 10 people every day much to Quentin&apos;s obvious dismay. And the moment when a local tells her that the Ganges river has antiseptic properties. And, oh, pretty much everything else she does. Go native If you want to fully immerse yourself in a different culture, like Bruce Parry, then you have to follow a different set of conventions. First you must throw yourself into any gruesome initiation ceremony that your host tribe requests of you, even if it does look like it&apos;s been cooked up to make you look like a fool. And second, always end your travelogue with a shot of a tribeswoman saying how handsome you are. It doesn&apos;t matter if she doesn&apos;t actually say you&apos;re handsome because she&apos;s saying it in a language that hardly anyone speaks, so you can just subtitle whatever you like.

The lineup: Ben Bruce (guitar), Danny Worsnop (vocals), Cameron Liddell (guitar), Sam Bettley (bass), James Cassells (drums).  The background: We wanted to write about Asking Alexandria today because they were, as of this morning anyway, the fourth most popular band at South By South West, behind the Strokes, Ellie Goulding and Skrillex, in terms of artists getting attention and generating buzz online during the festival. We also wanted to write about them because we were left so dissatisfied by the last metal band to appear in this column, Francesqa, after we saw them bigged-up in Kerrang!, which we assumed was still the repository for all things unholy and awesome, only to discover that they were actually purveyors of tepid emo and grunge lite.  So we needed some extreme noise terror, and one quick blast of a random Asking Alexandria track called Alerion suggested we&apos;d found just that. The chugging guitars that can be traced back to Anthrax and Metallica were present and correct, as were the drums accelerating at roughly twice the speed of the bass, and the vocals that approximated the sound of Satan gargling with sulphur - the sort that can be traced back to ... well, we&apos;re not sure, we lost touch with developments in metal after an unfortunate on-the-road experience with Pantera (long story), but Phil Anselmo? The bloke from Sepultura? Him from Napalm Death? Still, this was the stuff. But wait. That track, Alerion - is that a rave keyboard break we hear before us? We believe it is. It turns out that Asking Alexandria - who formed, bizarrely, in Dubai before mainman Ben Bruce decamped to North Yorkshire where he assembled a whole new lineup but kept the name - like to incorporate elements of techno when the mood takes them. They&apos;ve even got an album coming out later this month, Stepped Up And Scratched, produced by Joey Sturgis, the Paul Epworth of extreme metal, that will feature electronic and dubstep remixes of tracks from their 2009 debut album, Stand Up And Scream. Think of it as the industrialtronic metalcore version of the Human League&apos;s Dare and Love And Dancing spin-off project.  While they&apos;re mixing up metal mores and club techniques, they also do this weird thing where they switch suddenly, often within the same song, not just between techno and rock, but between full-on assault-mode and a straighter, more MOR sound. Weirdest of all, Danny Worsnop is able to cut directly from fire-breathing to actual proper singing - see Breathless. It&apos;s like having Pantera, Panic At The Disco and Pendulum all in one neat package.  Some of their lyrics leave a lot to be desired: &quot;Girl get down/ It&apos;s almost over/ Take it all the way/ You stupid fucking whore&quot; from Not The American Average, to give but one example, suggests they need to get their sexual politics in order, and their boasts of conquests on the road in interviews are as juvenile as you might expect from a bunch of Casablancas-handsome twentysomethings. But for pretty boys, they sure can rock, and trance, and apparently, dubstep. Make that Pantera, Panic At The Disco, Pendulum and Pariah in one neat package.

Davis slipped out of Lahore on a special flight from the old city airport after being released from the sprawling jail where he had been held for almost 10 weeks amid a diplomatic storm that rocked relations between the two allies and sucked in President Barack Obama. A Pakistani official said the 36-year-old US spy was bound for an airbase in Afghanistan, then on to the US. Davis was freed under Islamic laws that allow a murderer to walk free on payment of compensation to the family of his victims. The acquittal took place during a closed hearing at Kot Lakhpat jail where no reporters were present. &quot;The court first indicted him, but the families later told the court that they have accepted the blood money and they have pardoned him,&quot; said Rana Sanaullah, the Punjab law minister. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, thanked the families for pardoning Davis and allowing the American to go. Speaking from Cairo, Clinton said the US had not paid to win Davis&apos;s release. The dramatic case has become an obsession in Pakistan since Davis, a bulky former special forces soldier, opened fire on two men at traffic lights on 27 January. Davis claimed he acted in self-defence against robbers, but prosecutors said he shot one in the back as he ran away. Several officials said the men he killed were linked to Pakistani intelligence. The deal to free Davis was an unusual mix of Islamic law and tense backroom negotiations between American and Pakistani spies and diplomats. Court documents detailed payments of almost $1.2m to the mother, widow and eight siblings of Faizan Haider, while relatives of the other dead man, Muhammad Faheem, received a similar amount. A senior Pakistani official said compensation was also paid to the family of a third man killed by a US rescue vehicle, presumed to be driven by CIA employees. It is believed the money was transferred by Pakistani authorities, pending reimbursement from the US, allowing Clinton to make her denial of payment on Wednesday. Washington also undertook to facilitate the future resettlement of family members in the US or a Gulf state such as Dubai, the official added. &quot;The Americans will be helpful to the families,&quot; he said. But the deal was also a defeat for US diplomacy, which had insisted Davis was a bona fide diplomat who enjoyed immunity from prosecution. In the early stage of the controversy, the US accused Pakistan of &quot;illegally detaining&quot; Davis, while Obama defended him as &quot;our diplomat&quot;. The carefully orchestrated legal events in Lahore belied weeks of negotiations between the CIA and Pakistan&apos;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which have been at barely concealed loggerheads over the incident. The legal manoeuvres were &quot;a fig leaf&quot;, one official admitted. The idea of a payment was first mooted between Pakistan&apos;s ambassador to the US, Husain Haqqani, and Senator John Kerry in February. But the arrangement first needed the co-operation of Pakistani intelligence, which seemed determined to press its advantage. Relations between the two spy agencies had been fragile for months. In December the CIA station chief had to leave Islamabad after being named in the press; ISI officials were angry that their chief, General Shuja Pasha, had been named in a New York lawsuit brought by victims of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. The ISI had been unaware of Davis&apos;s CIA role in Pakistan, where he was employed to protect operatives gathering information about groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, a militant Islamist group close to Pakistan&apos;s intelligence service and linked to terrorist attacks against India, and relations between the CIA and ISI were strained as a result. The CIA director, Leon Panetta, phoned the ISI chief, General Shuja Pasha, last month to try to smooth relations. Media leaks in the Pakistani press during the stop-start trial kept the pressure on the US, such as the publication last weekend of the names and passport details of other &quot;Raymonds&quot; \u2013 Americans suspected of entering Pakistan under false pretences \u2013 in a newspaper. The report quoted &quot;official sources&quot;. In return for Davis&apos;s release, the ISI has obtained an undertaking from the CIA about covert operations on their turf, the Pakistani official said. &quot;They will do nothing behind our backs that will result in people getting killed or arrested.&quot; There were other indications that a deal had been worked out. The US embassy press release welcoming Davis&apos;s release was initially dated March 10 \u2013 around the same time a deal was struck in Washington. Analysts also noted that General Pasha, who was due to retire this month, obtained an unusual one-year extension of tenure this week. Kerry, head of the Senate foreign affairs committee, who is often used as a go-between in difficult issues, is thought to have raised the issue of compensation with the Pakistan government on a visit to Islamabad on 16 February. Kerry&apos;s visit, devoted to securing Davis&apos;s release, was initially believed to have been a failure. But US officials have been working behind the scenes since then at trying to secure the deal. Kerry said: &quot;This was a very important and necessary step for both of our countries to be able to maintain our relationship and remain focused on progress on bedrock national interests, and I&apos;m deeply grateful for the Pakistani government&apos;s decision. &quot;We deeply regret the loss of life that led to this difficulty in our relationship and the demonstrations on Pakistan&apos;s streets, but neither country could afford for this tragedy to derail our vital relationship. We look forward to working with Pakistan to strengthen our relationship and confront our common challenges.&quot; The US state department released a statement by the US ambassador to Pakistan, Cameron Munter, who accompanied Davis on the flight from Pakistan to Afghanistan. Munter thanked the families of their victims for pardoning Davis. &quot;I am grateful for their generosity.&quot; He stressed that the US justice department has opened an investigation into the shooting in Lahore. He added: &quot;Most of all, I wish to reaffirm the importance that America places in its relationship with Pakistan, and the commitment of the American people to work with their Pakistani counterparts to move ahead in ways that will benefit us all.&quot; As night fell in Lahore, there was a small protest outside the US consulate where Davis claimed to work, led by demonstrators from the Jamaat-e-Islami, the country&apos;s main religious party. Further protests are expected after prayers on Friday. Meanwhile, the CIA continued drone strikes in the tribal belt, firing three missiles at a car in North Waziristan that reportedly killed five people.

It is an extremely hard thing to admit but I am enjoying the Cricket World Cup. I have until this year been a champion refusenik of the tournament, a money-grubby, on-dragging, mobile-phone-touting travesty that traditionally brings me out in a nasty case of apoplexy. People who made the mistake of asking me casually if I was watching it were likely to be blasted with a pent-up fury rivalled only in the pages of the Oresteia. Over the past decade the ICC has wasted so much of my life on various round-robins and Super Sixes that I have longed not only to invoice them for my time but to send a ruthless and well-armed team of debt-collecting operatives to their Dubai headquarters to enforce payment. I should make clear that my pleasure at this month&apos;s matches is in no way an endorsement of a tournament I still abjure. England&apos;s games aside, it is another embarrassment of one\u2011sided contests. A short fit of geekery with a calculator has revealed that, if England&apos;s results are taken out of the equation, the average group game has been won by 117 runs or, in the case of games won by wickets, with 15 and a half overs to spare. Fifteen and a half! That is almost a third of the innings. Talk about being short-changed. Anyway that is not the point. The point is, I am in a quandary because there is no doubt that England&apos;s campaign, more mercurial than a mouth full of fillings, has me hooked. And what is stranger, even than the fact that my Sky box has the highlights packages on series link, is the reason why. Because, yes, England&apos;s games have been fascinating, last-over thrillers with a mighty underdog narrative. And I bow to no Farrow and Ball enthusiast in my appreciation of a good finish. But only, generally, if my team win. There exist in this benevolent universe many good, generous-minded, emotionally balanced sport-watchers who can appreciate a marvellous game whatever the outcome. These are the people who nod approvingly when Mario Ancic knocks Andy Murray out of Wimbledon and explain that the better man deserved it on the day. They appreciate sport at a spiritual level, like an aesthete approaching a Bacchanalian orgy and wondering which angle will capture the light on the bare flesh best. My boss is one of these noble types, and his infuriatingly dispassionate approach to England&apos;s myriad sporting teams is one of our few points of major disagreement. He is too mature to get any joy from seeing us rout weak opposition, even if it is Australia in an Ashes Test. He will lament the lack of competition in a one-sided game (with the sole, bizarre exception of tennis \u2013 I believe he would rather see Roger Federer take out his opponent with a flamethrower than see him lose a set). I, on the other hand, am the type of mean-spirited, overcompetitive fan who would gleefully celebrate a win over a team of under-10s if it would secure my team a piece of silverware. When England&apos;s footballers, for instance, draw 0-0 with an unfancied team like Algeria at a World Cup, the commentators say: &quot;You can&apos;t begrudge them the result.&quot; This is empirically untrue. I do and have sulked for hours on such occasions. So the fact that I am enjoying the Cricket World Cup is doubly unsettling. When I found myself rooting for the Netherlands as they closed in on their unlikely target in Nagpur I put it down to hormones. But then came Ireland and, along with half the cricket\u2011playing\u00a0world, I found myself with an enormous crush on Kevin O&apos;Brien even as he put England to the sword. By the time the Bangladesh game was reaching its joyous conclusion I was desperate to join that melded ecstasy of Chittagongians, jumping in unison in the stands. Even more worryingly, this wave of empathy has started to spill over into other sporting arenas. Having rarely seen Italy&apos;s rugby union team as anything other than a guaranteed two points in the Six Nations Championship, I found myself passionately involved in Saturday&apos;s game and \u2013 stay with me here \u2013 not just because the French were losing. As the clock ticked down, I was screaming at the Italian forwards not to give away a penalty with the same desperate voice I normally save for Dylan Hartley and Louis Deacon. When the cameras picked up Martin Castrogiovanni clinging to Nick Mallett like a kid reunited with his dad in a weepy Christmas movie, I might even have sniffled. It was on Sunday, when I caught myself cheering Scotland&apos;s first score on the board, that I knew something had gone seriously wrong. Have I suffered identity theft? Or is this what growing up feels like? Perhaps it is a sign of a deeper peace: that, after a decade of angst-ridden sports-watching, three Ashes wins in the past six years have finally given me a base level of security, enough to allow me to extend some magnanimity to other teams. Without undergoing a long and expensive course of psychotherapy, I will probably never know. But I do wonder what this newfound love for the underdog will throw at me next.

They can still proceed in this tournament after defeating West Indies by 18 runs. It was another Houdini performance from England on their favourite Indian stage. At one point West Indies, needing 244 for victory, were 222 for six and on target to send all those watching and listening in Dhaka and Chittagong into delirium; an England defeat guaranteed Bangladesh a quarter-final place. Then West Indies contrived to lose four wickets for three runs in 20 balls and at last English cricketers could be seen beaming in the middle of a parched square. Andrew Strauss&apos;s team \u2013 and a few weeks ago no one could have possibly predicted the 10 he chose to take out with him for this game \u2013 may be flawed but they have spirit and they have bottle. It is a great asset in sport to revel in the tight finish, to relish those squeaky situations and this team does. It is just that they are evidently useless against weak teams. In this group neither India nor South Africa nor West Indies could best them but they were beaten by Ireland and Bangladesh. Now England, who head off to Delhi, must await the outcome of two Group B games. On Saturday Bangladesh have to beat South Africa in Dhaka to threaten England&apos;s quarter-final aspirations. Even if Bangladesh are victorious, England can still hope that India defeat West Indies here on Sunday, which would also guarantee qualification. Given how West Indies fell apart, India are deservedly strong favourites in that contest. The second half of this match was a wonderful advert for 50-over cricket, with the game fluctuating after almost every ball as West Indies sought the runs that would send England back to Heathrow on the first available flight. First there was Chris Gayle, smashing Tim Bresnan&apos;s second over for 18 runs, then doing the same to Chris Tremlett&apos;s first. In no time Gayle had 43 from 20 balls, whereupon England introduced their secret weapon. James Tredwell last played in Hobart on 21 January. Cunningly held back for almost two months, it was the unassuming Kent off-spinner who gave England their opening. The seamers had been butchered by Gayle so Tredwell joined Swann, who opened the bowling, in the attack in the seventh over and something odd happened: Gayle decided to play a forward defensive, he missed the ball and was given lbw by Bruce Oxenford. Gayle called for a review but merely became the umpteenth batsman to depart in this way in this tournament. Out came Darren Sammy, at sea against Tredwell one minute, flicking him for six over midwicket the next. The West Indies captain aped Gayle at the crease and almost inflicted terminal damage. Meanwhile Tredwell, the man of an extraordinary match, disposed of two more left-handers, Devon Smith and Darren Bravo, the latter brilliantly taken at slip by Strauss. Sammy cracked 41 from 29 balls before he was bowled off the inside edge by Ravi Bopara, who would prove to be England&apos;s most economical bowler. This was surreal. England&apos;s attack was being held together by the peripherals: Tredwell and Bopara with willing contributions from Luke Wright, all of whom justified the bold selection policy of the tour management. For a while there was a semblance of normality as Ramnaresh Sarwan and Kieron Pollard tried to restore the innings. But when Swann had Pollard lbw via a quicker ball England finally seemed to be in control of the match, with West Indies 150 for six. That was just an illusion. Yet again up popped an unheralded cricketer of spirit and surprising quality. In Bengaluru it was Kevin O&apos;Brien, in Dhaka Shafiul Islam. Here Andre Russell, a 22-year-old Jamaican who has sprinted against Usain Bolt, hit a fluent and unexpected 49 in a critical 72-run partnership with the imperturbable Sarwan. Russell appeared to be caught at long-on but Jonathan Trott fell backwards and just touched the boundary as he took the catch. Instead of a wicket Swann and England had to endure a six. Suddenly it was 222 for six and England were desperate. But their off-spinners came to the rescue. Tredwell trapped Russell, who was contemplating the single that would have made him the first half-centurion in the match. Then Swann, raw-nerved, grumpy but still fiercely competitive, intervened. Sarwan was taken at short-leg and Kemar Roach fell victim to a brilliant diving catch at mid-off by Tremlett. By now there was panic in the West Indies camp, epitomised by the hare-brained decision of Sulieman Benn to seek a second run to third man. There was Trott delivering an inch-perfect throw and England were victorious. It was another epic climax, especially after such a lacklustre first half. When England batted it felt like a contest between two very ordinary sides playing badly. Batsmen were out to wanton shots, bowlers donated wides and England were unable to use up all their overs. For West Indies the most obvious plus in a match dominated by hitherto anonymous cricketers was the performance of Devendra Bishoo from Guyana, who took three for 34 with his leg-breaks. However, any quibbles about the mediocrity of the afternoon cricket were soon dispelled, initially by Gayle, Sammy and Russell and then by a defiant England team, which has steadfastly resisted the temptations of that Dubai/Heathrow flight after five months on the road. England&apos;s form may be poor, key players may be shattered but any side that comes up against them in a quarter-final would be advised to take nothing for granted.", "title": "Graeme Swann helps keep England in World Cup with West Indies win", "sentences": ["However, any quibbles about the mediocrity of the afternoon cricket were soon dispelled, initially by Gayle, Sammy and Russell and then by a defiant England team, which has steadfastly resisted the temptations of that Dubai/Heathrow flight after five months on the road."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-17T18:07:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/19/aerotropolis-kasarda-lindsay-cities-review", "tags": ["Science and nature", "Future of cities", "Books", "Culture"], "article": "In his dystopian novel The Sleeper Awakes, begun in 1899, HG Wells portrayed a future world in which vast machine-like cities were linked by air travel. Since then, no vision of the urban future has been complete without ubiquitous air transport, from Fritz Lang&apos;s Metropolis (1926), in which gnat-like aircraft soar among the skyscrapers, to the police spinners of Ridley Scott&apos;s Blade Runner (1982). In 1997 JG Ballard predicted that &quot;the airport will be the true city of the 21st century&quot;. Now John Kasarda, an American management consultant and academic, is jetting around the world showing politicians and business leaders how Ballard&apos;s prediction is about to come true. This &quot;prophet of living our lives aloft&quot; has flown more than 3m miles in the last 25 years and has &quot;jet lag stamped on his face&quot;. Journalist Greg Lindsay, the author of this enthusiastic survey of Kasarda&apos;s ideas, is clearly a believer. As the subtitle proclaims, this is &quot;the way we&apos;ll live next&quot;. According to Kasarda, the future city will have &quot;an airport at the center and concentric rings of uses radiating outward&quot;. The aerotropolis is designed for the wired, always-on &quot;Instant Age&quot; of smart phones and smart cities, where the only law is the survival of the swiftest. Kasarda argues that this is the next stage in globalisation, a radical rethink of how we live in a world rendered flat by new technology. Just as cities such as Southampton or Singapore grew up around their seaports, so the airport will become the heart of tomorrow&apos;s city. Dubai is the model. It is &quot;the aerotropolis writ large, a city of hubs designed to lure the world&apos;s wealth to its door&quot;. And as in so many other areas, China has been quick to seize the initiative. It will build 100 new airports by 2020, when it aims to have 82% of its population living within 90 minutes&apos; drive of one. This investment will enable the iPods and other high-value goods manufactured there to travel via Hong Kong to America within 48 hours. In contrast, the west views airports as &quot;nuisances or toxic threats&quot;. Kasarda warns: &quot;If we don&apos;t change our minds, the game will be over. In some ways, we&apos;ve already surrendered.&quot; There is no doubt that transport \u2013 whether on four legs or four wheels \u2013 has shaped cities throughout history. But to be successful, cities have to offer so much more than docks or terminals. In a revealing phrase, Lindsay describes Kasarda&apos;s aerotropolis as &quot;an urban machine not for living but for competition&quot;. HG Wells would have feared for the people who lived in such a place. Kasarda&apos;s overblown rhetoric cries out to be challenged, something Lindsay fails to do. But in its account of the rapidly evolving nature of work \u2013 from high-tech Chinese factories to the computerised fulfilment centres springing up around runways across America \u2013 this pacey but over-long book is at once fascinating and chilling. Lindsay and Kasarda dismiss the idea that air travel should be curtailed due to concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change as fatal for economic growth. Similarly, fears about peak oil are countered by the prospect of synthetic fuels. If the oil really does stop flowing, then they believe electrification of cars will allow reserves to be prioritised for aircraft. This dramatic option is one that Laurence Smith also raises in his book, The New North (322pp, Profile, \u00a320). But Smith does not minimise the challenges facing our oil-addicted societies. He points out, for instance, that to meet the expected demand for oil in 2030 we would need to discover the equivalent of nine Saudi Arabias. A scientist at UCLA, Smith studies the geophysical impact of climate change, particularly in the far north. In this measured and thoughtful book, he examines what our planet will be like 40 years from now. By 2050, the world&apos;s population will have grown to 9.2 billion, of whom 6.4 billion will live in cities, &quot;forming crowded urban clots around the hot lower latitudes of our planet&quot;. China will be the world&apos;s largest economy, followed by the US and India. People will be wealthier and older \u2013 Japan will have 13 people of working age for every 10 retired people. In 40 years&apos; time global warming will have transformed the planet. Despite technological advances and a growing diversity of energy sources including renewables and nuclear, the world will still rely heavily on fossil fuels. China is currently building two coal-fired power stations a week, &quot;equivalent to adding the entire UK power grid every year&quot;. Shockingly, coal will become the world&apos;s primary energy resource, with demand tripling by 2050. Smith&apos;s headline conclusion is that, as global warming thaws the permafrost and frees the Arctic of sea ice, the &quot;New North&quot; will become increasingly important. Although the Arctic proper (north of the Arctic Circle) is very small, the New North \u2013 the land and ocean lying above the 45\u02da N latitude \u2013 is vast, comprising some 29% of the world&apos;s ice-free land. The Northern Rim countries \u2013 the northern US, Canada, Russia, Iceland, Greenland, Norway, Sweden and Finland \u2013 form a bloc of a quarter of a billion people with a $7tn economy. Their population and power are set to grow dramatically by 2050, Smith predicts. As global warming takes effect, rainfall will increase here while droughts create water-shortages in the south. Estimates suggest that 30% of the world&apos;s undiscovered natural gas and 13% of its oil lie in the shale-rich sedimentary rocks of the Arctic. Its rich natural resources might make it the next Middle East in terms of its potential for conflict. The high Arctic is destined to become an &quot;economic engine, shovelling gas, oil, minerals and fish into the gaping global maw&quot;. Although at times it labours under the weight of evidence, The New North is a more convincing portrayal of the future than Aerotropolis. But both books raise urgent questions about what kind of world we want to live in.", "title": "Aerotropolis: The Way We'll Live Next by John D Kasarda and Greg Lindsay \u2013 review", "sentences": ["Dubai is the model."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-19T00:05:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/20/said-done-fifa-sepp-tour", "tags": ["Fifa", "Sepp Blatter"], "article": "Tour news Headlining Sepp&apos;s pre-presidential-election tour of Fifa&apos;s Asian voters last week: some generous PR for Burma&apos;s FA head Zaw Zaw.

An eight-year-old with just two starts to his name over hurdles, he evidently hasn&apos;t stood much racing, but that could well mean that there is still improvement to come and even just a repeat of his recent Towcester success would be enough to see him home against ordinary rivals.

That&apos;d be fantastic.&quot; Nicholls is especially pleased with the way Denman has recovered from his exertions and suggested that an operation to cauterise his soft palate, which took place the week after his previous run in the Hennessy, had helped him to &quot;finish off his race better and get over it better&quot;. The 11-year-old was one of several Cheltenham runners paraded yesterday through Ditcheat, where Nicholls trains, and the trainer said: &quot;He looked awesome, he was jig-jogging and fresh. You&apos;d expect a race like that would get to the bottom of him.&quot; Though keen to run Denman once more this season, Nicholls described the Totesport Bowl at Aintree as being &quot;the only possible race&quot; for him between now and autumn. Denman took a heavy fall in that race two years ago but a clear round this time would give him a much better chance there than he would have at Punchestown, where he struggled to cope with the right-handed bends last April. Calls for the horse to be aimed at next year&apos;s Grand National are likely to be ignored. Nicholls said that both he and the horse&apos;s owner, Paul Barber, feel Denman would not be suited by &quot;those big fences&quot;. Kauto Star may very well turn up for Punchestown&apos;s Gold Cup, in which his stablemate flopped last year. Nicholls ticked off the reasons why it should suit Kauto Star: &quot;It&apos;s right-handed, it&apos;ll be good ground, it&apos;s six weeks [after the Cheltenham race]. A lot of horses will run elsewhere or be finished for the season. I would think he&apos;d be hard to beat.&quot; That description applies with even more force to Long Run, Nicholls was happy to concede. &quot;I think we&apos;ll all be watching his arse for a while,&quot; he said and hinted at doubts about whether his pair would oppose Long Run again in next year&apos;s Gold Cup, when both would be 12. &quot;Next year is a different year. We&apos;ll know in January a lot more about what&apos;s going for the Gold Cup. Those two would have to be at the top of their game to warrant that and I wouldn&apos;t like to speculate.&quot; Pressed to name a younger horse in his stable who might make up into a Gold Cup contender, Nicholls mentioned Michel Le Bon, sidelined by injury since a successful chasing debut in November 2009. &quot;Or perhaps Sam Winner in two years&apos; time.&quot; Sam Winner, a running-on fourth in Friday&apos;s Triumph Hurdle, will not run again this season and will be a novice chaser next term, as will Al Ferof, winner of the Supreme Novice Hurdle. But Nicholls will prepare Zarkandar, Big Buck&apos;s and Master Minded as part of his strong team for Aintree&apos;s Grand National meeting in the hope of fending off Nicky Henderson&apos;s challenge for the trainer&apos;s title. Henderson trails by \u00a3110,000 and conceded defeat in today&apos;s Racing Post but Nicholls believes his rival is privately determined to make a race of it. &quot;He&apos;s certainly got the team there this year.

Phil Smith, Britain&apos;s senior handicapper, has reassessed the horse, owned by Sir Alex Ferguson, in light of his running-on fourth in Friday&apos;s Gold Cup and now believes he is set to carry much less weight than his ability deserves. &quot;It will be a huge temptation for them to run him now,&quot; said Smith, who is required to compile the weights for the Aintree race in early February and cannot revise them in light of subsequent performances. &quot;I&apos;ve raised him to a mark of 171 but he can run off 156 in the National.&quot; That means What A Friend will carry 15lb less, relative to the other runners, than if Smith could redraw the weights today, a fact that will surely impress punters. The gelding is already being backed in response to the words of his trainer, Paul Nicholls, who said he was &quot;highly likely&quot; to run in the National if the ground was good. Yesterday, Nicholls added that Daryl Jacob would keep the ride in the National, having rallied What A Friend to finish just a nose behind Kauto Star on Friday. Paddy Power cut the horse&apos;s Grand National odds from 25-1 to 16-1, which is now the best available. Smith&apos;s new mark for the Gold Cup winner, Long Run, is 182, 3lb higher than the horse&apos;s previous rating. That matches the figure earned by Denman in winning the 2008 Gold Cup but is lower than the two subsequent winners, Kauto Star (186) and Imperial Commander (185) in a vintage era for the race. &quot;I don&apos;t see any reason why Long Run shouldn&apos;t still be improving at the age of six,&quot; Smith said. &quot;I&apos;m not totally sure where the opposition&apos;s coming from next year, because clearly Denman and Kauto Star can&apos;t be progressing.&quot; Connections are reportedly rethinking the idea of sending Long Run to race in France this spring and are more likely to consider the totesport Bowl at Aintree on 7 April.

In Cecil&apos;s absence, his big-race jockey Tom Queally was in charge of the preparations for Saturday&apos;s favourite on the Tapeta track at Meydan on Tuesday morning, when Twice Over enjoyed a canter in the early-morning sunshine. Last year Twice Over finished only 10th of the 14 runners in the big race, the combination of a wide draw and early bumping putting paid to his chances in a race run at a strangely slow early pace. However, 12 months on, Cecil opted to send the multiple Group One winner out a month earlier and a prep-race at the start of this month in the third round of the Maktoum Challenge could hardly have gone better as he easily accounted for Musir and Gitano Hernando, both of which may renew rivalries this weekend. &quot;The plan has come good so far in that we thought last year that the horses that had been in Dubai seemed to run better and so we took him over early and he did the job nicely in the Maktoum Challenge, to set him up really well for this, hopefully,&quot; said Teddy Grimthorpe, racing manager for the owner Prince Khalid Abdullah. &quot;He was probably in need of the run; he looked a little big, but we expected him to run very well because Henry said he was in good form and he looked in good form, coat-wise and physically. The way he travelled and handled everything was very pleasing. &quot;He never really got into a rhythm [last year] and he was always a bit wide and actually, in the end, I know he was 10th, but he was only beaten three and a bit lengths and, naturally, we were very disappointed at the time but maybe on reflection, given everything, maybe it wasn&apos;t such a bad run after all.&quot; Queally described it as &quot;a case of so far, so good&quot; this week. &quot;He is grand and is in good form,&quot; said the jockey. &quot;He just did a routine piece of work this morning and quickened down the straight. He seems happy in himself, which is the main thing. He was a good winner last time out and he quickened up well. He seems to have tightened up since then and we just need a bit of luck now. He will have a blow-out this Friday and that will get him to the race.&quot; Heading the opposition is Cape Blanco, the first runner in six years Aidan O&apos;Brien has sent to Dubai, a statistic widely seen as a deliberate snub to the meeting and part of the spat between the Coolmore and Maktoum breeding empires, even if Ballydoyle publicly insists that the meeting comes too early in the season.

The Israeli news media devote a lot of space to dramatic events in the region, but our self-centered political discourse remains the same. It cannot see beyond the recent escalation across the Gaza border, or the approaching possibility of a Palestinian declaration of statehood in September. Israel&apos;s leaders are missing the old order in the Arab world, sensing only trouble in the unfolding and perhaps inevitable change. Prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, defence minister Ehud Barak, and the opposition leader, Tzipi Livni, have all reacted to the Arab revolution by reciting long-held positions. Netanyahu has warned of an &quot;Iran next door&quot; scenario in Egypt, pledging to fence off Israel&apos;s peaceful borders with Egypt and Jordan. Asked by CNN&apos;s Piers Morgan if he was sad to see Hosni Mubarak go, Netanyahu admitted that he was. No serious political figure in Israel has reached out to the revolutionaries, celebrating their achievement or suggesting we need to know them better since they might share values and ambitions with secular, liberal Israelis. Barak, Israel&apos;s top strategic mind, was kind enough to tell Sky News last weekend that &quot;in the long run, the shakeup in the Arab world is a positive and promising phenomenon&quot;. But the long run is an accumulation of short runs, in which Barak warns of &quot;irresponsible popular opinion&quot;. And Livni, the peace process champion, published an article in the Washington Post calling for a western-imposed &quot;code for new democracies&quot;. There are obvious reasons for Israel&apos;s timidity towards the uprising in the Arab streets. Israel&apos;s foreign policy is focused on survival in an unfriendly neighbourhood, and favours the status quo. The collapsing dictatorships, residing on the same status quo, provided its necessary &quot;stability&quot;. In his earlier days Netanyahu preached for regional democracy as the cornerstone of peace, but from the PM&apos;s office he sees things differently, praising democracy in principle while warning of its perils in practice. &quot;Those leaderships,&quot; said Barak this month, &quot;as much as they were unaccepted by their peoples, they were very responsible on regional stability \u2026 They&apos;re much more comfortable [to us] than the peoples or the streets in the same countries.&quot; Following decades of &quot;cold peace&quot; with Egypt and Jordan, Israel&apos;s foreign policy establishment developed an instinctive fear of Arab public opinion. Mubarak was not always friendly, but he watched Israel&apos;s back when it fought wars on its eastern and northern fronts. Even adversaries like Syria&apos;s Assad regime have been predictable, and not prone to risky adventures. Dealing with open societies could be much more complicated than assessing an autocrat and his bunch of cronies. But there&apos;s a deeper motive underlying the Israeli attitude. They see their country as a western bastion, a modern democracy that is unfortunately surrounded by less developed nations. Reflecting this, Barak coined the phrase &quot;a villa in the jungle&quot; to describe Israel&apos;s regional stance; recently he updated it to &quot;an oasis fortress in the desert&quot;. Beyond eating hummus in local Arab restaurants, the wider Middle Eastern culture is largely shunned by Israeli Jewish society. Arabic is not mandatory in Israeli Hebrew schools, and those who bother to learn the neighbours&apos; language want to spend their military service in the intelligence corps. Otherwise Arabic is hardly a career-booster. Israelis are so arrogant and ignorant about their vicinity that whenever we make comparisons, the benchmarks are always the US, western Europe, or countries of the OECD. It&apos;s never Egypt, Syria, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority or even Dubai. The western self-perception affects political views, too. Mainstream support for the peace process saw it as a means of pleasing the west, rather than integrating in the east. Netanyahu and Barak treat the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a nuisance in Israel&apos;s relations with the US, not as a moral or legal issue that Israel needs to resolve on its merits. So much so that Netanyahu considers launching a new peace policy during a visit to Capitol Hill, rather than at home. This attitude leads to a policy of self-isolation from neighbouring societies, along with complaints about western &quot;ungratefulness&quot; over Israel raising the lonely flag of liberal democracy in a sea of backwardness. That explains the narrow Israeli opinion of the Arab revolution, ranging from indifference to anxiety, if not rejection. Changes, schmanges, let us roll down the blinds and look westwards. After all, sunsets are way more beautiful and\u00a0romantic than sunrises. \u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight", "title": "Israel is blind to the Arab revolution | Aluf Benn", "sentences": ["It&apos;s never Egypt, Syria, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority or even Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-23T10:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/mar/23/horse-racing-live-23-march-2011", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Horse racing tips"], "article": "3.05pm Rats.

Frankel, even-money favourite for the 2,000 Guineas, has once more been reported on target to make his reappearance in Newbury&apos;s Greenham on Saturday 16th April, while Workforce is being aimed at the Tattersalls Gold Cup on 22nd May at The Curragh. Those plans have been confirmed on At The Races this morning by Teddy Grimthorpe, racing manager to Khalid Abdullah. Today&apos;s best bets, by Will Hayler  There&apos;s been a bit of a rush of huge-priced winners in recent days and I can&apos;t help but wonder whether the changing going conditions have plenty to do with that. It seems a long time since we had a day where three jumps cards all feature the word &apos;firm&apos; in their going description, but that&apos;s where we are today. Maurisca (2.10) appreciated the return to a quicker surface when winning at Market Rasen last Sunday and the step up in trip to an extended 2\u00be miles also appeared to suit. Admittedly, that wasn&apos;t as good a contest as the one he tackles today at Haydock but he hasn&apos;t had that many chances over fences and, having never finished out of the frame in five starts as a chaser, he&apos;s just the sort of horse you can pay to take a chance on as he tries three miles for the first time. Carrying a big weight didn&apos;t seem to be a problem for Maurisca at Market Rasen and he represents a stable, that of Charlie Longsdon, which has had a fine season and continues in good form, despite a couple of disappointments at Cheltenham last week. In common with many of Presenting&apos;s progeny, Glencree (2.40) is also at his most effective on fast ground, two of his three wins coming on good to firm. The return to two miles isn&apos;t certain to suit, but he might get an uncontested early lead, in which case it could take a good one to get past. Only three line up for the juvenile handicap hurdle at Warwick, which is a bit of a surprise, given that most four-year-olds seem notoriously badly treated compared to their older rivals. All three of today&apos;s runners would surely struggle in all-aged company, so this race must give them their best chance of success. Head Hunted went off too quickly when fourth at Sandown last time and ought to perform better today with his stable back in top form, but I just prefer Pullyourfingerout (4.05), whose second to Sam Winner at Cheltenham in December stands out like a beacon. Although the official going was going was good to soft last time at Kempton, the jockeys were unanimous that it was in fact considerably more testing and Pullyourfingerout simply sank in the mud. He&apos;ll be a lot more effective on today&apos;s ground. Some of the races on Hereford&apos;s card are diabolical. Alan King has done particularly well to find an open novice hurdle in which the official rating of 110 for Mister Chancer (3.05) makes him the stand-out form selection. Tipping competition, day three &apos;Chicken merry, hawk is near&apos;, as JahLion reminded us yesterday, and the three chickens at the top of our leaderboard decided to take a day off from picking winners, allowing many others to close the gap. Lonewolfmcquaid looks pretty hawkish after pairing Rockabilly (14-1) with Pere Blanc (7-2) to move up into fourth place.

On the same day, the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) sent troops to help crush the resurgent protests in Bahrain. Though the troops are probably from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates \u2013 a key member of the GCC \u2013 is now participating in the Arab spring, but on the wrong side. Suddenly, Art Week and the well-respected Sharjah Biennial assumed exponentially more meaning. The bubble of the art world didn&apos;t burst \u2013 the art fair and the biennial are patronised by Dubai and Sharjah&apos;s ruling families respectively \u2013 but the membrane between art and politics was infiltrated in ways alternately impressive, opportunistic, courageous and frustratingly inadequate. Dubai&apos;s art scene is booming, even if the city is not. Its art fair is now in its fifth year and has 82 galleries \u2013 up from 72 last year \u2013 hailing from 43 countries, mostly from the &quot;central world&quot;, of which Dubai claims to be the capital. The fair took place in the halls of the Madinat Jumeirah hotel, next-door to the iconic sail-like building of the seven-star Burj al Arab. On the opening morning, I latched on to the entourage of Dubai&apos;s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, taking a tour of the fair. Sheikh Mo clearly appreciates the entrepreneurial spirit of the fair and the cultural cachet it gives his maligned city, the victim of seemingly insatiable schadenfreude since the crash two and a half years ago. (The latest screed, maybe the most hysterical and myopic in the new tradition of Dubai-bashing, comes from AA Gill in Vanity Fair.)     Cultural cachet ... Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum tours Art Dubai.  Photograph: Ali Haider/EPA    Front-line art I deviated from the sheikh&apos;s tour to take in the booth of Artspace, one of eight galleries from Dubai at the fair. It was the &quot;revolution&quot; booth, with several works referencing Egypt. Khaled Hafez&apos;s mural-sized canvas features collages of soldiers and protesters in Tahrir Square on a background of blobby pixels and dribbles of paint. &quot;From the front lines,&quot; whispered a voice behind me as I leant in to the painting. The voice belonged to Hafez himself, who explained that the piece started off as an abstract colour field. But with the revolution unfolding as the paint dried, he transformed it into a tribute to his protesting comrades in Cairo&apos;s art scene, creating an &quot;open source&quot; collage of their snapshots of the action. Hafez, 47, has long made politically charged paintings and video work. &quot;My generation spent so much time blaming and criticising,&quot; he said. &quot;But it never crossed our minds to spend 18 days in Tahrir Square simply demanding what we want.&quot; Artists of the younger generation were acting as citizens first, aesthetic ciphers second, which seems to be a good model for how to be a political artist in revolutionary times (American art critic Ben Davis wrote very eloquently on this recently). Artspace showed another insta-response to revolution: a painting called Bye Bye Hosni, by the Moroccan artist Zakaria Ramhani, of a protester with a huge Facebook-like button on his back, tearing down a poster of Mubarak. It&apos;s an uncomplicated statement of solidarity, but in the context of the art fair feels opportunistic and overly media-friendly \u2013 a too-perfect metonym of the revolution. Only a handful of the galleries at Art Dubai are recognisable to the many people here on the bandwagon of the western art fair circuit. Assar Art Gallery from Tehran is one of the unknown galleries that makes this fair more exciting than the big daddies. Assar&apos;s standout work was a mock stain-glass window by Iranian artist Roxana Manouchehri, featuring an intricate mixture of Arabic and Gaelic text, Christian saints and Islamic iconography. The gallerist told me Manouchehri was inspired by a recent trip to Ireland. When I asked her about the situation in Iran, she told me that she teaches at the University of Art in Tehran; Sane Jaleh, the student killed in the recent protests and absurdly claimed by the government as a victim of the protestors, was one of her students. It was another moment where the bubble burst for a second, only to reform when the next sheikh or high-heeled gallerista swished by. Bahrain itself makes an appearance at the fair in a series of beautiful photos by Camille Zakharia at the Lucy Mackintosh gallery, from Lausanne. Zakharia documents the ramshackle fisherman&apos;s huts and piers that jut out from Bahrain into the Gulf. The photos are part of the Reclaim project that appeared at the Venice architecture biennale last summer, investigating how rampant land reclamation around the island city state has cut off entire neighbourhoods \u2013 both Shia and Sunni \u2013 from their traditional relationship with the sea. These endangered shelters \u2013 hang-out spots for drinking tea, playing games and watching TV (one has a satellite dish precariously rigged to it) \u2013 are a touching picture of vernacular life in Bahrain, a mental background on which to project the current violence. The Reclaim project was initiated by Bahrain&apos;s Ministry of Culture, run by Sheikha Mai bint Mohammed Al Khalifa. She was supposed to give a lecture on the project at the fair, but pulled out at the last minute. &quot;It wouldn&apos;t be appropriate for us to appear at an art fair at a moment like this,&quot; Noura Al-Sayeh, head of architectural affairs at the ministry and curator of the Reclaim project, told me. But she was keen to point out that &quot;art shouldn&apos;t be undermined as frivolous or unnecessary. Its function is to fill in the gaps in a radicalised society.&quot; Implied politics Escaping the strange bubble of the art fair, I took a bus to Sharjah, a conurbation of Dubai about 10 miles to the north, but much older and with something Dubai lacks: a large, well-established art museum. It has been almost completely taken over by the biennial \u2013 the 10th since 1993 and featuring 76 artists. The only hint of the &quot;festivalism&quot; familiar in most biennials here is a pretty innocuous-looking replica rocket, in surrender-flag white, pointing at the sky in front of the museum. The rocket is a Cedar 4, made by a group of scientists and mathematicians in the 1960s. They launched rockets not for military purposes but merely to study the science of trajectory and ballistics. The Cedar 4 was resurrected, and a film is being made about it by Lebanese artists Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige. The project is political only by implication; Hadjithomas, hovering nearby, would only say that &quot;this was a project made by dreamers&quot; and she wanted to &quot;bring back&quot; the importance of such people. Predictably, the politics at the biennial was slower and more considered than at the fair, which can respond faster to current events and with less intellectual burden. A mesmerising video by no fewer than four artists \u2013 Jane and Louise Wilson, Shumon Basar and Eyal Weizman \u2013 tells the story of the murder of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, the Hamas officer assassinated by Mossad in Dubai last year. Similarly strategic is the selection of Harun Farocki&apos;s 1993 film Videograms of a Revolution: a documentary of the Romanian revolution in 1989 stitched together from home videos and lost TV footage, which shows a heroic act of aggregation that the likes of Facebook and YouTube now do for us.     'Outside the museum, a group of artists handed out pieces of paper bearing the names of Bahrainis killed in the protest'    Meanwhile, a very direct political action took place that morning as Sharjah&apos;s Sheikh Sultan Bin Mohammed al-Qassimi was having his inaugural tour of the biennial. Outside the museum, a groups of artists including Ibrahim Quraishi handed out pieces of paper bearing the names of Bahrainis killed in the protests. &quot;We in the artworld are not living in a vacuum,&quot; Quraishi told me by phone after being released from the interrogation that swiftly followed. &quot;We didn&apos;t do it for show, but to have people carrying around these names with them all day,&quot; he said. Quraishi was only released after five hours of questioning by the Sharjah internal security forces and after giving assurance that he was not trying to bring down its ruling regime. Solidarity feels good, but the effect of Quraishi&apos;s action may be counterproductive. Haig Aivazian, a co-curator of the biennial who was also taken for questioning, told me: &quot;I would support a gesture of solidarity, but this one was not effective. The very small margin of freedom that the Sharjah Foundation has created for the biennial has been compromised.&quot; A more constructive act of solidarity emerged the next morning over another pertinent issue in the region: migrant workers&apos; rights, in this case for the new Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi, designed by Frank Gehry. Walid Raad, a Lebanese artist participating in the biennial, announced a boycott by a group of 130 artists, curators and writers unless the Guggenheim Foundation ensures construction workers are given fair conditions. &quot;Artists should not be asked to exhibit their work in buildings built on the backs of exploited workers,&quot; Raad said. &quot;Those working with bricks and mortar deserve the same respect as those working with cameras and brushes.&quot; The Sharjah Biennial is implicated as its chief curator, Suzanne Cotter, is also chief curator of the new Guggenheim. Human Rights Watch reports have documented rampant abuses on Saadiyat island, where the Guggenheim will stand alongside a Louvre outpost designed by Jean Nouvel, a national museum by Norman Foster and a Zaha Hadid-designed opera hall. Workers are forced to repay extortionate recruitment fees, have their passports revoked upon arrival, and are subject to fines if they quit. Maybe the local Gulf News knew the artists&apos; declaration was coming: the day before, they ran a puff piece with the headline &quot;Cosy home for Saadiyat workers&quot;, reassuring readers that everything is rosy on Saadiyat, which literally means &quot;island of happiness&quot;. Art and politics are an awkward pairing at the best of times. But Art Dubai and the Sharjah Biennial, however awkwardly and with whatever compromised means, are bringing the invigorating oxygen of cultural and political debate to the region.

Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, said on Wednesday that no firms plans will be made for any of their horses until they are safely back in Newmarket, since the stress of travelling can take its toll, but White Moonstone is still on course for the 1,000 Guineas on 1 May, for which she is the 7-1 favourite, and there are several possible runners in the 2,000 Guineas the day before, including Casamento, the winner of the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster, and Dubai Prince, a recruit from Dermot Weld&apos;s stable after winning a high-quality maiden and a Group Three event at Leopardstown. What follows is what Crisford had to say about plans for Godolphin&apos;s most high-profile horses. Casamento He&apos;s had a good winter in Dubai. He&apos;s in the Guineas and whether he runs there or goes for the Dante [at York in mid-May], that decision will be made much closer to the time. I&apos;m not saying that he hasn&apos;t got the speed for the Guineas, but we&apos;re in the fortunate position where we&apos;ve got a few possibilities for the Guineas and what we&apos;re going to try to do when we get back to Europe is to pick the right races for the right horses. Dubai Prince  He&apos;s got a good turn of foot and he shows plenty of speed to run over a mile. I think he&apos;ll start off over a mile and go from there. He&apos;s in good shape anyway, that&apos;s the main thing. White Moonstone  She&apos;s very straightforward and uncomplicated. Physically, she&apos;s done well and we&apos;re very happy with her. She&apos;s showing all the right signs and with six weeks to go, she&apos;s exactly where we&apos;d want her to be. We&apos;re definitely going to try to channel her into the Guineas and then, after that, we&apos;ll take it from there, but on her two-year-old form she&apos;s one of the best around and we hope she can build on that this year. Saamidd He was very disappointing in the Dewhurst. Things didn&apos;t work out for him that day, but something was bothering him. He was reluctant to load into the gates, he was just showing a little bit of temperamentwhich we&apos;ve never seen before with him, so something wasn&apos;t right and he didn&apos;t like the soft ground. I think ground will be a key factor with this horse and he&apos;s not going to be racing much on soft ground. There&apos;s been no sign of any temperament since. It just seemed strange because leading into the race we&apos;d all been saying how calm and placid he was and then suddenly, on the day, he just went a bit odd. Zoowraa She hasn&apos;t competed above Listed class yet and she&apos;s got a fair bit to prove, but she would have the French Guineas as a possibility anyway. That race might just suit her a little bit more than Newmarket but, again, nothing has been decided yet. Rewilding What he probably benefits from most is not backing him up too quickly in his races. His Derby run was good, but his Voltigeur performance was much better after quite a lengthy absence and then his St Leger run was poor. It seemed to us that he bounced after his great effort in the Voltigeur.

Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, singled out the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury on 14 May as a race that will need to raise its purse significantly to attract a Godolphin runner, and also said that the operation will send horses from their Newmarket stables to maiden races in France rather than nearby Yarmouth if the tariff is not met. Crisford was speaking after nearly 40 of the operation&apos;s prospects for 2011, including the potential Classic contenders White Moonstone and Saamidd, had cantered during their annual media morning. He said Godolphin does not support the tariff to increase Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s return from racing, but to guarantee a stable future for all workers in the racing industry. &quot;We will not be running in any below-tariff races whatever the situation and Frankie [Dettori, Godolphin&apos;s retained jockey] will not be riding in any, not when he&apos;s riding for us anyway,&quot; Crisford said. &quot;Basically, this is all about stable staff. Of course the owners need prize money but this whole thing is about lots of British stable staff being made redundant if this whole thing isn&apos;t sorted out. Prize money filters all the way down through the industry to every single person who is part of the backbone of the British racing industry. They are the cogs in the wheel that make it turn. &quot;We like Newmarket as a base but you might see a lot more of our horses racing overseas. If England doesn&apos;t have the races for us, we will find them elsewhere. Poet&apos;s Voice [winner of the QEII Stakes] and Rewilding [third in the Derby] are obvious horses to race back in England, but not below tariff. &quot;If we have to get a run into a horse and we can&apos;t run them at Yarmouth, we will take them to France. In this day and age of travel, it&apos;s not so difficult. It needs a bit more paperwork, but it can be done, and it will be done. It&apos;s not just about maiden races either, you would need to be looking at races like the Lockinge, too. &quot;We will enter horses if they are below tariff in case they are up to tariff by the time of the final declarations but if they are not, our horses won&apos;t run.&quot; The lead set by Godolphin, founded by Sheikh Mohammed in 1992, is expected to be followed by other members of the Maktoum family, several of whom have three-figure strings in training in the UK. Last year&apos;s Lockinge Stakes, which had a total value of just under \u00a3200,000 against a new tariff of \u00a3256,000, had no Godolphin representative and only one runner owned by a member of the family, Ouqba, the runner-up. However, Godolphin has won the race five times since 1998. Stephen Higgins, Newbury&apos;s managing director, held out little hope that the track will be able to meet the prize-money demand of the Horsemen&apos;s Group. &quot;We haven&apos;t got the ability to raise it to the tariff value,&quot; he said. &quot;The current value is above the minimum value [set by the British Horseracing Authority]. We are in constant dialogue with the Horsemen, trying to understand how their figures were reached.

It is six years since O&apos;Brien, who trains for John Magnier&apos;s Coolmore Stud syndicate, last ran one of his horses in Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s emirate. His absence, though no one concerned will ever confirm it, was evidence of the frost that descended on the relationship between the most powerful bloodstock operations in racing in the autumn of 2005. It is one of the more puzzling sporting disagreements too, in part because, while rumours abound, few people beyond Magnier and Sheikh Mohammed themselves know for sure why the dispute arose, but also because it is bad for business. In their own ways, both Magnier and Sheikh Mohammed take a fiercely commercial approach to life \u2013 Dubai&apos;s skyline is testament to that \u2013 yet the Sheikh&apos;s refusal to buy Coolmore-bred yearlings at the bloodstock sales since September 2005 is a brake on the market that, in the end, drags at his own Darley Stud breeding operation as well. But the appearance of Cape Blanco in Saturday&apos;s Dubai World Cup, the most valuable race of the season and one that Sheikh Mohammed conceived and developed, could signify that business links between Coolmore and Dubai are about to be revived. If so, it will be a victory for common sense, but a little of the credit too may belong to Dr Jim Hay, a recent recruit to the very short list of owners at O&apos;Brien&apos;s Ballydoyle yard. Hay, a Scot who now lives in Dubai, owns horses with his wife, Fitri, has been a significant new arrival in the bloodstock market in recent years, and recently bought significant shares in both Cape Blanco and Fame And Glory, O&apos;Brien&apos;s 2010 Coronation Cup winner. Hay plays down suggestions that the couple have helped to bring a thaw between Magnier and the Sheikh \u2013 &quot;don&apos;t overegg it&quot;, he said on Thursday \u2013 but he does acknowledge that the relationship has room for improvement. &quot;It&apos;s no secret that there are strains between the folk in Ireland and the folk here,&quot; Hay said. &quot;You could maybe see this [Cape Blanco&apos;s Dubai World Cup entry] as a move that could bring the two sides together. &quot;These squabbles are just part of life, they come, they go. I think hopefully in the years to come we&apos;ll see a lot more of the [Irish] folks with top-class horses here, which must be good for Dubai. It should be win, win, win.&quot; Hay, who has a PhD in chemical engineering and worked for BP for 27 years, acquired Fosroc, a specialist chemical supplier, in 2002 and has been an owner for the best part of a decade. Buying into horses trained by O&apos;Brien, though, is a significant new step. &quot;I first got involved with Coolmore by buying horses from them,&quot; Hay says. &quot;Things are always changing rapidly, and opportunities that might not have existed 10 years ago can now appear. &quot;Anybody who is in any way associated with Coolmore can only see it as an enormous honour. I gave my wife Vincent O&apos;Brien&apos;s biography the other day and told her in particular to read the section on the formation of the [Coolmore] syndicate with the Sangsters. There&apos;s a fantastic quote in there, Sangster went to see Lord Derby and said &apos;I know I&apos;m going to be really serious for horses, tell me what I should do&apos;. He told him two things. &apos;Firstly, find the best trainer you can find, secondly you have to start thinking one million at a time.&apos; And that&apos;s where we are now. &quot;I&apos;ve seen a few things saying that the reason they sold [Cape Blanco] to us was that they&apos;ve gutted the horse and bottomed him out. If you go to Ballydoyle, Aidan has got this amazing collage on the wall of the 2001 season. Twenty-three Group One winners, you can&apos;t get your eyes off it. And if you actually look at it in detail, you&apos;ll find that a lot of these were older horses. He knows that he wants to do that again, only get 24, or 25. That&apos;s what drives him, and he can&apos;t do it unless he&apos;s got a few older horses.&quot; The Hays have already invested millions in horseflesh, but this is not a wild splurge by a wealthy man with more money than sense. Purchases include around a dozen impeccably-bred fillies destined to form the basis of their own breeding operation, and every decision is carefully weighed. &quot;Racing for us is a serious business,&quot; Hay said. &quot;We have a whole range of investments for our family group, which range from boring things like government gilts at one end all the way through to horse racing at the high-risk end. The returns are potentially huge, and unlike many other investments you can have fun at the same time. &quot;Everything we do will have a 15-year strategy, and we run our racing the same way. We will have a long-term strategy, and a five-year business plan to back it up. We have board meetings at which we discuss everything. It can be difficult for many of the board members to get their heads around. This is extremely high stakes but the returns on it are huge if it works.&quot;", "title": "Jim Hay hopes to bring peace to warring Coolmore and Darley factions", "sentences": ["In their own ways, both Magnier and Sheikh Mohammed take a fiercely commercial approach to life \u2013 Dubai&apos;s skyline is testament to that \u2013 yet the Sheikh&apos;s refusal to buy Coolmore-bred yearlings at the bloodstock sales since September 2005 is a brake on the market that, in the end, drags at his own Darley Stud breeding operation as well.", "But the appearance of Cape Blanco in Saturday&apos;s Dubai World Cup, the most valuable race of the season and one that Sheikh Mohammed conceived and developed, could signify that business links between Coolmore and Dubai are about to be revived.", "Hay, a Scot who now lives in Dubai, owns horses with his wife, Fitri, has been a significant new arrival in the bloodstock market in recent years, and recently bought significant shares in both Cape Blanco and Fame And Glory, O&apos;Brien&apos;s 2010 Coronation Cup winner.", "&quot;You could maybe see this [Cape Blanco&apos;s Dubai World Cup entry] as a move that could bring the two sides together.", "I think hopefully in the years to come we&apos;ll see a lot more of the [Irish] folks with top-class horses here, which must be good for Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-24T17:50:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/24/qatar-planes-libya-high-stakes", "tags": ["Qatar", "Al-Jazeera", "Libya", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "TV news", "Television industry", "Media", "Africa"], "article": "In an air-conditioned room down an alley in the old market of Qatar&apos;s capital Doha, enthusiasts of &quot;damah&quot; gather most evenings. The ancient board game, rarely played in recent years, is now being revived by local enthusiasts. It is, afficionados say, a contest of strategy and finesse \u2013 and thus an apt metaphor for the high-stakes manoeuvring by the tiny Gulf state and its hereditary leader, 59-year-old Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, in recent weeks. For a country the size of Belgium with a population of 1.7 million, Qatar has been playing an extraordinarily high-profile role. This weekend four Qatari fighter jets are set to join the allied forces already off the Libyan coastline. The combat deployment is the first by an Arab or Muslim-majority country and thus of critical diplomatic significance. Then there is the key role played in the &quot;Arab spring&quot; by al-Jazeera, the satellite TV channel set up by the emir in 1996. Broadcasting from Doha, al-Jazeera is now the dominant Arabic-language news outlet in the region and increasingly recognised around the world. Al-Jazeera English is gaining fans. &quot;Al-Jazeera were the first on to the events in Tunisia. Its reports from there were watched by the Egyptians. Then its reports from Egypt were watched by everyone else. It has been a very important catalyst,&quot; said Hugh Miles, author of Al-Jazeera: How Arab TV News Challenged the World. Others have gone further and described the successive uprisings as &quot;fundamentally driven&quot; by the TV channel. Al-Jazeera&apos;s role and Qatar&apos;s decision to send planes are both rooted in Qatar&apos;s size, its location on a spur of the Arabian peninsula and the emir&apos;s efforts to ensure his country&apos;s independence from much bigger neighbouring states such as Iran and Saudi Arabia. As in a game of damah, the emir, who seized power from his father in 1995, has eschewed confrontation in favour of a more subtle strategy. &quot;Any wise person would do the same&quot;, said Faraj Almohammed, a 45-year-old economic advisor and keen damah player, in Doha&apos;s old market last night. For despite wealth from its vast oil and gas reserves which means its inhabitants do not pay income tax or utilities bills and enjoy average incomes of \u00a350,000, Qatar is vulnerable. &quot;The [Sandhurst-trained] emir is a military man and knows that Qatar is basically indefensible,&quot; said Blake Hounshell, the Doha-based managing editor of Foreign Policy magazine. &quot;He has thought laterally about ways of making Qatar more secure.&quot; The emir&apos;s main two strategic assets are al-Jazeera and diplomacy, said Mustafa Alani, analyst at the Gulf Research Centre in Dubai. &quot;The aim is to give Qatar an importance out of proportion to its size. Al-Jazeera gives it a loud voice and the emir has made a huge effort to make Qatar the local mediator of choice too.&quot; Al-Jazeera broke with the stultifying broadcasting style of government-run channels in the region and rapidly became an integral part of the Arab world&apos;s cultural landscape and immensely popular. &quot;Al-Jazeera pitches itself at its viewership. It is Arab-owned, Arab-financed, based in an Arab city and ... gives people what they want to hear in a language they understand,&quot; said Miles, the author. For protesters across the region, the presence of al-Jazeera cameras means more than news. Exposure brings a measure of security. In Syria this week, demonstrators chanted: &quot;We want al-Jazeera.&quot; In Sana&apos;a in Yemen, a handwritten sign read: &quot;Al-Jazeera is part of our revolution.&quot; Such influence has inevitably caused problems for Qatar. Last year al-Jazeera, which means &quot;the peninsula&quot; in Arabic, was banned in Morocco, suspended in Bahrain and caused a diplomatic incident with Jordan. A camera crew was arrested by Nato-led troops in Afghanistan for &quot;making propaganda&quot;. The channel has been restricted or targeted by almost every Arab state and many others, including the US. But it has also given the emir huge credibility and prestige among ordinary people. Al Anstey, managing director of al-Jazeera&apos;s English-language channel, said any challenge to governments was not deliberate but simply came from reporters covering &quot;the facts on the ground&quot;. For analyst Alani, &quot;like Qatar&apos;s role as a mediator, al-Jazeera makes enemies but is a net gain in terms of influence.&quot; Qatari diplomacy is wide-ranging. Successfully bidding for the 2022 World Cup attracted global attention, as it was meant to. Qatar has good relations with the US, hosting its vast airbase at al-Udeid, and, relative to the rest of the region, with Israel too. It also maintains contacts with Hamas and Hezbollah, shares an oilfield with Iran and is careful to be friendly to Riyadh. Angering the latter is &quot;not an option&quot;, said one western diplomat based in the region, a factor in what some claim is al-Jazeera&apos;s &quot;systematic downplaying&quot; of news of its neighbour. Anstey denied any bias. &quot;We are financed by the state of Qatar but editorially entirely independent. We cover every story on its merits,&quot; he said. Qatar is seen as moderate, at least compared to its neighbours. Alcohol is not illegal, though it is an offence to drink or be drunk in public. Homosexuality is illegal, even if the laws are applied pragmatically. Political parties are banned and, according to Amnesty International, the founder of a human rights organisation was detained this month. To the surprise of some, al-Jazeera reported the arrest. The effects of the channel on the region may be greater than the autocratic, if relatively moderate, emir of Qatar bargained for. &quot;Over the last decade, al-Jazeera has done more to educate Arabs about human rights, civil rights, democracy and the world than anyone else,&quot; said Miles, the author. &quot;Now anywhere in the Arab world you can have an informed discussion about what&apos;s happening in the world ... That is a huge change.&quot; The &quot;Arab spring&quot; appears likely to remain foreign news for al-Jazeera, however. &quot;Qatar is unique in that there are really very few local tensions and no major threat to stability,&quot; said Dr Jennifer Heeg, a Doha-based human rights specialist. &quot;The biggest split is between locals and the migrant labourers. A day of rage was called recently and absolutely no one turned up.&quot; This means that, unlike other local rulers, the emir does not have to watch the sentiment of a restive &quot;street&quot;. There is certainly little discontent among students in Education City, a vast complex of colleges set up by the emir on the outskirts of Doha. Students gathered for a snack after classes in the open-air cafeteria of the private Carnegie Mellon University said that, though relations between Qatar and Libya had been poor for a long time, it was the killing of an al-Jazeera cameraman near Benghazi two weeks ago, probably by Gaddafi&apos;s henchmen, that justified Qatar&apos;s military commitment to operation Odyssey Dawn. &quot;I think [Qataris] ... have the right to go and [avenge] their loss. I think all Arab countries should do the same. We are all Arab and we all should help each other,&quot; said Muhammad Hadi, a 20-year-old business administration student. &quot;I think Qatar wants to have more influence on the world [and] I am proud to live in this country.&quot; With additional reporting from Omar Chatriwalla and Shabina Khatri in Doha.", "title": "Qatar's decision to send planes to Libya is part of a high-stakes game", "sentences": ["&quot;He has thought laterally about ways of making Qatar more secure.&quot; The emir&apos;s main two strategic assets are al-Jazeera and diplomacy, said Mustafa Alani, analyst at the Gulf Research Centre in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-24T19:18:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/mar/25/new-zealand-south-africa-live", "tags": ["Cricket World Cup 2011", "New Zealand cricket team", "South Africa cricket team", "Cricket", "Over by over reports"], "article": " Preamble Morning. Who says 50-over cricket has nothing new to offer? This fascinating competition will enter virgin territory today, when either South Africa and New Zealand will win a World Cup knockout game for the first time. The fact they have not done so before is pretty staggering, even if it is not quite the statgasm we might think. This is only the second World Cup to have quarter-finals, so there haven&apos;t been that many knockout games down the years: this is the 34th in total, of which six have been lost by New Zealand and four by South Africa. Since South Africa&apos;s readmission to international cricket, the two sides have strikingly similar records. They were semi-finalists in 1992, 1999 and 2007; they were quarter-finalists in 1996; and they failed to reach the knockout stages in 2003. Yet a more relevant comparison might be between South Africa and another New Zealand team: the rugby boys, who have also found umpteen weird and wonderful ways not to win a World Cup. If South Africa discover another today, in a match they should win, a popular C-word may well be trending on a social networking site near you. (Insert your own &apos;and chokers will be trending too&apos; joke here.)  The winners of this match will play either Sri Lanka or England in Colombo on Tuesday. This will be played before the India v Pakistan semi-final. Scandalous, clearly, but all part of the plan from cricket&apos;s governing body, the BCCI, to ensure that India win.  An early email, from Guy Collier &quot;So this isn&apos;t exactly to do with the cricket but stick with me and I will do my best to bring it around. I am currently running a social experiment to see what happens when we open up questions of identity and move away from the traditional tick box approach you see in the census form \u2013 and if one small boy, albeit one who is actually 6ft tall and 30, can run a census from his bedroom using just social media. And the power of OBO cricket. &quot;I am looking for any and all plugs to encourage people to state on Twitter #altcensus today I am.... I will gather all the statements to see how they compare to the national census. If anyone has any questions they can check www.alternativecensus.org.uk. So here is my tenuous cricket link: what box do half the England cricket team tick when asked about national identity...? Maybe if they took part in the Alternative Census we could find out!&quot; The power of OBO cricket. Arf!  South Africa at the World Cup Group stages: P42 W30 L11 T1 (Win percentage: 71)Knockout games: P4 W0 L3 T1 (Win percentage: 0)  New Zealand at the World Cup Group stages: P61 W39 L22 (Win percentage: 64)Knockout games: P6 W0 L6 (Win percentage: 0)  New Zealand have won the toss and will bat first. I think they had to do that to have a realistic chance of victory. That sets this game up beautifully. If they put 250 on the board, chase won&apos;t be the only CH-word we&apos;ll be mentioning as South Africa&apos;s batsmen go about their business. Both sides have picked three frontline spinners. Daniel Vettori returns to the side, even though he is not fully fit, and the left-armer Luke Woodcock also comes in, with James Franklin omitted. South Africa have Johan Botha, Imran Tahir and Robin Peterson, while the big three \u2013 Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and AB de Villiers \u2013 return after sitting out the final group games against Bangladesh. Morne van Wyk misses out as a result. New Zealand Guptill, B McCullum (wk), Ryder, Taylor, Styris, Williamson, Vettori, N McCullum, Oram, Southee, Woodcock. South Africa Smith (c), Amla, Kallis, de Villiers (wk), Duminy, du Plessis, Botha, Peterson, Steyn, Morkel, Tahir.  As these two are serial losers in the World Cup knockout stages, here is some encouragement for them from one of the most inspiring figures ever to bestride this earth. Ignore the bit at the top right of the video.  Morning people Who are these weird &quot;morning people&quot; I keep seeing? They&apos;re a menace to society with their walking, talking and general 6am sentience. My alarm has been going off before 5.30 and 6 throughout this World Cup, and I&apos;ve not felt so consistently violated since I inexplicably watched most of the first season of Gossip Girl in one hit. Why would anyone get up at such an hour, never mind seem so jaunty and busy? Yes we all admire your lust for life and the incontrovertibly superior energy content of your diet, but please don&apos;t rub in our face, at least not before midday. Thankfully the Guardian power-showers are one of the best things that have ever happened to anyone, ever, so I now feel vaguely human. But I still don&apos;t understand these strange &quot;morning people&quot;. They&apos;re worse than the paediatricians. There&apos;s even a guide how to be a morning person. No thanks!  1st over: New Zealand 2-0 (Guptill 1, B McCullum 1) South Africa open with a spinner, as usual. How odd it is to type that sentence. Today it&apos;s Robin Peterson rather than Johan Botha and his first over, played cagily, brings just a couple of singles. &quot;Can today&apos;s match officially be termed a west London derby?&quot; says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. &quot;Also, cracking article by Selvey on Yardy&apos;s depression.&quot; It was. Selve is in storming form at the moment.  2nd over: New Zealand 5-0 (Guptill 1, B McCullum 4) Dale Steyn&apos;s first ball is driven urgently through extra cover for three by Brendon McCullum. Those are the only runs from the over, although one delivery to Guptill bounces twice before reaching the keeper, a reflection of the pace of this pitch. New Zealand have beaten South Africa at the last two World Cups, famously so in 2003 when Stephen Fleming played an awesome innings; they are not the same side these days, but don&apos;t write them off, at least not until they collapse to 40 for seven. They certainly have a puncher&apos;s chance now that they are batting first. &quot;Hold your horses Smyth, my boy,&quot; says Andrew Jobson. &quot;In the (admittedly unlikely) event of the match being abandoned, the higher-ranked team (SA) progresses. So New Zealand would be knocked out, and SA could then get beaten in the semi by the winner of SL-Eng, preserving both teams&apos; winless records.&quot;  WICKET! New Zealand 5-1 (B McCullum ct and b Peterson 4) A sensational return catch from Robin Peterson gets rid of the dangerman Brendon McCullum. He danced down the track but was done by a bit of extra bounce and pushed the ball back to the left of Peterson, who dived and then extended a telescopic arm to take a wonderful catch. He took an unbelievable catch off his own bowling earlier in the tournament to dismiss Ian Bell, and this was comparable. Brilliant stuff.  3rd over: New Zealand 6-1 (Guptill 1, Ryder 1) Robin Peterson is having quite a tournament. &quot;This is it, isn&apos;t it?&quot; says Duncan Bonnett. &quot;I&apos;ve spent the whole of last night and this morning not laughing at the Aussies in case it comes back to bite my boys as karmic revenge. We need to get into the Kiwi middle order quickly, or I&apos;m afraid the ahem, nerves, will start to jangle out there. On paper, we&apos;re too strong for the Kiwis, but what if they pick scissors instead of rock?&quot; Could make a &apos;Dale Stone&apos; joke. Doesn&apos;t really work. Dale Stone!  4th over: New Zealand 14-1 (Guptill 1, Ryder 8) An unusually sloppy over from Steyn includes a low full toss and a leg-side wide to Ryder, who then inside edges a hot inswinger to fine leg for four. These are very dangerous times for New Zealand, who could fold if they lose another one here. Ryder ends the over by clunking a pull over mid on for three. &quot;Please can we have early mention for what I expect to be the star of today&apos;s game?&quot; says Neil Withers. &quot;I am of course referring to Daniel Vettori&apos;s amazing moustache \u2013 I saw it last night on TV and couldn&apos;t stop laughing! It&apos;s the finest display of slug-balancing since Baldrick.&quot;  5th over: New Zealand 15-1 (Guptill 1, Ryder 9) The offspinner Johan Botha replaces Robin Peterson. As Mark Nicholas says on Sky, Graeme Smith is loving captaining a side with so many options. It&apos;s like going from the basic five channels to the full Sky+ experience, or so I&apos;d imagine if I had Sky. Botha so nearly zips a quicker one through Ryder, who gets a very late inside edge. One from a very good over. South Africa have been seriously impressive thus far. &quot;Morning people have just taken the next logical step from pretending they didn&apos;t want to come to the party you didn&apos;t invite them to,&quot; says Dan Smith. &quot;They couldn&apos;t come to that party, or indeed any other event you wouldn&apos;t want them at, because they need to be up bright and early for a granola-fuelled jog to the office. I spit in their carrot juice.&quot;  WICKET! New Zealand 16-2 (Guptill c Botha b Steyn 1) This is too easy for South Africa. Steyn dupes Guptill with a lovely slower ball, and he drives it high in the air to mid off, where Botha takes a nonchalant running catch.  6th over: New Zealand 16-2 (Ryder 10, Taylor 0) In their last World Cup knockout game, the 2007 semi-final, South Africa lost the match inside 10 overs. They might have won this one by the 10th over. They have been outstanding. &quot;You can rail against morning people all you want,&quot; says Peter Hanes, &quot;but never forget that they&apos;re the ones that ensure that the supermarket is stocked with fish fingers by the time you get there.&quot;  7th over: New Zealand 17-2 (Ryder 10, Taylor 1) One from another crafty Botha over. New Zealand are in all sorts of bother, already. &quot;Yesterday&apos;s link to the freak yoga instructor and his rooster was bad enough, but linking to Nick Berry singing that execrable dirge is going too far,&quot; says Martin Sinclair. &quot;I&apos;d rather complete my census than sit through that twaddle!&quot;  8th over: New Zealand 24-2 (Ryder 16, Taylor 2) Morkel replaces Steyn, and Ryder flays a full delivery square on the off side for four. Good shot. &quot;If you want to become a morning person it is simple - have a small child (yes yes I know, OBO readers, but even Millings has managed),&quot; says Robin Hazlehurst. &quot;You will get up at ungodly hours for several years and eventually get used to it. Option two, be a small child, they are certainly morning people. You were probably one too once, you just don&apos;t remember.&quot;  9th over: New Zealand 27-2 (Ryder 17, Taylor 3) Crikey, Danny Morrison has entered the commentary box and is now using that soft, ticklish voice of his. I bet he whispers the sweetest nothings. Botha bowls a leg-side wide and then Ryder pushes a single to mid off. NZ bat a long way down \u2013 Oram is down to come in at No9 \u2013 so there&apos;s no need to panic just yet. But they need to find a bowler to target, and I&apos;m not sure there are any. &quot;I don&apos;t really get why anyone would want to get up early every day,&quot; says Guy Hornsby. &quot;It&apos;s a necessity in order to pay the bills, to top up the supply of Liver Compromiser. The sort of people that do it are the preternaturally happy people \u2013 like children&apos;s TV presenters \u2013 that talk in awful lingo: work/life balance, working &apos;clever&apos;, maximising your potential, living life to the full. I just got a bit of sick in my mouth from that. There are so few jobs that would make you want to do that. Astronaut? Actor? International playboy? OBO writer? I bet Hugh Hefner doesn&apos;t get up in the morning. And yes, I&apos;m hungover.&quot; I just typed &apos;children&apos;s TV presenter&apos; into google, and look what was the second result.  10th over: New Zealand 34-2 (Ryder 24, Taylor 3) Ryder spanks another square drive for four off Morkel, despite or perhaps because of the presence of Kallis at short point. It went through his legs in fact. Ryder then pulls through square leg for three. He&apos;s a dangerous customer, and he looks in the mood to give it some humpty. &quot;I&apos;m a Kiwi watching in Wellington,&quot; says Cat Doran. &quot;Expecting an early night once we implode.&quot; Now that&apos;s what I call confidence.  11th over: New Zealand 36-2 (Ryder 25, Taylor 4) &quot;Any tips on getting my colleagues in Norway to embrace the majestic game that is cricket (even if it is the pyjama format)?&quot; says Al Weeks. &quot;I can&apos;t see why it&apos;s not a big hit here already, the climate is perfect for it and with the recent performance of minor nations they&apos;ve probably got a chance of putting an ad hoc team together and giving England a close game.&quot; Show them lots of videos of Viv. He was even cooler than your average Scandinavian, so they&apos;ll surely recognise the swagger.  12th over: New Zealand 47-2 (Ryder 33, Taylor 5) Peterson is back for Morkel, who took a little bit of abuse from Ryder. As does Peterson when a widish delivery is clattered through the covers for four. He gets four more to the same area off the last ball of the over, this time with a cut stroke. Ryder looks dangerous. &quot;What a great start by the South Africans,&quot; says George Miller. &quot;Peterson has really been a revelation for us in the WC. Although we are supposed to working on three papers (tomorrow, Sunday and Monday), production has pretty much ground to a halt.&quot;  13th over: New Zealand 50-2 (Ryder 34, Taylor 7) Imran Tahir is going to bowl. He has stunning record in this tournament \u2013 12 wickets at an average of 9.83 \u2013 and his second ball is a delicious googly that beats Ryder all ends up. Three from the over. &quot;Rob old chap, am I the only one picking up a bit of, umm,  Kenneth Williams  campness in your commentary this morning?&quot; says Steve Hudson. &quot;Lovely man paunch? Danny M&apos;s whispered sweet nothings? If you&apos;re building up to a frank admission of some sort, just let me tell you that the OBO crew will be very supportive. After all, there&apos;s no room for intolerance in the world of online bilge these days. We&apos;ll tolerate anything. Clearly.&quot;  14th over: New Zealand 53-2 (Ryder 35, Taylor 9) Three singles from Peterson&apos;s over. &quot;Oh come on all you townies, out here in the wilds of Oxonshire there is the dawn chorus (coming in strong at about 0500 currently but set to move earlier),&quot; says Angus Doulton. &quot;Exactly what is needed to fortify one for a morning&apos;s OBO humour. Actually even in the midst of town, you&apos;d be surprised what a few blackbirds can do to support the critical first mug of tea.&quot; I wish I was in bed. Normally, if you wake up early by accident, you can spend an hour moseying around, then get an extra nap in and still be up for midday when the day formally begins.  15th over: New Zealand 57-2 (Ryder 36, Taylor 12) There&apos;s more chance of Lord Henry Manners of Mannersville zestily picking his nose at the dinner table than there is of Ryder picking Tahir. He hasn&apos;t got a clue, but he&apos;s getting away with it for now. Taylor isn&apos;t entirely comfortable either and he gets a leading edge that falls safely on the off side.&quot;In the 6th over, when it was 16-2, you said that South Africa could have this game won by the 10th over,&quot; says Luke Dealtry. &quot;It&apos;s now the 13th over and the Kiwis are 50-2. CHOKERS!&quot; You said the word. You&apos;re not supposed to do that. If you say the C-word five times in a mirror, terrible things will happen.  16th over: New Zealand 58-2 (Ryder 37, Taylor 12) The returning Morkel&apos;s first ball is belaboured towards backward point by Ryder, and Duminy saves four with a brilliant diving save. Just one from the over, but this has been a decent comeback from New Zealand. Their tactic should be to just stay in the game as long as possible and hope that the asphyxiating pressure does for South Africa later on. It goes against all logic, but I think New Zealand have got a real chance today. &quot;A question for OBO readers,&quot; says Steve Kerr. &quot;Does anyone know of a London pub showing the Crusaders/Sharks Super XV game live on Sunday? Obviously can&apos;t be arsed going to Twickenham and will donate independently here.&quot;  17th over: New Zealand 61-2 (Ryder 39, Taylor 13) New Zealand must find a way to impose themselves on Tahir, which is easier typed from thousands of miles away than done. Just three from the over, which is again played with a respect that borders on fear. &quot;How about a bit more commentary about the game,&quot; says Clinton Rowling. &quot;Remember that thing people are logging on to the live feed to follow?? As much as I find your campness amusing and your amazement that people get up early slightly interesting I&apos;m logged on to follow a quarter final game at the cricket World Cup....&quot; Sure. Where do I send the editorial consultancy fee? And when do I come and tell you how to do your job?  18th over: New Zealand 69-2 (Ryder 44, Taylor 14) Morkel hasn&apos;t been at his best today \u2013 too wide to Ryder in particular, and he clubs two more through the covers. Whatever you do, don&apos;t let him free those massive arms. Morkel gets a slower ball wrong later in the over and Ryder helps it around the corner for four to bring up a good fifty partnership. &quot;In response to Guy Hornsby&apos;s comments in the 9th over, people who get up early every day are not preternaturally happy people,&quot; says Ewan Dunnett. &quot;They are usually depressed and full of fear. So much so they can&apos;t sleep. Children&apos;s television presenters, much like many comedians, are full of inner demons.&quot; Children&apos;s TV presenters are a fascinating genre of human. Have you seen that lass on Dancing On Ice. I haven&apos;t, because I have never watched Dancing On Ice, ever, but my friends tell me she has a ceaseless jauntiness that borders on the disconcerting.  19th over: New Zealand 75-2 (Ryder 47, Taylor 19) Botha replaces Tahir, and the hitherto strokeless Taylor plays a gorgeous extra-cover drive for four. That&apos;s his first boundary. This has been an extremely good partnership, not least because it would have been easy to wave the white one after that abysmal start. &quot;If Steve Kerr wants to watch the Sharks/Crusaders game he should head to the Famous Three Kings just by West Ken tube,&quot; says John O&apos;Mahony. &quot;Probably the best sports-watching pub ever. They have about 50-odd screens and they all seem to be showing something different. Some of the tables even have their own TV. Not been there for a couple of years mind so might have gone downhill.&quot; Everything does. It says here.  20th over: New Zealand 77-2 (Ryder 48, Taylor 20) Graeme Smith continues to shuffle his bowlers \u2013 he really is a kid in a sweet shop \u2013 with Kallis replacing Morkel. Taylor ducks under an existentialism-heavy bouncer, and there are just two from the over. &quot;I don&apos;t even read the commentary here anymore, except maybe the bits in bold,&quot; says Niall Harden. &quot;I&apos;m here for the great life advice, withering sarcasm, Freudian misprints and unsettling videos. I don&apos;t even really understand rugby.&quot;  21st over: New Zealand 80-2 (Ryder 49, Taylor 22) Three singles from Botha&apos;s over. South Africa could do with a wicket here. They might just, for the first time, be thinking dark thoughts. &quot;I&apos;m sensing,&quot; begins Jonathan Wood, &quot;that Clinton isn&apos;t a morning person.&quot;  22nd over: New Zealand 84-2 (Ryder 51, Taylor 24) Nobody really knows what a good score on is on what is a pretty slow pitch, but I reckon New Zealand would take 250. Taylor opens the face to glide Kallis to third man for a single. Then Ryder pushes a single to reach a really good half-century, defiant at first and controlled thereafter. He almost falls to the last delivery, however, gloving an attempted hook to third man for a single. &quot;Dear Coronation Street, I like cookery programmes,&quot; says Scott Murray. &quot;Please stop telling stories about people in Manchester and start doing recipes. Dear Brian Cox, I am frightened of the dark. Please stop talking about space.&quot;  23rd over: New Zealand 87-2 (Ryder 53, Taylor 25) Botha has been pretty economical today. Just three singles from that over, so his figures are now 7-0-19-0. &quot;Can anyone give me a good reason,&quot; begins Gary Naylor, &quot;why SA deny themselves the services of the best fielder in the world in order to use him as a below average keeper?&quot; Because fielding isn&apos;t quantified. Which is not to say you don&apos;t have a point.  24th over: New Zealand 88-2 (Ryder 53, Taylor 25) One from Kallis&apos;s over. This is a good spell for South Africa, with the last five overs bringing only 12 runs. As Pat Symcox says on Sky, New Zealand&apos;s dot-ball ratio has been too high today. Yet, for all that, they are still in a perfectly acceptable position. &quot;Just to clarify \u2013 having children doesn&apos;t mean you get up early; it just means your sleep is more fractured from 5-7am,&quot; says Kristian Petterson. &quot;Oh, and that your significant other loathes you even more than ever as they deal with said offspring as you snore. Apparently.&quot;  25th over: New Zealand 92-2 (Ryder 56, Taylor 26) This might be New Zealand&apos;s window of opportunity, with the offspinner JP Duminy coming into the attack. Ryder chips high over extra cover for a couple, and two singles complete the over. &quot;I&apos;m torn,&quot; says Jay Rose. &quot;As an Australian, I desperately want to see the Kiwis win this one, but a hard-earned grudging respect for Graeme Smith makes me want to see him end his career with a WC trophy. Plus, I simply can&apos;t see NZ beating India, which is even more important.&quot;  26th over: New Zealand 93-2 (Ryder 56, Taylor 27) This is a nice move from Smith. He could have let the game drift along for another five overs, but instead he has brought back Dale Steyn with a view to breaking this partnership. He doesn&apos;t do that, but it is a tight over that yields just one. New Zealand have scored only 18 off the last seven overs. Something will have to give pretty soon. &quot;Obviously I would rather stay up until 3 am smoking and drinking with all you salt of the earth chaps,&quot; says Richard Hands, &quot;but I have get up early because I live in Africa (where as often as not there&apos;s no electricity) and because my children have to be ready to leave for school at 6.30. Granola and carrot juice have nothing to do with it. In other news, the true delight of this WC for me has been the re-emergence and indeed pre-eminence of really good spin bowling. Just wish I could watch it.&quot;  27th over: New Zealand 98-2 (Ryder 58, Taylor 29) Duminy&apos;s over is a better one for New Zealand, with five from it. &quot;Answer to Naylor&apos;s question about South Africa&apos;s wicketkeeper,&quot; says Robin Hazlehurst. &quot;Morne van Wyk&apos;s batting.&quot;  28th over: New Zealand 104-2 (Ryder 64, Taylor 29) Ryder brings up the 100 with the first boundary for nine overs, a thumping off drive off Steyn. &quot;How about more discussion of fish fingers and other important stuff,&quot; says Tony Tyler. &quot;These days almost every entry seems to start with some rubbish about cricket. Anyone would think you&apos;re obsessed. (Please send the editorial consultancy fee to me.)&quot;  29th over: New Zealand 108-2 (Ryder 65, Taylor 32) Imran Tahir replaces JP Duminy and whistles through an over at a cost of four. &quot;Beavering away on a preview as I am, I&apos;ve only just caught up with your 11th over Norwegian reference,&quot; says Mike Selvey. &quot;I&apos;m currently reading a Henning Mankell &apos;Wallander&apos; novel, which when set alongside The Killing and the Stieg Larsson trilogy means that I would no more report cricket in Scandinavia than I would Midsomer.&quot;  30th over: New Zealand 116-2 (Ryder 71, Taylor 34) Another bowling change, the 11th of the innings, with Robin Peterson replacing Dale Steyn. Ryder greets him by charging down the wicket to the first ball and blasting it over mid off for a one-bounce four. The boundary from the first ball of an over helps relax the batsmen \u2013 like when you actually make people laugh during the first pint and can therefore sit and not worry about being you for the next 10 minutes or so \u2013 and they are happy to milk singles for the rest of the over, the last of which brings up a meticulous century partnership. &quot;Dear Ron Jeremy,&quot; begins Dan Smith. &quot;Enough of this grunting, when&apos;s that washing machine going to be fixed?&quot;  31st over: New Zealand 118-2 (Ryder 72, Taylor 35) Ryder slices Tahir over point. Just two from a good over. &quot;There&apos;s not much interest in NZ /SA here in Dubai on a lovely weekend afternoon,&quot; says Bob Cochrane. &quot;But I&apos;m wondering what the town will be like come Wednesday, 1:00 pm local time, when India and Pakistan square off. My guess is that streets will be empty and a record number of workers will fall victim to a mysterious illness.&quot; The battle fever.  32nd over: New Zealand 128-2 (Ryder 75, Taylor 42) Ross Taylor gets down one knee to slog sweep Peterson for a big six. &quot;There we go boy!&quot; says Mark Nicholas. This game is about to get interesting. Ten from the over. &quot;This one,&quot; says Kristian Petterson, &quot;goes out to all the people who&apos;ve found themselves at the Guardian OBO by mistake...&quot; That&apos;s hilarious. But clearly not true, because we love and respect all our readers equally here at the Guardian.  WICKET! New Zealand 130-3 (Taylor c Kallis b Tahir 43) All that good work undone in an instant. Taylor slog sweeps straight to deep square leg, where Kallis takes a good catch. That was smart cricket from Tahir, who hurried Taylor by whipping through his over in no time. Taylor tried to delay him, but he was a little flustered and fell to the final delivery.  33rd over: New Zealand 130-3 (Ryder 76, Styris 0) Apparently the auto-refresh again isn&apos;t working. Apologies for that. Still, hammering F5 is endearingly retro, right? Oh. &quot;Isn&apos;t navel gazing the whole point of cricket?&quot; says Myles Thomas. &quot;Why else would anyone stand out in a field for a long period every weekend for a summer focussing on the off chance of a ball being hit close enough to catch?&quot;  34th over: New Zealand 135-3 (Ryder 80, Styris 1) Five from Peterson&apos;s over, and it&apos;s time for the mandatory ball change.  35th over: New Zealand 139-3 (Ryder 82, Styris 3) Four singles from Botha&apos;s over. New Zealand have clearly put all their eggs in the basket marked &apos;overs 46-50&apos;. It&apos;s a big risk, but an understandable one for such obvious underdogs. I still think their best tactic is to just stay in the game as long as possible. Even if South Africa are 185 for three in the 40th, chasing 250, New Zealand will be reasonably happy. &quot;And to the fellow who loses sleep between five and seven because of a baby, try triplets, sunshine,&quot; says Mike Selvey. &quot;You haven&apos;t even seen the shine off the new ball with one.&quot;  36th over: New Zealand 147-3 (Ryder 82, Styris 11) Morkel returns to the attack, and his first is pushed supremely down the ground for four by Styris. That&apos;s a gorgeous stroke, and three balls later he drags a slower ball through midwicket for four more. Morkel has, by his very high standards, been poor today. &quot;Agree with Lord Selvey, Norwegians won&apos;t get cricket,&quot; says Ben Dorning. &quot;They like sport to be about man vs nature, not man against man. Otherwise they get all Scandinavian and cerebral about it \u2013 a friend was at a football match in Sweden recently when two groups of fans were singing different football chants at each other. He asked his Swedish friend what they were saying and apparently one group&apos;s chant was &apos;Push up more and stop sitting so deep&apos; while the reply from the other group was &apos;Yes, but don&apos;t leave the centre backs exposed!&apos;&quot;  37th over: New Zealand 153-3 (Ryder 83, Styris 16) Styris has started extremely well. He dances down the track to drive Botha&apos;s second ball emphatically over mid on for four and now has 16 from 14 balls. &quot;This hitting this F5 has just got me into trouble,&quot; says Mark Taylor. &quot;My manager, who can&apos;t see my screen but can see what I&apos;m doing, has told to me that for the last ten minutes all she&apos;s seen me do is hit one key on my keyboard. Not sure I could explain that one?&quot; Tell her it&apos;s &apos;X&apos; and you&apos;re just a very very modern man.  WICKET! New Zealand 153-4 (Styris b Morkel 16) I told you Styris looked good. That was one shot too many. He charged Morkel and tried a roundhouse slap over the off side, but the ball flew off the bottom edge and onto the stumps.  38th over: New Zealand 154-4 (Ryder 83, Williamson 1) Just one from Morkel&apos;s over, and the wicket. &quot;As a player for The Stockholm Academicals in the prestigious Swedish Premier (well, only) League, I&apos;d like to formally invite Lord Selvey to report on one of our matches this summer,&quot; says Dan MacDonald. &quot;I can personally vouch for his safety, although some of my shot selection will almost certainly be criminal.&quot;  WICKET! New Zealand 156-5 (Ryder c sub (Ingram) b Tahir 83) New Zealand are starting to subside. Ryder top edges a sweep straight to deep square leg, and the substitute Colin Ingram takes an easy catch. Tahir charges around in celebration like a man who has cured baldness, banging his head back and forth in delight. There are few bowlers in world cricket who enjoy taking wickets as much as he does.  39th over: New Zealand 157-5 (Williamson 3, N McCullum 0) Williamson cannot afford to hang around here. It&apos;s a big ask for a 20-year-old, but he needs to play himself in with singles, not dot balls. Just two runs from the over. &quot;Apologies for attempting to use you like a local radio station,&quot; says Nick Williamson, &quot;but if you were able to post a message about my JustGiving page I&apos;d be very grateful indeed. I am a member of a team from Scottish Widows which is taking part in the Intelligent Sport UK Challenge in Exmoor from 16-19 June 2011. We are competing to raise funds on behalf of Children 1st (effectively the Scottish branch of the NSPCC), which is obviously a great cause. Even better is that Lloyds Banking Group (of which we are part) has pledged to match anything we manage to raise.&quot;  40th over: New Zealand 164-5 (Williamson 10, N McCullum 0) Wiliamson edges Morkel just short of Smith at slip. He then works one nicely through midwicket for three in an over that brings seven. New Zealand are still just about in this game. &quot;Mark Taylor can avoid his manager&apos;s glare by using the right mouse button to bring up a menu, and the left clicking refresh,&quot; says Paul Wakefield, who may or may not have thought this through.  41st over: New Zealand 168-5 (Williamson 12, N McCullum 2) Four singles from Tahir&apos;s over. &quot;Having met the erstwhile children&apos;s TV presenter Dave Benson Phillips, I can assure you that that lass on Dancing on Ice&apos;s jauntiness would pale into insignificance,&quot; says James Prout. &quot;He is as jaunty and relentlessly happy at 6 in the morning off stage/camera as he is at 4 in the afternoon on stage/camera dropping parents into the gunk dunk. Yes the time I met him at that ungodly hour, I was hungover. My day was a long and tortuous one.&quot;  42nd over: New Zealand 169-5 (Williamson 12, N McCullum 3) Nathan McCullum edges Steyn&apos;s second ball on the half volley to the keeper de Villiers. Only one run from an excellent over. &quot;To be absolutely certain of an early start, make sure you acquire not only a small child, but at least one cat,&quot; says Richard O&apos;Hagan. &quot;If the child does not wake you at the crack of dawn, the cat almost certainly will. For guaranteed results, get more than one cat, that way you can be sure that if one of them isn&apos;t moaning about a lack of food or trying to show off a mouse, the other certainly will be. Or they&apos;ll be fighting with each other. I&apos;ve even tried making mine watch Tom &amp; Jerry and they still don&apos;t get it.&quot;  43rd over: New Zealand 171-5 (Williamson 13, N McCullum 4) South Africa are squeezing this innings very impressively. Two from Peterson&apos;s over, which means the last six have brought only 18 runs and two wickets. &quot;I had two root canals last Friday,&quot; chirps Michael Behl. &quot;The pain wasn&apos;t too bad but on Wednesday night I was eating pasta sauce with bacon in it, I bit down on a piece of bacon and it hurt, like really, really hurt. I never thought bacon would ever cause me pain. Now I&apos;ve been in pain since then and I have a final root canal booked for 3.45pm today. This pretty much ruins my Friday, the only thing I could hope for is South Africa losing, it would alleviate some of the inevitable pain.&quot; Root canals on consecutive Fridays? Dumb luck. That gives a whole new meaning to the Friday feeling.  44th over: New Zealand 174-5 (Williamson 15, N McCullum 5) Still no sign of a Powerplay, or any power play. Three singles from Steyn&apos;s over. This is slipping away from New Zealand. &quot;Robin Hazlehurst&apos;s advice in the 8th over,&quot; begins Steve Johnson. &quot;Because it was very boring you won&apos;t recall that you posted my advice earlier this tournament regarding the positives of small children in overcoming the &apos;clean glasses&apos; fixation. Are you starting to see a trend? Listen to the fans, Smyth. Listen to the fans. You know it makes sense\u2026 (I can&apos;t provide much advice on the &apos;finding the right woman&apos; bit. Except these things take time, even if you&apos;re the most inept etc.)&quot;  45th over: New Zealand 187-5 (Williamson 23, N McCullum 6) New Zealand finally take the batting Powerplay, and Robin Peterson&apos;s ninth over disappears for 13. Williamson mows the second over ball over mid on for six, a fine shot, and then McCullum misses a huge swipe at a ball that races away for four byes. &quot;SA choking again...&quot; says Andre van der Walt. &quot;Luckily they&apos;re choking NZ this time.&quot;  WICKET! New Zealand 188-6 (N McCullum c Duminy b Steyn 6) This might be a blessing in disguise for New Zealand. Nathan McCullum&apos;s grim innings of 6 in 18 balls, in which the only thing he middled was fresh air, ends when he swipes a slower ball from Steyn up in the air and straight to point. Great work from Steyn, who is a master when it comes to death bowling. And new-ball bowling, and middle-overs bowling...  46th over: New Zealand 189-6 (Williamson 24, Oram 0) Steyn has brilliant figures of 8-0-25-2. He is so good.  47th over: New Zealand 196-6 (Williamson 26, Oram 6) Jacob Oram just need to score 40 not out off 15 balls. No pressure. He sweeps his second ball, from Tahir, behind square for four. &quot;Can someone explain why Oram is batting below Nathan McCullum?&quot; says Anand. &quot;Wasn&apos;t Oram supposed to be one of the big hitters?&quot; No and yes.  48th over: New Zealand 203-6 (Williamson 32, Oram 7) No boundaries in that Steyn over, but New Zealand do manage to bust their lungs to the tune of seven runs. Williamson would have been miles out had Faf du Plessis hit the stumps from mid off.  WICKET! New Zealand 204-7 (Oram b Morkel 7) Oram misses, Morkel hits, and New Zealand&apos;s hopes of 230 or more have now gone. That was an excellent first delivery back from Morkel, right on target and hitting the top of off stump when Oram missed a mighty hoick.  WICKET! New Zealand 210-8 (Vettori b Morkel 6) Morne Morkel cleans Vettori up with a wonderful slower yorker. Seven balls remaining. There was an odd bit of commentary from Mark Nicholas, who screamed &quot;EEEEEEEEE&apos;S GOT &apos;IM!&quot; but with the &quot;EEEEE&quot; sounding like something out of Bullseye.  49th over: New Zealand 211-8 (Williamson 32, Woodcock 1) From the last 12 overs, New Zealand have scored 58 for the loss of five wickets. South Africa have been fantastic in the field.  50th over: New Zealand 221-8 (Williamson 38, Woodcock 3) The last over of the innings from Steyn goes for 10, including a boundary over extra cover from Williamson and a wide off what should have been the last ball. Williamson&apos;s cameo of 38 from 41 balls has given New Zealand a chance, but South Africa were superb in the field and would probably reach their target of 222 nine times out of ten. Alan Gardner will type you through the first 10 overs of New Zealand reply in half an hour or so; you can email him on alan.gardner.casual@theguardian.com.  INNINGS BREAK  Afternoon, chooks. How are we? I was going to mock up a picture of Graeme Smith wearing a snood to display at the top of the page throughout the South Africa run chase but in the end I  couldn&apos;t be bothered  didn&apos;t have time. Anyway, to those asking about the absence of scorecard and popup \u2013 we only get them for England games. You didn&apos;t think this was a proper operation, did you? Here&apos;s Ant Pease: &quot;Short of turning up like The Dude from The Big Lebowski (or El Duderino if you&apos;re not into that whole brevity thing) complete with jazz woodbine, how can your email officially pronounce you to be more casual than Bull?&quot; Haven&apos;t you seen Bully&apos;s new byline photo? He&apos;s a married man, now. The Dude abides no longer ...  1st over: South Africa 8-0 (target: 222, Amla 7, Smith 1) South Africa can&apos;t mess this one up, can they? Anyway, we&apos;re about to get going again. Nathan McCullum is going to bowl the first over \u2013 a somewhat leftfield choice, even by this tournament&apos;s standards. He&apos;s also starting around the wicket, to the right-handed Amla ... who leans into a couple of lazily effective cover drives, taking a two and a four from the first three balls. Hang on, what&apos;s this ...  WICKET! Amla c Vettori b N McCullum 7 (1st over: South Africa 8-1, target: 222) That&apos;s a very unfortunate way to go, as Amla is caught at slip after his edge rebounded up off wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum&apos;s boot! It looked like a bump-ball on first sight but the McCullums and Vettori both knew what had happened. Amla cut a ball that kept low, the shot deflecting on to the toe of McCullum&apos;s boot and popping straight up to Vettori.  2nd over: South Africa 10-1 (target: 222, Smith 3, Kallis 0) &quot;I generally dont like to do a Warnie, but I predict NZ will win this match by about 15 runs with Daniel Vettori scaring the SA with his moustache to get five wickets,&quot; prognosticates Pratik Dubey. Vettori, sadly, has got rid of his &apos;stache, but he opens at the other end \u2013 spinners at both ends! Smith almost runs himself out but just manages to beat the direct hit from long-leg.  3rd over: South Africa 15-1 (target: 222, Smith 6, Kallis 2) It&apos;s an over of shoes (ones and twos, for those wanting in their cockney) from McCullum. The good news for South Africa is that New Zealand were 6-1 for one after three overs of their innings. They&apos;re miles ahead! &quot;The run chase total is ominous,&quot; warns Ian Copestake. &quot;In South Africa 222 is the number of Diabilto, the very small devil.&quot; Has anyone ever had to chase 666? Obviously you&apos;d have no chance of getting it ...  4th over: South Africa 18-1 (target: 222, Smith 6, Kallis 5) Here&apos;s a good link from Mo Holkar, who points out that Amla&apos;s dismissal is reminiscent of this David Gower number. You do see them ... I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a more recent example lurking in among the shadowy recesses of my brain. Vettori rattles through six balls of left-arm darts.  5th over: South Africa 20-1 (target: 222, Smith 7, Kallis 6) Brendon McCullum thinks he&apos;s got Kallis, strangled down the legside off his brother&apos;s bowling ... but it looks like it just clipped his pads. The good thing about there being two spinners on so early is that I&apos;ll get to hand back to Smyth asap; the bad: I have no time to get up to speed!  6th over: South Africa 27-1 (target: 222, Smith 8, Kallis 12) The bear thumps a drive down the ground for four ... and then gets hit on his back pad after stomping down the track. New Zealand decide not to review it and although it was probably hitting leg the decision wouldn&apos;t have been overturned. &quot;Anand here,&quot; writes Anand, helpfully, &quot;writing from the Netherlands. Have you ever seen something as garish as McCullum&apos;s gloves? Looks like one of those traffic policemen. IF he were a bowler wearing an arm band like that, I am sure the batsmen would object. If SRT, the man who can detect miniscule movement in and around the sightscreen were to bat, he would object to the gloves ;).&quot; They&apos;re not as bad as Kevin O&apos;Brien&apos;s hairdo.  7th over: South Africa 33-1 (target: 222, Smith 9, Kallis 17) Tim Southee comes on to give these opening exchanges a more traditional flavour. He&apos;s joint-fourth on the tournament wicket-takers list but it doesn&apos;t look like the pitch will be offering him much assistance today. Kallis pings one off his legs for four. &quot;Don&apos;t know about chasing 666,&quot; says Vincent Barreto, &quot;but Victoria beat Tasmania by an innings and 666 runs in Melbourne about 1922 \u2026 and Tasmania has devils!!!&quot; Irony, eh? If I only I knew what it meant.  8th over: South Africa 36-1 (target: 222, Smith 11, Kallis 18) Vettori (4-0-15-0) continues to keep a lid on things. A delivery that drifted across Smith but didn&apos;t turn appreciably snicks a thick-ish outside edge, with the ball running down towards third man for a couple. A first half-century of the tournament from Smith would go a long way to averting South Africa&apos;s need for the Heimlich manoeuvre at any stage today.  9th over: South Africa 44-1 (target: 222, Smith 13, Kallis 24) A top edged hook from Kallis alls short of the man running in from long leg. Southee then strays on to Kallis&apos;s pads and he swats the ball away like (stretched simile alert!) a bear dismissing bees as he goes about collecting his honey. &quot;As a mnemonic, I find irony to be very much like rain on your wedding day. I&apos;m sure other examples also exist.&quot; Intriguing, Ant Pease. Tell us more.  10th over: South Africa 50-1 (target: 222, Smith 18, Kallis 25) [Edges towards exit] So, Oram&apos;s coming on to chop down some trees/take a few Saffer wickets, just as Rob prepares to retake his sweaty seat. If someone could Photoshop a picture of Oram as a lumberjack and then send it in, you&apos;d make me very happy. Oram is pretty accurate from the get-go but his last ball is wide and slashed through point for four by Smith. Right, now send your static and feedback to rob.smyth@theguardian.com. I need some lunch.  11th over: South Africa 54-1 (target: 222, Smith 20, Kallis 27) Hello boys! Southee forces Kallis to take evasive action with a good bouncer in an over that includes four singles. South Africa are cruising and are going to have to work extremely hard to cock this up.  12th over: South Africa 58-1 (target: 222, Smith 22, Kallis 29) Oram galumphs in for some more. It&apos;s all a bit futile, and not in the Nathan Barley sense. Four singles from the over. &quot;Is there anything more disconcerting than filling in a hotel mini-bar form whilst very hungover and seeing that the purchase options include mouthwash and shoe polish,&quot; weeps Stephen Cottreell. &quot;For one horrible moment I thought I&apos;d bottomed out. Like Christopher sitting on Ade&apos;s dog in the Sopranos.&quot;  13th over: South Africa 60-1 (target: 222, Smith 23, Kallis 30) Two more singles from Southee&apos;s over. This is easy for South Africa. Somewhere in a dark corner of my brain, Big Daddy is beating his chest, Tarzan-style, while a baying crowd chant &quot;EASY! EASY! EASY!&quot; I do miss Big Daddy. Look at the state of this. &quot;I&apos;m going to the cinema tomorrow to see Submarine,&quot; says Louise Wright, mistaking this for Twitter. &quot;My dad is going with me. It&apos;s suddenly occurred to me that with it being a coming-of-age film, it might be full of sex scenes and thus be v embarrassing to watch when accompanied by a parent. Anyone seen it and know whether I&apos;ve made a dreadful choice of film in that respect, please? If so, suggestions for avoidance tactics would be welcome.&quot; One of my best friends went to see American Pie with his ma. Imagine.  14th over: South Africa 68-1 (target: 222, Smith 28, Kallis 33) The left-arm spinner Luke Woodcock, playing only his third ODI, comes on to bowl. His first ball is a nervous wide half-volley that Smith blitzes through extra cover for four, but the fourth is a brute that spits past Kallis&apos;s outside edge. Where did that come from?  WICKET! South Africa 69-2 (Smith c sub (How) b Oram 28) Graeme Smith&apos;s poor tournament continues with a very soft dismissal. He reached well wide of off stump at a nothing delivery from Jacob Oram and sliced it straight to backward point, where the substitute Jamie How took a smart catch moving to his left.  15th over: South Africa 69-2 (target: 222, Kallis 34, de Villiers 0) This is the big partnership, between arguably South Africa&apos;s two best batsmen. If New Zealand can winkle out one more then South Africa will be three down. &quot;I saw Submarine last night,&quot; says Jos Roberts, mistaking this for Twitter. &quot;Nothing really to make your parents uncomfortable, other than Paddy Considine with an amazing mullet! Pretty funny though.&quot;  16th over: South Africa 72-2 (target: 222, Kallis 36, de Villiers 1) Three singles from Woodcock&apos;s over, which includes a couple of excellent stops from Guptill in the covers. &quot;When I came of age,&quot; says Ian Copestake, &quot;there was no sex involved.&quot;  17th over: South Africa 74-2 (target: 222, Kallis 38, de Villiers 1) Kallis flicks Oram to leg for a couple, the only runs from that over. It&apos;s a fairly quiet spell in the match.  18th over: South Africa 81-2 (target: 222, Kallis 39, de Villiers 7) Woodcock is having a bad time of it. His first ball is a full toss that de Villiers clips for four, and there are three more singles. South Africa need 131 from 32 overs. It should be a doddle. Should.  19th over: South Africa 81-2 (target: 222, Kallis 39, de Villiers 7) Oram bowls a good maiden to de Villiers, so his figures are now 5-1-13-1. &quot;I&apos;ve learnt two valuable lessons today,&quot; says Lizzy Ammon. &quot;1) Never bet on Graeme Smith 2) don&apos;t expect a four-year-old to prefer watching NZ vs SA to watching Star Wars. There was a physical wrestle for the remote. I didn&apos;t win.&quot;  20th over: South Africa 87-2 (target: 222, Kallis 41, de Villiers 11) Vettori brings himself on for Woodcock, which has to be the right move. Five from the over, including a very tight two to third man from de Villiers. &quot;When I first moved to the UK I had trouble grasping your concept of &apos;irony&apos;,&quot; says Marie Meyer. &quot;Then I went to Torquay for a weekend because I had heard it described as &apos;the English Riviera&apos;. I get it now.&quot;  21th over: South Africa 93-2 (target: 222, Kallis 42, de Villiers 16) That is an exquisite stroke from AB de Villiers, a square drive for four from a perfectly good delivery by Oram. Things may change, but for the moment this feels like a totally routine run chase. &quot;Lizzy Ammon&apos;s four-year-old sounds like a Big Daddy in the making,&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;All he needs to complete his fate is to be called Shirley.&quot;  22nd over: South Africa 97-2 (target: 222, Kallis 45, de Villiers 17) Kallis charges Vettori but is beaten in the flight, and his drive lands just in front of the man running back from mid on. The next ball is fluller and quicker and zips past the outside edge. Very smart bowling from Vettori.  23rd over: South Africa 103-2 (target: 222, Kallis 46, de Villiers 22) Another wonderfully timed drive from de Villiers, this time through the covers for four off Southee. He has a disgusting amount of ability. Kallis then survives a token run-out referral after a direct hit from mid on. &quot;My old English teacher took his wife to see American Pie in the mistaken belief it was American Beauty,&quot; says Andrew Fraser. &quot;He told us that he wasn&apos;t sure it was quite the classic others claimed it as\u2026&quot; When I was about 12 my Dad asked me to recommend some films that he could order from his book club thing. I knew he liked cop films, but I got 48 Hours mixed up with 9 1/2 Weeks. I wish I was making that up.  24th over: South Africa 108-2 (target: 222, Kallis 47, de Villiers 25) Kallis is slow to set off for a leg bye towards square leg and would probably have been run out by a direct hit from the wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum. Five from Vettori&apos;s over. &quot;There&apos;s a scene in Being There where Shirley MacLaine takes Peter Sellers&apos; oft-stated line of &apos;I like to watch&apos; very literally,&quot; says Matt Emerson. &quot;I watched that with my Mum and my Nan when I was about 14...my face could have been used on a Pantone reference chart as a replacement for crimson...&quot;  WICKET! South Africa 108-3 (Kallis c Oram b Southee 47) A fantastic running catch from Jacob Oram gives New Zealand a sniff. Kallis clubbed a mighty pull towards deep midwicket, where Oram appeared from nowhere to take a two-handed catch above his head on the run. That&apos;s a brilliant piece of fielding, especially for such a giant man.  25th over: South Africa 110-3 (target: 222, de Villiers 26, Duminy 1) Another quick wicket would make this really interesting, because South Africa have a relatively fragile lower order. &quot;I have a picture of Giant Haystacks in my wallet that I have had for twenty years,&quot; says David Weston. &quot;It is torn from a pub quiz sheet. The quiz was in the Johnson Arms public house in Dunkirk, Nottingham. I&apos;ll let you see it if you want.&quot; I like the fact that you don&apos;t feel the need to explain this behaviour. After all, keeping a picture of a huge hirsute wrestler in a wallet is precisely what all right-thinking people would do.  26th over: South Africa 113-3 (target: 222, de Villiers 28, Duminy 2) Nathan McCullum replaces Vettori, who bowled better than figures of 7-0-29-0 suggest. Three from a quiet over. &quot;My American inlaws, septuagenarians both, decided to go and see the film Quills (which, for the uninitiated, is about the Marquis de Sade),&quot; says Richard O&apos;Hagan. &quot;I think they are still recovering from the experience.&quot; They are not the only ones.  27th over: South Africa 120-3 (target: 222, de Villiers 34, Duminy 3) Duminy drags an attempted pull onto his body off the bowling of Southee; then de Villiers played a stunning on drive for four, through the legs of Duminy at the non-striker&apos;s end. He looks in fantastic nick. &quot;The 48 Hours/9 1/2 weeks confusion is understandable,&quot; says Dan Smith. &quot;9 1/2 weeks is a completely unrealistic period for a passionate love affair. While &apos;Gone in 60 Seconds&apos; turns out to be a film about car theft.&quot;  WICKET! South Africa 121-4 (Duminy b N McCullum 3) Now then. Duminy misses an angled-bat slap at a flighted delivery from McCullum that goes straight on to hit the off stump. That&apos;s a hideous shot. Every time you think the game is going away from New Zealand they take a wicket. If they get one more they will arguably be on top.  WICKET! South Africa 121-5 (de Villiers run out 35) It&apos;s happening. South Africa are doing it again. I don&apos;t believe this. New Zealand have got the huge wicket of AB de Villiers, who was called through for a seriously dodgy single to midwicket and was just short of his ground when Brendon McCullum claimed the throw from Guptill and shattered the stumps. It went to the third umpire but New Zealand knew it was out. Before leaving the crease, de Villiers almost kicked off with a couple of New Zealand fielders, presumably because of an overzealous send-off. This is a remarkable turnaround, and that is such a big wicket because de Villiers was in sublime touch.  28th over: South Africa 121-5 (target: 222, du Plessis 0, Botha 0) They couldn&apos;t. Could they? In fact, what happened with de Villiers was this: a number of New Zealand fielders, including the substitute Kyle Mills, were right in du Plessis&apos;s grille, pointing out that he had run out the best player, so de Villiers came over to support du Plessis. A couple of them will get done by the match referee. If they win, they will not care one jot about that. &quot;Statistics question,&quot; says Andre Van der Walt. &quot;Has anyone ever followed OBO when they had the option to watch a match?&quot; That&apos;s not a statistics question. That&apos;s a just-how-badly-has-humanity-gone-wrong question.  29th over: South Africa 122-5 (target: 222, du Plessis 1, Botha 0) Aggressive captaincy from Daniel Vettori, who brings himself back into the attack. He almost skids a couple of quicker ones through du Plessis, and there&apos;s just one from the over. &quot;Those collars are starting to look a bit tight on the South African jerseys,&quot; says Mark O&apos;Neil.  30th over: South Africa 123-5 (target: 222, du Plessis 2, Botha 0) South Africa&apos;s lower order has some handy players, most notably Botha and Peterson, but it&apos;s nowhere near the McMillian-Pollock-Klusener vintage. One from McCullum&apos;s over. This game is wide open now, and in fact New Zealand are probably marginal favourites. &quot;I still cringe at the memory of seeing Se7en with my mum when I was just 18,&quot; says Andrew Banks. &quot;She overheard me saying I wanted to see it on the phone and decided to treat me despite my protestations that she wouldn&apos;t like it. Not sure she&apos;s recovered, and sticks almost entirely to Miss Marple nowadays...&quot;  31st over: South Africa 125-5 (target: 222, du Plessis 3, Botha 1) Woodcock replaces Vettori and has a biggish shout for LBW against du Plessis. It was going down leg. Just two from the over, and the requirement is now 97 from 114 balls. &quot;Unless South Africa can call up a last minute replacement and get their young off-spinner Heimlich in at 8, you&apos;d have to say it looks like they&apos;re doing it again,&quot; says Ant Pease. Honk!  32nd over: South Africa 127-5 (target: 222, du Plessis 4, Botha 2) The South African batsmen are just regrouping for now. They look shell-shocked. The last five overs have brought seven runs and two wickets. &quot;I often OBO whilst watching a game, sometimes even the same game,&quot; says Richard O&apos;Hagan. &quot;However, I am ferociously loyal and would never try and OBO/MBM several different sports at once *coughNAYLORcoughcoughcough*&quot;  WICKET! South Africa 128-6 (Botha b Oram 2) This is an astonishing collapse. Botha is bowled by a beautiful leg cutter from Oram that hits the top of off stump. That is a jaffa. South Africa have lost three wickets for eight in six overs, and if they lose this match they are never \u2013 ever \u2013 going to hear the end of it.  33rd over: South Africa 128-6 (target: 222, du Plessis 5, Peterson 0) Even before that wicket, one of the South African backroom staff had his head in his hands. Then he started shaking his head sadly. He&apos;s completely given up! That&apos;s hilarious. He might as well be listening to this. &quot;I saw Four Weddings and a Funeral with my parents when I was 15,&quot; says Paul Wakefield. &quot;The loud sex scene left me utterly mortified, whilst my parents thought it hilarious.&quot; The scene, your mortification, or both?  34th over: South Africa 129-6 (target: 222, du Plessis 6, Peterson 0) Is it still deja vu if it happens again and again? Nathan McCullum is in his element, racing through his overs in little more than a couple of minutes. Only one run from that, which makes it nine from the last seven.  WICKET! South Africa 132-7 (Peterson c B McCullum b Oram 0) South Africa have completely gone. Peterson wafts hideously outside off stump and gets a thin inside edge to the keeper. South Africa have lost four wickets for 11 runs in eight never-to-be-forgotten overs.  35th over: South Africa 141-7 (target: 222, du Plessis 13, Steyn 5) Steyn touches his first ball to the fine leg boundary and then du Plessis, who has to play his shots, slams a superb boundary through extra cover. South Africa will not believe this is happening to them again. It was supposed to be different this time. They had proved they were a different team by winning Test series in Australia, England and Pakistan. They had the variety in their attack, the experience in their top order. They won the group and got the easiest quarter-final draw. They started the quarter-final brilliantly, calmly controlling it for 75 overs. And then it happened. Like it always bloody happens.  36th over: South Africa 142-7 (target: 222, du Plessis 13, Steyn 6) Steyn is a very tough man, an Australian in nature, and he is well capable of hanging around for 10 overs if du Plessis can do the bulk of the scoring. Steyn works the last ball of McCullum&apos;s over for a single, the only run from that over. &quot;I&apos;m contemplating making strangled and spluttering sounds at my South African mate after he took such pleasure in England losing to Ireland,&quot; says Mike McCarthy. &quot;Contemplating it, because (a) we&apos;ll lose by 200 runs tomorrow and (b) he&apos;s a lot harder than me.&quot;  37th over: South Africa 146-7 (target: 222, du Plessis 15, Steyn 7) Luke Woodcock comes back into the attack. His six remaining overs are so important, because he has been NZ&apos;s weakest bowler today, and he starts with a wide. Four from the over. New Zealand might have to think about using a sixth bowler, maybe Scott Styris or Jesse Ryder. &quot;When I went travelling at 18, I stopped off at my great uncle and aunt in Canada,&quot; says Andrew Fraser. &quot;Me and my friend convinced my great uncle to join his local video rental store and took out loads of films to while away the Canadian evenings. This seemingly foolproof plan collapsed as badly as the Saffers are when my great aunt joined us for American History... I still sweat when I think back to her reaction to the vigorous sex scene that starts the film. And not in a good way.&quot;  WICKET! South Africa 146-8 (Steyn c Oram b N McCullum 8) What hell kinda shot is that? Steyn was inadvertently monopolising the strike, and the pressure \u2013 dot, dot, dot\u00a0\u2013 got to him when he had a gruesome heave that flew off the edge. Oram, who couldn&apos;t stay out of this game if he tried, took a gleeful catch diving forward at backward point.  38th over: South Africa 146-8 (target: 222, du Plessis 15, Morkel 0) Nathan McCullum finished with sensational figures of 10-1-24-3. South Africa were 120 for three after 27 overs, you know. I told you New Zealand just needed to stay in the game! And, while people will focus on South Africa, New Zealand have been wonderful. The moment they smelt weakness, they were all over South Africa like a cheap rash. &quot;It&apos;s d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again&apos;,&quot; quotes Daniel Harris. &quot;Berra explained that this quote originated when he witnessed Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris repeatedly hit back-to-back home runs in the Yankees&apos; seasons in the early 1960s.&quot;  39th over: South Africa 150-8 (target: 222, du Plessis 17, Morkel 1) South Africa have taken the batting Powerplay, a desperate move that presumably means du Plessis is going to go for it. Vettori counters by bringing himself back into the attack. du Plessis square drives for a couple and then drives a single down the ground. Here&apos;s a simple email from Rahul Nayyar, which will some up how plenty of folk are feeling: &quot;Can&apos;t stop laughing.&quot; Then, just in case I miss that email, he follows up with &quot;ROFL&quot;. You have to feel for South Africa, though. Of all their chokes, this is probably the worst.  40th over: South Africa 156-8 (target: 222, du Plessis 22, Morkel 2) du Plessis smears an attempted yorker from Southee down the ground for four. This isn&apos;t quite over, not while he is there and not while New Zealand still have five fifth-bowler overs to bowl. South Africa need 66 from 10 overs with two wickets remaining.. As Mark Corrigan says at the start of season four of Peep Show, how the eff has it come to this? &quot;When New Zealand were scoring slowly and losing wickets, you were full of praise for South Africa&apos;s skill and pressure,&quot; says Andy Fyfe. &quot;Now it&apos;s all about how South Africa are throwing it away. Maybe some respect for NZ is in order? They&apos;ve stuck with a plan (flawed as it may have been during their innings), backed themselves \u2013 a trait commentators are only too happy to recognise in Australia and England \u2013 and now the pressure they&apos;ve applied is paying off. There are two teams playing this game...&quot; Yep, it&apos;s a fair cop. Inevitably we focus on South Africa when something like this happens, but New Zealand have been great in the field \u2013 particularly Vettori as captain.  41st over: South Africa 161-8 (target: 222, du Plessis 27, Morkel 2) du Plessis turned down a run off the last ball of the previous over, so that he could keep the strike, and he whips Vettori&apos;s third ball superbly past mid on for four. Five from the over, and Gary Naylor has just reminded me of this email, sent much earlier in this innings: &quot;Re: 11th over: &apos;South Africa are cruising and are going to have to work extremely hard to cock this up&apos;. You really are such an old hand at the OBO game aren&apos;t you? Like Glenn McGrath setting up a batsman with five short of a length before the toe-crusher.&quot;  42nd over: South Africa 164-8 (need 58 from 48 balls; du Plessis 29, Morkel 3) Just three singles from Southee&apos;s over. That means that du Plessis keeps the strike, but the required rate has risen above seven an over. Meanwhile, Stephen Cottrell has a pop quiz for us, but you don&apos;t need to be a hotshot to get the right answer: &quot;Which C was a 1990 album by the Beautiful South, following their 1989 debut, &apos;Welcome to the Beautiful South&apos;?&quot;  WICKET! South Africa 172-9 (du Plessis c Southee b Oram 36) It&apos;s all over. du Plessis, dropped earlier in the over, rifles Oram low to cover, where Southee takes a good low catch on the edge of the circle. In the commentary box, Mark Nicholas actually starts singing &quot;Oraaaaaaaaam!&quot; Seriously, he started singing. Singing. But you can understand why, because Jacob Oram has had an incredible hour and a half in the field and with the ball.  43rd over: South Africa 172-9 (need 50 from 42 balls; Morkel 4, Tahir 0) The No11, Imran Tahir, is about as good a batsman as me or you, so don&apos;t expect any miracles. This is a mind-blowing collapse. &quot;Deja vu is illusory, which is presumably what SA are experiencing as they&apos;ll think it&apos;s all a bad dream,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;What we have here is serial vu.&quot;  WICKET! South Africa 172 all out (Morkel c sub b Woodcock 4). NEW ZEALAND WIN BY 49 RUNS Morne Morkel clouts Luke Woodcock to Jamie How at long off to spark delirious celebrations in Mirpur. New Zealand cannot believe they have won this game. Nobody can. It&apos;s one of the most amazing twists in World Cup history. South Africa were 108 for two and then 121 for three, but they fell apart in a fashion that was astonishing even by their standards. New Zealand were outplayed for 75 overs, yet they stayed in the game and then mauled South Africa when the pressure was on. It&apos;s a stunning performance from a team who always overachieve at World Cups, and who will now play in their sixth World Cup semi-final out of ten \u2013 even though this is the first knockout game they have ever won. But, really, today is all about South Africa. Graeme Smith walks onto the field wearing a million-yard stare. You would not believe the puss on him. After four years of almost ceaseless excellence from South Africa in all forms of the game, it is going to take them a long, long time to understand how and why this happened. They probably never will. Thanks for your emails. See you tomorrow for the other quarter-final; I forget who&apos;s playing.", "title": "New Zealand v South Africa - as it happened | Rob Smyth", "sentences": ["&quot;There&apos;s not much interest in NZ /SA here in Dubai on a lovely weekend afternoon,&quot; says Bob Cochrane."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-25T08:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/25/rick-parry-liverpool-sale", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Football", "Sport", "Tom Hicks"], "article": "The former Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry has defended the decision to sell the club to George Gillett and Tom Hicks in 2007. It has been widely-reported that Hicks and Gillett assumed control of the club despite a rival offer from Dubai International Capital (DIC) but Parry, who along with the then chairman and owner David Moores made the decision to sell to the American duo, insists that DIC were not in the running. &quot;It wasn&apos;t a case of us rejecting Dubai,&quot; Parry told London&apos;s Evening Standard. &quot;They were the preferred bidder but they walked away.&quot; The reign of Hicks and Gillett, which ended when Fenway Sports Group bought the club last year after a bitter court battle, was punctuated by public arguments between the two owners, between Hicks and Parry and disagreements between the then manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez and the owners. The much-heralded new stadium in Stanley Park failed to materialise and the club struggled under the weight of the large amount of debt which was placed on the club by Hicks and Gillett. Parry believes much of the difficulty stemmed from the fractious nature of the relationship between the owners. &quot;I think one of the fundamental [problems] was that they actually didn&apos;t get on terribly well with each other,&quot; Parry explains. Parry left the club in 2009 and, despite the often haphazard nature of the Hicks and Gillet era, he feels that for a period of time at least things were going well. &quot;Don&apos;t forget and certainly until I left \u2013 which was 2009 \u2013 we were second in the league. The business plan was a net spend of \u00a320m on players. And they&apos;d over delivered on that. They took us pretty close to winning the Premier League in 2008-2009, within four points of Manchester United with a huge points total. &quot;So it wasn&apos;t all doom and gloom. Then, in 2009, for whatever reason, there didn&apos;t appear to be any net spend at all on the players. By which time they clearly realised that they probably needed to sell completely.&quot; Parry also stressed that despite what seemed to be a hostile relationship, he remains on good terms with Ben\u00edtez. &quot;You don&apos;t get into the business if you want people who are easy,&quot; he said. &quot;You want people who are winners. He&apos;s very demanding and he&apos;s a perfectionist. But I&apos;m still friendly with Rafael.&quot;", "title": "Rick Parry defends decision to sell Liverpool to American duo in 2007", "sentences": ["It has been widely-reported that Hicks and Gillett assumed control of the club despite a rival offer from Dubai International Capital (DIC) but Parry, who along with the then chairman and owner David Moores made the decision to sell to the American duo, insists that DIC were not in the running.", "&quot;It wasn&apos;t a case of us rejecting Dubai,&quot; Parry told London&apos;s Evening Standard."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-25T15:29:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/mar/25/henry-cecil-world-cup-desire", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Dubai World Cup", "Sir Henry Cecil"], "article": "Henry Cecil has achieved too much, and endured too much, to allow a single race to get under his skin, even if it is worth $10m (\u00a36.2m). But as he has prepared to saddle Twice Over, the favourite, for the Dubai World Cup at Meydan on Saturday, it has been hard to escape the conclusion that there are 10,000,001 reasons why he is unusually eager to succeed. Cecil&apos;s trademark nonchalance and gentle self-deprecation when interviewed by the media have always hidden a fiercely competitive streak that runs from his head to the toes of his Italian loafers. That will to win has carried him through a long series of professional and personal setbacks, and last year&apos;s Dubai World Cup, the first to be run at Meydan, still nags at him as one that got away. There was no doubting how strongly Cecil fancied Twice Over 12 months ago, but he drew a wide stall, got caught on the outside around the first turn and eventually finished 10th of the 14 runners. Flat trainers rarely look beyond the end of the season when making plans for their horses, but Cecil was talking about the World Cup as early as last July, when Twice Over won the Eclipse at Sandown, and now the opportunity has arrived to set the record straight. Attention to detail is a hallmark of all the great trainers and Cecil has left nothing to chance. This time around, Twice Over has been here for several weeks to acclimatise and had a prep race, too, in a Group Two event this month, which he won by nearly three lengths. Cecil&apos;s blacksmith has also refined special shoes to protect Twice Over&apos;s delicate feet, and even from his base in Newmarket, where he has been preparing his horses for the new Flat season, the trainer has been in constant touch. &quot;I wish I could have spent more time over here,&quot; Cecil said on Friday, &quot;but we&apos;ve got 130 horses at home and the season is less than three weeks away.&quot; &quot;Having had things go wrong [last year], we don&apos;t want to leave on that note and the main thing is to come back and try to get it right. The important thing is to adapt to the [synthetic] surface, so we tried something different, coming out here and having a race, and hopefully we&apos;ve got the timing right. &quot;I&apos;ve kept him on the surface rather than going on to the grass or the training tracks. He&apos;s handling it much better through the experience, he&apos;s definitely adapted himself well now, which he hadn&apos;t last year and he&apos;s actually better in every way.&quot; Cecil has always relied on his eyes and instincts when training his horses rather than some of the modern aids employed by other trainers. When a South African journalist asked him whether Twice Over is heavier this year, which would be a routine question for many modern trainers, Cecil replied that he did not have a clue, since he never weighs his horses. &quot;It sounds very amateurish, but I like to think that by looking at my horses I know when they&apos;re well,&quot; he said. &quot;Sorry.&quot; Twice Over&apos;s work is not timed either. &quot;When I gallop my horses, I don&apos;t use stopwatches or anything like that,&quot; Cecil said. &quot;I don&apos;t know whether they&apos;re working at 30mph or five miles per hour. Everything is done within themselves, I don&apos;t really let them down.&quot; Twice Over, then, will go to the starting gate at this ultra-modern racecourse on Saturday with the benefit of a very traditional training programme behind him, but one that has been overseen by the most accomplished British trainer of the last 40 years. Just over a week ago, Cecil demonstrated that, to him, every race matters when he saddled Plato \u2013 who looked fit and well enough to run in a Derby \u2013 to win a charity event at the Cheltenham Festival. Now he has a chance to win the world&apos;s richest race for the first time, with a horse who has become one of his favourites. &quot;You do get very attached to them,&quot; he said. &quot;He&apos;s been a very good friend and helped me a lot. Good horses help make successful trainers and jockeys. If I have bad horses, I&apos;m a bad trainer in the eyes of the world. &quot;He&apos;s better in every way than he&apos;s ever been. If you turned him into a human, how old would he be? He&apos;d be 60-odd, wouldn&apos;t he, or 55? He&apos;s probably improved with age a lot more than I have.&quot; Twice Over may have drawn poorly but he is a multiple Group One winner trained by a master and deserves to start favourite. Odds of 11-4 are quite cramped, though, in a race that comes close to living up to its name. Cape Blanco, part of Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s first team of runners here for six years, will be a tough opponent if he adapts after a much briefer chance to acclimatise, while Buena Vista and Victoire Pisa are top-class in Japan. If one horse has been underestimated by the market, though, it is probably Gio Ponti (5.35), from the US, who was the runner-up to Zenyatta in the 2009 Breeders&apos; Cup Classic. At 10-1, he is a very credible each-way bet, while in the supporting races, Champ Pegasus (4.50), another American runner, is a big price in the Sheema Classic and Wigmore Hall (3.45) can win for Michael Bell in the Dubai Duty Free.

The soldiers were blocking the main highway to the coast with pickup trucks and armoured vehicles, so our driver took to the desert, skirting the roadblock in a wide arc before cutting back to the road. He was edgy after that, spooked even by the sight of a distant abandoned car parked in the middle of the road. We \u2013 the Brazilian journalist Andrei Netto and I, travelling in the company of rebels from western Libya \u2013 would not be able reach Zawiya that night as planned. Instead we made for Sabratha, 12 miles to the west. It was clear that Sabratha had been reclaimed by Gaddafi loyalists. The police and intelligence service buildings were charred, but they had new green flags of the regime flying above them. We separated from our rebel escorts and took shelter in an empty half-built house, away from the militiamen roaming the streets. Later that night we saw four men approaching, dressed in dark tracksuits and carrying sticks except for one, who had a gun. When they surrounded the house there was no way to escape. They took our phones then frogmarched us, heads down, to an SUV, ranting as we went. &quot;You sons of bitches! You Jews and Zionists! You Arab traitors! You want to topple Gaddafi? We will rape your mothers! Gaddafi will show you!&quot; I was put in the pickup first, then Netto. As he was getting in, a tall militiaman swung a metal pipe that struck him on the head. Inside the car the man sat behind us, jabbing at us with a stick as he continued his tirade. We were taken a short distance to a compound guarded by armed men, where we were interrogated, then blindfolded and driven for two hours to a prison that I now know is in Tripoli. We were separated there; I have not seen Netto since. Still blindfolded, I was interrogated for four hours about my &quot;collaboration&quot; with the infidel British newspaper the Guardian. Then they walked me downstairs to the cells. They removed the blindfold in a neon-lit corridor lined with 20 great iron doors with sliding bolts and white numbers. Each door had two small hatches, at the top and the bottom. Empty cartons of juice, plastic packaging and trash were piled up outside the doors. I was pushed into cell 11, a windowless box, 2.5 metres x 1.5 metres, painted dark grey and lit by a weak bulb. The room contained a dirty mattress, blanket and soiled pillow. A low wall separated a broken toilet seat covered with a thick brown crust, a tap and a bucket. There was a strong smell of sewage. It was Wednesday 2 March. The prison would be home for a fortnight. Day and night in the prison, bolts were pulled, doors slammed and guards, in combat trousers, T-shirts and trainers, shoved shackled prisoners in and out of the cells. One guard in particular \u2013 a tall man with rimless spectacles whose civilian clothes implied rank \u2013 spoke the most. &quot;All the people we are capturing are al-Qaida infiltrators,&quot; he said at one point. &quot;Al-Qaida are beheading civilians, burning them and eating their hearts.&quot; Another day, he delivered a paean to Colonel Gaddafi. &quot;We love him,&quot; he said, rolling his eyes until they were just two white slits. &quot;We love, love, love him! And we want him. It&apos;s up to us Libyans to choose him \u2013 not the west. &quot;With him we have survived so many things. So many crises have passed and we will survive this. It&apos;s history we have with him. It&apos;s 42 years! I have known nothing but him and they want us to turn against him now. He is not just our leader, he is a philosopher and a thinker. He is everything.&quot; Worse than the guards, the fear and the smell were the ravings from a prisoner down the corridor. This man&apos;s shouting, made incomprehensible by being delivered through his hands or a blanket, echoed around the jail day and night. Sometimes he would break off, a moment of silence would ensue and he would begin crying and squealing in apparent pain. When a guard passed by he would ask in a very polite voice: &quot;You are not serving tea or coffee today?&quot; &quot;We are not getting newspapers today?&quot; Days later I discovered that he, like many of the others, was being regularly interrogated and beaten. In the early hours of Sunday 6 March a gunbattle began outside the prison. It started with a few bursts of small arms fire, then came the deeper note of anti-aircraft guns, which turned into a continuous long drumming. At one point guns were being fired from somewhere just next to the cells. The inmates became excited. Were the rebels storming into the prison? Had the uprising reached Tripoli? Were we being saved? The raving man gave a long, ululating victory cry while the prisoner in cell 12 continuously repeated &quot;O Lord&quot; like a mantra. The sounds of shooting rose and fell for more than half an hour before fizzling away and finally stopping when two helicopters came circling overhead. The officer with the rimless glasses came through the corridor later, fuming with anger. He shoved breakfast through the door hatch. &quot;Those filthy Europeans, we will crush them with the tips of our shoes,&quot; he said. &quot;If those rebel dogs come here to attack we will all die together. The sons of Gaddafi will never run. A man lives once and dies once, so better die fighting.&quot; On the evening after the battle the cells began to fill up. There was a man from Zwara, another from Zawiya, and a chubby grey-haired man named Richard who spoke English with an American accent. By Monday some cells had three inmates. &quot;Why am I kept here?&quot; I overheard one man say. &quot;I have handed myself in after the amnesty.&quot; &quot;Sure,&quot; laughed a guard. &quot;We will take you to a five-star hotel very soon.&quot; I was moved to a bigger cell upstairs. I could still hear the doors slamming and the man shouting and the new cell was also windowless, but it was whitewashed and lit by neon night and day. Later I heard the first of the voices coming through the wall. The cell was next to two interrogation rooms, where men were brought throughout the day. Each interrogation began and ended with the clinking sound of a man in shackles walking to or from the room. The madman was brought for interrogation at least twice. I heard snatches of shouted questions or accusations from the interrogators \u2013 &quot;Qaida&quot;, &quot;attack Libya&quot;, &quot;Muammar&quot;, &quot;who are they?&quot; \u2013 punctuated with smacks and thuds, like someone throwing sacks of rice at a wall, and the sound of prisoners pleading, screaming and weeping. One interrogation on Wednesday evening went as follows: &quot;Stand up!&quot; Smack came the sound. Smack. Smack. &quot;I said stand up!&quot; Smack. Smack. This cycle was repeated five times. Somewhere down the hall a TV blasted pro-Gaddafi marching songs. On Thursday 10 March I was taken out of the big cell and put in cell 18 in the downstairs corridor. This was also dark, tiny and filthy, but this time I was to share with another prisoner. He was sitting on a torn mattress, his back resting against the wall and his legs covered with a dirty yellow and red blanket. His hair was slicked back and a few days of white stubble sprouted from his chin. &quot;Bangladesh,&quot; he said, pointing at himself. He was shivering in a thin shirt and after few minutes of silence he added, in Arabic: &quot;Cold. All clothes with them.&quot; He told his story in broken sentences. He had lived in Dhaka with his wife and three children. Some years ago he had gone to &quot;a big manager in big glass building with a big office&quot; and paid money to get a visa to Saudi Arabia to work in construction. He had been promised a good salary, but the visa never came. After five months he was told there was no visa for Saudi, but he could get a visa for Dubai. So he paid the manager more money and waited. Two months later, he was told there would be no visa to Dubai but there was one for Libya. &quot;The manager said Libya is like Dubai, lots of petrol and a good salary.&quot; He arrived in Libya on a tourist visa that soon expired and the work permit and job he was promised never came, but he worked anyway, on building sites in Benghazi, then Tripoli. When the fighting and demonstrations erupted and foreigners started leaving Libya, he asked his Libyan boss to pay him the money he was owed so he could leave the country. &quot;He said &apos;later, later&apos;.&quot; While his friends all left for Tunis, he stayed to wait for his 800 dinars (\u00a3400). &quot;Four days ago&quot; \u2013 he counted them out with his fingers \u2013 &quot;a soldier stopped me and said where is my visa. I said I had no visa. They beat me and brought me here. &quot;Everywhere Bangladesh worker go, India, China, Indonesia \u2026 only here in Libya they do this to you and put you in a locked room.&quot; He crossed his hands to indicate handcuffs. A week had passed and he hadn&apos;t been able to speak to his wife. &quot;What is she to do now?&quot; Later he asked what would happen if he found enough money to get a ticket to Bangladesh: &quot;Would they let me go?&quot; The following day I was moved into solitary again, but towards the end of the second week I noticed small differences in the way I was treated. On day 12, a guard brought a toothbrush. On day 13, a bar of soap and shampoo arrived. On day 14 they brought a cup of coffee and even offered a cigarette. There was no information about what was happening outside or why I was being held, despite being told when I was first interrogated that I would be released the next day. When, I wondered, might they come and take me to the room where the beating took place? On Tuesday night a smiling officer came to say I would be released. I was blindfolded and taken to a bathroom with a mirror, given a razor and told to shave. I did not want to shave. I pleaded with him and he relented. An hour later I was told my release had been postponed. The next morning, Wednesday 16 March, I was given my notebooks and camera and blindfolded again. I had to lie in the back of a van and was driven for half an hour before being led into a room. When they took off the blindfold, I discovered I was back in my cell. &quot;We made a mistake,&quot; said an officer as he locked the door. Two hours later I was blindfolded and bundled into the van again. I would have to face trial, the officer said. There was an armed guard in the van. The van stopped and the guard told me to move closer to him. He took off the blindfold and I could see we were outside a grand building. A second man came and led me up some marble steps. At the top I found three colleagues from the Guardian waiting to receive me and take me out of Libya.

You always know that&apos;s the way he has to be ridden, that&apos;s the way Ryan gets the best out of him, and it&apos;s just a question of whether he gets the gaps or not.  &quot;He&apos;s a funny guy. If he was a man, he would be a loner. He&apos;s not a very social type, you have to train him the way he wants. We play around with him, we try to confuse him and he tries to confuse me and we just get along as best we can.  &quot;He never really runs a bad race. The only bad race he&apos;s ever run was at Ascot last year, and that&apos;s because he&apos;d had a long season here and in Hong Kong. He&apos;s even harder to train in English conditions because he knows exactly where the start of every canter and gallop is, here you can confuse him because you can change things around. Here you can play around with him, in Newmarket you can&apos;t.  That&apos;s why basically we won&apos;t be training him in England any more, he&apos;ll go to Hong Kong and Singapore and then start all over again next year.  Ryan Moore was only at the press conference briefly. &quot;They went a good gallop,&quot; he said. &quot;I was aiming at the right horses and the gaps always happened just when I needed them to. I don&apos;t worry about it [finding gaps]. If it happens, it happens.&quot;  Greg Wood in Dubai Good afternoon from Meydan, Dubai, where the richest race in the world, the Dubai World Cup, is due off in approximately six and a half hours&apos; time. Before that, there is a high-class card that includes two more of the most valuable events in world racing, the Sheema Classic and the Dubai Duty Free, both run on turf \u2013 and several more contests that thrust horses from countries including Japan, South Africa, the United States and, of course, Britain into truly international competition. The temperature here \u2013 where we are four hours ahead of GMT \u2013 will have cooled somewhat by the time the racing starts with an event for pure-bred Arabians in a couple of hours. At the moment, though, it is quite insanely hot, well over 30 degrees by all accounts, and it will be interesting to see how the Tapeta track stands up to it. Speaking to the excellent Richard Hoiles a while ago \u2013 you can follow him on Twitter too, incidentally \u2013 he wondered whether the course could ending up riding a little slow, as the wax holding it together starts to melt and makes it a little stickier than usual. If so it could be hard to make ground up the straight, though on the other hand, there is a stiffish breeze blowing up the stretch too, which could leave the horses that race up with the pace gasping for breath just when they need it most. These are just two of the many factors that need to be weighed up ahead of a card like this, when horses arrive from racing jurisdictions on several continents with outstanding domestic form to their name but no obvious way to compare one with another. For some punters, this is a complete turn-off, but personally I like the chance to think a little more laterally than normal and try to find horses at attractive prices in races where the favourite may face rather stronger opposition than the betting might suggest. One that definitely catches the eye is I Want Revenge (1.50), who was the hot favourite for the Kentucky Derby two years ago before he was withdrawn just a few hours before the race and has been very lightly campaigned since. Last time out, he ran fourth, beaten less than three lengths, in the Grade One Donn Handicap, one of the feature events at Gulfstream&apos;s winter meeting, and could conceivably outclass what is a weak field, even for a Group Two, today. At 9-1 with Bet365, who offer a quarter the odds the first three places, he is well worth an interest. Others that might reward close inspection are Euroears (3.05) and Gio Ponti (5.35), again each-way, at around 12-1 in the Classic. JJ The Jet Plane looks horribly short in the Al Quoz Sprint, a race that, at best prices, is 2-1 the favourite and 12-1 bar, but I can&apos;t realistically find one to put up against him so will instead simply be cheering for Triple Aspect (1.15), owned by Tony Bloom, who has also supplied the cash to build Brighton &amp; Hove Albion&apos;s magnificent new stadium.  Today&apos;s TV races Industry will be rewarded for Liam Jones when he is crowned the champion all-weather jockey today and the rider may also be celebrating a payday in the richest race of the winter season, the Winter Derby at Lingfield, aboard the useful outsider Cockney Class (3.10). The favourite, Nideeb, makes obvious appeal on the strength of his high-class Polytrack form, but he needs every yard of this mile-and-a-quarter trip. Cockney Class never really delivered what connections expected last season, victory in a six-furlong Newmarket handicap being followed by four defeats.But moving up in trip is going to help him, while a gelding operation could also bring about beneficial effects, so it is far from impossible that he can get involved. His final effort last season, when sixth of 13 in the Group 3 Darley Stakes, does not leave him with a lot to find. Lingfield 2.00 Despite being top weight, Hitchens should score. With Silaah likely to help cut out a frantic early gallop on his inside, the selection is fancied to cut his rivals down close home, provided he can hold his position to the bend. Newbury 2.15 Back from a break since falling when in the process of giving Sway a good fight at Exeter in December, Easter Legend looks a big player, despite meeting that rival on marginally worse terms. A smart hurdler on her day, she is sure to have been well schooled over fences since that latest blip and good ground suits. Lingfield 2.35 Both of the Richard Hannon-trained runners look major players and the betting market may provide an important clue about their relative prospects. But Vanguard Dream impressed as he maintained his unbeaten record in three starts this season and he could just have the edge. He looked talented when pulling out more to win at Newbury in October, despite having been keen enough in the early stages. Newbury 2.50 Since being fitted with a tongue-tie, Emmaslegend has proved nothing short of a revelation and, with her trainer in flying form, she can cut the mustard, even in this much stiffer grade. Her full-sister, Aimigayle, one of the toughest mares in training, loves these kind of conditions and Emmaslegend can prove a chip off the old block. Newbury 3.25 Expensive to follow this season, Maktu has nevertheless given plenty of encouragement to his followers, particularly when he came from a long way back to finish strongly over two and a half miles at Newbury last time. That kind of trip was never going to see Maktu at his best, but it offers good reason for hope in this contest, and the booking of Ruby Walsh is eyecatching to say the least. Ogee looks like the danger. Horse sense Philip Robinson will start the new Flat season with a point to prove, having been given another chance to show his talents by another well-liked veteran of his profession, Clive Brittain. Neil Callan was preferred for the job as stable jockey to Michael Jarvis&apos;s successor, Roger Varian, but Robinson has been working hard with his fitness in recent weeks and Nideeb (3.10) is a strong fancy to advertise his skills in the Winter Derby at Lingfield. A thorough stayer at this trip, he will need a decent pace to be seen to best effect, but his all-weather form is solid and his recent work suggests that he has improved again for another winter on his back. Dansili Dancer carries high hopes, but it will be a surprise if something does not have the legs of the nine-year-old in the closing stages and it could well be Nideeb who comes home strongest. Barry Hills is in Dubai to watch his runners at the World Cup meeting, but Tasheyaat (3.40) is expected to go close to making a winning debut at the same meeting, while, in the following race, his stablemate Whistle On By (4.15) is not short on ability, but has been plagued in the past with breathing problems, which seems ironic, given his name. Before leaving for Dubai to watch Twice Over&apos;s challenge for the World Cup, Henry Cecil was able to supervise work at an important stage of the season. Frankel&apos;s high-class work on the Cambridge Road Polytrack on Wednesday has been well documented, but his stablemate Air Traffic is a name to note. While Khalid Abdullah&apos;s immaculately bred, unraced colt World Domination has been the subject of plenty of talk already, it was Air Traffic \u2013 whose six older siblings have all been winners \u2013 who came out on top in their latest gallop. Rated last season&apos;s joint champion two-year-old along with Frankel, Dream Ahead was also spotted going through the gears on the Cambridge Road this week. His trainer, David Simcock, whose team look forward this year, has been trying to get the colt to settle better in his work and the signs are encouraging that the Middle Park winner is learning. Seen and heard &quot;I am not one to get involved in racing politics,&quot; said Richard Hannon on his website this week and he may have a bit to learn about spin. Announcing his intention not to run horses in races with low prize money, he said: &quot;It costs on average between \u00a316,000 and \u00a317,000 a year for an owner to have a horse in training and with these cuts the powers-that-be are simply driving them out of the sport&quot;. Those words might have carried more weight had it not been for the previous item on Hannon&apos;s site, confirming that he would start the new season with a record number of 231 horses in training. Henry Cecil is considered racing royalty in Britain, though he has never in fact been knighted. This fact was evidently lost on the Dubai newspaper that this week published a story about &quot;Sir Henry Cecil&quot;.

This World Cup, the second to be run at Meydan, was a repeat of last year&apos;s renewal from Cecil&apos;s point of view, as Tom Queally, Twice Over&apos;s jockey, could not get a position from a wide draw and was forced to race four wide through the first bend. Victoire Pisa, though, received smart steering from a much better post position in stall six, as Demuro brilliantly steered his mount wide of the field and into a prominent position three furlongs out in a race that, again like last year&apos;s, was run at a very steady pace. Demuro then kicked on two furlongs out and comfortably held the late challenge of Transcend, also trained in Japan, who completed the country&apos;s best result in an international race. Monterosso, the outsider of the field, was third, with Cape Blanco, Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s first World Cup runner, in fourth. Amid the delight of the winner&apos;s connections after their victory, thoughts quickly turned to the devastation unleashed on Japan by the recent earthquake and tsunami. &quot;It is a great souvenir to take back to Japan,&quot; Yoshimi Ichikawa, the winning owner, said. &quot;I was very worried during the race as I didn&apos;t know what would happen. I really appreciate the support we have had from all the people in Japan.&quot; Demuro was overcome with emotion after the race and was in tears when interviewed on his way back to the winner&apos;s enclosure. &quot;It&apos;s unbelievable. It&apos;s just unbelievable to win the Dubai World Cup for Japan,&quot; he said. Cecil&apos;s frustration that Twice Over could not get into the race was clear. &quot;He was taken out there, and then they slowed it right up and he couldn&apos;t go anywhere,&quot; Cecil said. &quot;Tom said he broke well, but when they got to the bend, the next minute he was out the back, and they slowed it up on the far side as well, so he didn&apos;t have a run, did he? I don&apos;t like making excuses and hard-luck stories, but the race just went all wrong for him.&quot; While Cecil endured only disappointment, Luca Cumani, his near-neighbour in Newmarket, took one of the most valuable prizes of his long career when Presvis, a horse who has to finish fast and late, came with a perfectly timed run under Ryan Moore to win the Dubai Duty Free. Presvis is a quirky horse, but one who has been an exceptional servant to Cumani, having now won nearly \u00a34.5m in prize money in a 22-race career. &quot;He&apos;s a funny guy,&quot; Cumani said. &quot;If he was a man, he would be a loner. He&apos;s not a very social type, you have to train him the way he wants. We play around with him, we try to confuse him and he tries to confuse me and we just get along as best we can. &quot;Basically we won&apos;t be training him in England any more, he&apos;ll go to Hong Kong and Singapore and then start all over again next year.&quot; Khawlah, in the blue colours of Godolphin, became the first filly to win the UAE Derby and she is now likely to be steered towards the Oaks at Epsom in June. Master Of Hounds, Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s first runner in Dubai for six years, looked to have the race won when Moore kicked clear a furlong out, but Mickael Barzalona, an outstanding young riding prospect from France, got Khawlah up to win by a nose in the final stride. Oaks quotes for Khawlah range from 12-1 to 20-1, but her win was also a significant boost for the form of Havant, trained by Sir Michael Stoute, who beat Khawlah with some ease at Newmarket last October. &quot;It&apos;s a real privilege to be here,&quot; O&apos;Brien said, suggesting that a prolonged cooling of relations between Sheikh Mohammed, Dubai&apos;s ruler, and John Magnier, who supplies O&apos;Brien&apos;s ammunition at Ballydoyle, may now be over. &quot;People have to see this place to believe it. The vastness, the glamour and the size of it, no words can do it justice,&quot; he added. Barzalona has enjoyed considerable success in France, where he is based with Andr\u00e9 Fabre. Bright riding prospects can easily burn out as rapidly as they appear, but this was an accomplished performance, and he could well emerge as a leader in the next generation of European jockeys. Godolphin completed a treble as Rewilding took the Dubai Sheema Classic, the main supporting race, following success for Skysurfers in the Godolphin Mile.

The first thought here in the fun department was that an awful lot of pretending goes on in professional sport. One act, regularly seen at the highest level, is the over-promoted sportsman who is raised beyond his talent. This is the twilight world of the one-cap wonder. The good club player is burned by the heat of international competition. But sport is about the exhibition of strength and the concealment of weakness, so the struggling performer must keep smiling to the gallery and hope the demons are not too vindictive when the lights go out. Geoffrey Boycott, not everyone&apos;s obvious first port of call for tea and sympathy, was sniffing around this point when he made a hefty and controversial assumption about the depression that drove Michael Yardy home from the Cricket World Cup. To Boycott, Yardy was out of his depth in the England one-day team and was having trouble dealing with that fact. &quot;He must have been reading my comments about his bowling, it must have upset him,&quot; Boycott said, thus managing, with exquisite egocentricity, to make it all about Geoffrey Boycott, not Michael Yardy. &quot;Geoff the Psychiatrist&quot; would have made an excellent Viz cartoon character, but is not much use in the assessment of the infinite complexity that is the human psyche. The covering up is the most poignant part. Ravi Bopara says he knew something was up when Yardy stopped coming to his room for a &quot;game of Fifa&quot;. Who would have thought a video game named after Sepp Blatter&apos;s lakeside gerontocracy would feature so tellingly in the story of a cricketer&apos;s cry for help? &quot;He hadn&apos;t been popping in and I kept questioning him why,&quot; Bopara said. &quot;So I did notice something.&quot; Michael Vaughan, the former England captain, says: &quot;They [Yardy&apos;s colleagues] probably won&apos;t have seen too much wrong with Michael, and that just shows you how much acting these guys have to do in front of their team-mates, so it must be terrible when they&apos;re in their own room with no one else watching them.&quot; The tension between sportsman as gladiator and the darker realities of loneliness, self-doubt and homesickness is there all the time. It breaks the surface only when an individual reaches such a level of psychic discomfort that he can take no more and heads for home. For Yardy, this must have been immensely difficult. Alongside his courage sits the suspicion, encouraged by Boycott, that he baled out because he knew he was not good enough to wear an England shirt. Reductionist judgments by amateur psychologists are to be avoided. Who among us can guess what was passing through Yardy&apos;s head, at the World Cup or anywhere? Marcus Trescothick, on the other hand, told us pretty clearly, in his autobiography, which recounts the story of him slumping in the corner of a Heathrow airport shop as he was about to board a flight to Dubai. &quot;My mind was pulling itself apart in a hundred directions,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Then came the pictures in my head; specific, enormous, terrifying images. What was happening at home? Was Haley OK? Was Ellie all right? I couldn&apos;t distinguish between what was real and what I imagined to be real ... things, beings, beasts, bastards ... attacked in waves, one after another, each worse than the one before. &apos;Oh God, please, make it stop. Oh go, please make it stop.&apos;&quot; This harrowing passage can&apos;t be tacked on to some sermon about the stresses of touring, or modern sport \u2013 but it would be a disservice to Trescothick, Yardy, or Shaun Tait (the Australian paceman who took a break in 2008, citing &quot;physical and emotional exhaustion&quot;) not to shine a light on the brutality of the international cricket calendar, which may (repeat, may) have exacerbated Yardy&apos;s unhappiness. Though not an Ashes player, Yardy went to New Zealand voluntarily to prepare himself for the World Cup and had been on the road for more than five months. Some from the England squad and management have been away since the end of October, with only three nights at home. Surely this ought to be illegal under employment law? If a working man marched off to other continents for six months and came home for three days in all that time he would probably be demonised as an absentee or deadbeat dad. When wealthier people do it we call them England cricketers. Please let&apos;s not mention the armed services. Signing up for wars is not the same as being forced on to a pitiless fixtures treadmill to satisfy the needs of sponsors, governing bodies and television. While the schedule places intolerable strains on family life, cricket \u2013 the people, the game \u2013 has handled with impressive sensitivity the problems of Trescothick and Yardy, as well as the decision by Steven Davies, the wicketkeeper, to be open about his sexuality. But it does make you wonder how many of the people we watch in sport are, to borrow from Stevie Smith, much further out than we thought. Villa in Spain no ray of sunshine for Torres Fernando Torres is working his way from sympathy to pity in the thoughts of neutrals observing his struggles with Spain and Chelsea. First, Roman Abramovich winces as El Ni\u00f1o is taken off, seven games into his goalless stay at Stamford Bridge; then, Damien Comolli, director of football at Liverpool, starts chirping about how clouds lifted over Anfield when Torres fled Merseyside with his \u00a350m transfer fee. The decline of this thoroughly gifted striker has been a talking point among the cognoscenti for many months. Some say he has &quot;already had his career&quot; \u2014 the most damning statement out there because it suggests there is no way back from his sluggishness. Just to make it even worse, his fellow January recruit, David Luiz, a centre-back, becomes an instant favourite of the Chelsea fans and scores lots of goals. Now comes more pain in Spain. On Friday night, David Villa struck twice for the world and European champions in their 2-1 home win over the Czech Republic to break Ra\u00fal&apos;s national goal-scoring record. Torres is now second- or third-choice striker under Vicente del Bosque. These are provocations to which he must respond. Only he can save his own legend.", "title": "Amateur psychologists to be avoided in delicate Michael Yardy debate | Paul Hayward", "sentences": ["Marcus Trescothick, on the other hand, told us pretty clearly, in his autobiography, which recounts the story of him slumping in the corner of a Heathrow airport shop as he was about to board a flight to Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-27T00:08:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/mar/27/horse-racing-live-march-27", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Horse racing tips"], "article": "Today&apos;s best bets, by Tony Paley Winning jockey Mirco Demuro was brilliant on Victoire Pisa in last night&apos;s Dubai World Cup and if you haven&apos;t seen the Italian jockey&apos;s masterclass yet you can here.

There is no doubt the most interesting racing takes place in Ireland today at Leopardstown where the the Irish 2,000 Guineas Trial Stakes is a fascinating race despite the small field because of the clash between Cocozza and Dunboyne Express. The latter could only manage fifth in the Racing Post Trophy at the end of the season but that was off an interrupted preparation and he had looked potentially very smart following his previous two victories. The well-bred Cocozza will be no pushover, however, and the form of the John Oxx-trained colt&apos;s win at Cork on his second start was franked by the runner-up. This looks a race to watch rather than to bet in. Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s stable has made a flying start to the 2011 Flat campaign and the trainer will be looking to Wild Wind (4.00) for a big run in the 1,000 Guineas Trial. She was clearly unsuited by the six furlongs in the Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket at the end of last season and has the form to be involved here. As does Katla who was a good winner of a Listed event at York. The doubt about her might be the trip of seven furlongs, the distance over which she ran her worst race last campaign. On a card crammed with interest the Ballydoyle team also send out Wonder Of Wonders (2.30) in the opener, a filly who is potentially very smart and who should give a very good account. There are just two jumps meetings on home soil and Waldvogel (2.25) looks an obvious one for champion jockey Tony McCoy in the opener at Wincanton. A decent campaigner for Luca Cumani on the Flat, he is clearly going to be a useful addition to Nicky Richards&apos; jumps yard if his Musselburgh victory last time is anything to go by.

The well-backed 5-1 chance Empowering, owned by O&apos;Brien&apos;s wife Anne-Marie and ridden by his son, Joseph, was soon in front and held off stablemate Wild Wind by a length and three-quarters. Favourite History Note, who suffered an interrupted passage when trying to throw down a challenge in the straight, finished an eyecatching third. Having got off the plane from Dubai only hours earlier, O&apos;Brien was understandably pleased to be back in time for the race. &quot;Joseph loved her all last year, she&apos;d been working lovely and she&apos;s a filly to look forward to,&quot; said the trainer. &quot;Joseph knew the filly and he was happy to make the running if nothing else went on. &quot;I think she was only rated 85 coming in here but she&apos;s a very well-bred filly and it&apos;s a lovely result.

When the man behind both the Godolphin ownership operation and Meydan itself pauses to consider the events of Saturday night, though, he may conclude that his most important racing projects are progressing well. In terms of bringing the racing world to Dubai the 2011 World Cup meeting drew horses from a much broader range of countries than the Breeders&apos; Cup is ever likely to achieve. The feature event saw a 1-2 for Japan while the reappearance of runners from Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s Ballydoyle, one of which went within a nose of victory, was another important boost for a meeting that the Sheikh wants to build year on year. As for Godolphin, Rewilding showed in the Sheema Classic that he has the potential to win a major European Group One this season, the only reservation being Godolphin&apos;s own belief that he needs plenty of time between races. His route through the campaign will need to be plotted with great care but Khawlah, the first filly to win the UAE Derby, is a realistic Oaks prospect and Godolphin know they also have White Moonstone, a Group One winner last year, at home too. If one of Godolphin&apos;s three-year-old colts turns out to be a top-notcher, they could be serious players in most of the big races this season - assuming, of course, that the British ones have prize funds that meet the Horsemen&apos;s tariff. If not, apparently, their horses will go elsewhere, a point of principal that is likely to be tested sooner rather than later. Other features of Saturday&apos;s action, though, were more troubling with an eye on the future, not least that the Dubai World Cup itself was, for the second year running, a slowly run muddle that saw the wide-drawn favourite, Twice Over, effectively beaten by the time they left the first turn. Mirco Demuro&apos;s ride on the winner Victoire Pisa, left, was brilliant and, though one could argue that he was simply doing what he is paid to do \u2013 jockeys are meant to be the brains of the operation, after all \u2013, he deserves huge credit for being the only one in the field to seize the moment. Demuro realised that the pace was too slow and made a bold move towards the head of the field while others sat and watched. It was a very brave decision in a $10m race. Yet a true Grade One event should generally be 95% about the horse and 5% about the jockey. This race was almost the other way around, and last year&apos;s World Cup winner, Gloria De Campeao, also benefited from a very canny ride. The two major turf races on Saturday were both won by finishers, most notably the Duty Free, in which Ryan Moore got it precisely right as he went from last to first on Presvis. Too many races on the Tapeta track, though, seem to be about getting a position, then crawling and sprinting, which in a big field can mean that three or four runners are relying on a miracle from the start. It could be a difficult habit to break since jockeys might see it as a percentage call which will work if they are lucky and offer a ready-made excuse if not. Then again, it might just be that there is still a shortage of jockeys with enough first-hand experience, and thus sufficient confidence, to ride a proper race on Tapeta. Victoire Pisa&apos;s win did at least show that a moment of genius in the saddle can have its reward. Building the world&apos;s biggest racecourse in barely three years is one thing but fully establishing it as a top-class venue is another.

House prices across the world staged a modest recovery last year, rising by 2.8% after a 3.8% decline in 2009, according to the latest Knight Frank global house price index. The global housing market benefited as strong price growth in the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East offset stagnation in Europe and the US. Hong Kong saw the biggest increases, with house prices jumping more than 20% last year, while Ireland record the biggest decline, of nearly 11%, according to Knight Frank. The UK came about two-thirds of the way down the global ranking, with prices rising 0.7% last year, compared to 3% growth in Germany, a 4.1% decline in the US and a 4.1% rise in Canada. Liam Bailey, head of residential research at Knight Frank, said: &quot;There are two stories here. The headline figure confirms relatively benign conditions but this hides big regional and country level differences. This annual data hides the fact that a growing number of countries are seeing negative quarterly price movements,&quot; Bailey adds. The percentage of countries in Knight Frank&apos;s 49-country index recording quarterly price declines rose from 31% to 41% in the second half of 2010. Bailey warned that parts of Asia, such as areas in Mumbai and along the eastern seaboard in China, were at risk of overheating after prices doubled in 18 months. North America was flat \u2013 helped by price increases in Canada \u2013 while Europe saw a 1.4% increase after a 7.7% decline in 2009. &quot;This year the outlook for the US and Europe is pretty slow. Growth in the US is likely to stick around zero, while in Europe it could dip to zero or even be negative,&quot; Bailey said. &quot;It looks increasingly likely that Asian markets will escape a crash in prices, but in many of the previously &apos;hot markets&apos; price falls later this year seem a realistic assumption,&quot; he added.

Understanding the environment in which we&apos;re trying to do this \u2013 whether Haiti, Pakistan, Libya, or, most recently, Japan \u2013 is the key to ensuring that our response is timely, appropriate and life-saving. From an uncertain start in Haiti a year ago, to achieving better co-ordinated rapid mapping operations for Pakistan, Libya and Japan, the generation of real-time mapping of crises through use of the volunteer technology &quot;crowd&quot; is proving its value. Sourcing and mapping information about displaced people, infrastructure and a host of other essential data is helping aid agencies to build better contextual understanding about urgent humanitarian needs. This can support a more effective initial response and, provide a strong basis for recovery and rebuilding. We learned from the response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake that collaborative technology can enable volunteer groups far from a crisis to play a major role in sharing information about humanitarian needs in the heart of a disaster zone. Take, for example, OpenStreetMap, an online community of volunteers dedicated to building a free and open map of the world that mobilised after the Haiti disaster. Around 640 volunteers around the world used simple web browser tools to scan old atlases and maps, and trace roads, bridges and buildings into the OpenStreetMap geospatial wiki, creating one of the most intensively mapped corners of the world. OpenStreetMap became the de facto source of Haiti map data for many humanitarian agencies. This volunteer network was able to build a street map of Haiti from scratch in around two weeks, a project that otherwise would have taken almost a year. The organisation I work for, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, was able to use this information to help improve humanitarian response. In the chaos of a post-disaster environment, a common contextual understanding of urgent needs is of utmost importance, but is often a nightmare to achieve. Crowdsourcing is a clear opportunity to speed our ability to gather this important and time-sensitive data. Last week, we received reports that Haitians trained by the OpenStreetMap community were contributing to efforts to map humanitarian needs after the earthquake in Japan. The potential of collaborative networks to create resilience after emergencies is bound only by our imagination and our ability to communicate. Better communication between large aid organisations and grassroots technology groups is needed to ensure data gathered by these groups can be used effectively by humanitarian organisations. This is why I am excited about the publication on Monday of Disaster Relief 2.0: The Future of Information Sharing in Humanitarian Emergencies, a groundbreaking report we commissioned with the UN Foundation and Vodafone Foundation Technology Partnership. UN emergency relief co-ordinator Valerie Amos and the report partners are launching the report at the Dubai International Humanitarian Aid and Development (Dihad) conference. The theme of the conference is his year is: &quot;New technologies: how these impact humanitarian and development operations&quot;. The report analyses how the humanitarian and volunteer technical communities co-operated in the Haiti earthquake response. It makes compelling recommendations about how they can work together to promote innovation and improve humanitarian response and accountability. Even as the report was being written, further examples of co-ordination were under way. The volunteer Standby Task Force, born as a result of our experience in Haiti, and now working closely with humanitarian information managers, has worked with the team at Ocha to produce a &quot;crisis map&quot; of the Libya situation, locating and verifying social media and news reports. Remote teams also helped us to map who is doing what and where \u2013 generating a better understanding of response gaps. These teams have also supported the gathering of humanitarian indicators for Libya and common operational datasets for Japan \u2013 information needed to organise effective relief. Even a year ago, the enormity of gathering this data rapidly was a daunting prospect. Now it looks entirely possible, and with it comes the vast improvement to the analysis, planning and overall effectiveness of humanitarian response work. The bottom line is that humanitarian action must save lives and should lay the foundations for recovery and reconstruction. Engagement with the volunteer and technical community is clearly helping us with this \u2013 but further and better structured engagement needs to happen if we are to achieve our collective goals. The aim is that this bold and forward-looking report will help us to do just that. \u2022 Oliver Lacey-Hall is head of the Ocha regional office for Asia and the Pacific and the Ocha&apos;s former deputy director of communications", "title": "How remote teams can help the rapid response to disasters | Oliver Lacey-Hall", "sentences": ["UN emergency relief co-ordinator Valerie Amos and the report partners are launching the report at the Dubai International Humanitarian Aid and Development (Dihad) conference."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-28T14:32:11Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/mar/29/humiliating-climbdown-apocalypse-horsemens-tariff", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Climbdown is too small a word for the humiliating manoeuvre performed by the Horsemen&apos;s Group on Monday morning . Having spent several days insisting that nothing would stand in the way of their tariff on prize money when the new Flat season on turf begins on Wednesday, the body that claims to represent owners, trainers, jockeys and stable staff announced that the tariff will now be &quot;suspended&quot; for all Class One races in 2011. Figures for acceptable purses in the most high-profile events, worked out to the last pound in anal-retentive detail, are suddenly irrelevant. British military history might read rather differently had Alan Morcombe, the chief executive of the Horsemen&apos;s Group, been in command of the Light Brigade. The 600 would have galloped into the Valley of Death, stopped to sniff the air and then galloped straight back out again. In this case, however, the catalyst for the retreat appears to be, somewhat bizarrely, the sudden arrival of reinforcements. Last Wednesday, at Godolphin&apos;s annual pre-season media morning in Dubai, Simon Crisford, one of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s most trusted advisors, made it clear that Godolphin and, by implication, the rest of the Maktoum family&apos;s bloodstock operations would refuse to run their horses in any sub-tariff event this year. Support for the tariff from the world&apos;s most powerful owner initially seemed like quite a coup, but the tariff was such a flawed idea in the first place that it was always likely to fall victim to the curse of unintended consequences. In this case, it soon became clear that Sheikh Mohammed, a man whose word is his bond, had just put his name to a potential boycott of a fair chunk of the top-end British programme. There were even several races at Royal Ascot, one of his favourite meetings, that would not have been guaranteed to meet the tariff without a boost to the purse, and it would be unthinkable to work out a season-long programme for a string such as Godolphin&apos;s without knowing for sure that it can include the Royal meeting. Even if every sub-tariff purse at Royal Ascot was raised to meet the Horsemen&apos;s demands, the Sheikh, ever the diplomat, would hardly want to be in a position where he might be accused of having blackmailed the Queen. The fundamental problem with the tariff, as with so many owner-led campaigns on prize money, is that it suggests the value of a race resides in its cash value and nothing else. Morcombe, who drew up the tariff, did at least concede in a statement announcing the HG&apos;s U-turn yesterday that &quot;horsemen have many reasons for deciding whether to enter races where the tariff is not being met and this is most relevant at Class One level where there are strong business and racing reasons for running horses in races. On occasions, these go beyond prize-money.&quot; The reality, though, is that the &quot;many reasons&quot; do not go beyond prize-money &quot;on occasions&quot;, but every day of the year, and at every level of the sport. The ultimate value of a Derby winner is many millions of pounds in stud fees on top of the \u00a3750,000 or so first prize, but a handicap at Pontefract may have a value far in excess of the purse from an individual owner&apos;s point of view, perhaps because it is local, or one of their favourite tracks, or for that matter, one of their horse&apos;s favourite tracks. The tariff surely cannot survive the embarrassing volte-face. Having let the major players off the hook, the Horsemen&apos;s Group cannot expect the smaller owners to toe their line. Then again, it was a Wonderland idea in the first place, so perhaps things will keep getting curiouser and curiouser.", "title": "Humiliating climbdown surely spells apocalypse for Horsemen's tariff", "sentences": ["Last Wednesday, at Godolphin&apos;s annual pre-season media morning in Dubai, Simon Crisford, one of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s most trusted advisors, made it clear that Godolphin and, by implication, the rest of the Maktoum family&apos;s bloodstock operations would refuse to run their horses in any sub-tariff event this year."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-28T23:06:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/29/running-with-the-kenyans", "tags": ["Running", "Fitness", "Life and style"], "article": "&quot;It&apos;s like we&apos;re going to war,&quot; jokes our coach, Godfrey, as we pile out from the back of the pick-up truck and start stripping down to our shorts and T-shirts. My wife, Marietta is scooting around taking photographs, while my children watch sleepy eyed from the truck cab, piles of water bottles on their laps, a bunch of bananas up on the dashboard. At the end of my six months in Kenya I&apos;m going to run the Lewa marathon. Whenever I mention it to runners here in Iten they shake their heads and say: &quot;That is hard.&quot;  The race is hot, hilly and is run along dirt trails. Oh, and there are lions and cheetah roaming around. To keep the wildlife at bay, the organisers send out helicopters to circle the route, but there&apos;s not much they can do about the heat, the hills and the uneven terrain. It&apos;s not a fast course. To help me prepare, I&apos;ve managed to find myself a team of top Kenyan runners who also want to race in Lewa. We&apos;ve christened ourselves the Iten Town Harriers and this morning we&apos;re off on our first training run. The rainy season seems to have ended early and the early morning air is crisp and fresh. Runners and small buses pass by as we stand on the side of the main tarmac road in Iten while Godfrey gives us a little prep talk. &quot;No racing,&quot; he says. &quot;Take it nice and easy.&quot; And with that we&apos;re off. The plan is to run a steady 30km, although I&apos;ve already told them I&apos;m likely to bail out at 20km. The truck, with Godfrey and my family in it, will follow us along the way, giving us five km time splits and handing out water if we need it.  I&apos;ve never been a great organiser, so I&apos;m amazed this has all come together. My approach is usually to have an idea, put it out there and then hope that someone will come along to help me put it into action. In Kenya, it&apos;s not a recipe that usually gets me very far, but somehow today it has worked. Our team&apos;s star runner is Chris Cheboiboch, who has the fifth fastest time ever in the New York marathon. He&apos;s a smooth operator who travels everywhere in his low-slung car, his Rolex and big grin hanging out of the window. He is largely responsible for everything coming together this morning, especially as he managed to find a truck we could use for the day. Godfrey, our big-hearted coach, got me worried when he rang me up the night before the run to tell me there was a change of plan. This usually means he has double booked himself, or he&apos;s somewhere on the other side of the country, but fortunately he was just calling to say he would be 15 minutes late. Kenyans are infamous for bad timekeeping, but I&apos;ve found that every training run I&apos;ve been on has started exactly on the dot. If they say 6.10am, they&apos;ll be gone if you turn up at 6.12am. Godfrey is bringing over a young runner called Shadrack, who he keeps telling me is going to win Lewa, for sure. &quot;Are you kidding me,&quot; he says. &quot;This boy is good.&quot; Shadrack himself is quiet and gentle, like most runners out here. His friend and training partner, David Barmasai, has just won the Dubai marathon, the world&apos;s richest race, and I get the feeling Shadrack is feeling a bit left behind. Also on the start-line for our morning run is Josphat, a friend of Chris who has been running for years. There is much debate about his age, although his official Lewa entry form says he is still only 34. He doesn&apos;t say much but instead likes to stand quietly in the background with a knowing look on his face. The last runner is one of my neighbours in Iten, Japhet. A young man of 24, he lives in a humble wooden shack without any electricity. His shoes are torn almost to pieces, which gives him a constant string of niggling injuries he treats by massaging himself. Despite his hardships, Japhet is a full-time athlete \u2013 even though he has never actually made a single Kenyan shilling from running. He&apos;s a talkative, friendly person who is constantly smiling and saying: &quot;It is good.&quot; The run sets off at a gentle pace (we go through the first five km in 24 minutes), and I run at the head of the group with Chris, the two elders leading our troop along. After about ten minutes the truck drives past us along the main road, the children waving, Marietta crouched in the back snapping away. It&apos;s a beautiful morning as we turn off the road and head out through the lush patchwork of fields. The dirt road meanders gently through small homesteads, clusters of round mud huts dotting the landscape like huge kilns or chimneys for an network of underground houses. At ten km the truck stops and Godfrey and my eldest daughter hand out water bottles, which we grab on the run as Godfrey shouts out that we&apos;ve run the last five km in 22 minutes. As we run on, Chris suddenly ups the pace. I don&apos;t know if he&apos;s trying to show his authority, but suddenly the talking and joking stops. The truck keeps passing us by, but I&apos;m having to focus too hard to wave back now. I&apos;m not sure how long I can keep this up.  Chris turns to me with a grin. &quot;You OK?&quot; he asks.  Surprisingly, I am. I&apos;m quite enjoying the new pace, even. But I feel as though I&apos;m pushing my luck. Chris&apos;s question sends doubts, excuses pinging around in my head. Before I&apos;ve fully made the decision, I&apos;m blurting out: &quot;I&apos;m just going to run 15K.&quot; &quot;Sure,&quot; says Chris. I feel like I&apos;ve given him the answer he was expecting. &quot;We&apos;re nearly at 15K,&quot; he says. &quot;Just two more corners.&quot; I should go on, but the pronouncement has been made. Once you decide where you&apos;re going to stop, it takes a reckless surge of energy to overrule yourself. Up ahead I see the truck stopped at the 15km point. It feels good to stop. My daughter runs to meet me, handing me some water. Marietta is crouched down, still snapping away. A group of children stand in a muddy field staring at us dumbstruck as though they have just witnessed an alien spaceship landing.  The others run past, and on, following the dusty road disappearing into some trees. &quot;That last five km was just under 20 minutes,&quot; Godfrey tells me. &quot;That&apos;s fast.&quot; It&apos;s not bad, but I can&apos;t help feeling I bailed out too early.  I clamber into the back of the truck and sit down on the spare tire next to my youngest daughter. She&apos;s looking up at me as though she&apos;s only half sure who I am. Chris, after pushing the pace, ends up hopping in the truck at 20km, complaining of a twisted ankle, while the others plough on to 25km, where they all stop (the last 10km is run in 38 minutes).  Godfrey hands out bananas and we take a group photograph. Then we jog the last one km back to Iten for a warm down. Inspired by watching the run, or perhaps just fed up with sitting in the truck, my eldest daughter joins us, skipping along up and down the banks at the side of the road like the Kenyan children who usually like to follow the runners. By the end she&apos;s feeling very pleased with herself. Godfrey drops us all off in town and we head our separate ways, resolving to meet up again for another group run in a few weeks.

A 26-year-old man was arrested at his home last week suspected of a bomb hoax, police said. He was taken to a north London police station and, bailed to return in May. The Met confirmed that they had searched an address in north London and the incident was not terrorist-related. The suspicious device had apparently been stowed on a UPS flight two weeks ago and travelled to Turkey undetected. The Department for Transport said it was taking the matter &quot;very seriously&quot;. A Turkish man delivered the package, consisting of a timer, wires and detonator inside a wedding cake box, to a UPS office in north London, a Turkish source told ITV News. It was only discovered after a security screening in Istanbul. Last October, packages containing explosive material hidden in printer ink cartridges sent from Yemen to the US sparked a global terror alert. One was discovered during a routine stop at East Midlands airport in the UK, and the other was found in Dubai. Both contained the high explosive PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate). Police said they had been timed to detonate over the eastern seaboard of the United States. At the time, it was promised that airports in the UK would improve their cargo screening. The Department for Transport said yesterday: &quot;The government is aware of this incident and takes it very seriously. We have already begun an investigation which will look at all aspects of this incident, including UPS&apos;s procedures. The UK has one of the toughest security regimes for air cargo in the world. All security measures are subject to continuous review.&quot; A UPS spokeswoman said: &quot;Two weeks ago, a suspicious package travelled within the UPS network aboard an all-cargo aircraft from the United Kingdom to Istanbul, Turkey. &quot;UPS is co-operating with the UK Department for Transport&apos;s investigation of the incident. UPS has a multiple-layered approach to ensure security.&quot; Last year, a device found at Windhoek airport in Namibia turned out to have been made in the US to test security. German security experts said it was most likely that either US or African authorities had been behind the test.

Prosecutors asked the court in Petah Tikva in central Israel to allow the continued detention of Dirar Abu Sisi for five days after which he would be charged. No charges have been made public. Abu Sisi, who has not been seen since his abduction on 19 February, told the court that he had been abducted and that he denied all allegations against him. Referring to an Israeli solider abducted by Hamas in 2006, he said: &quot;I don&apos;t know anything about Gilad Shalit. I don&apos;t know anything. I&apos;m an engineer.&quot; Reports suggest Abu Sisi was taken forcibly from a train in Kharkov then flown to Israel. It later emerged that he was being held in Ashqelon prison in southern Israel. Abu Sisi works as an engineer for a power company in the Gaza Strip and is married to Veronika, a Ukrainian national with whom he has six children. His family said that he was in the Ukraine to apply for citizenship to enable his family to leave Gaza. While no charges have been made against the engineer, the German magazine Der Spiegel claimed that he was kidnapped because he had knowledge of the whereabouts of Gilad Shalit. However, Ehud Barak, Israel&apos;s defence minister, said there was no direct link between Shalit and Abu Sisi. &quot;He didn&apos;t organise the abduction or guard Shalit but he is a person with intimate internal information on Hamas. This has value,&quot; he told Israel army radio. Smadar Ben Natan, Abu Sisi&apos;s lawyer, said that she had general knowledge of the charges against her client which were out of proportion to the efforts made to bring him to Israel. &quot;He is not a member of Hamas. He has a public position in the electricity distribution company. No one has said he is an essential person to any organisation, only that he has information. It&apos;s impossible to live in Gaza and not have some knowledge of Hamas,&quot; she told the Guardian. In a telephone conversation made public on Thursday, Noam Shalit, the father of the Israeli soldier held in Gaza, asked Veronika Abu Sisi to help get his son released. She told him: &quot;Your son is the same as my husband. Your son was kidnapped without foundation and my husband was kidnapped without foundation.&quot; In Kiev, Mohammed al-Assad, the Palestinian envoy in Ukraine, told a news conference that Abu Sisi &quot;was not a member of any organisation&quot;.

There is purpose, not wistfulness, in his voice as he declares his ambition, so what can explain the fact that he is 66-1 for a first title with one bookmaker and trading above 100-1 on Betfair? The 22-year-old is aware of the betting market&apos;s opinion but denies any resentment at the lack of respect. Shrugging, he points out that he has yet to ride 100 winners in a single British season and would need around twice that to get his hands on the crown. &quot;There&apos;s [the reigning champion] Paul Hanagan. Ryan Moore&apos;s going to be very hard to beat if he stays suspension- and injury-free. &quot;Richard Hughes said in the paper today that he&apos;s going to give it another go. There&apos;s a lot of people in front of me.&quot; But Buick is now prepared to acknowledge that he should at least be in the hunt, whereas the general feeling last year was that he was focused on winning high-profile races and lacked the drive for a title challenge. If that was ever true, it is no longer. &quot;I&apos;m going to give it a good go, I&apos;m not going to be taking spare days off just to have an afternoon lunch somewhere. I think I&apos;ve got good backing this year and I just hope to get off to a good start. You&apos;ll know by Royal Ascot where you are in the standings.&quot; Buick&apos;s ambition has met with an early obstacle in the form of the prize money tariffs set by the Horsemen&apos;s Group, which specifies the minimum amounts of money racecourses should be offering for each type of race. His main employer, John Gosden, is among those happy to support the scheme and that has meant the jockey will not be at Doncaster, which he names as one of the tracks he rides best, for Saturday&apos;s Lincoln. &quot;The races were below tariff at Doncaster,&quot; he says, pointing out that Gosden has made entries only for the Lincoln and a maiden race. Taqleed, the trainer&apos;s principal hope in the big race, is owned by Hamdan al Maktoum, who retains his own jockey, so Buick will be at Kempton, where the prize money on offer has been deemed relatively respectable. &quot;A lot of [Gosden&apos;s] horses are owned by the Maktoums and they&apos;re not going to run in races that are below tariff. And that&apos;s going to affect me, that&apos;s going to affect John Gosden. But I totally agree with it. Something has to be done about it and that&apos;s the only way it&apos;s going to be done, by people not running their horses.&quot; Two days into the new Flat season Buick has made a low-key start, finishing third at Leicester on Thursday on his only ride in Britain this year. But he is happy just to report himself in peak condition for the new term, something that could not be taken for granted when he was in hospital in December after two falls in Dubai on the same afternoon. &quot;I had a bad bang to the head, had bleeding on the brain and it was a lot worse than I had thought. I was in hospital for a week and it took me six weeks before I could get back to normal. And when I started riding, I wasn&apos;t riding fancied horses but still \u2026 I felt I was two steps behind everyone else. Then I got into it and had more rides and I&apos;m back now where I want to be, ready to rock and roll.&quot; Buick says Gosden, who turned 60 this week, is &quot;a great man to work for&quot; and their first year together was certainly fruitful. But in the immediate future the association may prevent the jockey from taking a fancied mount in the 2,000 Guineas on the David Simcock-trained Dream Ahead, which Buick rode to two Group One successes last year. Gosden has several entries in the Guineas, including Treasury Devil, described by Buick as &quot;a nice little horse.

The retailer replanted a British flag in the heart of the Gallic retail industry by announcing, 10 years after it quit the capital amid stern criticism from trade unions, politicians and ardent muffin fans, that it would open a shop on Paris&apos;s most famous boulevard before Christmas. As well as opening other general stores in shopping centres around Paris, M&amp;S is in talks to open a number of Simply Food outlets in the city. In a first for the company, it will accompany the expansion with a new French-language website that will trade in euros. Marc Bolland, M&amp;S&apos;s Dutch chief executive, showed off his multilingual skills at a press conference with the French media and said the group&apos;s last foray had not left a bitter taste among French shoppers. &quot;Over the past ten years the number of demands ... from people for us to come back has been enormous.&quot; He added: &quot;Our company has changed in a positive way and France has moved on as well. We want to come back in an extremely positive way.&quot; The main M&amp;S store on the Champs Elys\u00e9es will extend to three floors and sell womenswear, lingerie and food, taking over a site occupied by the Esprit clothing chain. M&amp;S executives are hoping that the group&apos;s return to France will receive a more positive response than its exit. In 2001, trade unions demonstrated against the closure or sale of 18 stores in France, with the loss of 1,650 jobs, plus a further 20 stores in Germany, Spain, Portugal and the Benelux countries. The reaction in France was particularly vociferous, with government ministers backing protests. However, M&amp;S appears to have learned from its last foray: it has pledged to retain and retrain the 30 Esprit staff.

John Dixon, head of food at M&amp;S who also had a senior role in the former French business, said the Simply Food stores will be stocked with British staples. &quot;You are going to see things like Scottish shortbread, Scottish smoked salmon, our fabulous tea. Those were the products that really stood us apart from everybody else in the market here.&quot; Bolland added that the general stores would carry a broad reflection of M&amp;S&apos;s clothing range including the Autograph label. &quot;It will give a broad sense of what we do with fashion.&quot; The top 10 items at the former M&amp;S store on Boulevard Haussmann reflected a love British basics, although lingerie sneaked in at number 10. The top five were: Marmalade; tea; pancakes; fleur-de-lis toilet paper; and muffins. Despite the street protests, and as that top five indicates, M&amp;S remains well regarded in France. The group said seven out of 10 people questioned for a survey were aware of the brand, with the 100 Champs Elys\u00e9es address a prime position for luring in Parisian shoppers. &quot;Four out of five women know where it is,&quot; said Bolland. &quot;[100] is a very important number to have when you come back to a country like this.&quot; However, M&amp;S is not expected to restrict its ambitions to France. The mainland Europe move has been expected for some time after Sir Stuart Rose, who chaired M&amp;S until January this year, made clear his desire to reverse the 2001 exit. M&amp;S, which has more than 600 shops in Britain, has been expanding abroad aggressively in recent years, with new outlets in India, Dubai and China. It plans to generate up to a fifth of sales overseas. Bolland would not be drawn on further European expansion plans but said the French strategy of targeting a major city with stores and covering the rest of the country with a website could be replicated elsewhere.

This sort of export-led growth has been at the heart of international development policy for decades. But questions are now being asked about how much of the taxable profit actually stays in Kenya. The head of domestic taxes at the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), John Njiraini, said late last year that he was investigating the flower sector, including the three largest multinational producers \u2013 Oserian, Karuturi, and Flamingo/Homegrown \u2013 based around Lake Naivasha. He told local reporters that he suspected that parts of the industry might be shifting profits to other jurisdictions to dodge Kenyan tax, whether legally or illegally.

In 2009, according to the UN&apos;s commodity trade data, the average price Kenya received for its flower exports was $3.70 a kg, whereas the average import price in Europe was $8.08 a kg. Transport costs are around 2.5% of the price a kg. Christian Aid&apos;s economist, Alex Cobham, calculates that this gap suggests Kenya may be losing as much as $500m (\u00a3312m) a year on its flower exports in this flight of capital to northern countries. About 60% of international trade now consists of internal transfers within multinational companies, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). When multinationals trade internationally with their own subsidiaries they use a mechanism called transfer pricing. Sales of goods and services between parts of the same company are meant to take place at the open market price, at an &quot;arm&apos;s length price&quot;. In practice it can be very hard to determine an open market price and by shifting ownership of research and development, marketing, brands, finance and logistics to different jurisdictions, multinationals can engineer their finances to their tax advantage. &quot;We have seen cases of multinationals reporting losses in Kenyan subsidiaries while their parent firms are making huge profits. We are investigating whether they have abused their transfer pricing policies,&quot; Njiraini told local reporters. Tax dodging in the flower sector is, however, a sensitive subject in Kenya. Several of the political elite have financial interests in flower farms. We asked to interview Njiraini but he was unavailable. It is not the first time the sector has come under investigation. In 2004 one of Njiraini&apos;s predecessors, Jack Ranguma, also began to look at the accounts. He too was suspicious that flower companies were reporting losses in Kenya while foreign investors remained eager to buy into the industry. &quot;There are many ways in which multinationals engage in aggressive tax planning and avoidance. I suspected under-invoicing of sales out of Kenya, and over-invoicing of expenses charged to Kenya which both reduce taxable profit in Kenya. I was looking at other intracompany arrangements that shifted profits to other jurisdictions such as management fees between subsidiaries, and interest rates charged for intracompany loans,&quot; he told us. Ranguma, who is now part of the Tax Justice Network in Africa, admits he cannot be certain the multinationals were dodging tax because he retired before his investigation was complete and work seemed to grind to a halt afterwards. He says he was hampered by the fact that the KRA lacked the expertise of international tax lawyers and accountants available to the multinationals. Private companies are not obliged to publish accounts in Kenya, and so it is not possible to track how much tax they pay and where. Consolidated accounts published in the countries where their ultimate parents groups are registered do not give a breakdown either. Our examination of the accounts of Flamingo/Homegrown&apos;s corporate structure does not suggest the use of offshore subsidiaries, but other flower companies do have tax-haven structures. Oserian sells to UK supermarkets including Tesco and Sainsbury&apos;s. Its Kenya company and the group&apos;s UK holding company are subsidiaries of Mavuno group in Liechtenstein. Mavuno also has a logistics company based in the low-tax jurisdiction of Dubai. We asked Oserian whether this structure was used for tax planning, but the director of administration for the Kenya company, Ruli Tsakiris, said that neither he nor the chairman of his group wished to comment on the investigation by the Kenya tax commissioner nor on the corporate structure involving Liechtenstein and Dubai. He referred us instead to the comments below from the Kenyan Flower Council. Sher Karuturi supplies the majority of its Kenyan flowers for auction in Europe. Its Kenyan operations include a network of companies ultimately owned in India through a holding company in Dubai. That company was used as an investment vehicle for acquiring the Kenya operations and carries out all its Kenya business&apos;s marketing, according to its website. It did not respond to our requests for comment. Flamingo/Homegrown is now part of the Swire group and is the main supplier to M&amp;S. Its Kenya companies and group structure are all held beneath a UK holding company, which would make it subject to the UK&apos;s controlled foreign company rules for tax purposes. Its director of sustainable business, Richard Fox, told us: &quot;The Flamingo group is a business that has grown out of Africa. We have always paid what we believe was the right amount of tax and we now follow OECD guidelines for how transfer pricing should be managed and so we feel we are doing what we should do. I would say we leave a very substantial part [of the profit we make] in Kenya because there is significant investment for continual renewal and replanting, so a lot of it has to come back to Kenya to finance [that].&quot; The Kenyan Flower Council is the trade body for both large and small flower exporters. Its chief executive, Jane Ngige, said the government investigation was welcome but until it was concluded assertions about its tax contribution were speculation. &quot;The industry is perceived to be very well heeled, but it is highly capitalised, there has been huge investment, today very few of those farms will make profit beyond 5%. It is very good the government is interested in where the money goes, but until we do a comprehensive value chain analysis we really cannot make those kind of pronouncements.&quot; Additional research by Richard Brooks", "title": "Kenyan flower industry's taxing question", "sentences": ["Mavuno also has a logistics company based in the low-tax jurisdiction of Dubai.", "We asked Oserian whether this structure was used for tax planning, but the director of administration for the Kenya company, Ruli Tsakiris, said that neither he nor the chairman of his group wished to comment on the investigation by the Kenya tax commissioner nor on the corporate structure involving Liechtenstein and Dubai.", "Its Kenyan operations include a network of companies ultimately owned in India through a holding company in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-01T13:21:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/01/corinthia-hotel-london-libya-sanctions", "tags": ["UK news", "Business", "London", "Libya", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Politics", "Africa"], "article": "A five star hotel due to open this month in central London has been given Treasury assurances that it will not face sanctions despite the fact that it is heavily backed by Libyan money.

The 300-room hotel has run a high profile advertising campaign to lure wealthy travellers to its doors. Five full page ads were placed in the Financial Times How To Spend It magazine two weeks ago. The hotel&apos;s website boasts that its location in Whitehall Place could not be more prestigious. &quot;With inspiration from world-class designers, we have created vast lobbies and high ceilings to take full advantage of spectacular cityscape views and have blended them with cutting-edge design to create iconic public spaces flooded with natural light,&quot; it claims. &quot;A supremely elegant facade, 294 sumptuous rooms and suites, stylish destination bars and speciality restaurants, together with the city&apos;s largest spa and wellness facility.You too can be involved in the making of a brand new London legend,&quot; it adds.

And there was one other essential precaution to take if you wanted to stay alive: you had to make sure to keep on the move. If you didn&apos;t, the Sri Lankan military would use your mobile signal to fix your coordinates and bomb you. &quot;We don&apos;t need a writers in prison committee in Sri Lanka,&quot; he ended his speech, &quot;because in my country they don&apos;t put writers in prison. They just kill them.&quot; No wonder then, that Sri Lanka&apos;s Galle literary festival has come under scrutiny. A recent call by the French-based organisation Reporters Sans Fronti\u00e8res to boycott this year&apos;s festival was signed by a list of high-profile names that included Noam Chomsky, Arundhati Roy and Tariq Ali. The festival, they said, gave &quot;legitimacy to the Sri Lankan government&apos;s suppression of free speech&quot;. The festival organisers were quick to rebut this charge. Theirs was a private initiative, they said, privately funded, and, rather than suppressing speech, it provided a forum for discussion. The opening session of this year&apos;s festival, titled After Shock, was a debate about the legacy of civil wars, including Sri Lanka&apos;s. The festival organisers seemed to have won the argument: among the invitees from all over the world, South Africa&apos;s Damon Galgut was the lone boycotter. Calls for cultural boycotts such as this one pose a special challenge for me. I am, after all, the new president of English PEN, whose work is focused not only on the defence of persecuted writers but also on the expansion of cultural engagement. At the same time I am a product of my South African heritage and of an early political engagement framed by the boycotts that helped to bring down the apartheid regime. I lived through so many years of boycotting South Africa that I had to train myself out of the habit of rejecting Outspan oranges. And it wasn&apos;t only South African goods we shunned. There was rugby and cricket, with the worldwide Stop the Tour protests that hit sports-mad white South Africa where it really hurt. And there were cultural boycotts that saw actors refusing to play on segregated stages, writers refusing to go on tour, and academics refusing inter-university collaborations. When, at his inauguration as president, Nelson Mandela articulated his country&apos;s relief that it would no longer be the &quot;skunk&quot; of the world, it was a sign that these boycotts had, in their own small way, helped to make the change. So I was uneasy during a recent Radio 4 Front Row programme, when I was booked to discuss the issue of cultural engagement and boycott with the Sri Lankan writer and artist Roma Tearne. Ours was the most sisterly of debates. We started out on the Galle Festival, with Tearne arguing that, although she wouldn&apos;t stop writers from going, she would never go herself because there would be no space for open discussion. I, who had been to Galle the previous year, countered with my experience of an audience \u2013 albeit an elite audience, as is the case for most literary festivals \u2013 that was ravenous to talk politics and, in particular, to talk Sri Lankan politics. And then, inevitably, our conversation turned to Ian McEwan. McEwan had recently been awarded the Jerusalem prize, given to writers whose work deals with themes of individual freedom in society. Like Margaret Atwood, who had previously ignored appeals not to accept the Dan David prize that was given by Tel Aviv University, McEwan refused calls to boycott his prize, choosing instead to weave into his acceptance speech an acknowledgment of the injustice of the evictions, demolitions and purchases of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem and to donate money to an organisation that brings together Israeli and Palestinian former fighters. As we discussed McEwan&apos;s decision, Tearne and I switched sides. She supported McEwan&apos;s decision and I demurred. To my mind, accepting a prize from Jerusalem&apos;s mayor, Nir Barkat, who has presided over the evictions, demolitions and compulsory purchases that McEwan condemned, risked normalising these policies. McEwan had struck a blow for freedom of expression, and yet, if that expression is used by others to justify the unjustifiable, how free then is it? Tearne and I are not the only ones to puzzle over the complexities of the issue. As they walked me to the lift, the show&apos;s producers said they&apos;d had trouble finding writers to discuss the subject on air, not only because writers never like criticising other writers, but because many of us find ourselves pulled in conflicting directions. The call for the Galle boycott, for example, gained strength during the Jaipur literary festival. Yet if Galle is to be boycotted because of the Sri Lankan government&apos;s abuse of human rights, then do India&apos;s actions in Kashmir make Jaipur a suitable case for boycott? Does the exploitation of workers in Dubai make its film festival a no-go area? Does Blair&apos;s decision to go to war in Iraq mean that England&apos;s many literary events should be shunned? A week tomorrow I will be debating the issue with Rachel Holmes and Romesh Gunesekera during PEN&apos;s Free the Word festival in London. The South African cultural boycott didn&apos;t happen in a vacuum. It was called for by the African National Congress, which represented the majority of South Africans, and it ran alongside a United Nations condemnation of apartheid, a worldwide protest movement and economic sanctions. That, it seems to me, is the way to go. It is easy enough to embarrass a writer \u2013 many of us feel keenly the injustices around us \u2013 into making a grand gesture. Better perhaps to campaign effectively for real change . This might include putting pressure on global companies to make it more difficult for a government such as that in Sri Lanka to use mobile phone signals to kill its opponents.

This line of reasoning usually fails to persuade these days (why are Las Vegas and Dubai unscathed by anything except the housing meltdown?) but it&apos;s persistent. We need some explanation for why our stable world is suddenly cracked in half or under water. Still, over time we&apos;ve become less superstitious, since science can explain these cataclysms. Angry gods or plate tectonics? We&apos;re definitely moving towards natural explanation of crises. Which is odd, because the physical world is moving in the other direction. The Holocene \u2013 the 10,000 years through which we have just come \u2013 was by all accounts a period of calm and stability on Earth. Temperatures and sea levels were relatively stable. Hence it was an excellent time to build a civilisation, especially the modern kind that comes with lots of stuff: roads, buildings, container ports, nuclear reactors. Yes, we had disasters throughout those millennia, some of them (Krakatoa, say) simply enormous. Hurricanes blew, earthquakes rocked. But they were, by\u00a0definition, rare, taking us by surprise \u2013 freaks, outliers, traumas that persisted in our collective history precisely because they were so unusual. We&apos;re now moving into a new geological epoch, one scientists are calling the Anthropocene \u2013 a world remade by man, most obvious in his emissions of carbon dioxide. That CO2 traps heat near the planet that would otherwise have radiated back to space \u2013 there is, simply, more energy in our atmosphere than there used to be. And that energy expresses itself in many ways: ice melts, water heats, clouds gather. 2010 was the warmest year on record, and according to insurers \u2013 the people we task with totting up disasters \u2013 it demonstrated the unprecedented mayhem this new heat causes. Global warming was &quot;the only plausible explanation&quot;, the giant reinsurer Munich Re explained in December, of 2010&apos;s catastrophes, the drought, heatwave and fires across Russia, and the mega-floods in Pakistan, Australia, Brazil and elsewhere were at least plausibly connected to the\u00a0general heating. They were, that is to say, not precisely &quot;natural disasters&quot;, but something more complex; the human thumb was on the scale. We still have plenty of purely natural disasters \u2013 though scientists can posit reasons climate change might make the world more seismically active, tectonic and volcanic forces seem beyond our reach; the great wave that broke over Sendai really did come out of the blue. But even in Japan, of course, the disaster was not entirely &quot;natural&quot;. The subsequent fallout was\u2026 fallout, the invisible plume streaming from one of our highest-tech marvels, a\u00a0complex reduced in minutes into something almost elemental, a kind of utility-owned volcano. In a sense Ishihara was correct when he decried &quot;selfish greed&quot;. It is consumerism that has flooded the atmosphere with CO2: the constant getting and spending, where $1 spent liberates roughly 1lb of carbon. We are remaking the world, and quickly; we are stumbling into a new way of thinking about disaster, where neither God nor nature, but man is to blame. That changes the valence of catastrophe. Since warm air holds more water vapour than cold, the atmosphere is nearly 5% moister than it was just a few decades ago. That loads the dice for great floods of the kind suddenly so common. I lived through one in my small mountain town in Vermont two summers ago: the biggest thunderstorm in our history dropped buckets of rain in a matter of hours. Our town is almost entirely intact forest; it should have been able to hold whatever nature threw at it. But that rain fell on a different planet from the one the forest had grown up on; every road washed out, and the governor had to visit by helicopter. But at least we had the solace (or self-lacerating realisation) that we&apos;d helped cause this deep change. Americans burn more carbon per capita than just about anyone; what do you say to a Pakistani farmer watching the swollen Indus wash away his life&apos;s work? And since global warming seems to take first aim at the poorest places that have done the least to cause it, this is a question we may be asking ourselves a good deal in the decades to come. Not every natural disaster is unnatural now, and we may be able to fool ourselves a little longer. But these days it&apos;s the climate deniers who act like the pious of yore, unable to accept the truth. I was surprised, and impressed, to read a poll of Americans taken recently. By healthy majorities, this most religious of western citizenries said natural disasters were more likely to be a sign of climate change than of God&apos;s displeasure. Which is good news, because for the first time in human history we can prevent a great deal of unnecessary cataclysm in the years ahead. Not all of it \u2013 there will always be earthquakes and hurricanes. But every bit of carbon we keep out of the atmosphere is that much less extra energy we add to the system. It&apos;s that much less disaster waiting to happen.

We drove even higher than the recommended safe area, so I was sure it was OK. Someone shouted, &quot;It&apos;s coming&quot; and I got out to have a look. The waters were upon us. I just about got my mother out of the car, but she tripped over. As I reached out to grab her, the tsunami swept us away. I was sure I was going to die. It was dark in the water and I was being hit by debris on all sides. At\u00a0one point, I saw an entire house coming towards me. But the surge forced me forward and suddenly up\u00a0into the air and on to a slope. At\u00a0last I could breathe. I\u00a0really don&apos;t know how long I was in the tsunami. The whole thing probably lasted less than a minute. Some people found me and gave me dry clothes. I dressed my own wounds. About 20 of us evacuated to a house high on one of the slopes.\u00a0We found six bodies that first\u00a0day and more on the second, including my mother&apos;s. It wasn&apos;t far.\u00a0I wrapped it in the cleanest sheet I could find and put a stone border around it. Then I covered it with a futon, so the crows could not get at it. I said a\u00a0prayer and left her there. There are so many bodies, the authorities are not sure what to do with them all. On the second day, a fire broke out on the mountain, and we didn&apos;t have much food \u2013 just one piece of bread or one rice ball each for the day. On the third day, the winds turned bitterly cold, so we walked for an hour to a public shelter at a school. When we arrived at Otsuchi, the city was still burning. I have nothing left. My savings, bank book and ID cards are all washed away. Eventually I want to move away from the coast. I feel bad about that, as my family have been here for more than five generations.

The first family came in at about 2pm \u2013 they had lost four relatives, three adults and one child. By 10pm, I was organising 50 burials. That night, cars and vans started turning up at the city morgue with bodies inside. I stayed until 4am \u2013 the bodies never stopped arriving, there were so many desperate families trying to identify their relatives. It\u00a0was madness. People couldn&apos;t find their relatives because the bodies were so dirty. It was terrible. After two days we ran out of coffins. On the Friday I called our supplier and ordered more; we got through 175. Because there were so\u00a0many dead, they moved the morgue into an old church. The bodies were laid out on long tables covered in black plastic sheets. We\u00a0started using a truck instead of\u00a0hearses to transport the bodies to\u00a0the funeral parlour. Instead of taking\u00a0one body at a time, we would\u00a0take 10 or 15. Until 20 days ago there were still bodies inside the church. Now I think there are none left. The problem now is death certificates \u2013 none has been issued yet. Many people are still missing. Thank God, nobody in my family was killed. I have one friend who had to leave his house, because there was no water or electricity, but\u00a0that was all. The city is returning to normal, but there was no carnival this year. Every week there are protests, demanding the impeachment of the mayor. Things are confused. Many people still have nowhere to live.

My family has been in the funeral business for 106 years and no one had ever seen anything like it.Tom Phillips Australian floods November 2010-January 2011: Queensland and Victoria floodsHuman cost: 37 dead, nine missing Economic cost: \u00a319bn \u2013 Australia&apos;s costliest natural disaster everSurvivor&apos;s story: Ashley Hay, 40, novelist, BrisbaneThe silence was vast. There were no birds singing, no cars on the roads. The only sound was the tiniest turn of water retreating across our lawn. I\u00a0had left home three days earlier, on\u00a0a wet day, but a normal one, and came back to find my house a little yellow island jutting out of a wide brown sea. Two days before, our suburb had been in a frenzy. My husband reported belongings being crammed into vans, trucks, cars \u2013 anything that would hold them. The traffic jammed as it tried to get to anywhere but here. Our grass, he said, was busy with flightless insects trying to get to higher ground: leeches, cockroaches, spiders. And it rained and it rained. We knew how high the water had crept in Brisbane&apos;s infamous 1974 flood. There were predictions of an extra metre this time. My husband took our son, some stuff, left most of\u00a0what we owned, and went away. Now, seeing our street, it was shocking. The Brisbane river had breached its banks, spilling across roads and parks, over cars and trees, to mark out a new shoreline, here, in our front garden. It was quiet and still and, the strangest thing of all, the sun was blazing down. The rain had stopped. The flood had peaked at 4.46m, a metre below the 1974 mark. It was 13 January, and the water was ebbing towards the day&apos;s first low. Suddenly, we knew the times and heights of the tides; suddenly we were attuned to its six-and-a-half-hour rhythm. Suddenly we were seafarers, watching our neighbours launch a boat from their drive. When the water drained away \u2013 it had gone by the next day \u2013 everything that had been immersed was a strange monochrome, halfway between brown and grey, fetid and slippy. And then it began. Taking every single thing out, piece by piece, to decide if it could be saved. It was unreasonably exhausting. We washed; we dried; we papered the lawn. And after a few days, we threw it all away. Who cares about a notebook that stinks like a sewer? Who needs a Christmas decoration that drips dark muck from hidden crevices, no matter how many times you rinse it, shake it out, pat it dry? Around us, houses were stripped and gutted \u2013 kitchens and bathrooms reduced to soggy piles of chipboard. A third of Brisbane&apos;s annual landfill \u2013 more than 110,000 tonnes of rubbish \u2013 was dumped in a week. The floods were almost three months ago now, and it&apos;s still too quiet. We&apos;re still the only people back on our strip. We tell ourselves we&apos;re the luckiest people around.Ashley Hay&apos;s first novel, The Body In The Clouds, was shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers&apos;\u00a0Prize. New Zealand earthquake February: Earthquake of magnitude 6.3 hit the city of ChristchurchHuman cost: 166 deadEconomic cost: \u00a34.5bn-\u00a36.75bnSurvivor&apos;s story: Anne Malcolm, 71, counsellor, ChristchurchI don&apos;t normally work on a Tuesday, but our counselling agency had a meeting from noon to 1pm [on the fifth floor of the Canterbury TV building]. The meeting was drawing to a close when, with no warning, the room exploded. Everything began to fly in\u00a0all directions. There had been aftershocks from the earthquake in September \u2013 we were used to the building wobbling. This was different. The explosion was sharp, jagged. Massive. I remember this sound of the structure breaking. The next thing I\u00a0recall was being completely buried. I had very, very heavy masonry and beams on me. Our floor, the top floor, came right down. There were 10 of us in the room and some rode down on the descending wall, almost surfed down with the building. Somehow the shock and adrenaline seemed to protect me, so\u00a0in those first moments I didn&apos;t experience intense pain. I\u00a0felt safe. I\u00a0felt I would survive. Two young policemen arrived within seconds. They clambered on to the rubble and began digging. Soon after, I was in the ambulance. I\u00a0had surgery, and now I&apos;m in a rehabilitation unit. I have only one functioning limb. I guess I&apos;m here for at least another three to four weeks, until I can begin using these limbs again. In hospital, I&apos;m on the ground floor. I can&apos;t imagine going into a building that&apos;s more than one level. When the aftershocks come, my heart rate increases, but then a staff member arrives to see how you are. How I&apos;ll be when I get home, I don&apos;t know. My local supermarket has gone, my post office has gone, my bakery has gone \u2013 everything that was part of my village life is gone. Our much-loved computer whiz-kid, who had been with us for 10 years, died on our floor. But on every other floor in that building, it&apos;s the other way around \u2013 one or two people were rescued, but everyone else was lost. We were the fortunate ones.Toby Manhire Sri Lankan floods January-February: Devastating floods hit the country; more rain fell in Batticaloa than it normally gets in a yearHuman cost: 62 dead; 1.1\u00a0million\u00a0displacedEconomic cost: \u00a3300mSurvivor&apos;s story: Milvahanam Loganadan, 40, driver, BatticalaoIt was about 7.30pm and we were sitting down to watch TV when we\u00a0heard people making a lot of noise in\u00a0the street outside. &quot;The\u00a0water is coming,&quot; they were shouting. &quot;It&apos;s a flood.&quot; I didn&apos;t know what to do \u2013 we have\u00a0a seven-month-old baby and\u00a0a\u00a0four-year-old. But even before I could get to the door, the water was coming into the house. It was rushing in, so we picked up the children, ran out and\u00a0kept going until we got to higher\u00a0ground. I convinced a rickshaw driver to\u00a0take the rest of my family to my wife&apos;s mother&apos;s house, which is on\u00a0top of a hill. It was chaotic. There\u00a0had been no warning on the\u00a0television or radio, so it was totally unexpected. It had been raining, certainly, but not enough for us to think that a flood was on\u00a0its\u00a0way. Once my family were safe, I went back to the house to get valuables and documents. Everything else was\u00a0ruined. I\u00a0checked on the neighbours. The navy and police had got to our\u00a0street with boats to evacuate the\u00a0ones who couldn&apos;t move themselves. Most people moved in with relatives, but quite a\u00a0lot of people ended up in camps for the displaced.\u00a0Happily, there were no deaths among\u00a0my friends and family, although I know other people did die. There were snakes in\u00a0the water; that killed a few, I\u00a0heard. We spent a week cleaning the house and then the waters came again and we had to evacuate again, and then clean it up once more. All our furniture has gone, and my\u00a0motorbike, but it could have been worse. I&apos;ve got a job, which helps a lot. Most of the farmers have\u00a0lost a lot of their crop and other people needed the dry rations\u00a0the NGOs were handing out to stay alive. It is the fear that is the toughest thing to deal with. The children were really frightened when it happened and Laksher, my four-year-old, is still scared that the waters will come again in the middle of the night.Jason Burke Burma earthquake March: Magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck about 30 miles north of Tachileik on the Thai-Burma border Human cost: At least 75 dead; more\u00a0than 110 injuredEconomic cost: Not yet knownSurvivor&apos;s story: Sai Noom Khan (not his real name), 23,\u00a0TachileikI was with my wife watching television when a loud knocking started suddenly. The room started to shake\u00a0and all our photos fell off the wall. It\u00a0was terrifying. I had never experienced an earthquake before. I was worried the house would collapse, so I grabbed my wife by the hand and we ran. We ran outside, but the ground was shaking so much it was hard to stand up. It lasted only about 40 to 50 seconds. We live on the top of the mountain, so there wasn&apos;t too much damage. Since the earthquake, everyone&apos;s been sleeping outside. It&apos;s cold, but we&apos;re too scared to sleep indoors.

It was the morning of 17 March. I watched, helpless, as our home was taken away by the floods. The only reminder that our house stood there was a lonely post. This was the first time I&apos;ve seen the waters that high. I&apos;m 5ft 5in and the floodwaters could have easily swallowed me. My wife and I saved every peso so we could buy the things we need.

There was heavy rain and\u00a0I\u00a0was afraid because I didn&apos;t even know where to put my kids. We couldn&apos;t open the front door because more water would come in,\u00a0and it wasn&apos;t even safe to open the window. We wanted to stay inside,\u00a0but we\u00a0could see the water was a metre\u00a0high, so we used a\u00a0hatch\u00a0to climb on the roof \u2013 we\u00a0waited there\u00a0for four or five hours. It\u00a0was raining\u00a0hard. We couldn&apos;t run\u00a0away\u00a0because we had to look after our property. That day was a disaster. Everything was washed away.

Amid uncertainty about the overall death toll, the UN said its staff were killed when the usually peaceful city of Mazar-e-Sharif exploded into violent protest. Four of the seven foreigners killed were former Gurkhas working as private security guards. Norway&apos;s defence ministry named another victim as Lieutenant Colonel Siki Skare, a 53-year-old female pilot working for the UN, while the sixth victim was named as Joakin Dungel, 33, a Swede working in the UN office. The seventh foreigner killed was believed to be Romanian. Two of the UN workers were reported to have been beheaded Last night, Afghan officials arrested more than 20 people in connection with the assault including the alleged ringleader. Under UN rules, officials will have to consider pulling out staff members or shutting down operations altogether. After an attack on a UN guesthouse in Kabul in late 2009 in which five UN staff were killed, hundreds of their colleagues were temporarily relocated to Dubai while the organisation spent millions closing guesthouses and outfitting a big base on the outskirts of Kabul. Last night, Staffan de Mistura, the UN&apos;s leading envoy in Afghanistan, flew directly to Mazar-e-Sharif to take stock of the disaster. One senior staff member said there had been &quot;absolutely no discussion&quot; about repositioning staff, but many UN workers feared the incident would mark another milestone in the gradual retreat of UN diplomats and aid workers into a world where they only see the inside of fortified compounds and armoured vehicles. Last week Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, said Mazar-e-Sharif would be one of the first areas to be transferred to Afghan control this year. But the police were no match for the sudden outburst of violence yesterday, which was triggered by the actions of a fringe Christian group on the other side of the world. The Rev Terry Jones&apos;s small church, the Dove World Outreach Centre in Florida, had threatened to destroy a copy of the Qur&apos;an on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks last year, but the pastor backed down after an appeal by General David Petraeus, the commander of US forces in Aghnaistan. But the church went through with the burning last month with Jones in attendance. The Qur&apos;an burning was the subject of anger at Friday prayers around Afghanistan yesterday. In Mazar-e-Sharif thousands of people poured out of the city&apos;s famous Blue Mosque after a sermon by the presiding mullah, with one police official estimating that there were 4,000 people on the streets of the city. The head of the Blue Mosque, Atiqullah Ansari, said only a minority were responsible for the violence, claiming they were the followers of a mullah who served under the Taliban regime. &quot;They went to the UN compound and killed the foreigners, this is what they wanted,&quot; he said. Last night Jones told the BBC he could not be held responsible for the attack on the UN. Instead he blamed Islam. &quot;We must take a serious, serious look at Islam,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a violent religion that promotes acts of violence, I believe we need to bring this before the UN.&quot; Barack Obama condemned the attack, saying: &quot;We stress the importance of calm and urge all parties to reject violence and resolve differences through dialogue.&quot; The attack was also condemned by William Hague, the foreign secretary, who said: &quot;The families and friends of those killed today have my deepest sympathies. The work of the [UN] in Afghanistan is of utmost importance. It is vital that they can carry out their work in a safe and secure environment. &quot;I call upon the Afghan government to investigate this incident and bring the perpetrators to justice.&quot; However, in Mazar-e-Sharif the surviving UN staff were said to be shell-shocked and bewildered at the failings of security that allowed their compound to be overwhelmed. Across the country the UN issued a &quot;White City&quot; order, putting all staff members into a state of lockdown, preventing them from leaving their compounds.", "title": "Afghanistan: United Nations mission rocked by mob killings", "sentences": ["After an attack on a UN guesthouse in Kabul in late 2009 in which five UN staff were killed, hundreds of their colleagues were temporarily relocated to Dubai while the organisation spent millions closing guesthouses and outfitting a big base on the outskirts of Kabul."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-02T00:46:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/apr/02/talking-horses", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Horse racing tips", "Sport betting", "Sport"], "article": "Paul Hanagan kicked off his championship season with four winners on this day last year, three of them trained by his main employer, Richard Fahey. Neither man has made quite the same impact over the first three days of the new turf season but they are well placed to win the Lincoln Handicap with Irish Heartbeat. Too much could be made of the fact that Irish Heartbeat (3.10) is unbeaten in two visits to Doncaster, but it is encouraging that he was able to win the Spring Mile over the Lincoln course and distance on his reappearance last year, his first run since joining Fahey from Ireland. He beat 17 rivals over an extended six furlongs here in September and it is always reassuring, in these races, if your fancy has a proven ability to beat big fields on straight tracks. Irish Heartbeat remains just 5lb higher than for his latest success, despite having run well in two six-furlong races since then. Fresh and returning to a mile, he can make it a hat-trick of victories on Town Moor. Fahey also runs Castles In The Air, another who has won a big-field handicap over a straight course and who also won on his reappearance last year. Taqleed did not quite get home when sixth in the Cambridgeshire on just his fourth start, his second in a handicap. Now four and presumably having matured physically, he is an obvious contender off the same handicap mark, but odds of 4-1 are hard to like, even allowing for his trainer&apos;s excellent record in such races. Eton Rifles did not manage to score last year, but ran well on his final three starts and was held off by a short-head over seven furlongs here in November. Another 2lb is probably neither here nor there and, if ready to go on his reappearance, could go close at big odds. The effect of the draw is much harder to predict these days but Irish Heartbeat is at least drawn on the side that had the edge, if there was an edge, in last year&apos;s race. Doncaster 2.05 Fahey and Hanagan could kick off another big day with Justonefortheroad in the Spring Mile. Also a winner on his first outing last year, this five-year-old scored twice more, most recently gaining a narrow verdict over Eton Rifles and 17 others over seven furlongs at York in October. Kempton 2.20 Last year&apos;s Lincoln winner, Penitent, returns to the Polytrack circuit where he once ran on to force a dead-heat as a three-year-old. Already a winner at Listed level, he comes from the yard that won this race last year and is likely to be sharp enough. This 10-furlong trip would be a doubt on a straight turf track, but he can surely see it out here. Doncaster 2.35 John Ryan is among those trainers who seem to have hit the ground running and his Iver Bridge Lad finally got on the score sheet for the first time in 20 months at Kempton last Saturday. It was not a great race and he had shown better form when chasing home JJ The Jet Plane in Dubai a fortnight before. This looks a good chance for him and he may catch some of these short of peak fitness. Kempton 3.25 Fahey is not known for his strike-rate in Sunbury, but Cosmic Sun may gain the trainer a rare success. Well beaten in the Cesarewitch, he has since been given a second breathing operation and ran on strongly to win at Lingfield in February on his only subsequent start, making his all-weather debut. Just 4lb higher, he must have an excellent chance. The runner-up at Lingfield, Beaubrav, had won his previous two starts and has won again since. Doncaster 3.40 David Evans has a couple of two-year-old wins on the board, one of them having been achieved with Redair at Kempton a week ago, when she beat Bubbly Ballerina and He&apos;s So Cool. Judging by the market support, that success was not unexpected, though she hung badly through greenness. Straighter this time, she may be hard to catch. Horse sense The Lincoln at Doncaster should prove its usual competitive self, with tips flying around for several horses, including the well-established favourite, Taqleed (3.10), described as &quot;fit, well and strong&quot; by our Newmarket source. There have also been mutterings of support for Prime Exhibit and Fremont, also prominent in the betting. Axiom is thought to be the interesting each-way contender, having his first run since joining Ed Walker, whose horses are reported to be looking well. It could be a big day for Newmarket trainers as John Gosden&apos;s Cobbs Quay (4.15) has been working well in preparation for today&apos;s maiden, while Satwa Moon (5.20) will be backed to give Ed Dunlop a winner. Paul Cole has had his first winner of the new turf season and is expected to have another with Mata Keranjang (2.05), gelded since last year. However, he will face a real challenge from Eton Forever, who was working well with Laaheb before that one was fourth in Dubai last weekend. Barry Hills has several juveniles who are reckoned to be well forward. His Sea Odyssey will be well fancied for the five-furlong maiden at Windsor on Monday. More immediately, Early Applause (2.10), a three-year-old, is expected to break his maiden at Doncaster tomorrow, having shown significant improvement since last year. Nicky Henderson will have a strong team at the Grand National meeting and there is real enthusiasm from those close to Long Run for him to run on Thursday. Henderson is expected to run Oscar Whisky and Binocular in the Aintree Hurdle but there is more room for doubt about the Cheltenham winner Bobs Worth. If the going is not softer than expected, he may miss the staying novice hurdle, though Henderson would still run Mossley. Seen and heard Hootys Agogo, third on his debut at Wolverhampton this week, is a name that officials at the British Horseracing Authority would probably like to veto, but they have missed their opportunity to do so. A Google search reveals that the gelding shares his name with a bar in the red-light district of Pattaya, Thailand, which is presumably familiar to a very different sort of punter. Among the more obvious April fool gags yesterday was the one posted on Paul Nicholls&apos; Betfair column, in which the champion trainer announced that he had been &quot;spreading myself a bit too thinly&quot;. His assistant, Dan Skelton, would take over training the hurdles and bumper horses, the spoof article said. &quot;While some at Ditcheat may think that Dan struggles to get past page three of the Sun each morning, he is a brilliant horseman,&quot; Nicholls was quoted as saying. Nicholls&apos; fellow trainer Marcus Tregoning has rearranged his business for real and, from this season, will be leasing Kingwood House Stables from Sheikh Hamdan rather than being salaried to train from there. Tregoning is determined to attract new owners and, to that end, is hoping for success from his three-year-old Yaseer and the juvenile Cavaleiro, one of the first crop of Sir Percy, the trainer&apos;s Derby winner from 2006. Will Hayler&apos;s best bet Sharp Sovereign 5.55 Doncaster Luke McNiff must count among the more experienced of these apprentices, albeit in a slightly different sphere, as he rode Church Island into second place in the 2009 Irish National. He&apos;s got a nice ride here on David Barron&apos;s five-year-old, who was never out of the first three in 10 starts last year, scoring four times at around today&apos;s trip on a decent surface.", "title": "Talking Horses", "sentences": ["It was not a great race and he had shown better form when chasing home JJ The Jet Plane in Dubai a fortnight before.", "However, he will face a real challenge from Eton Forever, who was working well with Laaheb before that one was fourth in Dubai last weekend."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-02T08:59:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/02/afghanistan-mazar-sharif-united-nations", "tags": ["Afghanistan", "United Nations", "World news"], "article": "Syed Jamal had a front-row seat for Friday&apos;s sacking of the UN compound in Mazar-e-Sharif. The small building containing offices for the provincial mission are separated from the bread shop owned by the 17-year-old&apos;s family by just an open drain and a few dozen yards of rutted, unpaved road. The day after the attack, a group of 20 bored policemen were lounging around in the front of the gutted building, biding their time by reading UN leaflets that had become strewn in front of the building, and standing guard in front of a pair of burned-out trucks. But the dramatic events of Friday \u2013 events that shocked the world, imperilled the entire UN mission and raised serious doubts about how Afghanistan will handle the handover of power from its foreign backers \u2013 were of marginal interest to Jamal and the boys messing around on the corner. And there were mixed feelings about the rights and wrongs of an incident that cost the lives of seven UN staff \u2013 four Gurkha security guards and three European UN diplomats \u2013 making it the worst crisis to hit the international organisation in Afghanistan. Yes, they thought what happened on their doorstep was wrong \u2013 particularly the beheading of two UN staff, who they accepted were only in Mazar to &quot;serve Afghanistan&quot;. But, they said, &quot;the foreigners&quot; needed to understand the level of anger at the desecration of the Qur&apos;an by a Christian extremist on the other side of the world. &quot;Why do they not respect us?&quot; asked Jamal. &quot;We do not burn their Christian books, so they need to understand that the Qur&apos;an is our most holy book.&quot; It was a question repeated in other parts of Afghanistan as anger over the Qur&apos;an-burning fuelled a second day of violence, sparking riots in the southern city of Kandahar in which nine protesters died and more than 80 were injured. Demonstrations in cities such as Kabul and Herat against Florida pastor Terry Jones&apos;s stunt were reported to have stayed peaceful, in stark comparison to Friday&apos;s drama in Mazar. It was in the city&apos;s exquisite Blue Mosque, where Jones&apos;s Qur&apos;an-burning was the subject of a Friday-prayers sermon, that the afternoon&apos;s bloody sequence of events began to unfold. Upon leaving the mosque, worshippers found another set of religious leaders in a Toyota Corolla kitted out with loudspeakers urging people to join them at the burning of Jones in effigy. But then the crowd turned and started walking the one-mile journey towards the UN compound. Atiullah Ansari, head of the Blue Mosque, said there had been no plan to do that and claimed that radical madrasa students from outside the city were to blame. These &quot;agents of the Taliban and Hezb-e-Islami [a Taliban-allied insurgent group]&quot; were solely responsible for the violence, he argued. That view was also being pushed by provincial government officials keen to blame a small minority for inciting the violence, although few analysts accepted it. Unusually, one of the Taliban&apos;s spokesmen, Zabiullah Mujahid \u2013 a man not usually given to missing an opportunity to claim credit for mayhem \u2013 sent a text message to the Observer denying involvement. If the glimmer of popular sympathy for violence in Mazar is disturbing, so too is the fact that such a terrible attack on western civilians should have happened there at all. Mazar is a highly secure city of ordered streets, where cars are regulated by traffic lights which, almost uniquely in Afghanistan, not only work but are obeyed. When Liam Fox, the defence secretary, toured Afghanistan, he made a point of adding Mazar to the usual British itinerary of Kabul and Helmand. &quot;It was a totally unthreatening environment,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;It&apos;s a city the size of Bristol and it felt just like any safe city in Central Asia.&quot; Indeed, there are few signs of the concrete bastions and blast walls that encrust important buildings in other Afghan cities. The newly opened US consulate, which has taken over an old hotel, does not even have razor wire along its not particularly high walls. And the UN compound looks, with hindsight, absurdly under-protected. Little stood in the way of Friday&apos;s crowds except a metal car barrier and a couple of Gurkhas who, on being overwhelmed by the crowds, were beaten with the butts of their own assault rifles, eyewitnesses said. The image of a furious mob cutting down the white men who had come into their midst conjured up parallels with the west&apos;s previous forays into the country, not least the first Anglo-Afghan War, which was preceded by a crowd overwhelming a British position and killing the famous diplomat Alexander Burnes in 1841. That incident had in part been due to the dissolute behaviour of foreigners that had been gradually enraging the locals in the conservative Islamic country for some time. Many believe the same is happening again. &quot;There is a lot of anger after years in which western military operations have caused an accumulation of civilian casualty cases,&quot; wrote Thomas Ruttig, director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network. &quot;Afghans are tired of the repeated initial denials, then admission that something may have gone wrong and then apologies. Paying compensation might be nice gestures but cannot bring anyone back to life.&quot; Politicians, including the president Hamid Karzai, tap into public anger in order \u2013 claim his many critics \u2013 to mask his own shortcomings. The day before the Mazar riots, the Afghan president fuelled the controversy by condemning the Qur&apos;an burning and calling for Jones to be arrested. In days gone by, the UN liked to think it stood above the many conflicts in Afghanistan, working as a vital independent arbiter. Today, however, the international organisation is regarded as too weak to be truly useful by the Americans and partisan by both the government and much of the insurgent movement. The Karzai government&apos;s displeasure with the UN was illustrated earlier this month when Ban Ki-moon, the organisation&apos;s secretary general, received an extraordinary letter from the Afghan foreign minister demanding radical changes to its mandate in the country. The government demanded that the UN close down many of its offices, limiting its presence to just &quot;six recognised zones throughout the country.&quot; The tragedy is that the UN had just started preparing for potentially greater risks to its staff in future, as the country starts a multi-year process of &quot;transition&quot; from Nato to Afghan security control. By the end of 2014, the entire country is meant to be in the hands of the Afghan National Army and its police force, with certain cities and provinces due to be transfer this year \u2013 including Mazar. But in a sign that they are not fully confident in Afghanistan&apos;s security services, UN officers have been looking at ways to improve the safety of their staff in areas that are soon to be handed over. Even in Bamiyan, by far the most benign and anti-Taliban area in the country, which is also slated to be transferred away from Nato control this year, the UN has drawn up plans to move from the compound that has served it well for years to the other side of the town and a more secure area. It is the sort of development that is likely to further erode already rock-bottom morale among many UN staff who, over the last two years, have seen their freedom to operate drastically curtailed in the name of security. Today they live and work in increasingly fortress-like facilities and only see everyday Afghanistan through the thick glass of their armoured vehicles. Now things could get even worse, with many UN staffers predicting that \u2013 as with the aftermath of an attack on a Kabul guesthouse in 2009 that left five dead \u2013 many people might be sent out of the country altogether to work remotely for Afghanistan from Dubai. Writing on her personal blog in response to Friday&apos;s attack, one aid worker called Una Moore said that the episode did not represent the beginning of the end of the international presence in Afghanistan; &quot;this is the end,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Unless we, the internationals, want our guards to fire on unarmed protesters from now on, the day has come for us to leave Afghanistan.&quot;", "title": "Afghanistan: when gentle Mazar-e-Sharif erupted in violence", "sentences": ["Now things could get even worse, with many UN staffers predicting that \u2013 as with the aftermath of an attack on a Kabul guesthouse in 2009 that left five dead \u2013 many people might be sent out of the country altogether to work remotely for Afghanistan from Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-02T18:45:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/04/libya-gaddafi-opposition", "tags": ["Libya", "Muammar Gaddafi", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Protest", "Africa"], "article": "Sitting at a cafe overlooking the second-century Roman arch of Marcus Aurelius, I am basking in the sun. In the nearby bazaar, pedlars shout their wares and customers bargain with the shopkeepers. Young Libyans sip their mint tea and the call to midday prayer beams out from several minarets. First impressions of Tripoli can be deceiving and things aren&apos;t quite as serene as they seem. People talk of corruption, lack of opportunities, frustration and a chokehold on expression but they are wary of who may be sat on the adjacent table. Opinions about the government or its projects are whispered in hushed voices. Officials are not mentioned by name if possible, for fear of being overheard by eavesdroppers, especially where Gaddafi and his family are concerned. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named from the Harry Potter series springs to mind. Libyans, young and old, long for freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of thought. Many Libyans like myself have been fortunate enough to observe these freedoms in practice in the west and to some extent in certain other Arab countries. But many Libyans are not so fortunate. On my countless visits to Libya I have experienced firsthand the social, civil, political, education and health &quot;systems&quot;: they basically do not exist. During his reign in power, Gaddafi has intentionally dismantled all civil institutions. Libyans have suffered as a result, while Gaddafi and his followers have reaped the financial benefits of the country&apos;s rich natural resources in what can only be described as the most successful mafia operation of the past four decades. I once spent two months working in the largest hospital in Libya \u2013 Tripoli Medical Centre. I can only describe my experience there as chaos. This was the so-called beacon of the revolution, the flagship hospital, the largest, most progressive hospital with all of the latest facilities that set the standards in healthcare for Libyans; the reality is of nurses unavailable to tend to patients, nonexistent daily ward rounds, multimillion dollar scanners lying unused in locked rooms. On one occasion, as I observed operations in the operating room, a man would casually walk through in jeans, a scruffy shirt and slicked back hair with a cappuccino in his hands and start a conversation as if he was in Starbucks. No wonder those that can afford it opt for medical treatment in countries like Tunisia, Jordan or even Europe. Driving along the main coastal highway in Tripoli, I would often visualise the untapped potential along this stretch of the Mediterranean. My friends and I would often reflect on the lack of development of the sprawling beaches. I would reminisce about places I have been fortunate enough to visit \u2013 the haute couture of Beirut, the chic of the C\u00f4te d&apos;Azur and the buzz of Jumeirah Beach Road in Dubai. The images of Tripoli in the 1950s, with its Italian colonnades and clean streets, could not be further from the mayhem and disorganisation that are the streets of the city today. It pains me to see that not only is there a lack of progress in Libya, but that the country is actively being decayed by the pathogen that is the regime. Libyans are idealists. Any hopes, ambitions or aspirations that they have had for the past four decades have been systematically crushed. Dreams have been shattered. The 17 February revolution has blown a breath of fresh air into all Libyans \u2013 whether they are in Libya itself or the Libyan diaspora dotted around the world. It is the dawn of a new era. We are now realising that the Libya that our parents could not provide for us is rapidly becoming a reality. There is a rich culture, heritage, music, history and arts that has been locked away for decades \u2013 the regime did not allow the people to freely express themselves using these valuable tools but there is a gripping realisation that these important parts of Libyan identity are even more valuable than the much-debated black gold that lies beneath its soil. Issues of tribal allegiances, &quot;east versus west Libya&quot;, ethnic groups and civil war have all been grossly overstated. Libya is not homogenous; Libya consists of many ethnic groups, religions, languages and tribes.

Here are 20 questions the MPs might consider asking these two top administrators, based on the remit of the inquiry, to consider whether &quot;football supporters are ill-served by current football club regulations,&quot; how to &quot;enhance supporter involvement in decision-making processes&quot; and whether there is a &quot;case for strategic government intervention&quot; \u2013 particularly in relation to &quot;the high-profile coverage of Liverpool and Manchester United&quot; and &quot;broader concerns.&quot; Congratulating the Premier League and its clubs, of course, for their great success since its clubs broke away from the Football League in 1992, in increasing their popularity, the achievements on the field and commercial pre-eminence, the committee could ask:1) Do Richards and Scudamore believe there is any problem at all with the Glazer family&apos;s leveraged buyout of Manchester United, which has loaded \u00a3522m debt on to the club and cost United around \u00a3350m in interests, charges and fees since 2005? 2) If there is no problem, do Richards and Scudamore disagree with Sir Martin Broughton, then the Liverpool chairman, who in the thick of the fight with Tom Hicks to sell the club in October, said: &quot;If you are leveraged, that is bad for a football club?&quot; 3) If leverage is not bad for football clubs, do Richards and Scudamore consider Liverpool are no better off with John Henry&apos;s Fenway Sports Group having paid off the \u00a3200m debt to Royal Bank of Scotland which Hicks and George Gillett&apos;s takeover had loaded on to the club? 4) In October 2008, Lord Triesman, then the FA chairman, warned of the &quot;very grave dangers&quot; posed by the \u00a33bn debt then owed by professional football. In response Scudamore said its clubs&apos; debts were &quot;sustainable.&quot; Given the subsequent insolvency of Portsmouth, and the financial crises at Liverpool, Hull City and West Ham United, and the measures the Premier League has since taken to tighten up its financial rules, has Triesman&apos;s judgment been vindicated? 5) Is the fact that English clubs are companies, up for sale to the highest bidder, the best way for our football clubs to be set up? 6) What positive proposals do Richards and Scudamore have to meet the government&apos;s and inquiry&apos;s stated commitment to involve supporters more in the ownership and decision-making at clubs? 7) Should the fit and proper persons test, now revised into the owners and directors test, outlaw buyers of clubs who are doing so with debt, and planning to load the clubs with those debts? 8) Are there lessons to be learned from the case of Thaksin Shinawatra, who was passed as fit and proper to buy Manchester City in 2007 despite having had his human rights record severely criticised by Amnesty International, been charged with corruption offences in Thailand and had his assets frozen in his home country? 9) Is Sven Goran-Eriksson&apos;s recall of his conversation with Richards at the time correct, that when pondering whether to accept Thaksin&apos;s offer of the City manager&apos;s job, Eriksson was told by Richards that Thaksin was: &quot;Absolutely clean?&quot; 10) Does Richards still believe what he told a 2008 conference in Dubai that the Premier League is damaging the England team because its clubs are &quot;lazy&quot; about playing English youngsters and do the &quot;easy thing&quot; of signing too many foreign stars? 11) The Football Task Force, in its report of January 1999, supported the Premier League to sell its TV rights collectively, against a European Commission challenge, which has made the league billions since. The Premier League agreed in the same report to &quot;make a minimum of 5% of income available primarily for investment in grass-roots facilities and projects.&quot; That led to the establishment of the Football Foundation. This season, the Premier League&apos;s TV deal alone is more than \u00a31bn, yet its contribution to the foundation is \u00a312m \u2013 1%. Why is this? 12) The Sport and Recreation Alliance includes the Premier League in its list of bodies committing to invest 30% of &quot;net broadcasting income&quot; into grass-roots sport. From the broadcasting income of over \u00a31bn, that would mean more than \u00a3300m invested into grass roots sport. How does the Premier League make its 30% figure? 13) Does the fact that there have been 54 club insolvencies in the Football League since the formation of the Premier League in 1992 have anything to do with the fact that so little of the Premier League fortune is shared with the league (except for parachute payments to relegated Premier League clubs)? 14) In 2008, responding to Triesman&apos;s speech about the dangers of debt, Scudamore said of the FA: &quot;We are like competitors. We compete for sponsorship and for television rights and we are in the same space.&quot; Do he and Richards consider the FA a commercial rival? 15) Do he and Richards accept that the FA is the governing body of English football, with the power to make rules to which the leagues and its clubs must adhere? 16) When there is so much attention on the FA for not having independent non-executive directors on its 12-man board, why is it acceptable for the Premier League&apos;s board to be made up of two men, Richards and Scudamore, with no independent directors? 17) The committee is considering whether to recommend a licensing system for clubs, incorporating rules on finance and governance with which clubs must comply, which the FA, as the governing body, would oversee. How do they feel about that? 18) When Richards proposed to the FA board in 2009 that they resolve not to send Lord Triesman&apos;s draft proposals on financial governance to the then minister Andy Burnham, and instead send a statement on behalf of the FA that it supported the Premier and Football League&apos;s proposals, was that not weakening the authority of the FA, of which Richards is a board member? 19) Is the Premier League satisfied that the average age of a supporter at matches, according to its own fan surveys, is around 44? 20) Does the Premier League see any merit in the German Football Federation&apos;s policy statement, explaining why it wanted to retain cheap access to matches, around \u00a312 to stand, compared to Premier League tickets of \u00a330-\u00a350, that: &quot;Football, being a people&apos;s sport, should not banish the socially disadvantaged from its stadia, and it should not place its social function in doubt?&quot;", "title": "Twenty questions parliament should ask the Premier League's two chiefs | David Conn", "sentences": ["9) Is Sven Goran-Eriksson&apos;s recall of his conversation with Richards at the time correct, that when pondering whether to accept Thaksin&apos;s offer of the City manager&apos;s job, Eriksson was told by Richards that Thaksin was: &quot;Absolutely clean?&quot; 10) Does Richards still believe what he told a 2008 conference in Dubai that the Premier League is damaging the England team because its clubs are &quot;lazy&quot; about playing English youngsters and do the &quot;easy thing&quot; of signing too many foreign stars?"], "publicationDate": "2011-04-04T14:17:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/04/novak-djokovic-number-one-ranking", "tags": ["Novak Djokovic", "Rafael Nadal", "Tennis", "Sport"], "article": "Novak Djokovic, for the time being and maybe a little while to come, is unbeatable. Ask Rafael Nadal. Ask Roger Federer. Ask Tomas Berdych. The testimonies will be qualified, varying in enthusiasm, but unanimous: the Serb is the man to beat. And if a reference from his closest and most demoralised contemporary is needed, ask Andy Murray. Nothing puts Murray&apos;s own wretched season in perspective so starkly as the success of his friend and rival, who was born a week after him, has gone nip and tuck with the Scot through the junior and senior ranks but, over the past three months, has moved further ahead than the gap of two places in the world rankings would suggest. When Djokovic \u2013 ranked second by the computer but not by many of his peers \u2013 came from 5-2 down in the first set to beat Nadal in the final of the Miami Masters 1000 on Sunday, he continued a winning streak that began in the Australian Open 11 weeks ago. He also brought his victories over top-10 players in that time to eight. These are not cheap victories. He has beaten Nadal twice, Federer three times, Berdych twice and Murray once. Such sustained excellence is rare; Nadal went on a 22-0 run on clay last year and, in 1984, John McEnroe strung together 39 wins before losing to Ivan Lendl in the French Open final. To emulate McEnroe&apos;s golden year \u2013 he was 82-3 over the season \u2013 Djokovic will have to win at least another slam, maybe not at Roland Garros, but Nadal&apos;s Wimbledon title is in his sights and the US Open as well. If he stays free of injury and his form holds, Djokovic should overtake Nadal this summer at the top of the rankings because the Spaniard, 3,170 points ahead of him, has so many more to defend. So irresistible has Djokovic been that even a switch to clay in Monte Carlo next week might not stop his rise. Nadal reckons Djokovic is a more serious threat to the No1 ranking he has held in his current reign since June last year than Federer \u2013 and some way ahead of world No4 Murray who has not won a set, let alone a match, since Djokovic blasted him in three sets to win the Australian Open. &quot;I think he&apos;s going to be No1,&quot; Nadal said, after Djokovic emerged a 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 winner of a final that dipped and soared for 3hr 22min. He reckoned Djokovic could reach the summit within two months. &quot;It depends on my results on clay. For sure he will be there. If I am solid, if I [have] a very good clay-court season, we will see.&quot; Djokovic is cautious. &quot;I know I&apos;ve had the best start of the season, no question about it,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s the best four months in my life. But it&apos;s only the start of the season. It&apos;s a bit early to talk about getting that top spot. Rafa is definitely the best player in the world now. &quot;I need to play consistently well throughout the whole year. We all know that clay court is his favourite surface \u2013 and I&apos;ve never beaten Rafa on clay.&quot; Few have. He remains the king of the red dirt and, on form, the only player capable of keeping Djokovic in check. As he said when he discovered tweeting recently, Djokovic feels he &quot;can fly&quot;. For 24 consecutive matches (26 in all going back before Christmas to the Davis Cup), he has stepped on to courts in Melbourne, Dubai, California and Florida so sure of his tennis that those formidable opponents have taken only four sets off him. When the best players do come at him, he raises his game, the memorable feature of his latest win over Nadal. But he has attained more than dominance. He has matured. &quot;You can&apos;t always expect to win,&quot; he said. &quot;I accept every day of my life on the court as something new to learn, trying to take the best out of it and move on as a better player, better person. I&apos;m still only 23.&quot; And that might be the most chilling statistic of them all.", "title": "Novak Djokovic has Rafael Nadal's No1 spot in his sights", "sentences": ["For 24 consecutive matches (26 in all going back before Christmas to the Davis Cup), he has stepped on to courts in Melbourne, Dubai, California and Florida so sure of his tennis that those formidable opponents have taken only four sets off him."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-04T20:12:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/activate/interview-benjamin-bratton-better-design", "tags": ["New York speaker interviews", "Education"], "article": "Tell us who you work for and what you do. I am a writer. My work is a mix of social and political philosophy, architectural and urban theory, and computing and information infrastructure. I direct the Center for Design and Geopolitics at Calit2 at University of California, San Diego, where I work side-by-side with nanoengineers, biotechnologists, computational physicists, neuro-ontologists, and, of course, crazy artists. A lot of my recent thinking is at bratton.info and @bratton. Right now, I am writing a book on the the fate of cosmopolitanism in the era of planetary computation and post-humanism.  Cities cover 2% of the earth&apos;s crust and account for 50% of the world&apos;s population. Does this statistic fully highlight the importance of architects and designers in facilitating a harmonious world?\u00a0 Only if we assume that architects and designers are responsible for the architecture and design of cities. They are and they aren&apos;t. Cities are almost living things unto themselves, which we can certainly effect in particular ways, but which evolve according patterns in migratory networks, logistical networks, financial networks, informational networks, and so on. We may soon take for granted the notion that these impersonal processes have more to with the character of cities than any single master plan. This is not to say that we shouldn&apos;t think hard about design, quite to the contrary. But our focus should be on thinking of the world&apos;s cities as a single, massively-distributed urban organism, instead of little isolated fortresses.  Perhaps the main points of conflict for the near future for cities are between formal and informal urbanism on the one hand, and &quot;open&quot; vs. private urbanism on the other. Informal open spaces in many of the world&apos;s fastest growing megacities are sites of both tremendous misery and tremendous vitality and invention. They are laboratories. For what, we don&apos;t know yet. We also see the predominance of private, highly curated and securitized environments as a preferred affluent experience. Disney pioneered the top-down designed environment, but certainly it is a program that is global: from Apple to Dubai. (I see the Android vs. iOS theological schism ultimately playing out at the level of the digital environments we want to program. The hardware at stake is the city itself.) Can willingness to do good in the world be promoted through better design, better architecture? What can be done to foster and encourage more social entrepreneurs and innovators? Better design is a way of doing good in and of itself, one would assume. But what is better design? Better for what end? Design means &quot;designation.&quot; To design is not only to make. It is also propose, project and ultimately to determine the material structure of the world we share. It is both authorship and authority, and this is a good thing.  That said, I don&apos;t believe that innovation ultimately comes down to people&apos;s attitudes so much as to systemic opportunities for ideas to actually take root and scale. Part of the reason that the internet was able to support innovation from so many different places is that it was built on standard platforms and protocols that allowed each point-of-reception to also be a point-of-production. Because of platform neutrality --this is an ideal version, I realise-- something that starts in one location can scale to become a global technique with less interference.  What if cities worked the same way? For me good urbanism means a healthy and playful mix of programs, of chance encounters, of interesting relationships with strangers, of cooperative experiences that are not dictated by shopping and entertainment, or worse, by security.  As bits and atoms interweave more closely into digital urbanism, this could produce very dull and lifeless spaces, with everyone locked into a &quot;Groupon phenomenology&quot; of point-chasing and accumulation, like autistic squirrels. Or it could turn the global city --our shared site condition-- into a different sort of game, one with much more interesting and generative rules. &quot;Beneath the pavement is a beach.&quot;  Technology is being used as a tool to enlighten, educate, and liberate people around the world. How far would you agree with this statement?\u00a0Yes, and it does the opposite as well, both radically so. It always has. We need to stop thinking about technology as something that we &quot;use.&quot; Technology is a politics of life. The wish that if only we had bigger better technology then limits would be overcome is wrong. Increasing the computational capacity of a pathological system amplifies the pathology. Paul Virilio&apos;s famous line, &quot;the invention of a new technology is also the invention of a new accident&quot; is axiomatic. The opposite is equally true: every new accident produces a new technology, but what kind? The effects can be profound but unexpected, and much more disruptive than we might anticipate. Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri write about the &quot;commonwealth&quot; as an opposite of the basic capitalisation of resources. If capital&apos;s primary thrust is to bring things that are outside of the market into the market (land, genomes, languages, whatever) then what is the opposite of that process? Not &quot;public&quot; or &quot;state&quot; property, but a movement of something being the property of capital to being essentially unknowable at all. It goes from private property back to &quot;not property.&quot; One of the effects of digital media has been to transform things (music, software, movies, cultural labor of all sorts) that used to have a high exchange value and make them all but un-ownable. Recorded music has almost no exchange value. We still like it but we don&apos;t buy it very much, and when we do we are mostly buying the service convenience of not having to deal with unreliable torrents. In the long run, one of the deep effects of planetary computation (and I believe that history is largely still to come) may be a movement toward these kind of &quot;commonwealths&quot; but in parallel with an equally powerful movement toward the capitalisation and privatisation of everything imaginable. Perhaps these two processes somehow depend on each other?  What is the one thing that most holds back the changes you would like to make in the world? The confusion of artificially cheap energy with genuinely free energy. A lot of our ecological thinking is based on the management of dwindling resources, and the stupefying fact that we have managed to blow through millions of years of oil in about one century. At the same time we need to at least conceptualise the possibility of not only genuinely renewable/sustainable energy, but also of practically infinite energy sources. This should be our long term goal: free electrons. If the politics of the future is the politics of energy, then perhaps Nikola Tesla will have his picture on our money.\u00a0What drives you to keep on innovating? The fact that for all the ideas we put out into the world, they only really have impact if somebody else out there, perhaps someone I never meet, picks up on one --a turn of phrase perhaps-- and makes use of it in ways I could never imagine. I produce the raw material and am happy to let others fashion it into good things. I don&apos;t believe in visionary programs, nor do I believe that professional &quot;innovators&quot; do nearly as much direct good as they think they do, or are told that they do by adoring audiences. &quot;Innovation&quot; has become a content genre, a weird form of reality television, and one that is equally divorced from reality. For me, the way back to reality is an end-run. Always an end-run.

A criminal complaint sent to the public prosecutor&apos;s office in Paris claims British-born Owen-Jones, who retired as president of the group last month, also misused company assets and was involved in an &quot;abuse of trust&quot;. L&apos;Or\u00e9al has dismissed the allegations as totally &quot;unfounded&quot; saying they are related to a case that was thrown out by the French courts and closed in 2003. The accusations centre on L&apos;Or\u00e9al creating a parallel distribution network or so called &quot;grey market&quot; for its cosmetics brands such as Lancome and Guy Laroche in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine in the 1990s. Janez Mercun, a Slovenian businessman who lodged the latest complaint, had an exclusive contract to distribute L&apos;Or\u00e9al products in the same area at the time. He claims the company&apos;s parallel network was set up through a company in Dubai in order to avoid French taxes and led to the &quot;personal enrichment&quot; of Owen-Jones, 65, and is seeking \u20ac34m (\u00a329.9m) damages. Mercun says his company, Temtrade, was distributing L&apos;Or\u00e9al products under what it thought was an exclusive contract when the same goods began turning up on makeshift stands in Moscow 40% cheaper. Two other L&apos;Or\u00e9al directors have been named in the lawsuit, according to his lawyer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rik-Karol Canoy, who says it is the first time a criminal complaint has been made. &quot;L&apos;Or\u00e9al says the case has been settled, but they are talking about civil proceedings, this is a criminal action,&quot; Canoy told the Guardian. The legal move came as the company was recovering from the damaging and well-publicised falling out between L&apos;Or\u00e9al heiress Liliane Bettencourt and her daughter Fran\u00e7oise Meyers-Bettencourt last year. The family spat \u2013 over Bettencourt giving almost \u20ac1bn in art, cash and life insurance policies to a society photographer \u2013 turned into a political scandal amid claims Bettencourt, France&apos;s richest woman, employed the wife of a government minister while hiding part of her fortune in Swiss bank accounts. It was also alleged \u2013 and vehemently denied \u2013 that she made illegal donations to President Nicolas Sarkozy&apos;s ruling right-of-centre UMP party. The revelation of the latest legal complaint is also a blow for the new head of L&apos;Or\u00e9al Jean-Paul Agon as he attempts to put the Bettencourt scandal behind the firm. L&apos;Or\u00e9al said the &quot;so-called revelations&quot; related to a commercial dispute dating back to 1998 that had &quot;already been judged&quot;. &quot;The courts have found in L&apos;Or\u00e9al&apos;s favour five times with a definitive ruling by the court of cassation [France&apos;s highest civil court] back in 2003,&quot; it said in a statement. &quot;These unfounded accusations, highly publicised today as they were at each stage of the legal case, are an attempt to falsely reopen a case that has been closed since 2003.&quot; The row over the direct sales of L&apos;Or\u00e9al cosmetics on the &quot;grey market&quot; in Russia in the 1990s has returned regularly to haunt the company. Mercun distributed L&apos;Or\u00e9al products in eastern Europe for 25 years, between 1974 and 1999, through his Swiss-based Temtrade company, but claims L&apos;Or\u00e9al had set up a parallel market for its products in Russia using a Dubai-based front company. In January 1998, L&apos;Or\u00e9al agreed to pay Temtrade 20m French francs compensation for the losses it suffered. However, in 2002 Temtrade began further legal action claiming $227m in damages from L&apos;Or\u00e9al for &quot;not respecting an exclusive contract&quot;. L&apos;Or\u00e9al insisted it had already compensated Temtrade and won the case. In 2007 Temtrade raised the issue again, asking the Paris court of appeal to revise the 2002 judgment dismissing its claim for compensation, in the light of new documents. This was refused by the court. RUSSIAN BANKER FLEES A powerful Russian banker has reportedly fled to London after police stepped up their probe into an allegedly fraudulent \u00a3280m land deal involving Yelena Baturina, the wife of former Moscow mayor, Yury Luzhkov. Sources in the Russian capital said Andrei Borodin, the president of Bank of Moscow, had left the country as prosecutors considered laying charges in connection with a loan authorised by the bank. Borodin and Baturina, a property and construction tycoon, both vigorously deny wrongdoing, and Borodin told the RIA Novosti news agency that he had gone abroad for medical treatment. &quot;I intend to return home as soon as the state of my health allows,&quot; he said. Luzhkov and his wife have come under increasing scrutiny since the former was ousted from his post in September after falling out with the Kremlin.

He bowled nine cautious overs, in three spells, against Sussex on Durham&apos;s pre-season tour in Dubai and has been included in Durham&apos;s 2nd X1 to face Durham UCCE in a two-day game beginning on Thursday. Onions played the last of his eight England Tests in Cape Town in January 2010. He then broke down in the nets in Bangladesh when a fracture in the left-hand side of his back, which surgeons believe he had survived pain-free for as long as four years, suddenly worsened. &quot;It was like a broken polo mint, wobbling around,&quot; he said, a descriptive feat for someone who has yet to watch the video. England attempted two prolonged rest cures, both unsuccessful, wasting six months in the process, before finally admitting that he would take no part in the Ashes series. &quot;Then it was time for a bit of carpentry,&quot; Onions said, who had a vertebrae pinned and the other side of his back drilled to make it stronger. He is determined to take things slowly. &quot;It&apos;s been a long time. I have to be very careful and not have ambitions to play every game. There will be doubts in my mind until I get to the point where I can play consistent cricket. My body feels strong. It is just a matter of getting the trust back. &quot;I want to be a strike bowler again and I need to bowl 20 overs in each innings. I&apos;ve yet to prove that I can do that. I&apos;ll have to prove that in 2nd X1 cricket, but I&apos;m just happy to have a ball in my hand again.&quot; At the moment, he refuses to talk of England, but his unspoken target is a winter tour. &quot;My aim is to be fit and strong and sign a new four-year contract with Durham,&quot; he said. &quot;I could quite easily say I want to play for England and be on a winter tour but with the year I have had it&apos;s a matter of taking it session by session and hoping my body will hold up to the task. There is no reason why it can&apos;t. &quot;When I get fit and strong I think I can get back into that England side and make a lot of difference, but I have a lot of work to do before that.&quot;", "title": "Graham Onions: I had doubts I might not play again", "sentences": ["He bowled nine cautious overs, in three spells, against Sussex on Durham&apos;s pre-season tour in Dubai and has been included in Durham&apos;s 2nd X1 to face Durham UCCE in a two-day game beginning on Thursday."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-06T15:41:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/07/glamorgan-county-championship", "tags": ["Glamorgan", "County Championship Division Two", "Cricket", "Sport", "County Championship 2011 Division Two"], "article": "2010 in a nutshell Glamorgan should have won promotion from Division Two but stumped themselves.

The next day he was a revolutionary who told his airline it had better send another pilot to take the plane back to Dubai. Now Bejou, after his own crash course in fighting and surviving on the battlefield, is one of those in charge of a military training camp attempting to turn the volunteers of Benghazi into soldiers against Muammar Gaddafi &quot;I came to do my part in a peaceful demonstration but we were met with guns. For four days they were shooting at us, even using anti-aircraft guns. So I learned how to use a Kalashnikov and an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] on the battlefield,&quot; said Bejou, who has been a pilot for 30 years. &quot;I spent three weeks on the battlefield and it wasn&apos;t organised at all. No discipline. No one knew how to use their weapons. We set up this camp to change that.&quot; At the training ground inside a former Gaddafi military base on the edge of Benghazi on Thursday more than 1,000\u00a0young men were gathered for instruction in the use of Kalashnikovs, mortars and rockets. Some of the recruits put on a show of bravado. They claimed to be on the march to Tripoli to topple Gaddafi. But there was a more sober feeling among the bulk of volunteers, and the men showing them how to shoot, not flee. A few weeks&apos; training only goes so far against a more experienced and better disciplined force. The volunteers know that mostly they are at the camp to learn how to defend their homes if Gaddafi&apos;s troops make a push toward Benghazi. Sadir Misrati took on the role of sergeant major, strutting around the parade ground barking at people. Short, with a bayonet stuck in his belt and 40 years of experience in Gaddafi&apos;s army to draw on, he acknowledged the challenge of trying to create soldiers in less than six weeks. &quot;They&apos;re volunteers and they don&apos;t know anything about this. They&apos;ve never been in the military. They&apos;ll get a good idea of how to use their weapon. Maybe it&apos;s not enough but it gives them an idea,&quot; he said. Just about everyone recognises that an idea is not enough to create an army that can bring down Gaddafi. On this point the men on the parade ground part ways with the western leaders who say they are equally keen to see Libya rid of its dictator. Britain is hatching a plan to send experienced soldiers, such as former members of the SAS, to train the rebel army under the cover of private security companies paid for by Arab states. The revolutionary council&apos;s line on the prospect of foreign trainers is diplomatic. &quot;We will appreciate any friendly nation training our fighters,&quot; said Mustafa Gheriani, a council spokesman. &quot;Our preference is for trainers of Arab origin but we appreciate the help from wherever it comes.&quot; But at the training base there is suspicion. &quot;Why do they want to send trainers?&quot; asked Bejou. &quot;If they are talking about just a few weeks&apos; training what&apos;s the point? We are doing that. If they are talking about long-term training they are talking about a long war and more people dying. That could turn this into a civil war. We don&apos;t want a long war. If Nato, the allies, want us to be in Tripoli we could be there in seven hours.&quot; The talk of training for a longer war only fuels growing suspicion in Benghazi that Nato is abandoning the west&apos;s commitment to use air power to protect civilians. It was interpreted by the rebels as meaning western powers would destroy Gaddafi&apos;s army and clear the way for them to march into Tripoli. Saleh Farej is the Kalashnikov instructor. Before he introduces himself he quickly says that his long white beard does not mean he is al-Qaida. It is not a joke. The rebels are disturbed by suggestions their uprising has been infiltrated by Islamist extremists. They fear it will cost them western support. Farej says more training is not the problem. It is Nato they need. &quot;If Nato is not with us we cannot win. Then we will be in the hands of God. &quot;But we will still want to be free so we will still fight to defend our city.

Not the cricketers, they behaved impeccably. Just don&apos;t go near the committee. Leicestershire and Glamorgan have spent so much time plotting in darkened rooms recently that this would have been a much bloodier affair as a debating contest rather than as a cricket match. Committee members in Leicestershire and Glamorgan should wear shades, dash back double whiskies and have American gangster nicknames. Chairmen, coaches and chief executives have been dispensed with, petitions have come and gone and the lawyers have had a field day. Invitations to lunch in the president&apos;s suite should only be accepted after updating your will. It is a close-run thing but Glamorgan&apos;s chairman, Paul Russell, probably has most claims to rival Ice Pick Willie after giving Cardiff a passing resemblance in the autumn to gangster-era Las Vegas. Glamorgan should have sailed to promotion last season \u2013 they were 37 points clear at one stage but missed it on the final day of the season when they drew with Derbyshire and Sussex gave Worcestershire a final-day run chase that they gleefully accepted. It was totally justifiable after the way their season collapsed that Russell and the chief executive, Alan Hamer, yearned to replace Jamie Dalrymple as captain, install Colin Metson as managing director of cricket above Matthew Maynard, and demand a more coherent approach to the development of Welsh cricketers. It was just that they planned it all in Dubai and forgot to discuss it with Maynard. Maynard resigned, slighted, his son Tom joined Surrey, and the president, Peter Walker, followed on principle, but a members&apos; rebellion petered out and Ice Pick Willie had his way. Matthew Mott, Glamorgan&apos;s new coach, has an excellent pedigree. He coached New South Wales to the Sheffield Shield title in 2008, and coached Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League and arrived in Wales on Wednesday, presumably after first casing the joint for trip wires. It is his job to restore spirits, along with a placid new South African captain, Alviro Petersen. Nine Leicestershire wickets on the opening day of the championship season was a sound way to start, although at 156 for eight they would have expected better. Some things at Glamorgan never change. Robert Croft, irascibly, and Dean Cosker, modishly, still churn out the spin in mid\u2011afternoon, and have 39 seasons between them. Cosker had an excellent 2010 and he began well here with four wickets on the opening day, the most decisive that of James Taylor, who made 45 from 98 balls before driving him half\u2011heartedly into the offside. Claude Henderson then put an easing pitch into perspective, clattering the second new ball and finishing with an unbeaten 74. A patient crowd watched gratefully in glorious sunshine, fearing that the Foxes face a season of struggle. They have only 16 full-time players, barely enough for a convincing squad photograph, after record losses last season of \u00a3405,000. Repeat that, the county admit, and administration might beckon. Those losses were swollen by about \u00a370,000 when the outgoing chairman, Neil Davidson, withdrew a verbal commitment to &quot;sort out&quot; part of Matthew Hoggard&apos;s salary. You don&apos;t sort out a salary for a captain who has rebelled against you. Hoggard has spent some of the winter helping to attract new sponsors, but he would have to raise a lot more yet to buy a new seam bowler, and when the summer is at its height, and his 34-year-old body begins to ache, that is what he will yearn for.", "title": "Leicestershire 231-9, Glamorgan | County Championship Division Two match report", "sentences": ["It was just that they planned it all in Dubai and forgot to discuss it with Maynard."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-08T18:20:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/08/masters-2011-alvaro-quiros", "tags": ["Masters 2011", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "There were clouds over Augusta National as Alvaro Quir\u00f3s stepped on to the 1st tee on Friday but when he broke out his smile it was as though the weather had reverted, in a microsecond, to the golden sunshine of Thursday. If Quir\u00f3s ever becomes famous, that smile could be used to sell ice-cream to Eskimos. He was smiling because the official starter had just asked him, sotto voce, how to pronounce his name. The Spaniard understood the humour inherent in the situation of a player who had shot 65 the previous day, just two strokes off the all\u2011time course record and good enough for a share of the overall lead, being a stranger to the crusty, green-jacketed, straw-hatted custodians of Augusta National. The situation had come as a surprise to Quir\u00f3s, too. His record for the season to date includes a win in the Dubai Desert Classic but on both of his previous visits to Augusta, in 2009 and 2010, he had failed to make the cut, and until Thursday his best round stood at 75. His second\u2011round score of 73 on Friday did not quite live up to the achievement of the opening day but it was good enough to keep him high up the leaderboard going into the weekend. Those of us who knew little of Quir\u00f3s until this week were delighted to find ourselves in the presence of the most engaging, amiable, amusingly modest and generally civilised of men. He laughed while recounting how, walking up the 18th fairway as part of the last group out on the first day, shooting for a share of the lead in glorious late-afternoon sunshine, he had been given a glimpse of how it must feel to be contending for victory on Sunday evening. &quot;Normally I&apos;m watching this situation through the TV, sitting on my sofa,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a special moment.&quot; A couple of weeks ago, speaking of the first great Spanish golfer of the modern era, he said: &quot;Seve has the hands of an artisty. I have the hands of a bricklayer.&quot; It is true that the 28-year-old is not noted for his finesse but as he made his way around the course, registering eight birdies and a single bogey, it looked like there was a great deal more to him that than just a booming drive. He led the European Tour&apos;s driving statistics in 2007, 2008 and 2009, and on Friday he was outdistancing both of his playing partners, Venezuela&apos;s Jhonattan Vegas and Gary Woodland from Topeka, Kansas, both of them very big hitters indeed. On Thursday, however, it was the putter that spoke just as eloquently, as it must for anyone hoping to shine on this course, whose length is overshadowed only by the difficulty of its greens. &quot;It looked like everything was working perfectly,&quot; he said. &quot;Even the bad shots that finished far away from the flag, I was able to make two-putts.&quot; Quir\u00f3s turned pro in 2004, joined the European Tour three years later, and came into this season with wins in the 2007 Alfred Dunhill Championship, the 2008 Portugal Masters, the 2009 Qatar Masters and the 2010 Open de Espa\u00f1a to his credit. He comes from a small town called Guadiaro on the Costa del Sol, not far from Gibraltar, and his introduction to golf came as a by-product of the 1997 Ryder Cup. When the Bolivian tin magnate Jaime Ortiz-Pati\u00f1o bought the Las Aves course at Sotogrande, renamed it Valderrama and had it redesigned for the Ryder Cup under the guidance of Robert Trent Jones, many of the workers who carried out the rebuilding came from nearby Guadiaro. In recognition of their efforts, Ortiz-Pati\u00f1o bought a parcel of land in the town, had Jones and David Thomas create another 18-hole course, and presented it to the people. It was on that public course, called La Ca\u00f1ada, that Quir\u00f3s, whose family had no connection to the game, played his first golf. Those following him around the course on Thursday noted that he kept up an animated conversation with his caddie. Afterwards it emerged that this was the first round of competitive golf he had played in the company of Gareth Lord, Robert Karlsson&apos;s former bagman. &quot;This is our first official round, so we have to talk about a lot of things,&quot; he said. Why had he made the change? &quot;It&apos;s like in football. When a team is playing badly, you cannot change the 11 players. The only thing that you can change is the coach. In my case, it&apos;s the same. I cannot change myself. Well, I&apos;m trying to change myself but it doesn&apos;t work.&quot; As a supporter of the perennially inconsistent Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, he is familiar with the ups and downs of sport. Thursday evening, however, was a new kind of up. &quot;Obviously I&apos;m very happy but my target will still be the same: a drive on the first hole and make the cut.&quot; There was a stutter at the 1st on Friday as he drove into the trees and dropped a shot but he steadied himself with a run of five pars before making birdies at the 7th and 8th. He double-bogeyed the short 12th after an excursion into the sand but had the satisfaction of once again finishing the round with a birdie for a 138 total.

Strange but true. Sugar&apos;s property company, Amsprop, bought the famous old pub \u2013 which makes an appearance as the Maypole in Dickens&apos;s Barnaby Rudge \u2013 from the Chef &amp; Brewer chain last April. It has been lavishly renovated, and has reopened as the setting of Sheesh, a locally well-regarded restaurant that used to be based in Buckhurst Hill. The pub website gives the building&apos;s date as 1547, whereas Amsprop&apos;s site omits the &quot;Ye Olde&quot; and says it&apos;s 17th century. Either way, it&apos;s an amazing building, beamed and sprawling, whose later additions culminate in a gated car park, flaming torches and two huge bronze statues, one a mounted warrior, the other a bison. Yes, a\u00a0bison and, no, I have no idea. This is all of a\u00a0piece, since half-beamed houses were presumably the Tudor equivalent of bling; all that&apos;s happened is that the bling and noove factor has kept up to date. On Twitter, the new look was approvingly described as &quot;The Tudors meets Dubai&quot; \u2013 yes. The interior is like that, too, only more so, with chandeliers and near-hallucinogenic carpets. It&apos;s big, with a bar, conservatory, lounge, smaller dining room, large new main dining hall with open-plan kitchen, and no square inch unblinged. The customers fit right in. I couldn&apos;t tell if they were le tout Chigwell, or people drawn by its new associations, or what, but on a Sunday lunch Ye Olde King&apos;s Head was a catwalk of people getting out of sports cars and SUVs in expensively distressed denim, big hair, torn white linen babydoll outfits worn with thigh-high leather boots, spray tans, clunky watches and even clunkier bags. Everybody seemed to be having a good, even a great time, and it&apos;s a while since I&apos;ve been anywhere people spent so much energy covertly checking out each other&apos;s labels. The people-watching at Sheesh is outstanding, especially if you are prone to asking yourself, who are these people? A demographic so conscious of status is not the easiest to serve, and so such an operation has to be very professional. This Sheesh is. The Turkish food is not the most ambitious, but it is fresh and carefully cooked, and the staff are efficient and good-natured. The formula is working, because the place was bursting at the seams by the time we left. There&apos;s a familiar trajectory with this kind of cooking, from interesting and various starters to simpler kebabs and grills. My advice would be to go for the fish, which is delivered fresh daily. Sardines were plainly grilled, which is the best way to cook them, with salad \u2013 in its way, a perfect dish. Slow-cooked squid with spinach was outstanding, melting in texture and richly, deeply flavoured by its spicy tomato sauce. Turkish pizza was good fun, a thin pizza base with a crispy lamb topping. The meze dips were less distinctive \u2013 they didn&apos;t have much flavour \u2013 and I&apos;d be inclined to give them a miss. With mains, again, go for the fish. Monkfish kebabs were simply grilled and none the worse for that; they were \u00a318, which I don&apos;t mind paying when the fish is as good as this. Mixed kebabs, also \u00a318, was minced and grilled lamb and minced and grilled chicken \u2013 decent if unstartling. Chips were the old-fashioned British style of chunky potato, rather than the modern Frenchified crunchy chip \u2013 good. Puddings were a bit boring; portions are generous, so maybe people are often so full they don&apos;t get that far, but crumbly chocolate cheesecake and heavy date and toffee pudding were very skippable. All the food came on rectangular black plates. Groovy. Sugar seems to divide opinion between those who think he&apos;s nicer than he chooses to let himself seem (my own suspicion, for what it&apos;s worth) and those who think he isn&apos;t. Since he owns the building, and not the restaurant, this shouldn&apos;t have much bearing on whether people go to Sheesh, but I&apos;ll bet it does. My advice to Sugar fans is that because almost the entire menu is grilled, you&apos;ll have to order the battered calamari starter if you want to point at the plate and say, &quot;You&apos;re fried.&quot;", "title": "Restaurant: Sheesh, Chigwell, Essex | John Lanchester", "sentences": ["On Twitter, the new look was approvingly described as &quot;The Tudors meets Dubai&quot; \u2013 yes."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-08T23:02:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/09/rory-mcilroy-masters-2011", "tags": ["Masters 2011", "Rory McIlroy", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Rory McIlroy promised that there would be no repeat of last summer&apos;s debacle at St\u00a0Andrews, and he was as good as his word. As he bounced around Augusta National on Friday, pulling steadily away from a field that took its time about mounting a challenge, he must have wondered where the competition had gone. In the Open championship last year the young Northern Irishman equalled the course record with a 63 on the opening day, followed by an 80 in the second round. Inevitably there were those who wondered whether history would repeat itself after he came home on Thursday afternoon with a 65 that proved good enough for a share of the lead. &quot;Looking back on it,&quot; he said this week, &quot;it was a very valuable lesson in my development as a golfer.&quot; On the Friday at St Andrews a gale had blown him off course. On Friday the breeze freshened a little, and the pin positions were much more demanding, but he more than held his nerve. And if he needed a stimulus on his way to a round of 69, it came from the performance of his two playing partners. The crowds flocked to watch the 21-year-old McIlroy, the 22-year-old Rickie Fowler of California and the 23-year-old Jason Day of Queensland facing up to one of the most daunting tests in golf. As the American and the Australian worked to join the man from County Down on the leaderboard, the trio seemed to be making a significant statement on behalf of the future of golf. &quot;We fed off each other,&quot; McIlroy said afterwards, although he admitted it was not until midway through the back nine that he realised quite how well Day was doing. The Irishman set off by successfully negotiating the quite sadistically tight flag location at the 1st green before making his first advance with a birdie at the par-five 2nd hole. Three holes later a marvellous second shot gave him a 6ft birdie putt that disappeared as if being sucked in by a sudden reversal of the course&apos;s elaborate underground hot-air blowing system. A terrific drive at the 9th, hit downhill and downwind and travelling fully 360 yards, exposed the elevated green to a exquisite second shot that gave him a 2ft birdie putt to go 10 under par, the first player to reach double figures. Trouble with a bunker at the short 12th pegged him back, but his response was to unleash another mighty drive at the 13th, clearing the turn in the fairway and opening up the green for a well-judged wedge. An 8ft eagle putt was missed, but the birdie restored the shot lost at the preceding hole. From then on it was about steady par play all the way home through the last half-dozen holes, to finish two shots ahead of the remarkable Day. This weekend we will find out whether he is ready to sustain that level of performance over the whole distance. He had started the round level with Alvaro Quir\u00f3s, the good-natured Spaniard who had failed to make the cut on both his previous visits to the Masters, in 2009 and 2010, with 75 as his best score. Yesterday&apos;s second-round score of 73 did not quite live up to the achievement of the opening day, but it was good enough to keep him high on the leaderboard going into the weekend. Those of us who knew little of Quir\u00f3s until this week were delighted to find ourselves in the presence of the most engagingly modest and amusing of men. A couple of weeks ago, speaking of a great compatriot, he remarked: &quot;Seve has the hands of an artist. I have the hands of a bricklayer.&quot; He led the European Tour&apos;s driving statistics in 2007, 2008 and 2009, and on Thursday he regularly outdistanced both of his playing partners, Venezuela&apos;s Jhonattan Vegas and Gary Woodland from Topeka, Kansas, both of them very big hitters indeed. So far this week, however, the putter has been just as effective. Quir\u00f3s turned pro in 2004, joined the European Tour three years later, and has wins in the 2007 Alfred Dunhill Championship, the 2008 Portugal Masters, the 2009 Qatar Masters, the 2010 Open de Espa\u00f1a and this year&apos;s Dubai Desert Classic to his credit.

The panel is likely to urge chancellor George Osborne to force a degree of separation between banks&apos; high-street branches and their City trading floors. HSBC is in the middle of a triannual review of where it wants to be based. Headquartered in London since 1992, is looking into a return to Hong Kong and is even reported to be receiving overtures from Paris. Chairman Douglas Flint says HSBC&apos;s review of where it wants to be based is a dispassionate one: &quot;If you were coming down from Mars with our business configuration, where would you seek to place the international headquarters?&quot; Meanwhile, Barclays, under US-born chief executive Bob Diamond, is being buttered up by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who declared that it would be &quot;great&quot; if the British bank relocated to the Big Apple. Analysts at UBS wrote last week that Barclays may soon have &quot;little option&quot; but to consider shifting its domicile. But Diamond says: &quot;London is where we want to be. Of course it&apos;s our obligation on behalf of shareholders to look at the alternatives, but this is home and where we want to stay.&quot; Lloyds and RBS would struggle to justify leaving as they are partly owned by British taxpayers. But Standard Chartered has no such obligation. Its chief executive, Peter Sands, said a year ago that the \u00a32.5bn levy on banks&apos; balance sheets meant relocation was &quot;something we have to think about&quot;. The departure of any bank is not to be taken lightly. Banks contributed \u00a353.4bn in taxes in the year to March 2010, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, and financial services support a million jobs. Even in business circles, a departure would be controversial: Andrew Witty of GlaxoSmithKline said recently that the disloyalty of businesses that regard themselves as &quot;mid-Atlantic floating entities&quot; dangerously erodes public trust in big corporations. Others are not worried. Ian Mulheirn of the Social Market Foundation says our economy has been &quot;lopsided&quot; for years, with a bulging financial sector keeping sterling strong to the detriment of exporters. &quot;The government should be ambivalent,&quot; he says. &quot;The tax take, in future, would come from other profitable industries which have been crowded out.&quot; So, as a public service to wavering bankers, we have put together a handy guide to alternative bases \u2013 including eateries where our relocated financiers could offload part of that hefty bonus. DUBAI PROS Spending money is Dubai&apos;s pleasure. Far from sneering at huge bonuses, Dubai celebrates such excess. The Mall of the Emirates is great for shopping \u2013 or for skiing; it houses an artificial slope. It was the world&apos;s largest shopping centre until the Dubai Mall opened three years ago. There are ultra-low taxes, great beaches and good golf, and Dubai is keen to attract investment: it has set up &quot;free zones&quot; exempt from corporation tax for 15 years. CONS The possibility of a jail term for indulging in public shows of affection is off-putting, but it is the night-time traffic in Dubai that is the city&apos;s most unappealing characteristic. The automated metro network is not yet fully operational and tailbacks make driving infuriatingly slow. Furthermore, the brittle nature of Dubai&apos;s rapidly acquired wealth was evident during the financial crisis when it needed a $10bn bailout from its neighbour, Abu Dhabi. And Dubai is not ideal for fair-skinned types prone to sunburn. WEEKEND GETAWAY The Maldives are a short hop away, and so too is Goa.

Income tax is levied at just 15%. &quot;In terms of dynamism, Hong Kong is very exciting,&quot; says a regular visitor from the UK. As the centre of rapidly expanding foreign-exchange trading in the Chinese yuan, Hong Kong&apos;s economic importance was officially acknowledged for the first time in Beijing&apos;s 12th five\u2011year plan. CONS City insiders say that it&apos;s impossible to get your kids into a good English-speaking school, and the cost of living is sky-high, with the spillover from the property bubble in mainland China pushing up the price of a place to live, particularly in sought-after neighbourhoods higher up Victoria Peak.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire from financial information himself, is keen to attract international banks. The US is an aspirational society that generally respects wealth. A handy heliport at the end of Wall Street provides quick access to the summer beachside hangouts in the Hamptons. CONS There is still a residue of anti-Wall Street sentiment in the US \u2013 an online poll found that 93% of Americans want bankers and traders to face criminal charges over the credit crunch. Although relatively modest in their scope, Wall Street reforms enacted by the Obama administration have restricted proprietary trading and created a potentially powerful consumer financial protection agency. Smoking in bars is strictly prohibited and there are no casinos in Manhattan. Also, it&apos;s an awkward time zone for banks eyeing far-eastern growth.

The French are ambitious to build Paris&apos;s presence as a banking centre after winning the right to be home to the new European Securities and Markets Authority. A merger between Euronext and NYSE in 2007 put Paris&apos;s stock exchanges in the big league. Finance contributes 4.5% to GDP, accounting for 700,000 jobs. CONS Nicolas Sarkozy reckons bankers&apos; activities &quot;defied common sense&quot; as they played &quot;pass the parcel&quot; with toxic derivatives. The president is an enthusiastic backer of an international tax on speculation. There are signs of detente, however, from finance minister Christine Lagarde, who has described bank bashing as futile. Taxes are relatively high, and unions can be militant. The reputation of French finance was damaged by rogue trader J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel, who ran up \u00a34bn in losses at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in 2008.

Public transport experts get very excited about the road pricing and metro systems, a side benefit of an authoritarian government that has seen the island ruled by the People&apos;s Action Party for more than 50 years.

Banks are concentrated around the Paradeplatz, pictured, where UBS and Credit Suisse both have headquarters. The tradition of banking privacy attracts wealthy customers worldwide. There were only modest public protests over the global financial crisis, even when the government invested $60bn saving UBS. CONS Unpopular with younger staff, who view Switzerland as a snooze. With 1.4 million people, Zurich is smaller, less cosmopolitan and more conservative than rival centres. Shops, restaurants and accommodation are expensive.

As funerals for some of the 27 people shot dead in Deraa on Friday were being held, there were reports of violent clashes between mourners and security services. An eyewitness in Deraa told the Guardian that security forces had been &quot;shooting randomly&quot; as mass funerals went on. It is not yet clear whether anyone was killed in those clashes. Further funerals are due to take place in Harasta and Douma. The government issued a warning amid Friday&apos;s protests, the largest and most deadly yet. A statement from the interior ministry, posted by the official Sana media agency, said: &quot;There is no more room for leniency or tolerance in preserving security of the country and protecting the general order.&quot; It added that this would be done &quot;according to the law which specified the conditions for using weapons&quot;. Sit-ins are taking place in Deraa, with the coastal city of Banias cordoned off. The National Organisation for Human Rights said 37 people had died across the country on Friday, including 27 in Deraa, three in Homs and Harasta and one in Douma, bringing the total death toll since 18 March to more than 200. &quot;We are very worried, especially for Banias where mobile coverage is currently down,&quot; Ammar Qurabi, the head of the organisation, speaking from Cairo, said. Other activists said they were concerned about Latakia, where several districts have been cut off and the army deployed, although the town centre remains quiet. As in Deraa, there are reports of access to medical care being blocked. &quot;Pharmacists have reported being told by security to shut early and to report those who purchase goods to treat the injured,&quot; Wissam Tarif, a local human rights monitor, said. Both security forces and the shabiha, a group of thugs in Latakia with links to the ruling Assad family, reportedly carried out the violence in Banias and Latakia. The government has denied this, blaming &quot;spiteful individuals, outsiders and those who were compelled by known foreign parties&quot;. The US president, Barack Obama, has condemned the &quot;abhorrent&quot; crackdown. Activists and protesters have become increasingly frustrated by a muted international response, which has prompted countries in the region to rally to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad&apos;s side. Syrian activists said they were concerned that a cycle of violence had taken hold which would only escalate as the government refused to meet protesters&apos; demands. They said a critical mass of protesters had not yet been reached. &quot;It is a fight between the people and the regime,&quot; Ayman Abdel Nour, a Syrian dissident living in Dubai, said. &quot;Friday was an escalation, but we are still not seeing enough people from all governorates and segments of society coming out to allow them to tip the balance.&quot; However, there are some signs of growing unhappiness among formerly loyal parties. An editor of the state-run newspaper Tishreen, Samira Masalma, was sacked after she criticised shootings by security forces.

Met Office temperature records for Scilly obtained by the Guardian also appear to undermine Jersey&apos;s claim. The Met Office officially recognises Scilly as the warmest place in the UK. A Met Office spokesman said that Jersey \u2013 50 miles further south \u2013 does not fall under its auspices because &quot;it is not part of the UK&quot;, although &quot;it had no reason to doubt&quot; Jersey&apos;s claims to be warmer. The small print on Jersey&apos;s advert says it bases its claim on &quot;minimum temperatures supplied by the Jersey Meteorological Department&quot;. Tony Pallot, Jersey&apos;s principal meteorological officer, said Jersey&apos;s &quot;mean minimum&quot; for 1971-2000 \u2013 the period used by the Met Office to calculate all its mean temperatures \u2013 was 8.9C (48.2F). However, Met Office data for Scilly seen by the Guardian says the &quot;mean minimum&quot; for St Mary&apos;s, Scilly&apos;s largest island, was 9.4C over the period. On other measures such as hours of sunshine and maximum mean temperatures, Jersey performs marginally better. The council of the Isles of Scilly is also contesting the use of the term &quot;Britain&quot; in Jersey&apos;s advert, arguing that the Bailiwick of Jersey is a British crown dependency but not part of the UK. It also argues that, geographically, Jersey is not part of the British Isles archipelago. Julian Pearce, the council&apos;s economic development officer, said: &quot;We shall be writing to Jersey to remind them of both our geographical position and our ranking as the warmest place in the UK.&quot; He also said he was investigating whether the council had grounds to make a formal complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). Jennifer Ellenger of Jersey Tourism said: &quot;We stand 100% behind our advert and we have the data to prove we are the warmest place. We are politically part of the British Isles, even if not strictly geographically.&quot; She confirmed the advert&apos;s claim is based on the mean minimum temperature, but also on two further measures \u2013 average hours of sunshine per year and &quot;mean annual&quot; temperature. She added that another aim is to suggest the people of Jersey are the warmest in the British Isles, too. Ordnance Survey, the national mapping agency for &quot;Great Britain&quot; \u2013 namely, England, Scotland and Wales \u2013 said it defines the &quot;British Isles&quot; as being &quot;all the main and offshore islands of Great Britain and Ireland, as well as the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands&quot;. Malcolm Bell, head of tourism at VisitCornwall, which works closely with Council of the Isles of Scilly to attract 4.5 million tourists to the far south-west of England each year \u2013 100,000 ofwhom visit Scilly \u2013 said he would be writing to Jersey Tourism in support of Scilly. He said: &quot;When I first saw the advert I just laughed. It seems a bit desperate to base an advert on warmth alone when people who are only interested in that would just go to somewhere such as Dubai instead. &quot;But the advert&apos;s claim is also a bit cheeky. People want honesty in advertising. &quot;Jersey might just about be technically correct in what they say, but it is bordering on unethical to stretch the truth like this when promoting your destination. We are in economically challenging times and we want to fight fairly for every customer.&quot; Jersey, which received 685,000 visitors in 2010, has been challenged before over its tourism campaigns. In 1990, the ASA upheld a complaint against Jersey after it failed to substantiate a claim that it had more sunshine that anywhere else in the British Isles. In 1993, the ASA criticised Jersey for making exaggerated claims after it ran a newspaper campaign boasting that &quot;our sandy beaches are always spotless and all of our golden beaches are scrubbed and rinsed twice by clear blue water&quot;. The ASA noted that &quot;on seven recent occasions large quantities of untreated sewage had poured onto bathing beaches&quot;. Last year, Jersey Tourism accused the Met Office and the BBC of discrimination because it felt the Channel Islands were routinely left out of national weather forecasts. As a result, it said it was missing out on millions of pounds worth of revenue from prospective visitors. &quot;Many people don&apos;t have any idea just how lovely the weather is a short hop away from the mainland \u2013 meaning we lose out on valuable income,&quot; David de Carteret, director of Jersey Tourism, said then. It was this grievance, says Jersey Tourism, that led it to base this year&apos;s campaign around the &quot;warmest place in the British Isles&quot; slogan. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 April 2011.

Alongside Ferran Adri\u00e0, head chef at El Bulli, and Carme Ruscalleda, of Sant Pau, Santamaria was one of the leading figures in the huge boom in Catalan cuisine over the past 20 years. Like them, he not only provided excellent food, but knew how to publicise his restaurants and books. Catalan cuisine is based on traditional Mediterranean cooking and Catalonia&apos;s position as a crossroads between France and Spain, with strong Italian influence. Its mountains run sharply down into the sea, which has created original combinations of food from land\u00a0and sea. Born in the small town of Sant Celoni, on the slopes of the Montseny hills some 40 miles north of Barcelona, Santamaria studied technical drawing, but was diverted quickly into cooking by his love of food. In 1981, he and Angels Serra (whom he married the following year) opened a restaurant in the 250-year-old farmhouse where Santamaria was born, El Rac\u00f3 de Can Fabes. It was just the moment for an haute cuisine restaurant. In Spain, emerging from 40 years of dictatorship, a new middle class with money to spend was out to throw off repression. Hedonism was on the menu. Can Fabes won its first Michelin star in 1988 and, in 1994, became the first Catalan restaurant to be awarded three stars. It was the first in a small chain of restaurants, which accumulated seven Michelin stars in all: Santceloni in Madrid (two stars), Tierra in Toledo (one star) and Evo in l&apos;Hospitalet (one star). Evo opened in the five-star Hesperia hotel designed by Richard Rogers and completed in 2006. The restaurant, beside the highway from the airport into Barcelona, fills the top floor under a\u00a0glass dome and enjoys panoramic views over the city. In 2008, Santamaria opened Ossiano, a restaurant in Dubai, where he mixed Arab and western tastes; and, last August, his final project, Santi, in Singapore, managed by his daughter Regina. The six restaurants employ 170 people. In his hyperactive decade since 2000, Santamaria put his name to nine books. These included three selections of the weekly articles and recipes he published in the Sunday supplement of la Vanguardia newspaper. He was also a cook with literary interests: his Santi Santamaria Entre Llibres i Fogons (Santi Santamaria Between Books and Stoves, 2005) selected 55 works of 20th-century Catalan literature with references to food, quoting the extracts alongside their recipes. Like all his books, it showed his strong pride in Catalan culture and his insistence that cuisine was a vital part of that culture. In 2008 he published La Cocina al Desnudo (Cooking Laid Bare), provoking huge controversy. Conventionally enough, he lamented the rise of fast food and the decline of healthy Mediterranean cooking. But then he attacked the &quot;molecular or techno-emotional cooking, promoted by Ferran Adri\u00e0 ... that fills our plates with gelling agents, stabilisers and laboratory emulgents&quot;. To Adri\u00e0&apos;s use of colorants and taste enhancers, Santamaria counterposed traditional Catalan cuisine, emphasising that Can Fabes used local, seasonal produce. Lamb and mushrooms came from the Montseny, truffles from Vic, fish from the daily auction at Blanes: he bought directly from local producers. The row with Adri\u00e0 split Spanish chefs and food journalists. Followers of Santamaria insisted on the ethics of traditional values, flayed the agro\u2011food industry and implied that Adri\u00e0&apos;s food could even be a health hazard; while Adri\u00e0&apos;s supporters underlined his originality and daring, even comparing his outrageous taste experiences with Salvador Dal\u00ed&apos;s art provocations. Santamaria was a bon vivant, passionate and hardworking, with a caustic humour that kept his feet on the ground. &quot;We chefs,&quot; he said recently, &quot;are a bunch of fakes who work to entertain snobs and make ourselves a fortune.&quot; Santamaria is survived by Angels, their son Pau and daughter Regina, all three chefs. They intend to carry on the family businesses. \u2022 Santiago Santamaria i Puig, chef, born 26 July 1957; died 16 February 2011", "title": "Santi Santamaria obituary", "sentences": ["In 2008, Santamaria opened Ossiano, a restaurant in Dubai, where he mixed Arab and western tastes; and, last August, his final project, Santi, in Singapore, managed by his daughter Regina."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-10T17:41:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/10/masters-2011-european-players", "tags": ["Masters 2011", "Rory McIlroy", "The Masters", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "The first shots in the 75th Masters were fired on Thursday morning by Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus, who drove somewhat creakily from the 1st tee before shaking hands, signing a few autographs and retiring to the clubhouse, leaving the field of 99 players to get on with it. The role of honorary starter is a Masters tradition going back to 1963, and it is one that was filled before Palmer and Nicklaus by other former champions, including Byron Nelson, Gene Sarazen and Sam Snead \u2013 American heroes to a man. Look down the road, however, perhaps to the centenary tournament in 2026, and the picture may be a little different. At dawn on that Thursday morning the honorary starters could well be a grey\u2011haired Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam, or Bernhard Langer and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal, illustrating the shift in golf&apos;s centre of gravity in the 50 years since Gary Player became the first non-American to put on the green jacket. When the final round of the 2011 tournament started on Sunday morning, the leaderboard represented a dismaying sight to local eyes accustomed to a strong American presence. For the first time in\u00a0the history of the competition, not one\u00a0of the top seven players in the Saturday night standings was a citizen of the United States. Just as amazingly, the seven represented five continents: Europe with Northern Ireland&apos;s Rory McIlroy and England&apos;s Luke Donald, South America with Angel Cabrera of Argentina, Africa with Charl Schwartzel of Johannesburg, Asia with KJ\u00a0Choi of South Korea, and Australia with Queensland&apos;s Jason Day and Adelaide&apos;s Adam Scott. Add Bo van Pelt, Tiger Woods and Fred Couples, filling eighth to 10th places, as the leading North Americans, and only Antarctica failed to lodge a representative in the top 10. In the rush to acclaim the preponderance of non-Americans at the top of the leaderboard, it was easy to overlook the fact that no European player had won the Masters since Olaz\u00e1bal took the second of his two green jackets in 1999. &quot;And let&apos;s not forget,&quot; George O&apos;Grady, the chief executive of the European Tour, cautioned, &quot;that the defending champion here this week is Phil Mickelson.&quot; Five months ago, however, O&apos;Grady was able to bring the European Tour&apos;s season to a triumphal climax during the Race to Dubai by lining up the 60 competitors with their array of trophies, including the three major championship trophies currently held by Graeme McDowell (US\u00a0Open), Louis Oosthuizen (Open) and Martin Kaymer, the current world No1 (US\u00a0PGA), plus the Ryder Cup, which had just been recaptured at Celtic Manor. As a statement of past achievements it was impressive enough, but O&apos;Grady&apos;s real purpose was to help strengthen the players&apos; self-confidence by providing an illustration of what could be achieved in the future, and a sign of why there was no longer a need to accept a place in the shadow of the US and its golfers. &quot;There&apos;s a great self-belief among the players,&quot; he said, standing beneath the famous oak tree outside the Augusta clubhouse while the early starters teed off. &quot;Should Rory McIlroy hold on to this position, there&apos;s a mass of people associated with golf around the world, not just the European Tour but everywhere, who can take a lot of pride in contributing to that \u2013 amateur bodies, the structure of the game in different areas, as well as the Golfing Union of Ireland, the Nick Faldo junior series which he&apos;s played in, and the Junior Ryder Cup as well. &quot;This is the same in Italy, for example, where the Italian golf federation has developed Matteo Manassero, and that sort\u00a0of thing is being replicated throughout the rest of the world.

At least three people were shot dead and scores more wounded in shootings in the port city of Banias on Sunday amid reports that the army, already deployed in Deraa and Latakia, was being deployed. Human rights groups named Ayman Soliman, Nizar Higazy and Muhammad al-Dayegh as those killed after Sunday prayers, while a further person was in a critical condition after being shot during earlier unrest the same day. The fresh violence came as Syria&apos;s president, Bashar al-Assad, said in a statement that the country was &quot;on course to comprehensive reform&quot;. But protesters rejected the claims, pointing to an apparent warning by the government of further violence issued amid Friday&apos;s protests, the largest and most deadly yet. A statement carried by the state news agency Sana said: &quot;There is no more room\u00a0for leniency or tolerance&quot; in &quot;preserving security of the country and protecting the general order&quot;. This would be done &quot;according to the law which specified the conditions for using weapons&quot;. Up until now the government has not admitted to using force, blaming the crackdown on\u00a0outsiders. As night fell on Sunday, Banias, which has a major oil refinery, was cordoned off; mourners took to the streets in Douma; and a sit-in was going on in\u00a0Deraa. The National Organisation for Human Rights said 37 people were killed across Syria on Friday, including 27 in Deraa, three in Homs, three in Harasta and one in Douma, bringing the total death toll to more than 200 since 18 March. On Saturday there were reports of violent clashes between mourners and security forces. One witness in Deraa told the Guardian that security forces had been &quot;shooting randomly&quot; as mass funerals went on. It was not clear whether anyone died in those clashes, but activists say they are increasingly concerned that there will be a major crackdown this week. There are also concerns over access to medical care being blocked amid interruptions to communications in parts of Banias, Latakia and Deraa. &quot;Pharmacists in Banias are being told by security to shut early and to report those who purchase goods to treat the injured,&quot; said Wissam Tarif, a local human rights monitor. &quot;We are also worried about the government&apos;s intentions in Deraa.&quot; A nationwide violent crackdown by security forces has been complicated in Banias and Latakia by reports of involvement by the shabiha, a violent group with links to the ruling Assad family. But the government has denied the group&apos;s involvement, blaming unrest on &quot;spiteful individuals, outsiders and those who were compelled by known foreign parties&quot;. On Saturday Barack Obama condemned Friday&apos;s crackdown as &quot;abhorrent&quot;. But activists and protesters have grown increasingly frustrated by a muted international response which has seen regional countries rally to Assad&apos;s side. A cycle of violence may now have taken hold which would escalate if the government refuses to meet protesters&apos; demands, said Ayman Abdel Nour, a Syrian dissident living in Dubai. But he added: &quot;We are still not seeing enough people from all governorates and segments of society coming out to allow them to tip the balance.&quot; Assad has attempted to keep protest numbers down by issuing concessions to appease specific groups such as Kurds and conservative Muslims. But he has failed to put an end to emergency law or release political prisoners \u2013 two of the protesters&apos; demands. Many people in Damascus, which has been calm, have expressed anxiety and even anger at the continued unrest as a threat to stability. But there are small signs of growing unhappiness among formerly loyalists. An editor at the state-run newspaper Tishreen, Samira Masalma, was sacked after she criticised the shootings on al-Jazeera television.

A once-loved local relic you&apos;re keen to reimagine? Not just the cupboard under the stairs or your back garden, but out there in your suburb, town or city centre? For inspiration, turn to Wilton&apos;s Music Hall, the crumbling late-19th century space in the City of London that is being sung back to life, or New York&apos;s High Line, which transformed the rusting elevated railroad line into one of the most imaginative and best-loved of all urban parks. I would like to restore the stag beetles, nesting nightingales and overflowing flowers that attracted a rainbow of butterflies to a plot of land near me that has been cleared by a local developer. The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) is calling on the public to do something about such spaces. Artists, architects, planners, engineers, landscape designers, students and local groups led by a professional can enter the Forgotten Spaces competition to suggest designs for an imaginative new use for a forgotten space anywhere in Greater London and the Sheffield City region. Anyone can get involved \u2013 you don&apos;t have to live in London or Sheffield to put forward a proposal. If enough people show interest, the RIBA Forgotten Spaces initiative may well spread elsewhere around Britain. To encourage entries, which must be original and submitted by 12 May, there will be three prizes of \u00a35,000, \u00a32,000 and \u00a31,000. Registration and details of the brief for Forgotten Spaces 2011 can be found online at architecture.com/forgottenspaceslondon and architecture.com/forgottenspacessheffield. Exhibitions of entries will be held this autumn at Somerset House, London and The Crucible, Sheffield. These will raise debate over what the RIBA calls the &quot;pockets of obscure leftover land and neglected plots that could \u2013 with imagination and new thinking \u2013 accommodate a host of functions and respond to local needs.&quot; The initiative coincides with the government&apos;s drive for localism and the &quot;Big Society&quot;, an attempt to get as many people as possible involved in shaping society. One of the oddest, or saddest, aspects of the huge construction boom of the past decade has been the way so many new buildings and developments have been isolated, leaving plots of lands between them as neglected patches. Forgotten Spaces is about revelling in these overlooked spaces, the places that have fallen between the cracks. RIBA says a forgotten space &quot;could be small or large \u2013 a grassy verge, a wasteland, an unused car park, a derelict building, an empty unit, an underpass or a flyover. The proposal could be simple or complex, a commercial or public facility, a piece of public art or a new building. The main requirement is that it responds to the surrounding area and serves a function for the local community.&quot; This is a great initiative; it should empower and encourage people who feel otherwise uninvolved to think imaginatively about the unused spaces around their homes that are inevitably numerous, whether they hail from Doncaster, Derby, Des Moines, Delhi or Dubai.

Durham&apos;s choices are limited after a scan revealed that Steve Harmison broke his left forearm in the opening championship match against Hampshire at the Rose Bowl. Harmison was struck by a return drive from his captain, Phil Mustard, and bowled only four balls, including two wides, in the match. He is expected to miss three championship matches. Durham&apos;s head coach, Geoff Cook, sounds reluctant to turn to Onions so soon. The bowler admitted on the eve of the season that he had feared his back injury might end his career and that he would continue to harbour doubts about his fitness until well into the season. He has had only a couple of gentle workouts \u2013 one on a pre-season tour of Dubai and another for the second XI last week. Cook shares the bowler&apos;s caution and may call up Mitchell Claydon to face his former county. &quot;It&apos;s great to welcome Graham back into the squad; he&apos;s worked incredibly hard throughout his rehabilitation but it&apos;s important we time his return in the championship correctly,&quot; Cook said. &quot;There is a lot of four-day cricket over the next two months and we need to make sure we bring him in at the right time.&quot; Will Smith is also back in favour after a traumatic 2010 in which he lost the captaincy by the end of May and played only four championship matches.

The Nell Gwyn is a traditional trial for the 1,000 Guineas \u2013 Speciosa completed the double most recently five years ago \u2013 and Barefoot Lady is now set to return next month for the Classic, a race in which Fahey has never before been represented. &quot;She isn&apos;t big, but they don&apos;t come much tougher,&quot; said Fahey. &quot;She&apos;d need to be supplemented if she is to run in the Guineas, but the owner&apos;s keen and the way she was staying on, you&apos;d have to think that a mile won&apos;t be a problem.&quot; It will cost \u00a330,000 to add Barefoot Lady to the line-up this month, but bookmakers were fairly dismissive of her prospects and Totesport offers 33-1 about victory. Connections can at least take encouragement from the fact that Speciosa was available at similar odds after her first victory. Fahey and Hanagan had also struck in the most valuable race on the card, the \u00a3150,000 Tattersalls Millions Sprint race, with the 4-1 shot Sir Reginald. The winner was due to be sold to Hong Kong after finishing third in the Gimcrack at York last season but the deal fell through when the horse was found to have a small cyst, and now the owner Jim McGrath has enjoyed the considerable consolation of a \u00a380,000-plus winning cheque. &quot;He was fit today and this had been his target for a long time \u2013 this was his Derby,&quot; said Fahey. &quot;Every winner means a lot to us, whether it&apos;s here or a seller at Catterick, but it&apos;s nice to come here and have a winner or two, because they usually go too fast for our horses.&quot; Fahey may be a rare visitor to Newmarket but more is sure to be seen of him this year, something which also applies to the 19-year-old French rider Mickael Barzalona, who tasted victory on his first visit to England as Ocean War scored in the Godolphin colours. Having ridden for Godolphin in Dubai for the past two winters, Barzalona struck up a successful partnership with Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s team during this year&apos;s Dubai Carnival, and more will be seen of him in the months ahead. &quot;He is a natural talent and a very good jockey,&quot; said Godolphin&apos;s racing manager Simon Crisford. &quot;He has commitments in France, where he is the second jockey to the Wertheimers, but he will be riding for us whenever possible.&quot; A Derby possible, Ocean War may well trial for the Epsom classic at Lingfield next month.

Officials in Doha confirmed that the Gulf state&apos;s military had been shipping French-made Milan missiles to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. Qatar&apos;s prime minister and foreign minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem, made clear on Wednesday that UN resolutions on Libya permitted the supply of &quot;defensive weapons&quot; to opposition forces struggling to fight Libyan armour. Qatari government officials were tight-lipped about the deliveries, which are being organised by the joint chiefs of staff and probably made by sea. &quot;We need to send the Libyans equipment so they can defend themselves and get on with their lives,&quot; one senior source said. &quot;These are civilians who have had to become fighters because of the situation.&quot; Britain&apos;s foreign secretary, William Hague, and colleagues from the 21-nation Libya contact group endorsed Qatar&apos;s position. Hague insisted the UK would supply only non-lethal equipment. France&apos;s view is similar but both countries \u2013 which are leading Nato air strikes in Libya \u2013 accept that arming the rebels is legal. Gaddafi&apos;s government has repeatedly complained that the Qataris are supplying the rebels. Khaled Kayim, Libya&apos;s deputy foreign minister, claimed on Wednesday that about 20 Qatari specialists were already in Benghazi. Rebel spokesmen have said they are in talks with &quot;friendly&quot; countries, including Qatar and France, to obtain weapons. Arms deliveries are consistent with Qatar&apos;s overall policy. The emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, is the only Arab leader to recognise the interim national council in Benghazi. Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are the only Arab states to participate in Nato-led military operations in Libya, although the Arab League supports the no-fly zone. Sheikh Hamad was in Washington on Thursday for talks with Barack Obama that were expected to include the Libyan situation. Mustafa Alani, of the Gulf Institute of Strategic Studies in Dubai, said the shoulder-launched weapons were a significant addition to the rebel arsenal because Nato aircraft could not target Libyan armour in built-up areas without risking collateral damage. Helicopters could do so but there is evident reluctance to deploy them. &quot;These missiles need minimum training. It&apos;s aim and shoot,&quot; Alani said. &quot;They are effective especially against the old generation of Soviet-made T72 tanks.&quot; Journalists in eastern Libya last week reported seeing rebels armed with Milan missiles for the first time. Qatar&apos;s armed forces are themselves equipped with the Milan but Alani said the weapon could have been bought by the Qataris directly from France for delivery to the Libyans. Qatar is tiny but immensely wealthy thanks to its vast oil and gas reserves, and pursues a famously independent foreign policy that allows it to maintain good relations with Iran while hosting key US military bases, as well as discreet links with Israel and its Palestinian Islamist enemy Hamas. Al-Jazeera satellite TV, based in Doha, is hugely influential. It is also assisting a rebel satellite TV operation broadcasting from Doha and providing other support for Libyan opposition groups. It has agreed to market crude oil produced from eastern Libyan fields no longer under Gaddafi&apos;s control. This week Qatar&apos;s state-owned marketing company delivered four shipments of oil products to Benghazi.", "title": "Libyan rebels receiving anti-tank weapons from Qatar", "sentences": ["Mustafa Alani, of the Gulf Institute of Strategic Studies in Dubai, said the shoulder-launched weapons were a significant addition to the rebel arsenal because Nato aircraft could not target Libyan armour in built-up areas without risking collateral damage."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-14T11:29:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/apr/16/talking-horses", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Horse racing tips", "Sport"], "article": "Frankel cut for Guineas after Greenham win 3.25pm Chris Corrigan writes: Frankel&apos;s odds for the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket in two weeks&apos; time were cut drastically after a clear-cut, four-length victory in the Greenham Stakes at Newbury. William Hill were shortest moments after the race, quoting Frankel at just 4-9, with several bookies going 4-6. In the morning the colt had been 5-6 for the Guineas. Trained by Henry Cecil and ridden by Tom Queally, Frankel was maintaining his unbeaten record as he stretched away in the final furlong. Today&apos;s SP was 1-4. Queally said: &quot;He did it well, I think it&apos;s fair to say our pacemaker wasn&apos;t quick enough, but he did it nicely. I gave him one or two smacks as he will probably get one the next day. He relaxed fine, dropped the bit and when I gave him a bit of rein he did it well. It&apos;s his first run and he&apos;s entitled to improve a great deal from that, and if he does he will go to the Guineas with a great chance.&quot; Any remaining doubters of the colt&apos;s superstar status could point to the fact that the second favourite, Strong Suit, ran a shocker, finishing at the back of the six-runner field. The second horse was the 28-1 shot Excelebration, with Shropshire back in third at 18-1. So how good was the form?  No comment on race-fixing claims 1pm: The British Horseracing Authority has refused to comment on new allegations of race-fixing. A report in a national newspaper claimed that five jockeys are currently under investigation for riding horses to lose over a period that could stretch back as far as six years.  Paul Struthers, head of communications for the BHA, said: &quot;We have a team of investigators who each have a number of ongoing investigations into a variety of matters at any one time.  &quot;It would be inappropriate to comment on individual investigations except those that are already in the public domain or until such time as an investigation has been concluded and charges issued.&quot; PA Today&apos;s best bets, by Tony Paley Gordon Elliott, who saddles Chicago Grey, can add a Scottish Grand National at Ayr to the Aintree prize the trainer collected with Silver Birch in 2007. The Irish handler became the youngest trainer to win the Grand National when he triumphed four years ago and continued his swift climb up the training ranks when he had his first winners at the Cheltenham Festival last month. Chicago Grey (3.25), who won the four-mile National Hunt Chase at that meeting, looked to have a fair bit in hand that day and can see off the runner-up, Beshabar. Novices have an excellent record in this race and the selection, who will get a typical hold-up ride from Paul Carberry to conserve his energy, jumps well and his form this season \u2013 including splitting Time For Rupert and Quinz, the subsequent Racing Post Chase winner \u2013 stands up to the closest scrutiny. Elliott has always considered his runner would be better off in the spring and Chicago Grey&apos;s tough Cheltenham race may not prevent him showing his best. Last year&apos;s National Hunt Chase winner, Poker De Sivola, looks to have been readied for this prize by the shrewd Ferdy Murphy and heads the dangers, along with the improving Always Right. 2.05 Newbury: Sir Michael Stoute won this race last year with Harbinger and Verdant looks another from his yard poised to show plenty of improvement at the age of four. Bred to take high rank, Verdant will be much better suited by the fast conditions than his main rivals here. 2.20 Ayr: Nadiya De La Vega is in receipt of half a stone from her stable companion Giorgio Quercus and is proven at this distance. The selection ran well for a long way at the Cheltenham Festival and will appreciate stepping back down to novice company. 2.40 Newbury: Pontenuovo&apos;s form when third last season to Dream Ahead in the Group One Prix Morny is the best on offer and the reports about her recent work from Roger Charlton&apos;s yard, to which the filly has been switched for this campaign, have been highly encouraging. This ground will be much more to her liking than the mud she ran in last time. 2.50 Ayr: The lightly weighted Via Galilei has classy handicap hurdle form from Sandown and Aintree to his name. He is sure to be well suited by the strong pace guaranteed by a number of prominent runners in this heat. 3.10 Newbury: Those involved with the short-priced 2,000 Guineas favourite Frankel are taking no chances in running the classy Picture Editor to ensure a proper pace. The selection proved himself the best two-year-old for a number of years last term and is impossible to oppose given his recent work on the Newmarket gallops. 3.45 Newbury: Willie Musson is a trainer to keep a particularly close eye on and he has primed Marajaa for a big run here. The selection was beaten a head in this race last year and was readied for a repeat bid a fortnight ago with an eye-catching run in the same Doncaster event he ran in 12 months ago. All the pace is around his high-numbered stall and, while this is a wide-open heat, he looks a very good each-way bet at around 25-1. Horse sense Never the first stable out off the blocks each year, Roger Charlton took plenty of encouragement from the victory of Genki at Newmarket on Thursday and the trainer is looking for another good run when Pontenuovo (2.40) makes her debut for the yard in the Dubai Duty Free Fred Darling Stakes at Newbury. Bought for \u00a3400,000 by Bjorn Nielsen in December, she is further forward in work than some of her stablemates and her French juvenile form stacks up well enough in this company. Clowance (2.05) may not be allowed to take her chance in the John Porter Stakes unless an unexpected cloudburst hits the racecourse, but she is well enough to do herself justice if conditions do turn in her favour. Newbury&apos;s maiden races look as competitive as ever and Strategic Bid is expected to be a strong fancy in the finale, the Derby entry having been considered a possible Craven Stakes runner until earlier this week despite still being unraced. But Voodoo Prince (5.25) has been working with Native Khan, the eventual winner of that race, and the much-talked-about son of brilliant mare Ouija Board could be ready to make a winning debut for his in-form stable. Gone To Lunch (3.25) is fancied to complete an emotional victory in the Scottish National at Ayr. Second in the race 12 months ago, he was hours from death after contracting shipping fever, a serious illness which affects the lungs, on his journey home. But Gone To Lunch recovered at Jeremy and Camilla Scott&apos;s Brompton Regis stables and made a winning return in a point-to-point in February before being far from disgraced in the Cheltenham Foxhunter. He is now 8lb lower in the weights than last year. Seen and heard If British Horseracing Authority officials were not already hot enough under the collar about an article in the Racing Post criticising their decision not to allow Fergal Lynch to resume his riding career, their moods were not improved this week by the number of reporters asking them about rumours of a new investigation into race-fixing. Suggestions that one jockey had failed to turn up to ride work on Wednesday morning as a result of having been questioned were denied by the trainer concerned. A BHA statement also revealed little, saying: &apos;We have a team of investigators who each have a number of ongoing investigations into a variety of matters at any one time. It would be inappropriate to comment on individual investigations except those that are already in the public domain or until such time as an investigation has been concluded and charges issued.&apos; However, it is believed that serious charges will be issued against three or more riders within a matter of weeks. Other names could also be placed in the frame if whispers that a Sunday tabloid plans to publish further accusations prove correct. The Five Bells pub in Newmarket, run by the former jockey Allan Mackay, has been temporarily banned from selling alcohol pending a police investigation into alleged breaches of its licence. According to the East Anglian Daily Times, police want the pub&apos;s licence revoked amid claims that a boxing gym was operating from the same premises. In an incident at the pub last month a man was stabbed with a penknife in his abdomen and leg, after which a 47-year-old man from the town was arrested. Will Hayler&apos;s best bet Piano 5.30 Haydock The selection has top weight to carry in a 17-runner field and should start at decent odds in what looks an open race. The expectation is that Piano will be contesting much better races than this in future and there was a lot to like about her two wins at the end of last term, when she was upped in trip.

Despite looking well in the preliminaries for the Totesport Greenham Stakes, Frankel once again showed an untractable side to his nature in the early stages of the race when pulling for his head, testing Tom Queally&apos;s iron grip on the reins. But once Queally had got the 1-4 favourite on a even keel, he loomed up powerfully alongside the leader Excelebration and galloped clear from the furlong-pole, scoring by four lengths with the runner-up a further six lengths clear of the remainder. Cecil admitted finding the build-up to Frankel&apos;s return to action &quot;nerve-racking&quot;, but there will be plenty more rushes to come this season, firstly at Newmarket in a fortnight&apos;s time. &quot;He&apos;ll do a couple more bits of work and that will get him right,&quot; said Cecil. &quot;I&apos;d say he was about 80% today but I said that this run would bring him along a lot and hopefully he will be much nearer 100% at Newmarket. &quot;He has had a good blow afterwards and I had said that it has been hard to get him fit as we haven&apos;t been able to get on to the grass with him at home. You can do so much on the all-weather but it&apos;s a deep surface and you have to be careful not to ask too much. &quot;They have done a great job with the ground here, there is no jar at all. He goes on soft ground, but he&apos;s better on fast ground. They couldn&apos;t go fast enough today, but he looked well in the paddock, he&apos;s gone down well and he&apos;s won well. It&apos;s very satisfactory and there is a lot more to come.&quot; Bookmakers Victor Chandler, having already reportedly laid an ante-post bet of \u00a3550,000 on him at 10-11, went shortest at 4-9 about him supplying Cecil with a third 2,000 Guineas victory, but even Ladbrokes and Totesport are now 1-2, with 4-6 the best price available. Queally seemed just as relieved to negotiated the first step up the ladder. &quot;I gave him one or two smacks as he will probably get one the next day,&quot; he said. &quot;He relaxed fine, dropped the bit and when I gave him a bit of rein he did it well. &quot;It&apos;s his first run and he&apos;s entitled to improve a great deal from that, and if he does he will go to the Guineas with a great chance. &quot;The press are all hyping him up, saying he&apos;s like a car, a train, a plane. He doesn&apos;t have to win a Grand Prix does he? The Guineas will do.&quot; Although Frankel remains favourite for the Derby, he appears an increasingly doubtful stayer over a mile and a half and his prospects of lining up in the Epsom race appeared even slimmer after World Domination made a winning debut for the same connections in the 11-furlong maiden later on the card. Immaculately bred out of the Oaks winner Reams of Verse, World Domination has considerably more size about him than Frankel but impressed when skipping clear to beat Solar Sky by three and three-quarter lengths. Cecil said: &quot;He will come on a lot, but he is more grown up than I expected. He travelled through the race like an old handicapper. I said to the Prince [Khalid Abdullah, owner] that we should put him in the Derby, just in case he was a Derby or a King Edward VII horse. &quot;I&apos;m not sure what I will do with him, he needs another race and we will have to see whether I go for one of the Derby trials or maybe take him to Newmarket for a trial.

Sitting astride the faultline between the Shia and Sunni worlds, the small Gulf island state lies at the heart of a strategically sensitive region that is dominated by bitter rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia \u2013 both very tough neighbours. Bahrain was always going to be a prime candidate if unrest erupted in the Arabian peninsula. But it was not easy to predict that the Al-Khalifa dynasty, Sunnis who rule over a restive 70% Shia majority, would react so brutally when protests mushroomed in February. Still, the activists who streamed to Manama&apos;s Pearl roundabout in a deliberate echo of Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square were demanding reform, not the overthrow of the regime. By regional standards, King Hamad was not the most repressive of rulers. Bahrain, unlike Saudi Arabia, has a parliament and a legal opposition. Bahrain&apos;s press operated within &quot;red lines&quot; but had a margin for manoeuvre. Expensive western PR companies were employed to promote the country&apos;s image. Prospects for political change looked reasonable until last summer when a sudden security crackdown began. The government was alarmed by joint Shia-Sunni demands to investigate the acquisition of prime real estate by the royals: Google Earth showed just how much of the island \u2013 where public beaches are rare \u2013 was already owned by the Al-Khalifa family. Last October the mildly Islamist Shia opposition party al-Wefaq won a plurality of seats in the lower house of parliament \u2013 despite being smeared by the government as Hezbollah-type extremists. But progressives in Bahrain emphasise nationality, not religious sect \u2013 thus the catchy slogan &quot;not Shias, not Sunnis, we are all Bahrainis&quot;. Bahrain&apos;s politics are as local as any other country&apos;s, though international pressures count for a lot, too. Projecting an image of stability also mattered hugely for a leading financial centre that has been struggling to compete with flashier and wealthier Dubai. As the base for the US Fifth Fleet, Bahrain is important to Washington, which values Hamad&apos;s bellicose attitude towards Tehran \u2013 revealed in WikiLeaks&apos; releases of state department cables. The king&apos;s choice of a Bahraini Jewish woman as ambassador to the US was a savvy move. Long-standing claims of Iranian meddling have not been substantiated. But Saudi concerns about Bahrain quickly became apparent in the face of the unrest just across the causeway from the kingdom&apos;s oil-producing Shia eastern province. What the Bahraini opposition calls an &quot;occupation force&quot; was deployed by agreement with the Saudi-dominated Gulf Co-operation Council and portrayed as answering the call of a sister nation in need. The Saudis were already unsettled by the way Barack Obama had washed his hands of Egypt&apos;s Hosni Mubarak. Thus their insistence on maintaining regional order \u2013 triggering the grim repression that has now become a permanent feature of Bahraini life. Britain and France have announced reviews of arms sales and the European Union is speaking out. The US has expressed concern but its public comments have been muted. Washington&apos;s tone, similar to that it uses with Israel, is of a candid friend. It has conspicuously failed to support the demands of the protesters. The contrast with Libya could hardly be greater. Arab leaders back Bahrain to the hilt. Only Iraq&apos;s Shia prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, has dared to criticise Hamad&apos;s crackdown. Iran \u2013 ignoring its own appalling record of crushing peaceful protests \u2013 is warning gleefully that the Saudis are &quot;playing with fire&quot;. For most observers, the lesson is clear: western and Arab governments alike badly need the Gulf region&apos;s energy and financial resources.

Discussions continue with the Dubai authorities about moving the prisoners to another jail. They are said to be traumatised after allegations that Lee Bradley Brown died after being beaten up by up to six police officers and dragged from his cell in the Bur Dubai station. British embassy staff visited the police station yesterday to reinterview the British inmates. There are fears that they may be at risk of reprisals following reports that they blew the whistle on the alleged beating. Negotiations are focusing on a possible transfer to the new Dubai Central Prison, in the middle of al-Aweer desert, which is the emirate&apos;s largest jail with room for 4,000 inmates. Radha Stirling, of the Detained In Dubai charity, said talks were continuing about moving the Britons to a &quot;safer place&quot; while a Foreign Office spokesman confirmed they had &quot;made a number of requests&quot; to the Dubai authorities. Among them is the need for a &quot;fair and proper&quot; investigation into the death of Brown, 39, from Ilford, Essex. Dubai police maintain Brown&apos;s body had no signs of bruising or evidence of assault when he died last Monday. They claim he suffocated on his vomit in his cell. A Foreign Office source said yesterday that, if concerns remained over Brown&apos;s cause of death once his body had been repatriated, a UK pathologist could carry out a second post mortem examination. Embassy officials are also still trying to piece together the circumstances surrounding Brown&apos;s visit to Dubai amid unconfirmed reports that he was invited to the Arab state by a mystery woman. Brown, a self-employed handyman, was staying at the Burj al-Arab hotel, said to be the &quot;world&apos;s most luxurious&quot;, with room prices starting at more than \u00a31,000 a night. He was arrested and taken into custody on 6 April over allegations of assault and use of abusive language during a row with a Nepalese housekeeper at the hotel. It has been claimed that Brown was not allowed access to a lawyer or given enough food and water for six days. In turn, unnamed Dubai police sources are reported to have dismissed the beating claims as &quot;a total fabrication and distortion of facts&quot;, saying that they never beat suspects in custody. Foreign Office officials are interviewing possible witnesses. A spokesman said: &quot;We remain in close contact with the families and the police, who have assured us that they are investigating.&quot; The four British prisoners are unharmed, he said, and the Foreign Office is in contact with their families.

In the subsequent 200 years, 40% of the species in coastal waters collapsed, showing falls in their population by 90% or more. There was a pattern to this story of decline. There was a much-less marked attrition in coastal regions with richly diverse marine ecosystems than in regions exhibiting low levels of diversity. What does this have to do with economics? Quite a lot, as it happens. In recent years, as the limitations of the rigidly mathematical approach to economics have been exposed, there has been interest in what the dismal science can learn from biologists, ecologists, geneticists, physicists and psychologists. Two years ago, Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England&apos;s executive director for financial stability, published a paper in which he used global fish stocks, the spread of epidemics, and the destruction of the rain forests to explain why the system collapsed so dramatically. The March edition of Central Banking contains a fascinating piece by its editor, Claire Jones, on how the work of the scientist Robert May on the stability and complexity in ecosystems supports the case for deep structural reform of finance. This is, of course, a topical issue in the light both of the preliminary report by the UK government&apos;s independent commission on banking (ICB) and the setting up of a financial policy committee (FPC) at the Bank of England to keep tabs on what the City is up to. Both the ICB and the FPC seek to strike a balance between preventing another financial crisis and ensuring that the growth prospects of the economy are not impaired by over-zealous regulation. As Paul Tucker, the Bank&apos;s deputy governor put it in a speech in New York last week: &quot;The government has proposed that the FPC be subject to a constraint that it should not act to preserve stability at the cost of significantly impairing the capacity of the financial sector to contribute to medium-to-long term economic growth. What this means in practice is that when faced with an immediate or incipient threat to stability, we must try to find a solution that avoids damage to long-term growth. That discipline is welcome by the Bank.&quot; But perhaps it shouldn&apos;t be. A light-touch approach could make the financial system less safe and increase the chances of a second financial crisis. It needs to be remembered that as a result of the first blow-up the UK economy is operating 10% of GDP below where it would be had the pre-crisis trend of growth continued. Haldane&apos;s analysis certainly suggests that leaving the status quo largely untouched is risky. Judging reforms by whether one or more big UK bank might relocate in the US, Switzerland, Dubai or Singapore misses the point entirely. Seen from an ecological viewpoint it is a bit like asking whether half a point off Brazil&apos;s GDP for the next 10 years is more important than protecting the Amazon rain forest. Pr\u00e9cis of the argument goes like this. In the decade or more leading up to the crisis, the financial sector became bigger, more complex and more homogeneous. Mutual institutions became banks, commercial banks dabbled in investment banking, and investment banks set up in-house hedge funds . What had been a diverse financial ecosystem became a monoculture. &quot;In consequence, the financial system became, like plants, animals and oceans before it, less disease-resistant&quot;, Haldane noted. &quot;When environmental factors changed for the worse, the homogeneity of the financial ecosystem increased materially its probability of collapse.&quot; Those running the system did not think for one minute this was going to happen. They thought that the system was strong and durable because risk had been spread. They were also reassured by the way global finance had withstood the Asian crisis of 1997, shrugged off the dotcom collapse of 2001 and had continued to expand despite rising oil prices and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The rationale was that complexity equalled stability, which was what biologists believed about ecosystems until the 1970s. Then, research showed that some simple ecosystems, such as the Savannahs were robust while more complex systems such as rain forests were vulnerable. For a while, this vulnerability lay hidden, with the system able to absorb a considerable amount of strain without appearing to suffer. But eventually, a tipping point was reached: the moment when fractionally more over-fishing caused irreparable damage to the stocks of cod on the Grand Banks. Seen from this perspective, it becomes easier to explain why seemingly minor problems triggered a systemic crisis in global finance. Few could understand why the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 could lead within a month to a situation where no bank in the world appeared safe, but that was because none of those responsible for the system \u2013 the bankers, the politicians and the regulators \u2013 understood that complexity plus homogeneity spelt danger. Haldane noted in his paper that &quot;in just about every non-financial discipline \u2013 from ecologists to engineers, from geneticists to geologists \u2013 this evolution would have set alarm bells ringing. Based on their experience, complexity plus homogeneity did not spell stability: it spelt fragility.&quot; In an echo of the loss of fish stocks after 1800, by early 2009, 23 of the biggest European and American banks had lost 90% of their market value. All this is highly relevant to the debate about how to fix the financial system. Up until now, the focus has been on curbs on pay and on ensuring that banks have bigger capital buffers to limit their leverage and their exposure to risk. Neither is likely to do the trick. The root of the problem before the crisis was that bankers did not know the risks they were taking. If, in the years ahead, they still do not appreciate those risks, they will try to find ways to sidestep new capital constraints, no matter how much they are paid. The task of the FPC is to ensure that the City is aware of those risks. Better information would help to reduce the risks of another crisis, particularly if information was shared across borders. Haldane cites the example of the World Health Organisation, which set up a Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network in 2000 to provide a co-ordinated global response to fighting epidemics such as bird flu and SARS. But more transparency won&apos;t be enough on its own, because what the financial system needs is more diversity and more simplicity. That means a richer ecosystem: mutuals, commercial banks, investment banks, state-owned banks, banks dedicated to funding environmental industries. It also means greater simplicity to ensure that shocks do not lead to system collapse. That is why it is a mistake to accept, at the first sign of resistance from finance sector, that there can be no Glass-Stegall-style separation of retail and investment banking. We need to be clear what an insufficiently robust response to the crisis means. It means allowing the City and Wall Street to hoover up all the fish and chop down all the trees.

Kenyan athletes finished in the top three places in the men&apos;s race (despite their biggest star, Olympic champion Sammy Wanjiru, pulling out just weeks before the race), and also first and third in the women&apos;s race. It began as a trickle \u2013 when Joseph Nzau won the Chicago marathon in 1983 \u2013 grew into a river, and has now become a roaring, unstoppable torrent. Last autumn, out of 42 elite men&apos;s marathons, 38 were won by Kenyans and four by Ethiopians. The spring marathon season has so far been an even more dominant story, with Kenyans winning the men&apos;s and women&apos;s prizes in virtually all of the big races so far, from Paris to Rotterdam, London to Dubai. This is all great news for Kenyans. I watched yesterday&apos;s London marathon in a packed bar in Eldoret, in Kenya&apos;s Rift Valley. It was like watching a football match, with the bar full of cheering, whistling fans. But for the rest of the world, all this dominance is becoming a problem. Not only are all the other runners being left for dust, but there is a gnawing fear among race organisers and, crucially, sponsors and advertisers, that global TV audiences are finding it all a bit boring. Just recently, the world cross country championships, which have been held annually since 1973, were changed to a biennial competition. The reason? East African dominance is killing interest in the event. And now the Utrecht marathon in the Netherlands has decided it has had enough. After four Kenyan victories in the past four years, it has applied the old adage: if you can&apos;t beat them, get rid of them. Last week it was revealed that the event organisers have used a grossly unbalanced prize money system as a way to &quot;discourage&quot; Kenyans from running. By offering a Dutch winner \u20ac10,000 against a mere \u20ac100 to any foreign winner, the organisers say they are only trying to give local athletes a chance, but the move sets a dangerous precedent. Athletics Kenya has reacted furiously, asking all Kenyan athletes to withdraw from the race in protest. Such dominance in sport is not usually seen as a problem. Take Roger Federer, Tiger Woods or Manchester United, for example. No one has ever sought to exclude them from a major competition on the grounds they are too good. In fact, the opposite is usually true. They are welcomed as sporting heroes. Usually, we love to watch the very best going head to head. But when the very best are all African, suddenly it becomes a problem. It&apos;s hard not to think there is an element of cultural ignorance going on here. Africa is another world, I was once told when I started working for a national television news programme. Things happen there that would be huge stories if they happened in other parts of the world, but really, people are not interested in Africa. This may be part of the problem. We in the west just can&apos;t empathise with these runners. We have no understanding of their backgrounds, where they&apos;ve come from. They just show up, win and disappear. In many ways sport is like a soap opera, and it is only when you get to know the characters involved that you begin to revel in the drama. But rather than relate to the top African runners as individual characters, each with their own back stories and personalities, the tendency is to lazily lump them all together as &quot;the Kenyans&quot; or &quot;the Ethiopians&quot;. Perhaps the athletes are partially to blame. Most Kenyan runners are shy when placed in front of the post-race press conference microphone. There are no Usain Bolt arrows, or Christian Ronaldo pouts. They are on the whole quiet and reserved. Yes, perhaps a little media training wouldn&apos;t go amiss. But considering just how dominant these runners are, in the world&apos;s most accessible sport, how many of us can even name more than one or two Kenyan runners? Is there really a will to find out about them? Or is it the case, like the news stories, that we don&apos;t really want to know? If marathon running is a soap opera, then right now it&apos;s in the midst of one of its most gripping episodes. Particularly in men&apos;s marathon running, the winning times are getting faster and faster at an incredible rate. Just this week, BBC Radio 4 ran a programme on how soon we will see a sub-two hour marathon. These guys are quietly pushing back the boundaries of the most universal of sports, and all we can do is complain that it&apos;s boring. One common response to their performances is to attribute their dominance to genetics, despite recent studies failing to find any genetic uniqueness to the people of Kenya or Ethiopia. Blaming genetics is an easy way out. There&apos;s nothing we can do, we say, throwing up our arms. The die comes pre-loaded. But blaming racial differences undermines the incredible dedication, focus and effort these runners are putting into their sport. It undermines their brilliance. So rather than watching Sunday&apos;s race and saying, &quot;oh, another Kenyan has won&quot;, I propose as sports fans we see Emmanuel Mutai and Mary Keitany as individuals.

Residents of Homs and Talbisseh told news agencies that the cities were tense following funerals for at least 8 of the victims. The injured were refusing to seek medical treatment for fear of being arrested, they said, while reports suggested a sit-in was being staged. Despite a reduced level of violence during Friday&apos;s protests and a pledge to lift emergency laws within the week, protesters turned out on Sunday for Syria&apos;s independence day which commemorates the departure of the last French soldier in 1946. Protests also took place in Daraa, Duma and Latakia on Sunday, and Daraa again on Monday]. Amateur footage suggests a rapidly growing number of demonstrators are calling for the toppling of the regime rather than freedom.

The Syrian government \u2013 who said one policeman had been killed and 11 injured in Talbisseh at the hands of an armed gang \u2013 has repeatedly blamed the past month of protests on armed gangs linked to outsiders, from Lebanese enemies to exiled opposition. &quot;Even if the US gave money to these groups, it has no bearing on the protests,&quot; said one independent activist in Damascus. &quot;It is clear that this movement was started by normal people, not the opposition \u2013 which barely exists anyway \u2013 and not even us activists.&quot; Ausama Monajed, an activist helping to publicise the protests, is a member of the party, but said his work was run by volunteers only.

Baby Run, meanwhile, brings a much higher profile to Sandown, having taken the Foxhunter Chase over the Grand National fences at Aintree earlier this month. &quot;Balthazar King won the other day and now he&apos;s got in the handicap proper I&apos;d think he&apos;d have a great chance,&quot; Richard Johnson, his jockey, said on Monday. &quot;The way he stayed on at Cheltenham up the hill there you&apos;d hope he&apos;d get the three mile, five furlongs.&quot; Other entries for Saturday&apos;s race include Meanus Dandy, who will be ridden by Ruby Walsh for Paul Nicholls, who will be confirmed as champion trainer once again at Sandown, while the weights are unlikely to rise any further after Siegemaster was confirmed as a probable runner under top weight of 11st 12lb. &quot;He&apos;s in the Irish National, but he&apos;s more likely to run at Sandown if the ground is OK,&quot; Dessie Hughes, the Co Kildare trainer, said. &quot;If it&apos;s good jumping ground, we&apos;d travel for a race like that.&quot; The rise in the weights was welcomed by David Pipe as the trainer considered saddling Faasel and Gentle Ranger. Dubai Prince, who was transferred to the Godolphin operation after winning both his starts as a juvenile for the Curragh trainer Dermot Weld last season, will miss both the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby after suffering a setback. The son of Shamardal, who had been quoted at around 14-1 for the Newmarket Classic, has been diagnosed with a hairline fracture of his right iliac wing, part of the pelvis. &quot;It is a big shame as he had been shaping up nicely this spring,&quot; Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, said. &quot;He will now need a few weeks off but he should be fine for later in the season.&quot;", "title": "Balthazar King given weights boost for Bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown", "sentences": ["Dubai Prince, who was transferred to the Godolphin operation after winning both his starts as a juvenile for the Curragh trainer Dermot Weld last season, will miss both the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby after suffering a setback."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-18T19:52:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/apr/19/art-colleges-face-uncertain-financial-future", "tags": ["University of the Arts London", "Cuts and closures", "Goldsmiths, University of London", "Royal College of Art", "Art", "Higher education", "International students", "Students", "Education", "Art", "Arts"], "article": "The University of the Arts London (UAL), England&apos;s largest art and design university, should be planning the launch of its new state-of-the-art campus in King&apos;s Cross, which is due to open in September. But this has been marred by a collapse in its public funding, which has led UAL to embark on a radical restructure of its courses. Set to lose more than \u00a350m in public funding by 2015, the university, which comprises six colleges including Central Saint Martins (which is moving to the new campus), Chelsea College of Art and Design and the London College of Fashion (LCF), is having to think creatively about how it might secure its financial future. Among other things, it is looking to set up courses in China and the Middle East while amalgamating three of its loss-making further education foundation courses and expanding its range of more lucrative postgraduate degrees. It is not the only major art and design school under financial pressure. Goldsmiths also faces the loss of its teaching budget as it only runs arts and humanities courses, which have been particularly hard hit by the funding cuts. The postgraduate Royal College of Art (RCA) plans to increase student numbers by 50% over the next three years to increase its income. But of the big London art schools, UAL faces perhaps the greatest challenge. A relatively new university, it has undergone a series of significant structural changes, including the recent amalgamation of Byam Shaw School of Art and Central Saint Martins (CSM). Nigel Carrington, rector of the UAL, admits the university is in a challenging financial position. Not only is it set to lose almost all its public funding for teaching over the next three years, but like other universities set up after 1992, it has already lost millions of pounds of research funding. &quot;There is a complete collapse of funding for universities like this,&quot; says Carrington. &quot;We have to assume we are being privatised. We will have virtually no public funding at all by 2015. We have \u00a352m of teaching funding at the moment. We expect all but \u00a31m-\u00a32m of that to have gone by 2015.&quot; Over the last three years, he says, the institution has been hit hard by pretty much every budget cut, including a loss of just over 34% of its government funding for the coming academic year. Last week, UAL announced its undergraduate fees would be \u00a39,000 a year from 2012. Carrington says there isn&apos;t much choice; by 2015, 75% of its income will come directly from its 20,000 students and only about 5-7% will come from the public sector. &quot;It would be impossible for us to charge \u00a36,000, given the high cost of running technical workshops and providing studio space in central London. We&apos;re about to see a massive capital budget cut when we need to refurbish several of our sites.&quot; UAL has already taken &quot;a huge number of efficiencies,&quot; he says, including a redundancy programme that should shave about \u00a34.5m from staff costs. As well as expanding its overseas and postgraduate provision, plans include scaling back loss-making courses (including art foundation courses); amalgamating technical and support services, and expanding its short taught courses, which bring in about \u00a310m a year. But Carrington admits that moving from &quot;a public sector institution into an entrepreneurial institution&quot; won&apos;t be easy. Efforts will be focused on maintaining UAL&apos;s high number of international students, who make up a quarter of the total. The London College of Fashion ran courses in Dubai last year aimed at attracting students to study in the UK. China is the next target \u2013 Carrington notes that the Chinese are &quot;furiously building&quot; art and design schools in a bid to stem the flow of young talent to the west. &quot;We are looking at whether we can teach something like a foundation [art\u00a0foundation course] in China,&quot; he explains. &quot;Those who either can&apos;t or don&apos;t want to come here straight after school can do a course offshore, which is then quickly topped up here and then they go straight into our undergraduate courses. We&apos;re not looking to set up an overseas campus \u2013 we&apos;re looking at sending staff over.&quot; This plan is likely to prove controversial. The foundation course in art and design at the London College of Fashion is due to close in May, while from September, Camberwell, Chelsea and Wimbledon foundation students will all be taught at a new venue in Camberwell, with the aim of steering them into UAL undergraduate courses rather than studying at rival art and design institutions. But Susan Collins, director of the Slade School of Fine Art, part of University College London (UCL), is concerned that this will reduce access to degree courses. &quot;Our worry is that getting rid of foundation courses is going to turn higher education into an inverted pyramid,&quot; she says. Meanwhile, UAL is increasing its postgraduate portfolio, including a fashion MBA, while CSM will run six master&apos;s courses, three practice-based MAs, including one in art and science, and three research-based MRes courses. Carrington also warns that postgraduate fees will jump to be the same as or slightly higher than those for undergraduate degrees as they are set to lose all their funding for new entrants from 2012. But with students set to amass far greater debts due to rising undergraduate fees, UAL is trying to design courses that give students more time to work, not least because its students also have substantial material costs. Its taught master&apos;s degree programmes are increasingly what are known as &quot;extended mode&quot; courses, running two to three days a week over two years \u2013 putting them somewhere between a traditional part-time course and a full-time course. For example, the new photography MA will run on 3.5 days in the first year and 2.5 in the second, charging \u00a33,800 per year \u2013 compared with \u00a37,500 for the full-time MA at the RCA or \u00a36,000 at the London College of Communication. Mark Dunhill, the dean of fine arts at CSM, believes scholarships, bursaries and subsidised accommodation should be on offer for less well-off students to ensure art and design does not become &quot;the preserve of the wealthy&quot;. He also believes arts institutions should be running more short courses and evening classes and offering modules that allow students to build up credits over a longer period of time as is common in the US. &quot;There, they could choose whether they wanted to take a class in the morning or in the evening or do a &apos;minimester&apos; in the summer. So maybe a kind of mixed economy, a mix of pay as you go and a loan.&quot; While Dunhill is reasonably optimistic that UAL and other big-name art and design colleges will adapt to the new market, he fears some non-specialist universities may dump departments to cut costs. &quot;There&apos;s a danger we could dismantle art education in response to market demand. To be honest, I think everyone is in a state of shock. I don&apos;t think anyone believed this could happen. It&apos;s such an assault on the success UK art schools have demonstrated over the past 20 years.&quot;", "title": "Art schools face uncertain financial future", "sentences": ["The London College of Fashion ran courses in Dubai last year aimed at attracting students to study in the UK."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-19T05:44:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/apr/19/live-racing-19-april", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Horse racing tips", "Sport"], "article": "1.35pm Wootton Bassett out of the 2,000 Guineas Will Hayler: Unbeaten Wootton Bassett, the big hope of the north this season, is to miss the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket in less than a fortnight&apos;s time. His trainer Richard Fahey has been unable to find a racecourse where conditions were suitable in order to give Wootton Bassett a proper workout, so the colt worked at home in Malton this morning but the performance was not enough to persuade Fahey to give him the green light. Fahey said: &quot;We&apos;ve run out of time. It&apos;s disappointing but we didn&apos;t want to go to the Guineas if he wasn&apos;t 100%.&quot; The French 2,000 Guineas, which is two weeks after the Newmarket Classic, or the Irish version at the Curragh a week later are now the likeliest targets for Wootton Bassett, whose defection leaves Frankel&apos;s grip at the head of the Newmarket betting looking ever tighter. With Dubai Prince ruled out yesterday, how many runners will there be on April 30? Today&apos;s best bets, by Will Hayler A little over three weeks to the start of York&apos;s excellent Dante meeting and the track looked in fantastic condition with the sprinklers going as I drove past this morning en-route to a trip to the hairdressers for Mrs Hayler. If you&apos;ve never been to the Dante, I can&apos;t recommend it enough \u2013 plenty of good racing in front of much more manageable crowds than you will find on John Smith&apos;s Cup day or at the Ebor meeting. It will be a major disappointment if Dot&apos;s Delight (7.45) doesn&apos;t improve for moving up in trip to two miles at Wolverhampton this evening. Being held up in a slowly-run race last time did not show her in the best possible light, yet she still stayed on to finish second, and a faster gallop will surely to be on the cards in this much bigger field. Six Of Clubs has got a good write-up in the Racing Post today, which ought to help the price of my selection, who I really do fancy. You can make too many excuses for moderate horses, as I have found to my cost before. But this is the first time everything has looked in Dot&apos;s Delight&apos;s favour and I am determined to give her and the marvellous Silvestre de Sousa another chance. Kieren Fallon goes to the BHA&apos;s headquarters on High Holborn on Thursday morning in a bid to overturn the 10-day ban he received at Kempton last week for failing to ride out for second place (Jason Maguire&apos;s appeal against another suspension is later the same morning) but the rider will be keen to maintain his recent winning momentum at Pontefract this afternoon. Ponte Carlo was Fallon&apos;s old stamping ground in his days with the Ramsdens and he rides the track particularly well. Hoof It (3.10) has already been well supported for the six-furlong handicap, but there may yet be some juice to be squeezed out of his price at 100-30, as the form of his victory on his final start last season at Doncaster continues to work out well and trainer Mick Easterby expects him to be more effective at today&apos;s six furlongs than five this season.

Some call it a Devon Loch, others the Costanza Moment. Being in a position from which you simply cannot fail, and then failing \u2013 not simply, but spectacularly. It&apos;s going to take something similar if Manchester United are to miss out on a record 19th title. Starting tonight at Newcastle, United need 13 points from six games to clinch the title (although you suspect 11 would be enough, as logic, form, the fixture list and that psychic down the road with the inexplicably moreish musty smell all point to Chelsea rather than Arsenal being the main challengers). United do have a tricky run in, with Arsenal, Chelsea and an in-form Everton still to come. Nor is tonight a given, even though Newcastle have won only two of their last 12 games this season and two of the last 28 against United since the famous 5-0 win that clinched the title for Kevin Keegan&apos;s side back in October 1996. United at least have Wayne Rooney back, following his two-match ban for introducing a bad word to millions of hitherto Listerine-mouthed children up and down the country. Surprisingly, neither Rooney nor Patrice Evra have been banned by the FA for having absolutely nothing to do with a couple of incidents that set a diabolical example to hitherto innocent children. The FA have decided to take no action over the post-match contretemps between Mario Balotelli and Rio Ferdinand \u2013 which, let&apos;s be honest, was extremely funny \u2013 or the very mild damage to the United dressing-room. Won&apos;t someone think of the plasterwork? &quot;We brought it to the FA&apos;s attention on Saturday night, we apologised and offered to pay,&quot; said a United spokesman, proudly branding an &apos;IOU, Honest, Love, The Glazers&apos; note. &quot;It was about three inches in diameter ... and not a hole,&quot; he added, as the Fiver fnarred wearily, a broken tea-time email. The state of football, reduced to getting all hot and bothered over some damaged plasterwork.

QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;[Colonel] Gaddafi is a man I&apos;ve always admired. I know him and I know Seif, his son. They are my friends. But frankly I don&apos;t really know what is happening in Libya, but it must be very hard for Gaddafi and his family&quot; - just when you thought El Hadji Diouf couldn&apos;t make himself any more unpopular ... TOFFEES PAST THEIR SELL-BY DATE There are people who would pay good money just to wind up Manchester United fans. In fact, Sheikh Mansour already has \u2013 and last weekend&apos;s display of impotent rage from Rio Ferdinand, ignominious petulance from Paul Scholes and puce fury from Lord Ferg must have all represented highly satisfying returns on investment for Manchester City&apos;s mischief-making owner. Interestingly, the chances of anyone forking out a fortune to buy Everton in the intention of provoking a similarly amusing shift in power on Merseyside are waif-thin: because what is the point in paying to work Liverpool fans into outrage when so many of them reside permanently in that state already? None whatsoever. Thus, by being very easily offended, Liverpool fans prevent their neighbours from getting too noisy, the sly coots. &quot;New ownership isn&apos;t always the solution to everything,&quot; wheezed David Moyes today in an attempt to put a brave face on the fact that, despite making his millions from persuading people to sit through West End musicals, chairman Bill Kenwright has for years failed to convince anyone to buy Everton. &quot;We don&apos;t need new owners,&quot; insisted Moyes, who for the last three seasons has only been allowed to spend what he earns through sales, which is obviously a ludicrous restriction in an industry in which winners must venture further into the red than Mick Hucknall&apos;s suppository. &quot;We need an investment of money,&quot; jarred Moyes, explaining: &quot;Everton could be very close to being very good for not an awful lot of outlay. It might not be one of those clubs that needs \u00a3300m-\u00a3400m to turn it around. The stadium needs investment obviously, but maybe one side can be developed to start with. I&apos;m not sure, something like that. Maybe the football team doesn&apos;t need \u00a3100m. Maybe the football team needs an amount that would give it a chance to breathe again and grow a little bit more. That&apos;s maybe why we don&apos;t need a zillionaire.&quot; So there you have it, Everton aren&apos;t looking for a zillionaire, just someone who might like to hand over tens of millions of pounds without actually taking ownership over how it&apos;s spent.

While thousands of men from Benghazi volunteered to fight on the frontline in late February and March, he stayed at home, tending to his car painting business. He was 44, out of shape and had never even held a gun, so what use would he be, he thought. Then Nato arrived with its airstrikes, and Ali expected the war to be over quickly. It was not. So on Monday, dressed in jeans and a shirt, he drove to the rebel training camp opposite Benghazi&apos;s main university and enlisted as a volunteer. &quot;I have been seeing on TV what is happening to our brothers in Misrata and Ajdabiya. Nato could not finish the job. So I decided that I needed to help my brothers and defend my family.&quot; When the British and French military advisers arrive in Benghazi, where the headquarters of the rebels trying to oust Muammar Gaddafi is based, they will find no shortage of eager men like Ali \u2013 low on experience but large of heart. But they will also find a more organised guerilla force than that which existed even a month ago, when volunteer fighters were still being sent directly to the frontline. Many quickly arrived home again in coffins. &quot;At the start it was chaos,&quot; says Bejou Marey, 48, who quit his job as a pilot for Emirates in Dubai to come home to fight in February, and is now one of the managers of the training camp. &quot;People, including myself, went straight out to fight. If a weapon got stuck we did not know what to do. Two of my best friends were killed next to me.&quot; Lessons appear to have been learned. A few weeks ago, the rebel military leaders introduced a new policy where only those with previous fighting experience were allowed on the frontline. Civilian volunteers are now kept back to man checkpoints, or to take up defensive positions around Benghazi. Accidents are still occurring due to inexperience in using heavy weapons, but friendly fire incidents are decreasing, the rebels say. On the training ground, new recruits with no previous military experience must now go through a few hours training each day for a month or more, before being posted to their positions. Men like Faraj Mohamed, who was in Gaddafi&apos;s army for 30 years, provide instruction on how to use an AK-47, and an overview of the rebel-held weapons like anti-aircraft guns and rocket launchers. The volunteer fighters also learn to march, get tips on military tactics, and undergo basic psychological evaluation, according to Marey. &quot;We don&apos;t want lunatics running around with our guns,&quot; he says. Along with Ali, several dozen other volunteers enrolled at the training camp on Monday, a motley group, clean-shaven and bearded, in baseball caps and turbans, boots and trainers. One of them, Ali Shirif, 20, a smartly dressed civil engineering student with gelled hair and Wayfarer-style sunglasses, in his third week of training, says he wants to go to the frontline. &quot;I am not scared, though I think they will put me on defensive duties.&quot; If so, he is likely be there with Ibrahim Abdullah, who is old enough to be his grandfather. Born in 1948 and with a creased face to prove it, Abdullah pulled a photocopied certificate from his tattered flannel shirt. It was a record of doing six-months basic training in 1984, serving a man he hated with all his heart. &quot;If I can&apos;t get my hands around Gaddafi&apos;s neck, I will bite him with my teeth.&quot; He paused, then added: &quot;And his son Saif too.&quot;", "title": "Libyan rebels a more organised force than a month ago", "sentences": ["&quot;At the start it was chaos,&quot; says Bejou Marey, 48, who quit his job as a pilot for Emirates in Dubai to come home to fight in February, and is now one of the managers of the training camp."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-19T16:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/20/easter-holiday-travel-uk", "tags": ["Transport", "Rail transport", "Road transport", "Air transport", "Travel", "Easter", "Travel & leisure", "UK news"], "article": "Motoring organisations expect the busiest Easter on the roads for several years, with Britain forecast to bask in glorious weather in one of the hottest Aprils on record.

Homebase has reported a 20% rise in barbecue sales compared with Easter last year and said it would sell enough gas &quot;to fuel 300,000 barbecues\u2026 and enough garden chairs to fill Westminster Abbey 30 times over&quot;. Road The AA expects traffic to start building , with a total of 10m cars \u2013 a third of all vehicles in the UK \u2013 on the move during the long holiday weekend. It estimates that the recent spike in petrol and diesel prices will add an extra \u00a32 to to the cost of each 100 miles driven by holiday motorists. According to Trafficmaster, the hotspots will be the A21, M3, M4, M5, M11 and M27. Additionally, the cross-Channel routes \u2013 the M20, A20 and A2 to Eurotunnel, Folkestone and Dover \u2013 are expected to be exceptionally busy. Although most restrictions for roadworks will be lifted during the Easter period, some big works will still go ahead, bringing congestion on the M1 between junctions 10 and 14 and the M25 between junctions 18 and 21A, and junctions 27 and 30. The M1 still threatens to disrupt north-south journeys after a fire under a raised section of the motorway in north London forced the Highways Agency to implement lane closures and speed restrictions. Three lanes should be reopened by Thursday but a 50mph speed limit will still be in place for safety reasons. The government has urged motorists to consider alternative routes such as the M40 and A1. Edmund King, president of the AA, said the temptation to hit the road, lured by good weather and the long break, could be tempered by punishing fuel prices. &quot;The roads are still going to be busy but I think drivers will choose to go to the closest beach. So we predict that there will be slightly shorter trips, as many drivers try to economise.&quot; Rail Fewer delays on the railways, plus ever-present road congestion, could persuade some motorists to take the train. According to the Association of Train Operating Companies, there will be 6.5m rail journeys over Easter, up from 6.2m last year, although the network will be less busy than on an average working day. Network Rail has promised fewer replacement bus services than last year, as part of its drive to eliminate one of the holiday traveller&apos;s biggest bugbears. The number of trains running will be 18% up on last year. Acknowledging that Good Friday will probably be the busiest day on most routes, Network Rail says there will be one-third more services that day than in 2010. Nonetheless, improvement work will continue on some lines including the Great Eastern route between London Liverpool Street and Shenfield; the Thameslink service across central London; and, on Saturday and Sunday, sections of the west coast main line. Virgin Trains, the London-to-Glasgow operator, said it expected Thursday to be its busiest day of the year, with more than 100,000 passengers using the service, including some travellers keen to avoid the M1 bottleneck. &quot;We have seen an increase in bookings over the past few days, which may be down to people worried about travelling by car due to the M1 closure,&quot; said a Virgin Trains spokesman. Air  Despite the hot weather in the UK and an awful forecast for rainy Madrid, millions of air passengers are expected to take their chances at the airport. Departure and arrival lounges are expecting one of the busiest weekends of the year as about one in 10 holidaymakers buck the trend of holidaying at home. Heathrow estimates it will handle 1.1 million passengers over Easter, with its owner, BAA, expecting to process a total of 1.8 million passengers at its airports including Stansted, Edinburgh and Glasgow. Heathrow&apos;s top destination will be New York followed by Dubai, Dublin, Amsterdam and Hong Kong. Malaga will be the top destination at Britain&apos;s second-largest airport, Gatwick, which will process nearly 500,000 people over Easter with nearly one in 10 passengers heading for the Spanish resort. Gatwick said that, including the royal wedding weekend, travel numbers would be up 4% on last year. A peak-time period for air travellers wouldn&apos;t be the same without some form of disruption and there could be a problem for duty-free shoppers this Easter. The government is refusing to meet the 29\u00a0April deadline for lifting the Europe-wide ban on carrying duty-free liquids bought on flights originating outside the EU on to connecting flights in the UK. Other EU countries may meet the deadline, meaning that passengers travelling through Frankfurt will be able to carry their bottle of Chanel No\u00a05 on to their flight but anyone connecting through Heathrow will have to leave it at the gate.", "title": "Heatwave entices Britons to spend Easter holiday at home", "sentences": ["Heathrow&apos;s top destination will be New York followed by Dubai, Dublin, Amsterdam and Hong Kong."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-20T14:55:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/20/the-fiver-football-email", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "FAWLTY POWERS? Every time a challenge has been thrown down to them this season, Arsene Wenger&apos;s young team have risen heroically to meet it. But in the light of last night&apos;s draw between Manchester United and Newcastle, which breathed fresh scope for fun into the Premier League title race, we must remind ourselves that there are limits to what even lion-hearted prodigies can do and, difficult though it may be to believe, at some point this season Arsenal may fail to screw up an opportunity to win something. For surely even they can&apos;t have many more c0ck-ups in reserve? Already this season they, like sailors who&apos;ve slipped LSD into the scuttlebutt, have delved deep into the absurd in search of ways of wasting opportunities: they&apos;ve thrown away a four-goal lead, managed to get their striker sent off for shooting wide, conceded a penalty in the 12th minute of stoppage time, fielded no fewer than four goalkeeping clowns and even lost a cup final to none other than Birmingham City, for crying out loud. So when they travel to White Lane tonight, what wacky way can they possibly find of responding to the gauntlet thrown down last night by Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s teases? Bacary Sagna is likely to return to the fold, which sadly means there is unlikely to be any comedy intervention from Emmanuel Eboue. Mind you, fans of fiascos will take heart as Sagna also played when Spurs and Arsenal met at the Emirates and was, therefore, part of the inventive troupe that contrived to lose 3-2 after being two goals in front. What has also been encouraging is that with each new skit put on by his players this season, Wenger has obligingly played along by performing ever more accurate impersonations of Basil Fawlty. The Fiver is not the only one to notice this: &apos;Arry Redknapp approves too. &quot;He used to be &apos;The Professor&apos;,&quot; barfed Redknapp. &quot;I read these articles from all these clever reporters who said he sat there like a chess master. He&apos;s watching the game and all the other idiots are jumping up and down, shouting and screaming, and Arsene Wenger sits there studying every move on the pitch. That was the year they went unbeaten. We can all sit there with a cigar when you&apos;re winning 3-0, saying &apos;this is good&apos;. Suddenly they started losing and he was one of the biggest nutters of all. He&apos;s jumping around more than anyone now.&quot; One of these days, if this Arsenal team aren&apos;t careful, Wenger could be jumping having won a title. QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;He is one of the most significant people in the history of Real Madrid and I am nothing in the history of Real Madrid. But I am the coach and the coach is the one who decides. I am the coach. What do you want to do? It&apos;s me. The decisions are mine&quot; \u2013 Jose Mourinho humbly responds to Alfredo Di Stefano&apos;s criticism of his tactics \u2026 for one sentence, before promptly reverting to type. NAMING WRONGS The impression given by the Royal Emirates Group yesterday was that the sovereign wealth fund had purchased a Spanish club and intended to rename them Team Dubai. Today it emerged that popular makeweight municipality of Madrid club Getafe were the lucky team. Disappointingly, it also emerged that Team Dubai will only be appended to the name and also branded across the stadium, shirts and all other merchandise. Royal Emirates Group said Dubai&apos;s minister of culture, the Spanish ambassador and &quot;many other corporate icons and members of the ruling family of Dubai&quot; would attend the ceremony on Thursday at Burj Al Arab, the eleventy-four star hotel that looks like Portsmouth&apos;s Spinnaker Tower. Angel Torres, the club president, says he is in Dubai &quot;with the idea of having meetings to look for sponsors that improve the image of Getafe and a new name for the stadium&quot;. Instead he is getting more than he initially bargained for. The big loser in this deal, other than Real Zaragoza who were thought to be the targets of Dubai&apos;s come-hither eyes yesterday, is Alfonso Perez, the Getafe-born former Real Betis striker who won a gold medal with Spain at the Barcelona Olympics and had the stadium named in his honour in 1998. Talk of Getafe has the Fiver&apos;s castanet-clacking, bull-fighting, siesta-taking Spanish cousin A-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa Ole Ole Ole Cinco, on the phone. He reminds us that the club are managed by the former Real Madrid great M\u00edchel, who once grabbed Carlos Valderrama Vinnie-Jones-on-Paul-Gascoigne style and was censured by a disciplinary panel for &quot;manipulating in public that of your neighbour which is a gift given exclusively to males by nature&quot;. Poor Alfonso Perez had a gift given exclusively to him, too, and has had it manipulated off him in front of corporate icons in equally dignity-reducing fashion. DOUBLE YOUR MONEY WITH BLUE SQUARE!

FIVER LETTERS &quot;I wish people like Nick Smith (yesterday&apos;s Fiver letters) would give Frank Lampard a break. When Chelsea went out against Barca in 2009 after a shocking refereeing display, Lampard was a model of dignity and restraint. He shook hands with Xavi and Iniesta and wished them well for the final. He is a model pro, has been a brilliant player to watch and the amount of abuse he gets from idiots that don&apos;t watch football grinds my gears. Next Nick will be telling me that a professional footballer who plays at the highest level in central midfield, plays virtually every game (up until this season) and scores loads of goals is fat ... Oh&quot; - Nick Cotter. &quot;Re: Nicholas Einhorn&apos;s comments (yesterday&apos;s Fiver letters) about Hleb being uncomfortable in Birmingham because of trophy allergy. So that&apos;s why he left Barcelona as soon as they won the Treble?&quot; - Saurav Samaddar. &quot;Mis-placed corrective pedantry from Stuart Kirwin (yesterday&apos;s Fiver letters), I&apos;m afraid. Eileen Margerum (Monday&apos;s Fiver letters) informed us that &apos;George S Needham&apos;s middle initial was actually C&apos;, not middle name as Stuart suggests&quot; - Mark Robinson. &quot;So, after his glaring &apos;name v initial&apos; gaff in yesterday&apos;s letters, can we declare Stuart Kirwan the first ever official loser of a Fiver pedantry battle?

INSULT OF THE DAY R.E.S.P.E.C.T. code of conduct for coaches, as backed by Lord Ferg in 2008: No1: I will show respect to others involved in the game including match officials. No4: I will always respect the match officials&apos; decisions. No6: I will never engage in public criticism of the match officials. 19 April: Lord Ferg, currently serving a touchline ban for publicly criticising a referee, on match official Lee Probert&apos;s decision to hand Javier Hernandez a yellow card for diving against Newcastle: &quot;It was a clear penalty. [The referee has] let himself down by booking the player. If it&apos;s not a penalty, fine, but to book him is an insult. There is definitely contact, no doubt about that.&quot; BITS AND BOBS Police have warned high-profile Queen&apos;s Celtic fans to watch out for suspect packages after four incendiary bombs capable of causing &quot;real harm&quot; were sent to Neil Lennon and two other prominent supporters of the club. Financial fair play enforcer Michel Platini has apologised that the cheapest Wembley Big Cup final ticket costs \u00a3150 plus \u00a336 administration fee, while the cheapest package for one adult and a child costs \u00a3338. &quot;It was a mistake, it was not good. But it is not easy to decide the price of the tickets,&quot; whimpered the president of Uefa. Michael Owen has hit back at Newcastle fans who booed him during Manchester United&apos;s draw last night. &quot;If they knew the facts, then they may have a different opinion,&quot; said the striker, presumably not referring to the facts that he cost \u00a316m and \u00a3103,000-a-week in wages but scored just 30 times in four knack-plagued years before jumping ship as soon as the club was relegated. Sunderland striker Fraizer Campbell has been ruled out of the bulk of next season after undergoing surgery for cruciate ligament knack. And 25-year-old Schalke keeper Manuel Neuer is almost certainly on his way to Bayern Munich after a tearful confirmation he&apos;s leaving the club. &quot;After 20 years of loyalty, I want to keep my options open for a change,&quot; he cheered. STILL WANT MORE? Penalty decisions are generally not controversial enough, reckons Paul Doyle, so let&apos;s give referees more leeway in deciding whether to point to the spot after fouls in - and outside - the box. Perhaps &apos;Arry Redknapp should mind his own business, rather than calling for Stoke&apos;s game against Manchester City to be moved, suggests Paul Wilson. If Arsenal&apos;s self-sustaining business model is represented by directors earning a fortune from a club who are putting up ticket prices by 6.5% at the stadium with the most expensive tickets in the world, Proper Journalist David Conn wants no part of it.

This particular force of nature appears to be so strong that it can deliver the most successful of men into the arms of, among others, Jennifer Thompson, the 21-year-old who entrapped Wayne Rooney last year. When the crux of the theory hinges on the current generation improving on the last then I suppose occasionally even nature is flawed. So, here we are, another week and another player falls foul of a kiss\u2011and\u2011tell story. &quot;Thank goodness for the super injunction,&quot; says Player\u00a0X. But do we even care? Do you get to the end of a tabloid story along those lines and think: &quot;I really enjoyed reading that&quot;? Probably not, I&apos;d guess. If Charles Darwin were still around, perhaps he could also offer us a clue as to what drives our insatiable appetite for celebrity gossip. I haven&apos;t played at a club which hasn&apos;t had a player caught out by his wife or girlfriend. Nor have I met a Wag\u00a0\u2013 a term which, incidentally, nobody in football uses \u2013 who knows that the life she enjoys, which is provided by her husband, would be waiting for her elsewhere should she choose to leave\u00a0him. I know wives that have walked in on a player in full swing, gone shopping, come home and had his dinner on the\u00a0table as if nothing had happened.\u00a0And I know plenty of wives who simply cannot do without a designer wardrobe, two weeks in Dubai and half of Tiffany&apos;s every Christmas and birthday, and so turn a blind eye to promiscuous behaviour.\u00a0This\u00a0amicable\u00a0agreement that dare not speak\u00a0its name only becomes a\u00a0problem\u00a0when the media get\u00a0hold of it. The point is that if a player&apos;s wife needs her man to maintain a certain lifestyle, then the general rule of thumb is that things are brushed under the carpet as quickly as possible, if indeed there ever was a genuine grievance to begin with. We can all name those that the last sentence applies to. The exception is when a wife no longer needs the player or she discovers the words self and respect and puts them together, as was the case with Cheryl\u00a0Cole. For my own part, I have no desire to inflict any of this torment on my wife and am happy to record that I am very content with my own situation. It should also be pointed out that I have seen things that would frighten me to death, were I tempted to think otherwise, including the antics of two team-mates who make a very good double act, and I&apos;m not talking about their partnership on the field. Always out together, they bring untold riches back to hotels and have what might be described, by some, as a very pleasant evening. I know this because another player filmed them and showed everyone. If ever I needed\u00a0another example of why it is not a good idea to mess around as a married man, it was presented to me on a screen three inches by four and in remarkable clarity. When one of the protagonists was confronted with it he laughed his head off. I would hate to see what scares\u00a0him. It&apos;s no great secret why footballers are so sought-after for a quick one between the sheets. They are seen as a trophy among certain girls, including some of the groupies that I see hanging around outside the training ground and try to avoid like the plague. Some women seem deluded enough to think they may end up happily ever after, while others appear happy with the idea that a one\u2011night stand with a footballer is a notch on their belt as well as the\u00a0player&apos;s. So what is in it for the married player? After all, the risk and reward are completely out of sync with each other \u2013 so much to lose for the sake of five minutes of lust. That&apos;s the theory. The reality is that many will get off on the idea that you can sit down with a stunning woman and she&apos;ll hang on your every word, laugh at the worst jokes as if you&apos;re a stand-up comedian and be impressed when the champagne\u00a0bottles\u00a0keep arriving. In short, a player can have his ego stroked relentlessly and get his leg over believing that nine times out of 10 he&apos;ll get away with it. I&apos;ve also started to think there is another possible reason for the scale of infidelity among footballers, other than the obvious absence of a moral compass, and that is that far too many players get married at a very young age. Lots of footballers have childhood\u00a0sweethearts\u00a0\u2013 best footballer\u00a0gets together with prettiest girl at the school syndrome \u2013 and have kids with them before they have had the chance to &quot;sow their oats&quot; or &quot;play the\u00a0field&quot;. Yet further down the road, when a player begins to earn the big bucks, that&apos;s when the temptations really start. I see a situation occasionally unfold where young players and their girlfriends arrive at the club, barely able\u00a0to hold a conversation with anyone else at first and untouched by the football lifestyle. Within a few years the kids are with a nanny, the wife is on the phone to the travel agents every five minutes and the player is in a hotel room licking Cristal off a \u2026 well, you get the idea. So what can we conclude from all of this? A couple of things: that my daughter will be told to stay away from footballers and that Darwin&apos;s prediction that &quot;light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history&quot; never took into account the super injunction.

Two politicians also resigned from parliament in a sign of growing unease at the government&apos;s use of lethal force. Nasser al-Hariri, a member of Syria&apos;s parliament from Deraa, told al-Jazeera Arabic TV: &quot;I can&apos;t protect my people when they get shot at so I resign from parliament.&quot; Minutes later a second politician, Khalil al-Rifae, also from Deraa, resigned live on the channel. The resignations \u2013 the first during this crisis \u2013 were a significant sign of unease at escalating violence. Security forces again opened fire at funerals for Friday&apos;s victims, where large crowds of mourners were chanting anti-government slogans. A witness in Izraa told the Observer that five people from nearby Dael and Nawa were shot dead at the entrance to the town . &quot;They were attempting to come to the funerals of 10 people killed on Friday,&quot; he said. He insisted the security forces and army were responsible. News agencies reported that at least two mourners had been shot dead by snipers in Douma, a suburb of Damascus, and three in the district of Barzeh. Human rights organisations and activists said at least 76 people and possibly more than 100 were killed during the largest and bloodiest protests yet on Friday, as the unrest continued into its eighth week. Many were shot in the head and chest, and mosques were used as hospitals. Al-Jazeera reported accounts of Syrian security officers entering hospitals and clinics to take the dead and injured to military hospitals in an apparent attempt to cover up casualty figures. Local human rights organisations claimed some Syrian Christians were among the dead. Christians, who make up around 10% of Syria&apos;s population of 22 million, are largely supportive of the regime due to fears of a backlash by the Sunni Muslim majority. The claims could not be independently verified. Easter celebrations, in which parades of children and families usually flood the streets of Damascus&apos;s old city, have been cancelled. It is unclear whether this was a decision by Christian leaders or if the government had put pressure on them in a bid to prevent large gatherings. With the death toll since 18 March now above 280, international condemnation of Syria has begun to grow. Barack Obama issued a strongly worded statement calling the violence &quot;outrageous&quot; and said that it should &quot;end now&quot;. As in other protests that have swept the Arab world, social media have been one of the powerful tools of protest, subverting official channels. Amateur video footage of bloody scenes continued to emerge from the protests. In one video, posted on YouTube, a man tells how security forces killed his son and left him to die. As the situation escalates, Syrian observers said the government had made it clear that it intended to cling to power with the use of violence, despite attempts at reform. &quot;They want to push demonstrators to the limits,&quot; said Ayman Abdel Nour, a Syrian dissident based in Dubai. He still believed that President Bashar al-Assad had time to show that he was serious about reform. But after Assad recently lifted the country&apos;s state of emergency, abolished the security court and appointed new governors in Latakia, Homs and Deraa, other commentators said he was running out of options. Protesters have responded with a new round of chants. &quot;We want the toppling of the regime,&quot; said a resident of Ezraa, a small southern town that saw one of the highest death tolls on Friday. &quot;The blood of our martyrs makes this our responsibility now.&quot; Activists acknowledged some concerns that protesters, who have been overwhelmingly peaceful so far, will be tempted to take up arms in self-defence. Syrians say weapons licences are hard to come by for non-Baath party members, but many people in the tribal southern region own guns. The regime still retains the loyalty of the military and leading businessmen as well as many among the country&apos;s minority communities. In the streets of central Damascus, many say they would rather stick with stability than take a risk on what would come if Assad&apos;s regime was to fall. Syria&apos;s government, which has continued to blame the deaths on armed gangs, expressed &quot;regret&quot; at Obama&apos;s sharp condemnation of Friday&apos;s violence. &quot;It isn&apos;t based on a comprehensive and objective view of that is happening,&quot; it said in a statement posted on the official Sana website. It added that Syria viewed Obama&apos;s comments as &quot;irresponsible&quot;. The statement came as al-Jazeera correspondent Cal Perry was ordered to leave the country, adding to an almost total blackout on independent and foreign media.

For another, the legacy of Chernobyl will be remembered for much, much longer than anyone would wish. According to estimates, this area of northern Ukraine will be uninhabitable for decades, if not centuries. We like to think of our architectural treasures as milestones of human progress.

In terms of scale, complexity and longevity, much of this stuff makes Dubai&apos;s Burj Khalifa look like a sandcastle. It is too early to know what will be\u00a0done about Fukushima. A 20km exclusion zone has been imposed and radiation levels will not be brought down to safe levels for at least another six months. Even at Chernobyl, the 1986 accident is by no means dealt with. Immediately afterwards, the Soviets hastily cobbled together the most effective structure they could to\u00a0contain further radioactive contamination. Unromantically named the Object Shelter, it was a concrete and steel sarcophagus resting on the remains of the ruined reactor. Owing to the high levels of radioactivity, it had been impossible to bolt or weld the Object Shelter together, so within a decade it was on the verge of collapse. Given that 95% of reactor four&apos;s nuclear materials are still inside, another nuclear disaster remains a possibility. Hence the current longer-term plan, called the New Safe Confinement. This \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.4bn) project calls for the erection of\u00a0an arch-shaped hangar, bigger than a\u00a0football pitch and high enough to fit the Statue of Liberty inside. Because of\u00a0the radiation levels, it must be built 500 metres away then slid over the top of the reactor and the Object Shelter. At 32,000 tonnes, it is just about the heaviest object ever moved. &quot;In some ways, this is how the engineers of the pyramids must have felt,&quot; says Eric Schmieman, chief technical adviser on the New Safe Confinement. &quot;The steel structure has\u00a0a design life of 100 years, so there are very rigorous requirements to demonstrate all the materials will last that long. The Eiffel Tower has been around that long but it&apos;s been protected from corrosion by painting. You can&apos;t repaint this because of the radiation.&quot; The structure of the New Safe Confinement is carbon steel, protected by inner and outer layers of stainless steel cladding. Its purpose is not to shield radioactive emissions but to prevent the release of radioactive dust\u00a0and other materials, and to keep out rainwater, which could carry contaminants into the water table. Work is currently proceeding on the foundations, and the arch will be assembled and slid into place by 2015. Then huge, remote-controlled cranes inside will dismantle the Object Shelter\u00a0and begin retrieving the hazardous materials inside. The structure will be visible from space, a hulking shell of steel in the midst of a landscape of industrial devastation. By the time it reaches the end of its 100-year life span, it is hoped that all the radioactive material will have been removed, but then comes the problem of where to put it. At the\u00a0beginning of the nuclear era, the emphasis was very much on the power\u00a0stations, including Basil Spence&apos;s heroic 1950s design for Trawsfynydd, in Snowdonia. But very little consideration was given to what came after. Those early power stations became obsolete: Trawsfynydd was decommissioned in 1991. What&apos;s more, the industry has so far generated nearly 300,000 tonnes of high-level nuclear waste, and counting. To be safe, it must be isolated from all living organisms for at least 100,000 years. Current opinion is that the best thing to do with nuclear waste is put it\u00a0underground in what is known as a\u00a0&quot;deep geological repository&quot;. At present, there are no such repositories in operation anywhere. In Britain, all the nuclear waste produced since the\u00a01940s is stored above ground in Sellafield. Preliminary moves have been made towards finding a site in Cumbria but there&apos;s a powerful local resistance to such schemes, and no long-term solution is expected before 2040. In the US, a site was earmarked decades ago at Nevada&apos;s Yucca Mountain, 100 miles from Las Vegas, but the Obama administration finally abandoned the scheme last year. Some countries are further ahead, though. Sweden&apos;s nuclear operation presents itself as a model for the rest of the world, and shows how much effort a fully joined-up operation requires. After cooling on site for a year, spent fuel from Sweden&apos;s three coastal nuclear sites is transported in purpose-built casks, on a specially designed ship, to a central interim storage facility. There, robotic arms transfer the fuel into storage cassettes underwater. These cassettes are then sent to another storage pool 25 metres beneath the facility to cool for at least another 30 years. Then the waste is moved to another plant to seal in copper canisters before it arrives at its final resting place in the geological repository. Sweden has numerous other nuclear facilities, including the \u00c4sp\u00f6 hard rock laboratory, an underground research laboratory open to visitors. Bizarrely, \u00c4sp\u00f6&apos;s surface buildings could be mistaken for a traditional farmstead: a collection of buildings in red and white timber. The folksy tweeness only points up how alien the rest of the nuclear landscape is. This is the heaviest of heavy industries, and it is often the least visible: a hidden parallel realm of\u00a0anonymous industrial facilities, restricted zones, clinical chambers and subterranean vaults. Sweden has identified a site for its deep geological repository, in Forsmark, but the Finns have been building theirs since 2004. Situated on the northwest coast, a few miles from its Olkiluoto nuclear power stations, it consists of a 5km-long tunnel spiralling 400m down to the bedrock, where a honeycomb of storage vaults fans out. Named Onkalo, whose literal translation is &quot;cavity&quot;, it was the subject of a documentary last year, Into Eternity. Retitled Nuclear Eternity and broadcast on More4 tomorrow, the film fully appreciates the Kubrickian visual aspects of the nuclear landscape and the staggering challenges the project presents to our notions of permanence, history \u2013 even time itself. Onkalo will be ready to take waste in 2020, and then will be finally sealed in 2120, after which it will not be opened for 100,000 years. By that time, Finland will probably have been through another ice age. Little trace of our current civilisation will remain. The prospect of designing anything to last even 200 years is unlikely for most architects; the Egyptian pyramids are &quot;only&quot; about 5,000 years old. Plan like an Egyptian  This longevity poses Onkalo&apos;s custodians, and others in their position, with another unprecedented design issue: what sign should you put on the door? As one expert says in Into Eternity, the message is simple: &quot;This is not an important place; it is a place of danger. Stay away from the site. Do not\u00a0disturb the site.&quot; But how to communicate with people so far in the\u00a0future? Put up a sign in a language they don&apos;t understand and they are sure to open it just to see what&apos;s inside. Ancient Egyptians on the pyramid planning committee probably grappled with the same issues. One of the Finns suggests using an image of Munch&apos;s The Scream; another suggests a series of monoliths with pictographs and an underground library explaining the tunnel; another wonders if it is better not to tell anyone Onkalo is there at all. When a team pondered the same issue in the US in the 1990s, they came up with proposals for environments that communicated threat and hostility. They imagined landscapes of giant, spiky, black thorns or menacing, jagged\u00a0earthworks, or vast concrete blocks creating narrow streets that lead\u00a0nowhere. If architecture is about designing spaces for human habitation, this is\u00a0practically its opposite. These subterranean cities are places no human will ever inhabit or see, places designed to repel life and light. They are a mirror image to our towering achievements above ground and, like the pyramids, they are both monument and tomb. Every nuclear nation is compelled to build them, at great effort and expense, and to continue building them until we find a better way to deal with nuclear waste or a better alternative to nuclear power. Until then, we must live with the thought that in some unimaginable future aeons hence, this could be all that remains to prove our species was ever here. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 April 2011, to correct the translation of the word onkalo. The original article gave its meaning as &quot;hiding place&quot;.

Nearly a decade after the extrajudicial prison camp opened, 172 of its 779 inmates are still marooned there and Obama \u2013 who faced 240 captives when he came to office \u2013 has admitted it&apos;s not likely to close any time soon. The leaked Guant\u00e1namo files offer an insight into why. According to the documents, those still held fall roughly into three groups: the bad, the unprosecutable and the homeless. Some were active terrorists but others merely fought for the Taliban when the US invaded Afghanistan after 9/11. The so-called &quot;worst of the worst&quot; are 40 inmates who have been or may yet be prosecuted. They include members of the &quot;Dirty 30&quot; alleged to have been Osama bin Laden&apos;s bodyguards, plus those claimed to belong to his inner circle. At their head is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, 51, whose scowling, battered-looking mugshot from his 2003 capture has become a familiar news staple. According to his 15-page prison dossier, &quot;KSM&quot;, who grew up in Kuwait, told a fellow plotter that the 11 September 2001 attacks had been his &quot;dream and life&apos;s work&quot;. He was repeatedly waterboarded in a CIA prison. Obama has had to abandon his idea of putting &quot;KSM&quot; and four others on trial in New York near the site of Ground Zero. They may face a military tribunal at Guant\u00e1namo instead. The five are locked up in Camp 7, a high-security cage. They are among 14 &quot;high-value detainees&quot; extracted from secret CIA prisons in 2006 and flown to Cuba. Two others in the group were also waterboarded, according to admissions. One was Muhammad al-Nashiri, listed as &quot;one of the highest-ranking, most skilled and dangerous al-Qaida operatives captured to date&quot;. The Saudi inmate is accused of more than a dozen terror plots, including attempts to blow up the British embassy in Yemen and UK warships at Gibraltar. His file says: &quot;He had personally chosen the UK military base in Gibraltar to be the target for the operation \u2026 He had seen a news documentary on the base and thought it was a good target.&quot; But Moroccan intelligence arrested a local team over the Gibraltar plot in 2002 and Nashiri was subsequently picked up in Dubai and turned over to the CIA for &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot;. In one of its more bizarre passages, his dossier says: &quot;Detainee is so dedicated to jihad that he reportedly received injections to promote impotence and recommended the injections to others so more time could be spent on the jihad.&quot;     Abu Zubaydah.    The third waterboarded &quot;high-value&quot; inmate is 40-year-old Palestinian Abu Zubaydah. His lawyer, Brent Mickum, says he &quot;was not, and never had been, a member of either the Taliban or al-Qaida. The CIA determined this after torturing him extensively&quot;. But his file claims he was in Bin Laden&apos;s inner circle, alleges he discussed a &quot;dirty bomb&quot; with a Briton, Binyam Mohamed, and provided false passports according to another Briton, Moazzam Begg. An assessment dated November 2008 says: &quot;Detainee has provided a wealth of information \u2026 [He] continues to be a valuable source of intelligence for operations still occurring today.&quot;     Maad al-Qahtani.    The second group of captives consists of 73 inmates whose future remains unresolved. More than half are &quot;too dangerous to transfer but not feasible for prosecution&quot; in the words of Daniel Fried, Obama&apos;s special envoy on closing Guant\u00e1namo. They include those who it is conceded have been tortured to such an extent they cannot be prosecuted under any fair legal process, such as Maad al-Qahtani, the would-be &quot;20th hijacker&quot; of 9/11. Early moves by the White House to transfer these detainees to a facility in the US while it figured out what to do with them foundered after the Senate voted down a budget for it amid rising public resistance to the idea of allowing potentially dangerous terrorists on to US soil. Finally there are 59 people who the US claims could be transferred if only other countries were willing to take them, and in some cases supervise them. The homeless include 27 Yemenis. Yemenis form the largest single group still imprisoned in Guant\u00e1namo and cannot return, according to Fried, &quot;because of the deteriorating security environment in that country&quot;. The US wanted transferred Yemenis to be &quot;detoxed&quot; at a Saudi-run rehabilitation camp before being released into Yemeni custody, but Yemen&apos;s president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, objected. Another prisoner awaiting a home is Mahrar Rafat al-Quwari, a Palestinian, no longer assessed as high-risk. He fought with Bin Laden at Tora Bora and was accused of being &quot;non-compliant and sometimes hostile to the guard force&quot;. His alleged infractions included &quot;inciting a disturbance&quot;, hitting a guard with his elbow and stating &quot;all Americans are liars&quot;. In 2009 Switzerland was asked to accept him, but it is unclear whether it has agreed. The leaked files document increasingly desperate attempts to find inmates alternative homes, particularly 20 Uighurs \u2013 Chinese Muslims rounded up from a Taliban camp at Tora Bora in 2002. The White House has tried to bribe small countries into accepting them. It will not forcibly return the Uighurs to China \u2013 ironically, because of fears that they may be imprisoned or tortured. The US did manage to unload five on Albania, where they are claimed to have settled down well. According to documents: &quot;Three are currently trying to get funding to open up a halal pizza restaurant. All have had cooking classes and two are working at restaurants in Tirana.&quot; Other states have been reluctant to take any Uighurs for fear of Chinese anger. China has protested to every country that accepted any, and privately berated US diplomats for what one Chinese ambassador called a &quot;slap in the face&quot;. As a result, when the US in desperation offered some to Slovenia in 2009, the ambassador cabled home that the Slovenian prime minister had &quot;blanched&quot;.     Ahmed Mohammed Yaqub.    Some Uighurs eventually went to Switzerland and Bermuda. Only five remain in Guant\u00e1namo: four footsoldiers who have not been classed as a threat since 2005 and their alleged leader, Ahmed Mohammed Yaqub, who has been downgraded from his 2008 high-risk assessment. The five refuse to go to the only two tiny island havens on offer, Palau and the Maldives, where they say they have no cultural ties.

Adil Hadi al Jazairi Bin Hamlili, an Algerian citizen described as a &quot;facilitator, courier, kidnapper, and assassin for al-Qaida&quot;, was detained in Pakistan in 2003 and later sent to Guant\u00e1namo Bay. But according to Hamlili&apos;s Guant\u00e1namo &quot;assessment&quot; file, one of 759 individual dossiers obtained by the Guardian, US interrogators were convinced that he was simultaneously acting as an informer for British and Canadian intelligence. After his capture in June 2003 Hamlili was transferred to Bagram detention centre, north of Kabul, where he underwent numerous &quot;custodial interviews&quot; with CIA personnel. They found him &quot;to have withheld important information from the Canadian Secret Intelligence Service and British Secret Intelligence Service \u2026 and to be a threat to US and allied personnel in Afghanistan and Pakistan&quot;. The Guardian and the New York Times published a series of reports based on the leaked cache of documents which exposed the flimsy grounds on which many detainees were transferred to the camp and portrayed a system focused overwhelmingly on extracting intelligence from prisoners. A further series of reports based on the files reveal: \u2022 A single star informer at the base won his freedom by incriminating at least 123 other prisoners there. The US military source described Mohammed Basardah as an &quot;invaluable&quot; source who had shown &quot;exceptional co-operation&quot;, but lawyers for other inmates claim his evidence is unreliable. \u2022 US interrogators frequently clashed over the handling of detainees, with members of the Joint Task Force Guant\u00e1namo (JTF GTMO) in several cases overruling recommendations by the Criminal Investigative Task Force (CITF) that prisoners should be released. CITF investigators also disapproved of methods adopted by the JTF&apos;s military interrogators. \u2022 New light on how Osama bin Laden escaped from Tora Bora as American and British special forces closed in on his mountain refuge in December 2001, including intelligence claiming that a local Pakistani warlord provided fighters to guide him to safety in the north-east of Afghanistan. The Obama administration on Monday condemned the release of documents which it claimed had been &quot;obtained illegally by WikiLeaks&quot;. The Pentagon&apos;s press secretary, Geoff Morrell, said in many cases the documents, so-called Detainee Assessment Briefs, had been superseded by the decisions of a taskforce established by President Barack Obama in 2009. &quot;Any given DAB illegally obtained and released by WikiLeaks may or may not represent the current view of a given detainee,&quot; he said. According to the files, Hamlili told his American interrogators at Bagram that he had been running a carpet business from Peshawar, exporting as far afield as Dubai following the 9/11 attacks. But his CIA captors knew the Algerian had been an informant for MI6 and Canada&apos;s Secret Intelligence Service for over three years \u2013 and suspected he had been double-crossing handlers. According to US intelligence the two spy agencies recruited Hamlili as a &quot;humint&quot; \u2013 human intelligence \u2013 source in December 2000 &quot;because of his connections to members of various al-Qaida linked terrorist groups that operated in Afghanistan and Pakistan&quot;. The files do not specify what information Hamlili withheld. But they do contain intelligence reports, albeit flawed ones, that link the Algerian to three major terrorist attacks in Pakistan during this time. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-confessed architect of the 9/11 attacks, told interrogators an &quot;Abu Adil&quot; \u2013 an alias allegedly used by Hamlili \u2013 had orchestrated the March 2002 grenade attack on a Protestant church in Islamabad&apos;s diplomatic enclave that killed five people, including a US diplomat and his daughter. He said Abu Adil was also responsible for an attack that killed three girls in a rural Punjabi church the following December, and that he had given him 300,000 rupees (about $3,540) to fund the attacks. The church attacks have previously been blamed on Lashkar I Jhangvi, a Pakistani sectarian outfit that has developed ties with al-Qaida in recent years. Separately, US intelligence reports said that Hamlili was &quot;possibly involved&quot; in a bombing outside Karachi&apos;s Sheraton hotel in May 2002 that killed 11 French submarine engineers and two Pakistanis. But the intelligence against the 35-year-old Algerian, who was sent home last January, appears deeply flawed, like many of the accusations in the Guant\u00e1namo files. Some of the information may have been obtained through torture. US officials waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times at a CIA &quot;black site&quot; in Thailand during his first month of captivity. And little evidence is presented to link Hamlili to the Karachi hotel bombing, other than that he ran a carpet business \u2013 the same cover that was used by the alleged assassins to escape. What is clear, however, is that Hamlili was a decades-long veteran of the violent jihadi underground that extends from northern Pakistan and Afghanistan into north Africa. From the Algerian town of Oran, he left with his father in 1986, at the age of 11, to join the fight against Soviet forces in Afghanistan. Later he fell into extremist &quot;takfir&quot; groups, recruited militants to fight in the Algerian civil war, and gained a reputation for violence. Under the Taliban the Algerian worked as a translator for the foreign ministry and later for the Taliban intelligence services, shuttling between Pakistan and Afghanistan in the runup to 9/11. Last January Hamlili and another inmate, Hasan Zemiri, were transferred to Algerian government custody. It was not clear whether they would be freed or made to stand trial. Clive Stafford Smith, whose legal charity, Reprieve, represents many current and former inmates, said the files revealed the &quot;sheer bureaucratic incompetence&quot; of the US military&apos;s intelligence gathering. &quot;When you gather intelligence in such an unintelligent way; if for example you sweep people up who you know are innocent, and it is in these documents; and then mistreat them horribly, you are not going to get reliable intelligence. You are going to make yourself a lot of enemies.&quot; The Guant\u00e1namo files are one of a series of secret US government databases allegedly leaked by US intelligence analyst Bradley Manning to WikiLeaks.

For most businesses, the price of water remains relatively inconsequential compared to other operating costs. The real value of water for business is tied to intangibles such as brand, reputation, license to operate, business continuity and as a driver for innovation. But there is another aspect of the value of water for business \u2013 arguably the most important aspect \u2013 that is tied to the social dimension of water. Currently, some 1.1 billion people lack access to clean water, and more than 2.5 billion people lack access to safe sanitation. The implications of these statistics for a steepening scarcity curve are staggering, particularly as demand for water increases globally in many major sectors \u2013 industrial, agricultural and domestic. The business implications are similar to the implications for society: increased competition for water and a workforce that lacks access to a basic resource. Based on innovative ideas presented at the second annual Hult International Business School Global Case Challenge a few weeks ago, solutions can be identified to help solve the water scarcity issue. The competition is focused on addressing the global clean water crisis in partnership with Water.org, an organisation founded by Gary White, Matt Damon, and The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI). In competitions held in Boston, San Francisco, London, Dubai, and Shanghai, the international competition crowd-sourced innovative ideas from some of the world&apos;s top students. Deloitte participated as a judge. The Hult Global Case Challenge, as a CGI member, has committed to working with fellow CGI members to solve one of the world&apos;s most pressing resource issues. The winners of each regional competition will compete in the global final in New York City on April 30, 2011, co-hosted by the CGI. At the final event, the participating teams will present their refined solutions to a panel of executive judges. Water.org will receive a USD $1 million donation from Hult International Business School, which can be used to help see the winning team&apos;s solution implemented. The Hult competition draws attention to the alarming and indefensible lack of access to clean water and sanitation among many populations. It is driven by a global business school competition. It recognises social issues can no longer be divorced from economic and environmental issues. (The cornerstone of sustainability is the integration of economic, social and environmental risks and opportunities.) Based upon the passion, creativity and commitment of the students participating in the Hult Global Case Challenge, we are confident of identifying new pathways to solving the water scarcity challenge.

Fasten your seatbelt and put on your iron-clad boots. Soon commotions will be heard.&quot; According to the Tehran-based Javan Online \u2013 a publication close to the Revolutionary Guards \u2013 this statement was made by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&apos;s senior adviser and confidant, Esfandiyar Rahim Meshai, days before the forced resignation of Iran&apos;s intelligence minister, Heydar Moslehi, on 17 April. Moslehi resigned after a major dispute with Meshai and Ahmadinejad over who should head the intelligence ministry&apos;s bureau of planning and budget. Until now, there is nothing extraordinary about this story, because when it comes to firing ministers, no president can beat Ahmadinejad&apos;s record in post-revolution Iran. Ministers have been fired before, such as former intelligence minister Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei. Others, such as the former foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, were not only fired but humiliated by being dismissed while visiting a foreign country. In fact, Mottaki heard the news of his dismissal from his Senegalese hosts who were informed before he was. When it comes to saying &quot;You&apos;re fired&quot;, Ahmadinejad would make Donald Trump and Alan Sugar, the hosts of The Apprentice, look like novices. But what sets the dismissal of the current intelligence minister apart is the reaction of Iran&apos;s most powerful man, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei. Much to the shock and surprise of many Iran observers, and quite possibly the president himself, after staying quiet for seven years and not mentioning a word about Ahmadinejad&apos;s dismissals in public, Khamenei has suddenly and publicly put his foot down, like never before. He did this not only by reinstating Moslehi to his job but by coming out and chastising Ahmadinejad&apos;s decision because he felt &quot;expediency is being ignored&quot;. Even more surprisingly, Khamenei also stated that: &quot;I won&apos;t allow, as long as I&apos;m alive, an iota of deviation of this massive movement of the nation.&quot; But why now? Where has Khamenei been all these years? What is so special about Moslehi that has brought him to utter such a strong condemnation? How come he didn&apos;t say anything when Ali Larijani was forced to resign in November 2007? Larijani is infinitely closer to Khamenei than Moslehi. &quot;Loose lips sink ships&quot; was the famous British slogan during the second world war. UK citizens were told to be careful about what they said, because the enemy might be listening. Ayatollah Khamenei has the same concern. He did not reinstate Moslehi only because he was becoming concerned about his and Ahmadinejad&apos;s growing power \u2013 which, as far as some people in Iran&apos;s leadership are concerned, is getting out of hand. What seems to have concerned Iran&apos;s leader is the manipulation of intelligence material by Meshai and Ahmadinejad and his rivals for their own political benefit. Although this has probably happened before, Khamenei seems to have realised that it is going too far. And he has a point. There is much political scoring going on in Iran with the use of what different sides claim to be intelligence-related material. One recent example is when a text message was sent to thousands of recipients from the treasury. According to the government, this happened because the system was hacked. However, according to the Persian-language Rooz online publication, which is based in Belgium, the text message stated that Meshai had installed listening devices in the office of the supreme leader. It also had stated that Meshai had travelled to Dubai the previous month as part of a trade delegation, where he met US officials. These are serious allegations. It is not only those who are against Ahmadinejad and Meshai who have used such methods in their favour. Ahmadinejad has done the same. During the 2009 presidential debates with Mir Hossein Mousavi, live on air, and in front of millions of Iranians, he threatened to show evidence against him. These were believed to be photos taken secretly of Mousavi&apos;s wife without her hijab. This infuriated Mousavi. In fact it is believed to be one of the reasons why he has dug in his heels against Ahmadinejad ever since. By reinstating Moslehi, the Iranian supreme leader has now declared that the ministry of intelligence is out of bounds, both for the president and those who oppose him. This sounds logical, especially because Ahmadinejad is such a controversial figure and has many enemies inside the regime. Ahmadinejad has taken the reprimand very badly. On Wednesday he cancelled a trip to the city of Qom. He also refused to attend a government meeting where the newly reinstated Moslehi was present. In my opinion, for the first time since becoming president, the prospect of Ahmadinejad&apos;s resignation must be considered. Although at this point it&apos;s a small possibility, nevertheless it is one that never existed until now, and cannot be ignored. The reason is related to Ahmadinejad&apos;s own personality. He is not good at taking &quot;no&quot; for an answer. He is now sulking, and according to reports has set three conditions for his return: the removal of Moslehi, the removal of Saeed Jalili as Iran&apos;s chief nuclear negotiator and the reinstatement of Meshai as Ahmadinejad&apos;s first deputy. The Iranian president has sulked before. But this time it is very serious. If he doesn&apos;t get his way he will either be left with no option but to resign, or to continue with the knowledge that this affair will have put an end to Meshai&apos;s chances of running for president.

Never mind the game \u2013 after all, few people do mind the games at Getafe and week 24 was to prove a desperate 0-0 until it was settled with a last-minute penalty after a devious dive from Gio Dos Santos \u2013 this was the moment they&apos;d been waiting for: the arrival of La Liga&apos;s latest star. Nineteen minutes in, he appeared in the directors&apos; box, forcing people from their seats and heading along the row like a late-arrival at the cinema, popcorn spilling across innocent laps, easing into the best seat in the house. Front row centre. Now the show could begin. Cameras were trained upon him, notebooks drawn from pockets like guns from holsters. By Ali&apos;s standards it was early: two weeks earlier he had turned up to Zaragoza in the 88th minute. And as far as the game was concerned, let&apos;s face it, he was over an hour early. Nothing was happening \u2013 even Racing&apos;s coach called it a &quot;0-0 all the way&quot;. But here he was, dark glasses and entourage, all dressed in black, plus a bit of bling, making quite an entrance. At half-time, he shook hands, waved and posed for photos, before heading inside for the finger buffet. There were autographs to be signed, too. And when Racing scored, he lifted his arms into the air, fists clenched. It was not the kind of thing you expect from the consciously controlled environment of the palco, Spain&apos;s almost mythical directors&apos; box, where there is an almost pathological and entirely false obsession with &quot;respect&quot;, and where &quot;extravagant&quot; normally refers only to the size of the cigar and the amount of oil combed through the hair. Yet by Ali&apos;s standards it was relatively restrained, a bit of a letdown to all those who&apos;d gone to Getafe to see him perform: the week before, his first as official owner, Racing defeated Sevilla 3-2 in the last minute and he leapt out of his seat, hopping up and down and cheering, punching the air and giving high-fives, waving his Racing scarf and going bonkers, while Sevilla president Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda del Nido sat and stewed in silence. Sure, there were grumbles, but most people thought it was funny \u2013 not least because of the deliciousness of seeing Del Nido, a man who likes nothing more than to puff up his chest and buff up his bald patch, squirm. Some suggested he should moderate his behaviour. But, as the president of Cantabria, Miguel-Angel Revilla, said, mostly it was funny. Ali was &quot;a maniac&quot;. As a fan but not officially the president he was not, strictly speaking, bound by protocol. Besides, he had bought the club, he could do whatever he felt like. Bought the club? No. Saved it. Racing had to pay the tax authorities and were in debt. Not a huge debt by Spanish football standards, at around \u20ac14m (\u00a312.5m), but they needed a solution; he had bought them out, investing almost \u20ac3.5m. The local edition of the sports newspaper AS splashed its cover with a huge: &quot;Ali the saviour!&quot; Racing were 16th and in trouble when he took over. He sacked Miguel-Angel Portugal and brought in Marcelino, the coach who miraculously took them to the Uefa Cup in 2007. They had beaten Sevilla and Getafe and drawn 2-2 with Villarreal, climbing as high as 12th. That was just the start. Racing were going to be big. Ali&apos;s initial cautious discourse soon gave way to something much more dramatic. He talked about a third power, ready to challenge Madrid and Barcelona. An Indian who flies around in a plane with his name on the side, he was going to spend big. They even let him off the heinous crime of not eating ham, giggling indulgently as they noted how this billionaire eats hamburgers and nothing else. The reason was simple: &quot;That Hindu bloke has his pockets full of cash,&quot; a beaming Revilla said. Only it seems he didn&apos;t. Or if he did, he wasn&apos;t ready to dip his hands into them again. That was back in February. A month and a half later, the club say the money has dried up \u2013 and so have the results. The same newspaper that called him Ali the saviour is now asking if he is in fact Ali Baba. Revilla says he&apos;s not sure he trusts him. The accusations that were made about him in England when he tried to buy Blackburn Rovers, accusations that pointed at unpaid council tax, have now been noted. However lawyers representing Western Gulf Advisory-AG insist: &quot;There is no basis for the suggestion that Mr Ali had a questionable track record in business and a &apos;colourful financial history&apos;,&quot; and say the allegations are &quot;false and misleading&quot;. What is beyond dispute is that Racing are struggling. The coach, brought in by Pern\u00eda not Ali, admits that the team are suffering the consequences; the players have spoken out against him, albeit quietly. Rather than a shed-load of money, they say he has left a trail of broken promises and embarrassing excuses. Now, he&apos;s nowhere to be seen. He doesn&apos;t even have anyone running the club for him: Racing have the same president and same staff they always did \u2013 only now their power is limited. With every passing day, the mask slips. The players joke that the first time they saw Ali he was impeccably dressed, complete with cravat and carefully cultivated creases; the second, a little less so; and the third, even worse. &quot;The day he turns up here in Pull &amp; Bear,&quot; they say, &quot;we&apos;re really screwed.&quot; They&apos;re pretty screwed already. When Ali took over at Racing, he paid \u20ac1.4m to Spain&apos;s tax authorities, an amount that needs to be stumped up every other month until more than \u20ac13m is repaid. \u20ac1.5m went on owning the club, roughly \u20ac750,000 each to the local government and the majority shareholder. \u20ac450,000 went to paying staff and players for February. \u20ac350,000 was paid to Credit Suisse for overseeing the purchase. In total, he is estimated to have spent \u20ac3.5m on the operation. And every time he comes to watch Racing play, flying in on his private jet, it costs him somewhere in the region of \u20ac70,000. So he has certainly put money in to the club, saving them from legal intervention. Ali also has an astonishing run: in the seven games he has attended Racing have largely got good results \u2013 beating Sevilla, Espanyol, and Getafe and drawing with Villarreal. But they say it&apos;s what he hasn&apos;t paid that worries them now, the promises: the \u20ac50m he talked about for transfers and the next instalment for the taxman. This month, Racing&apos;s long-standing director general, saying he was unable to get hold of the owner and still less his cash, had to seek a loan elsewhere to satisfy the \u20ac1.4m debt. And then there are the players. Racing&apos;s squad have had their monthly allowance, but the actual salary \u2013 paid in a single chunk after the season \u2013 is a different matter. Despite a guarantee that means the Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol Profesional protects the payments, players are fearful. After all, they are still waiting for last year&apos;s. Last season, 11 players were owed a total of \u20ac1.7m by Racing; the figures were small, seven of them in the region of little more than \u20ac40,000, but still there is concern. Not least because of which players are affected. Eleven players with a commitment to the club, players such as Gonzalo Colsa, Pedro Munitis and Pedro Pinillos, who were persuaded to hang fire and wait by Pern\u00eda; players who bit their tongue, who did not denounce the situation. When Ali Sayed took over, they were told the wait was over. The cheque is in the post.  It seems it wasn&apos;t. They say the first promise came at the club&apos;s training ground: the 11 men were told that the payment had been made and would be in their banks any day now. The second was made at Cornell\u00e1. Ali came down to the dressing room and admitted that he hadn&apos;t made the first payment but he would. The third came an hour and a half before Racing played Levante. Munitis and Pinillos were called up to Pern\u00eda&apos;s office and told that the money would be with them soon. Ali Syed was not there but, with devastating cheek, he offered a bonus if they beat Levante \u2013 Racing&apos;s players simply laughed at what seemed like the shamelessness of it. By the fourth, Pern\u00eda even showed them the &quot;bank slips&quot;. The money never arrived. In the meantime, the coach who was burned by broken promises and financial mismanagement at Real Zaragoza, fears a repeat. He and his players are looking for a way out. No one can understand what&apos;s going on. It doesn&apos;t make sense. Ali has put money in, after all, and has at least kept the administrators at bay in the short term. But what of the long term? And even if he does pay now, the damage is done. Racing don&apos;t need a sugar daddy, but they do need a daddy: like everyone, they want an owner who is serious and rich, like everyone else, but in that order \u2013 a serious attitude matters more than serious cash. What, people are asking, is behind this? What&apos;s really going on? Could the political situation in Bahrain be a cause? What&apos;s really going on? What&apos;s going on is that results are getting worse. This weekend, Racing faced fellow relegation-strugglers M\u00e1laga. It was the game one newspaper called a &quot;battle of the magnates&quot;, another called &quot;the clash of the sheiks&quot;. But as M\u00e1laga&apos;s CEO bluntly put it: &quot;\u20ac50m has been ploughed into this club; others can&apos;t say the same.&quot; &quot;The losers will pay a heavy price,&quot; Marca said before the game. Racing&apos;s fans would settle for the losers paying, full stop. Racing lost 2-1, Julio Baptista again showing his huge value to M\u00e1laga \u2013 the kind of value that Racing&apos;s fans can only dream of. His goal and another great performance leaves Racing in trouble, on the pitch as well as off it. Although the run-in favours them \u2013 they face sides who should have nothing to play for \u2013 they have now lost four of their past seven and they are now only two points off the relegation zone again, down in 16th. No better than they were when the saviour arrived. Not that Ali noticed. He had promised to travel to the game, to be with his team. Pern\u00eda says he called him at 1.45 to tell him that, actually, he was staying in Paris instead. Back in Getafe in February, everyone was wondering when Ali would turn up. Now they&apos;re wondering if he&apos;ll turn up. Talking points \u2022 Talking points on Madrid and Barcelona? What, like there&apos;s not enough of them everywhere anyway? They both won. Next. \u2022 Erm \u2026 \u2022 All right, all right, Madrid won brilliantly and Barcelona won poorly. And Madrid won brilliantly with what is effectively their B team now \u2013 only two players started who had done so against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final. And still they beat Valencia 6-3, having raced into a 5-0 lead. They may just have the most ridiculously good squad ever. Higua\u00edn got a hat-trick and Kak\u00e1 scored twice, one of them a real beauty. &quot;The guard of honour [we gave them at the start of the game] lasted an hour,&quot; Unai Emery moaned. &quot;We have ridiculed ourselves.&quot; \u2022 As for Barcelona \u2026 Osasuna&apos;s coach, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mendil\u00edbar, complained that his side were left &quot;looking like idiots&quot; after Barcelona scored twice from only two shots on target. Leo Messi got the second \u2013 his 50th, yes, 50th, of the season \u2013 while David Villa opened the scoring with his first goal in 12 games. It came barely 20 minutes after Fernando Torres had scored for Chelsea. Good news for Vicente del Bosque at last after a week Spain&apos;s players had largely spent kicking the bejesus out of each other. \u2022 Sergio Ramos says: &quot;Now, there are even complaints over decisions that are right.&quot; Now? \u2022 They may not always be technically perfect, but you&apos;ve got to admit that Basque derbies are fun. Real Sociedad played the better football, but Athletic Bilbao won the first game between these two sides at San Mam\u00e9s in four years. El Pa\u00eds called it a &quot;splendid struggle in the cathedral&quot;, which made it sound a bit like \u2026 erm, like quite a good game. Which it was in a feisty sort of way. And speaking of feisty: Iker Muniain, balls of steel. \u2022 Adi\u00f3s Almer\u00eda. This time for sure. Hello again Mallorca. This time for sure. They have racked up the 42 points that allowed Michael Laudrup to say that he will at last sleep easy. \u2022 A huge banner at the Molin\u00f3n declared Manolo Preciado&apos;s pain the supporters&apos; pain too. Life just keeps on smacking Preciado in the face; and Preciado just keeps on keeping on. Preciado, who lost his wife through cancer and his son in an accident in which he crashed into a wall on his motorbike, has now lost his father in a car accident. His Sporting Gij\u00f3n side beat Espanyol 1-0 to virtually secure First Division football for another season with 41 points. &quot;That&apos;s for the old man,&quot; Preciado said. \u2022 What do we want? Independent ballboys! When do we want it? Now! Sevilla-Villarreal: a brilliant game. But one after which everybody is talking about just one thing \u2013 cheating ballboys who, taking a leaf from Zaragoza&apos;s book of late, took to throwing the ball on the pitch to break up Villarreal attacks. It&apos;s not the first time that Sevilla&apos;s ballboys \u2013 or indeed a number of team&apos;s ballboys \u2013 have taken to playing a part in matches, speeding up and slowing down depending on the result. Or even going missing when told to by Machiavellian master Cristobal Soria \u2013 Sevilla&apos;s ever-so-lightly sneaky match day delegate. There&apos;s only one solution: sack them all and get non-club ballboys in as well, Mind you, they&apos;ll only get accused of bias. \u2022 Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, they&apos;re free at last!

The sport once again faces a serious crisis of confidence thanks to the Grand National fallout, corruption scandals in the offing and warfare over prize money, with courses ranged on one side and trainers, jockeys and owners on the other. As the next putative wonder horse, the odds-on Guineas favourite Frankel will carry an awful lot of expectations, as well as bets including one of \u00a3500,000, when he races down the Rowley Mile this weekend. Horserace ratings experts Timeform are in little doubt that trainer Henry Cecil has a potential superstar on his experienced hands. &quot;Frankel has the potential to develop into one of the greats of the sport and is in the right hands to do so,&quot; say Timeform in their newly published Racehorses of 2010 annual. But they also suggest that the horse&apos;s tendency to fight his rider, again in evidence when he ran at Newbury last week, casts serious doubts over his stamina for the Derby, for which he is also clear favourite. In Timeform&apos;s view, he will turn out to be an outstanding champion at a mile and could establish himself as the best Cecil has trained. The Timeform annual rates Frankel 133p, one of the highest ratings given to a two-year-old in Timeform&apos;s history. The colt, though, is going to have to be every bit as good as many in the sport are hoping if he is to cope with older milers of the calibre of Goldikova (133) and Canford Cliffs (131), if and when he meets them towards the end of the racing campaign. It is widely recognised that jumps racing is in a golden age, but a glance at Timeform&apos;s historical ratings suggests the last two years are true for the Flat, certainly as far as their Horse of the Year is concerned. Harbinger in 2010 and Sea The Stars 12 months earlier were given figures of 140, ratings reserved for greats such as Dubai Millennium (2000), Dancing Brave (1986) and Shergar (1981) in the last 29 years. And, with every expectation that Frankel can reach those heights too, 2011 could be another vintage season. The emergence of racing champions is an issue the sport has placed at the top of its agenda but Timeform are unconvinced that Racing for Change&apos;s major initiative, the new British Champions&apos; Day at Ascot in October, is at the right time or has a winning format. &quot;St Leger day [in September], three weeks before the Arc, is the ideal time in the international calendar and the meeting could circulate around some of the country&apos;s top tracks, both Ascot and Doncaster, for example, being big enough,&quot; according to Timeform, who also suggest opening up the St Leger to older horses and staging it as part of the Champions&apos; Day programme. There are plenty of other subjects chewed over in the 1,500 pages covering the A to Z of the 14,000 runners that competed on Britain and Ireland&apos;s tracks last season, while Timeform also give recommendations of bets in the major races and horses to follow. With the weekend in mind, Timeform make a strong case for Havant in Sunday&apos;s 1,000 Guineas. While accepting that her breeding has led many to believe the mile-and-a-half of the Oaks will suit her more, they argue that she &quot;has a good turn of foot and is likely to have the speed for the 1,000 Guineas.&quot; The large &apos;P&apos; horses - those which Timeform consider are capable of much improved form - are invariably ones to note and two to catch the eye are Oaks propsect Morning Charm (93P) and Derby dark horse Sea Moon (92P).

We&apos;ve been here before. Masdar is the latest in a long line of brave new worlds that appear to promise the earth and then in practice deliver rather less. Remember Dongtan? That vast eco-metropolis that was supposed to rise up from the marshlands outside Shanghai? Nearly a decade on, the marshes still lie empty, the project mired in local politics. Or think of the huge hopes invested in Britain&apos;s new towns after the war; or the tower blocks that were going to sweep away the slums with bright, airy living. Grand designs often go awry. But talk of Masdar as a failure is premature. Sure, the ambition may have been scaled down \u2013 along with virtually every other project under the sun in these cash-crunched times. And some of the more fanciful features \u2013 such as the magnetic pilotless cars \u2013 have been dropped in favour of a more banal approach. But this is still a scheme with some scale. If there are no more cutbacks, by 2021 Masdar will be a desert city of 40,000 powered entirely by renewables. It will have proved that it&apos;s possible to slash water consumption \u2013 arguably even more important than cutting energy \u2013 and eliminate waste almost entirely. All of which is no mean achievement in a region whose main urban claim to fame \u2013 Dubai \u2013 is the living epitome of an unsustainable future. By then, Masdar shouldn&apos;t be alone. On China&apos;s Pacific coast, the Tianjin eco-city development is promising green living powered by solar and geothermal, with nine out of 10 journeys to be made by foot, bike or public transport. But if we see these new developments as a model for the green cities of the future, it will be us who have failed, even if they&apos;ve been a (qualified) success. Why? Because by 2040, two-thirds of the world&apos;s population will be living in urban areas, and all but a tiny fraction of these will be in today&apos;s vast conglomerations. So the green city of the future already has a name: it&apos;s called Mumbai or London, New York or Lagos. And if we can&apos;t transform our existing urban areas into something approaching sustainability, then we are, frankly, stuffed. These don&apos;t have the luxury of starting from scratch \u2013 let alone doing so with a budget funded by years of oil revenue. But there is a huge amount that can be done. A lot of this consists of boring old efficiency techniques, from lagging lofts to reusing greywater. These can save far more resources than can ever be generated by covering roofs in solar PV \u2013 sensible though that is. But there could be shiny new tech too \u2013 for example, laser-guided &quot;shoals&quot; of driverless travel pods, running on a fraction of the power used by today&apos;s electric vehicles, could replace the noisy chaos of traffic jammed streets. In this context, the real value of Masdar is as a showcaseand laboratory for the innovations that will help shape our urban future: from radical new public transit systems to smart mini-grids. But some of the most innovative changes will be in attitudes and behaviour, rather than gizmos. Forum for the Future&apos;s report Megacities on the Move highlights the need for radical shifts in ideas of ownership \u2013 of cars, for example. Already, schemes like Whipcar \u2013 which allow members to borrow neighbours&apos; cars as and when needed \u2013 are emerging. But why drive at all, if everything you need is in walking or cycling distance? Rather than building endless Masdars, we could reconfigure existing cities around local hubs, avoiding the need for constant crosstown traffic. Community-owned energy and food schemes could go a long way towards meeting local needs too. In Britain, the Transition Towns movement \u2013 about as far away from oil-rich dream metropolises as you can get \u2013 is buzzing with ideas like these. The challenge may be enormous, but so are the possibilities. So let&apos;s enjoy the sci-fi sparkle of Masdar by all means. But be prepared to get down and dirty to transform the mean streets of our home towns too.", "title": "Masdar is just a showcase \u2013 existing cities must forge their own green future | Martin Wright", "sentences": ["All of which is no mean achievement in a region whose main urban claim to fame \u2013 Dubai \u2013 is the living epitome of an unsustainable future."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-29T10:30:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/29/hayley-turner-small-talk", "tags": ["Hayley Turner", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "So, Hayley. You&apos;re involved in this Paddy Power Future of Racing project. Have you actually ridden with any of this lycra gear on? No, not yet. But in the near future, maybe. If you look at cycling, and the way people are streamlined and don&apos;t have things flapping around, I think racing silks are a bit old school. But some of it is a bit bonkers, isn&apos;t it? This idea of wearing a helmet which shows you your speed as you ride? Well some of it might be further into the future than the rest but some of the ideas could be integrated now. It&apos;s what&apos;s good for the public really. If you can get an app on your phone where you can almost be in the race, view the race from any angle you like, maybe from a camera on the jump ahead, that would make the audience feel more involved. What about the idea of changing colour depending upon where you finish in a race with fibre-optics in the riding clothes? It would make it easier to follow, wouldn&apos;t it? They&apos;re on about changing the betting to decimals and things like that, but racing needs to be more fun as well. You live in Newmarket, where most of the town seems to work in racing. Do you have any non-racing mates? Yeah, loads. My family aren&apos;t from racing. But I&apos;ve taken my sisters there and they&apos;ve enjoyed it. They come to the Shergar Cup with me, with the international jockeys. You have a nice Monday evening meeting at Windsor, the sun&apos;s shining on your back, there&apos;s a band playing, you can have a drink and a bet, and watch the horses. It&apos;s a unique experience. People should really go and give it a try. Time for the good stuff. Chocolate or cheese? Chocolate. I&apos;m a jockey and I have to watch my weight, but I just prefer it sweeter. Do you have a favourite bar? Oh\u2026 Err\u2026 A favourite chocolate bar, I mean. Oh\u2026 [laughs]. I thought you were\u2026 A Dime bar. Those mini-Dimes are nice. I feel like one now, now I&apos;m talking about them. What have you been up to today? Have you been riding work? No, I&apos;ve actually had a morning off, which is unusual for the time of year. Most mornings I am riding work, getting the horses going at the start of the new season. What do jockeys do on a morning off? Lounge around the house? Basically, yeah. Catch up on a few jobs, spend some time on the computer, catch up on some sleep, walk the dog. That sort of thing. I thought everyone in racing had to get up at 5am every day, every week? I&apos;m riding out for trainers in Lambourn sometimes, so to get there from Newmarket means you&apos;re setting off really early, but I do get nearly every Sunday and Monday mornings off which is really useful, especially if you&apos;re riding at the evening meetings. Is it hard to keep your fitness and your diet going properly when you&apos;re working such odd hours? Big time. It&apos;s really difficult, because you can&apos;t get into a routine with breakfast and dinner at set times. You don&apos;t know where you&apos;re going to be all week, so even if you go to the shop and buy a load of food, if you&apos;re working away it just goes off and goes to waste. You just have to be quite strict on yourself. They provide food at the races, but again that&apos;s only just getting out of the old school times, after we had to nag them about what they were serving \u2013 we had to say instead of having chips or chicken nuggets we need something healthier to pick at. When do you get the chance to let your hair down? I went to South Africa for 10 days at the end of last year and although I was riding, because it was to take part in a jockeys&apos; challenge, that was a bit of a holiday as well. It was brilliant. And then I called in on Dubai on the way home to see friends and I went skiing at Christmas too, so I&apos;ve had my full worth of holidays. What was the last film you went to see? I saw a chick flick last month called No Strings Attached. It was all right. There was a few of us and there was a guy with us and he didn&apos;t mind it. What do you listen to in the car when you&apos;re doing all this travelling? I&apos;m into all hip-hop and R&amp;B, and I&apos;ve got a lot of that on my iPod. I&apos;ve got Akon \u2026 who else have I got? I&apos;ve just downloaded a load this morning. Luckily for me I like any music. If you&apos;re travelling with [Irish flat jockey] Jimmy Quinn, he&apos;ll put Magic FM on, if you&apos;re going with one of the younger jockeys, you can put your Usher CD on. I&apos;m versatile, as long as it&apos;s not Classical or anything boring. How many miles do you clock up each year? About 50,000 normally. Personally, I think I&apos;m a damn good driver. I&apos;d love to be on Top Gear. It sounds stupid but I think it&apos;s the same as when you&apos;re riding and you can see things happening before they happen \u2013 you&apos;re always reading what&apos;s going on around you. Thinking ahead. Jockeys do so many miles, but very rarely do they get in any trouble on the roads. (Later on the day of this interview, Hayley was involved in an accident on a slip-road leaving the motorway heading to the races. She texted Small Talk to stress that it wasn&apos;t her fault, but added &quot;that will teach me \u2013 LOL&quot;.) Who would win a fight between a lion and a tiger? [Pause]. A lion. Why? I think they&apos;re bigger and stronger. But maybe if they were running, a tiger, so I don&apos;t know now. What do you think? So the tiger&apos;s best bet is to turn it into a sprint competition? If I was the tiger, I&apos;d get my skates on. I think that&apos;s the only way forward. If Small Talk were to dip its hand into its pocket and buy you a drink, what would he be buying you? [Confidently] Vodka, lime and soda. That didn&apos;t take a lot of thinking about. If you were somewhere nice, I might have a nice white wine. But when you&apos;re down the pub\u2026 You&apos;ve got to be careful what wine you&apos;re drinking in what pubs. You don&apos;t really know what&apos;s coming out of the tap, do you? I&apos;m allergic to beer, which is a shame. This is indeed a tragedy. How did you find out? Was there an awful incident in your teens that taught you this? [Laughs] No, I&apos;ve got this thing called coeliac disease. Beer&apos;s got yeast in it so I can&apos;t drink it, which is a bit of a blessing for my weight probably. Getting wheat-free sandwiches isn&apos;t easy, but the bread that doesn&apos;t have wheat in it tastes awful anyway, so I tend to go without. What would you put into Room 101? Hmm, that&apos;s a good one. [Pause]. Never see again. There&apos;s probably one or two people I&apos;d like to put in there but I can&apos;t tell you. Other jockeys? I can&apos;t tell you. Sorry. What are your targets for the season ahead? I&apos;d obviously like to win the Derby, but more realistically just to ride as many winners as possible. I rode 100 last year and I&apos;m well on course to do the same, as long as people keep giving me rides. You were The face of the Derby a couple of years ago, weren&apos;t you? I was but only because I was injured and, to be honest, I was in a bit of a strop about not being allowed to ride, so I probably didn&apos;t enjoy it all as much as I should have done. Good luck for the rest of the year.

The conditional jockey was riding the Rachel Hobbs-trained 100-30 favourite Monty&apos;s Moon in the novices&apos; handicap hurdle and appeared to have the prize sewn up when racing into a clear lead after the final flight. But he eased down when passing the marker that denotes the chase and hurdle course and he was passed by both Some Catch and Miller&apos;s Dawn in the final strides, being beaten a neck and three-quarters of a length into third. The on-course stewards noted this was Carberry&apos;s second such offence within the space of 12 months and therefore referred the matter to the British Horseracing Authority. PA 3.25pm: Frankel gallops 2,000 Guineas rivals into the ground Frankel, the 1-2 favourite trained by Henry Cecil and ridden by Tom Queally, won the Qipco 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, from Dubawi Gold (33-1) and Native Khan (16-1). Cecil said in the winner&apos;s enclosure that in the final furlong &quot;Frankel was looking for all the other horses. He was waiting for them. It is a relief. It has gone right and he&apos;s a very, very good horse&quot;. The colt produced a barely believable performance as he made every yard of the running. An unbeaten juvenile campaign and a ready comeback victory in Newbury&apos;s Greenham Stakes led to the son of Galileo being sent off at 1-2 for the season&apos;s first Classic. Rerouted was due to be deployed in a pacemaking role, but he just could not keep up as Frankel quickly opened up a huge advantage over the rest of the field. He was miles clear at the halfway stage and it seemed he would not be able to keep up such a ferocious gallop. But the rest could not get near him and he passed the post with a stunning six lengths in hand. Dubawi Gold filled the runner-up spot, with Native Khan a further half-length away in third. It was a third 2,000 Guineas triumph for Cecil following the successes of Bolkonski (1975) and Wollow (1976). PA 2.15pm: Haggas downbeat about Fury Chris Cook: William Haggas trained Green Destiny to win the opening nine-furlong handicap here at Newmarket, which some may see as a positive for the chances of his Fury in today&apos;s Guineas. But Haggas said: &quot;I think he&apos;ll struggle today, personally, because I haven&apos;t had a smooth run with him. &quot;He&apos;s useful [but] I haven&apos;t worked him on grass at all. We&apos;ve been trying to get him fit and he had a setback five weeks ago, which meant I couldn&apos;t run him in a trial, which is really what I wanted to do, we wanted to run him in the Free Handicap and we couldn&apos;t do that, so we&apos;ve been up against it a bit.&quot; Haggas said the setback involved a foot injury and the horse is fine now but the trainer is clearly afraid that this race will come too soon. 1.40pm: Queally fit and ready to go Chris Cook: Tom Queally, Frankel&apos;s jockey, has just arrived at Newmarket and been passed fit by the racecourse doctor. He was stood down after taking two of his three rides at Leicester yesterday, which he attributed to the after-effects of a cold, but now descibes himself as being well again after &quot;a good night&apos;s sleep&quot;. He rode out this morning and appears cheerful and relaxed, denying any nervousness about the big race. Market movers: 1pm  Chris Cook: Hullo from Newmarket, where an excited crowd is lining the Rowley Mile racecourse, having camped out for days in the hope of catching a glimpse of the mighty Frankel, who is credited with bringing a &quot;feelgood&quot; quality back to the country. He will shortly be married up with Tom Queally and it is the most fervent wish of everyone here that this will not end with some kind of horrible separation. The crowds are being greeted by some horsey statues, painted in styles suggested by the names of past Guineas winners. You can see several Sea The Starses and a Cockney Rebel here as well as the very real Monsignor, the dual Cheltenham Festival winner who is here to have his nose patted. Such treatment will be not be welcomed by the bookmakers, who advise me of the following market movers. In the opener at 2pm, there has been money for Sandor (10-1 from 14s with one firm), Breakhart (15-2 from 11-1), Viva Vettori (16s from 20s), Beaumont&apos;s Party (14s from 16s) and Green Destiny (5-1 from 6-1). Presumably, some other horses have been pushed out but I have no note as to which. Dandino is the one everyone wants to back in the Jockey Club Stakes at 2.30pm and is 9-4 from 5-2. There has been some nibbling for Casamento (12-1 from 14s) and Roderic O&apos;Connor (8-1 from 9-1) but Native Khan has been pushed out to 20-1 from 16s by one firm. Astrophysical Jet is 3-1 from 4-1 in the Palace House, while Jonny Mudball is 12-1 from 16s. Coeus from Sir Mark Prescott&apos;s yard is 9-2 from 11-2 in the six-furlong handicap at 4.20pm. Good luck to everyone having a bet today. I&apos;ve had a few quid on Saamidd at 40-1 on Betfair, which just seems too big. He&apos;s being ruled out on the basis of one bad run in the Dewhurst, but Saeed bin Suroor says he wasn&apos;t right at the time and in any case he didn&apos;t seem suited by the good to soft going. Today&apos;s faster surface seems more his thing and he is supposedly well now. Today&apos;s TV races Casamento looks the most sensible play in today&apos;s Qipco 2,000 Guineas, a race featuring a betting market starved of activity by the dominance of one horse. Frankel&apos;s obvious talents ought to light up this year&apos;s race, but his hold over the betting is total and even at a best price of 4-7, he makes minimal appeal as a punting proposition, particularly from a draw in stall one that could potentially leave him isolated if the runners fan across the track from the central stalls position. Casamento (3.10) can be backed at 11-2 in the market in which the favourite is ignored, meaning that he will be settled as a winner even if he chases Frankel home and that is a bet that makes a great deal more appeal. Godolphin&apos;s recent record in the 2,000 Guineas is pretty dreadful. Since the victory of Island Sands back in 1999, Saeed bin Suroor has saddled 21 runners, of which only one has made the frame. But there is more than one trainer on the Godolphin team these days and Mahmood al-Zarooni, whose operation is run entirely separately from Suroor&apos;s, has started the season in better form than his team-mate, sending out a number of winners. Consequently, there is greater confidence that Casamento, whose high-class Irish form of last season was achieved for a different trainer, will be ready to do himself justice on his debut in the blue silks. Although the horse is reportedly seen as a Derby prospect, there&apos;s no finer way to stake your claim for Epsom than with a big run here. Newmarket 2.00 A big field, but few offering solid recent form. Indeed most of these runners look firmly in the grip of the handicapper. The exception is Green Destiny, who has obvious questions to answer on his seasonal debut, but has the scope for further improvement on just the fourth start of his career. Goodwood 2.15 It was not Philip Robinson&apos;s finest hour when Ferdoos went down by a short-head to Polly&apos;s Mark in a similar contest at Ascot last September, but the placings can be reversed with a different rider on board. She very much looks like the type of filly to improve again this season and pick up some decent prizes. Newmarket 2.30 Some interesting runners, but ultimately a weaker-than-average Group Two event and a repeat of Laaheb&apos;s recent fourth in the Sheema Classic at Meydan would suffice. The selection progressed throughout last season and may appreciate a change of tactics if Indian Days is determined to take the early lead. Goodwood 3.30 There were a few burnt fingers at Ripon a fortnight ago when Montparnasse was denied by Montaff on his debut for Kevin Ryan. But coming back to a mile and three-quarters looks a sensible move, as the horse&apos;s stamina has seemed to be stretched at longer trips. Newmarket 3.45 With the stalls on the stands side for this contest, high-drawn horses could hold the advantage and Prohibit may prove best positioned from stall 14. Rob Cowell&apos;s runner has been running as well as ever in Dubai in recent months, his latest sixth behind JJ The Jet Plane representing a level of form which many of these rivals would struggle to match. Horse sense Loving Spirit (3.10) has impressed since moving on to the grass for the first time last week and could offer some value in the markets without Frankel in today&apos;s Qipco 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket. James Toller might not have the same profile as Henry Cecil or Sir Michael Stoute, but he remains a trainer to respect and already has a Classic under his belt having sent out Bachelor Duke to win the Irish 2,000 Guineas in 2004. Loving Spirit worked on Wednesday under Robert Havlin, after which the jockey could barely contain his enthusiasm for the colt, and the experienced Scot has ridden enough good horses for John Gosden to know his geese from his swans. Frankel has done nothing but impress in his work since Newbury and will be very hard to beat. He did one short but sweet canter up Warren Hill yesterday, as Henry Cecil, who is starting to feel the pressure of expectation, looked on. Laaheb (2.30) was noted going well on the Watered Gallop this week and ought to take the beating in the Jockey Club Stakes, while Green Destiny (2.00) is ready to go close on his seasonal return in the opener. The improving Jonny Mudball (3.45) has been showing up particularly well for Tom Dascombe, but the best bet of the day could be Zain Shamardal (5.25) in the finale, especially now that Brian Meehan has finally found the winning touch again with a victory at Kempton on Wednesday. Connections were very disappointed when Zain Shamardal found one too good in an ordinary looking maiden on his final start last year, but his conqueror Splash Point went on to take the UAE 2,000 Guineas for Godolphin and the form of the selection&apos;s half-length defeat now looks an awful lot stronger. Seen and heard Red faces were narrowly avoided at Fairyhouse last Monday after late work from groundstaff before the start of the Irish Grand National meeting. The words &apos;Fuck the Queen&apos; had been burnt into the grass with weed killer near the winning post days earlier, but the damage only became apparent the night before. Staff spent the following morning covering up the offending areas with bags of cut grass. Junior minister for agriculture Shane McEntee, whose Meath East constituency includes the Fairyhouse course, said the action was &apos;just ridiculous&apos; and &apos;quite stupid in this day and age&apos;. &apos;We don&apos;t all have to bow to the Queen if you don&apos;t want to, but the visit is vital,&apos; he said. Security is set to be tight for the Queen&apos;s forthcoming trip when the Irish National Stud and Coolmore have been mooted as possible stopping points . Ryanair boss Michael O&apos;Leary promised to pay \u20ac100,000 to buy the winner of Fairyhouse&apos;s point-to-point bumper on Monday in order to promote the race. But there was never much chance that O&apos;Leary would get his hands on the stylish 13-length winner Simonsig. Multi-millionaire Scotsman Ronnie Bartlett, who heads the Albert Bartlett vegetable business, had only just bought the five-year-old for a sum rumoured to be close to O&apos;Leary&apos;s offer. O&apos;Leary produced another \u20ac 50 note to try and tip the balance, but \u2013 according to O&apos;Leary \u2013 Bartlett then merely pocketed the cash and walked away.", "title": "Talking Horses | Will Hayler", "sentences": ["Rob Cowell&apos;s runner has been running as well as ever in Dubai in recent months, his latest sixth behind JJ The Jet Plane representing a level of form which many of these rivals would struggle to match."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-30T11:33:54Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/may/01/frankie-dettori-1000-guineas-blue-bunting1", "tags": ["Frankie Dettori", "1,000 Guineas", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Godolphin ended a nine-year losing run in the Newmarket Classics stretching back to their last 31 runners with a surprise winner as Blue Bunting, a filly supposedly using the race as a trial for next month&apos;s Oaks, came with a withering run under Frankie Dettori to win the 1,000 Guineas. In discussions with Sheikh Mohammed before the race Dettori had agreed to ride the 16-1 chance in the hope that she might stay on from the rear to make the frame. But in the event Blue Bunting exceeded all expectations and will now head to Epsom as the deserved favourite. In an eventful contest, ran at a fierce gallop set early on by Hooray, the well-fancied Memory lost all chance when standing still as the stalls opened whereas the favourite Moonlight Cloud ran out of reserves having been at the head of affairs a furlong out. Together and Maqaasid looked to have the race between them coming out of the Dip, only for Blue Bunting to emerge from the pack along the stands&apos; rail, leading near the finish to beat Together by three-quarters of a length. &quot;The boss said to me, &apos;She&apos;s a staying type \u2013 just make her run well,&apos;&quot; said Dettori. &quot;There&apos;s a tremendous head-on wind so we agreed to sit &apos;mid div&apos; and just run on and try to be placed. &quot;A furlong out I thought I was going to get placed but the first two were hands on knees they were so tired. I haven&apos;t won a Classic for a while, especially here at Newmarket, my home town. It&apos;s a great feeling. She will definitely get the mile and a half at Epsom.&quot; The trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni paid tribute to Sheikh Mohammed after Blue Bunting gave him a first Classic success. &quot;To win a Classic in England isn&apos;t like anywhere else in the world. It&apos;s a different taste, especially in Newmarket,&quot; he said. &quot;It has all come about because of His Highness. We follow what he says because he has the experience. He knows the racing here.&quot; Al Zarooni was installed last year at Newmarket by Godolphin, to work as a second trainer alongside Saeed bin Suroor. Although the party line has always been that the two trainers have equal standing, the relative lack of runners and winners from Suroor&apos;s team this season forces the question as to whether the stables are utilising different tactical plans. Indeed Al Zarooni&apos;s excellent start to the season comes in stark contrast to the slow beginnings of recent years, this victory seeing him overtake Henry Cecil for third place in the trainers&apos; championship. While many of her stablemates enjoyed the winter warmth of Dubai, Blue Bunting remained in Newmarket, a notable change of Godolphin policy from previous years when, apart from the yearlings, the entire team moved to the Emirates at the end of each year. Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, played down the significance of the decision. &quot;She stayed behind because she had a small problem, a little chip in her ankle, otherwise she would have gone to Dubai,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t think that it makes any difference and the horses that come in from Dubai perform just as well as horses who have been here. &quot;We have won lots of early-season Classics over the years with horses straight off the plane from Dubai. I know a lot of people think they take a little dip when they get off the plane but I am not one of the people who believe that. &quot;White Moonstone, who had to miss this race, is still not right.

Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, hinted that the Pakistani state itself was complicit in sheltering the terrorist leader, saying Bin Laden had &quot;hidden himself in the military bases of Abbottabad&quot;. The killing has revived questions about alleged links between al-Qaida and elements in the country&apos;s security forces. Ironically, only 10 days ago Pakistan&apos;s army chief addressed cadets at that town&apos;s military academy \u2013 the equivalent of Sandhurst in the UK or West Point in the US \u2013 claiming the army had broken the back of militants linked to al-Qaida and the Taliban. Islamabad had long insisted that Bin Laden was not hiding in Pakistan but in neighbouring Afghanistan, but tensions with the US had mounted in recent months over cross-border drone attacks and the government&apos;s faltering efforts to tackle the Pakistani Taliban. Pervez Musharraf ,president of Pakistan from 2001 to 2008, described Bin Laden&apos;s death as a &quot;positive step&quot;, but criticised the US for launching the raid within his country&apos;s borders. Calling it a victory for the people of Pakistan, Musharraf said he also expected some short-term instability due to acts of revenge. &quot;It&apos;s a very positive step and it will have positive long-term implications,&quot; Musharraf told Reuters in Dubai, where he has a home. &quot;Today we won a battle, but the war against terror will continue.&quot; Musharraf said, however, that the operation infringed on Pakistan&apos;s sovereignty: &quot;It&apos;s a violation to have crossed Pakistan&apos;s borders.&quot; But suspicions of complicity will centre on the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistan&apos;s powerful security and spy agency, which is widely considered untrustworthy by its western partners. &quot;For some time there will be a lot of tension between Washington and Islamabad because Bin Laden seems to have been living here close to Islamabad,&quot; Imtiaz Gul, a Pakistani security analyst, told Reuters. &quot;Pakistan will have to do a lot of damage control. This is a serious blow to the credibility of Pakistan.&quot; In Kabul, Karzai seized on the news of Bin Laden&apos;s death to criticise the US-led coalition, complaining that it was focused on counter-insurgency operations in the Pashtun south of Afghanistan rather than Taliban safe havens over the border. &quot;Year after year, day after day, we have said the fighting against terrorism is not in the villages of Afghanistan, not among the poor people of Afghanistan,&quot; he said. &quot;The fight against terrorism is in safe havens. It proves that Afghanistan was right.&quot; Aminuddin Muzafary, secretary of the High Peace Council established by Karzai, said Bin Laden&apos;s death &quot;removed the curtain from Pakistan&apos;s face.&quot; He added: &quot;His death shows the unfaithfulness of Pakistan but it is also possible that it was a business deal between the CIA and the ISI. Time will reveal whether or not this was a deal or something else.&quot; The news was &quot;very worrying,&quot; said Abdullah Abdullah, Afghanistan&apos;s top opposition leader. &quot;Just a few weeks ago the Pakistanis were insisting that the US military and intelligence operations should be stopped in Pakistan and their agents should leave the country.&quot; Afghanistan&apos;s intelligence service has long believed that their Pakistani counterparts were harbouring Bin Laden. Last year, shortly after he was sacked by Karzai, Amrullah Saleh, the former head of the National Directorate of Security, claimed the ISI knew exactly where the al-Qaida leader was hiding. Saleh told the Guardian that the Pakistani state deliberately kept Bin Laden safe so that the west would ignore its nuclear programme. He said: &quot;They built their nuclear bomb under the very watchful eyes of the west. How did they escape from that danger? By creating another crisis for you. If I make an analogy \u2013 you have a pain in your finger and pain in your kidney, which one [do] you go [for] first? They created a kidney pain for United States through Bin Laden and Taliban so you give up talking about the pain from the nuclear bomb.&quot; Elements within the ISI have long been accused of sympathy for militant Islamism and of aiding the Taliban in Afghanistan and insurgents in Kashmir as part of their regional rivalry with India. The Indian home ministry issued a statement expressing &quot;concern that terrorists belonging to different organisations find sanctuary in Pakistan&quot;. In London the Pakistani high commissioner, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, insisted that Islamabad had no idea of Bin Laden&apos;s whereabouts until the US operation. &quot;Nobody knew that Osama bin Laden was there \u2013 no security agency, no Pakistani authorities knew about it,&quot; Hasan told BBC Radio 5 Live. &quot;The fact is that the Americans knew it and they carried out the operation themselves and they killed Osama bin Laden and then later our president of Pakistan was informed that the operation was successful, and that&apos;s it.&quot; But the chairman of parliament&apos;s foreign affairs committee Richard Ottaway said: &quot;Unfortunately, I am not sure that the government of Pakistan speaks for the whole of Pakistan. It is a divided country with lots of tribal loyalties, and there are clearly internal divisions within Pakistan&apos;s security services.", "title": "Death of Osama bin Laden puts pressure on Pakistan", "sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s a very positive step and it will have positive long-term implications,&quot; Musharraf told Reuters in Dubai, where he has a home."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-02T16:33:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/02/sea-burial-osama-bin-laden", "tags": ["Osama bin Laden", "Islam", "Religion", "Al-Qaida", "World news"], "article": "Osama bin Laden&apos;s burial at sea was quickly criticised by Muslim scholars who claimed it had breached sharia law and warned that it may provoke calls for revenge attacks against US targets. Others used the sea burial question to question whether he was dead at all, with doubts fuelled by the absence of authentic photographs of his corpse. US officials said tests using DNA from several of Bin Laden&apos;s family members had provided &quot;virtual certainty&quot; that it was his body. A woman believed to be one of Bin Laden&apos;s wives identified the al-Qaida leader, and he was visually identified by members of the US raiding party, the Pentagon said. Burying him on land could have led to his grave becoming a focus of contention and pilgrimage as well as posing tough questions about where he should be laid to rest. &quot;Finding a country willing to accept the remains of the world&apos;s most wanted terrorist would have been difficult,&quot; a US official said. &quot;So the US decided to bury him at sea.&quot; The burial reportedly took place from the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson in the North Arabian sea. Senior US officials told news agencies that his body was disposed of in accordance with Islamic tradition, which involves ritual washing, shrouding and burial within 24 hours. The 24-hour rule has not always been applied in the past. For example, the bodies of Uday and Qusay Hussein \u2013 sons of the Iraqi dictator Saddam \u2013 were embalmed and held for 11 days after they were killed by US forces. Their bodies were later shown to media, provoking some angry responses. It remains unclear if the US will release photos of Bin Laden&apos;s remains, but dispelling any doubts that he is dead is likely to be a major impetus \u2013 particularly in an age when conspiracy theories can be powerfully manipulated on the web. In a hint that such a release may be on the cards, John Brennan, Barack Obama&apos;s counter-terrorism adviser said: &quot;We are going to do everything we can to make sure that nobody has any basis to try to deny that we got Osama bin Laden.&quot; He added that the US will &quot;share what we can because we want to make sure that not only the American people but the world understand exactly what happened.&quot; Brad Sagarin, a psychologist at Northern Illinois University who studies persuasion, said the rapid disposal of the body &quot;would certainly be a rich sort of kernel for somebody to grasp on to if they were motivated to disbelieve this.&quot; Citing the example of those who refuse to believe that Barack Obama is a US citizen, he added: &quot;As with the birther conspiracy, there&apos;s going to be a set of people who are never going to be convinced. People filter the information they receive through their current attitudes, their current perspectives.&quot; Already, doubt is spreading in Pakistan. Many people do not want to believe that Bin Laden is really dead, even though an al-Qaida spokesman, in vowing vengeance against America, called him a martyr, offering no challenge to the US account of his death. In the immediate aftermath, people in Abbottabad expressed widespread disbelief that Bin Laden had died or ever lived among them. &quot;I&apos;m not ready to buy Bin Laden was here,&quot; said Haris Rasheed, 22, who works in a fast food restaurant. &quot;How come no one knew he was here and why did they bury him so quickly? This is all fake, a drama, and a crude one.&quot; Kamal Khan, 25, who is unemployed, said the official story &quot;looks fishy&quot;. In terms of the basic requirements for Muslim burials, standard practice involves placing the body in a grave with the head pointed toward the holy city of Mecca. Burial at sea is rare in Islam, though Muslim websites say it is permitted in certain circumstances. One is during a long voyage where the body may decompose and pose a health hazard to a ship&apos;s passengers, an exception noted on Monday by Tunisian scholar Ahmed al-Gharbi. Another is if there is a risk of enemies digging up a and grave and exhuming or mutilating the body. Dr Saud al-Fanisan, former dean of the faculty of sharia law in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, said that if a body was buried at sea it should be protected from fish. In the words of alislam.org, the body should be lowered into the water &quot;in a vessel of clay or with a weight tied to its feet&quot;. Mohammed al-Qubaisi, Dubai&apos;s grand mufti, said of Bin Laden&apos;s burial: &quot;They can say they buried him at sea, but they cannot say they did it according to Islam. Sea burials are permissible for Muslims in extraordinary circumstances.

The body of Bin Laden should have been handed over to his family to look for a country to bury him.&quot; The radical Lebanon-based cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed said: &quot;The Americans want to humiliate Muslims through this burial, and I don&apos;t think this is in the interest of the US administration.&quot; The Egyptian analyst and lawyer Montasser el-Zayat said Bin Laden&apos;s sea burial was designed to prevent his grave from becoming a shrine.

That planning process will begin next week with a two-day meeting in the Midlands involving Flower, his Australian bowling coach, David Saker, and the England managing director, Hugh Morris, at which they will review the team&apos;s winter of two halves \u2013 Ashes triumph followed by World Cup disappointment \u2013 and look ahead to the 2013 Ashes series and beyond. Andrew Strauss&apos;s future as the one-day captain, which has been the subject of speculation since England&apos;s early World Cup exit, will inevitably be one of the subjects under discussion. So will the workload on coaches as well as players, although there is not understood to be any firm agreement in Flower&apos;s new deal over future touring commitments from which he may be released, contrary to recent suggestions. The England and Wales Cricket Board was also keen to stress that Flower&apos;s improved deal does not involve any fundamental change to the arrangement under which he has previously been employed \u2013 as a permanent member of staff rather than for a set contracted period of two or three years. That is a contrast with Saker, whose new three-year contract was announced during the fifth Test win in Sydney with which England secured the Ashes in January. Flower&apos;s bargaining position was strengthened considerably both by England&apos;s success in Australia and when he was widely touted as a possible successor to Gary Kirsten when he stepped down as India&apos;s coach after their World Cup triumph. The announcement last week that the former England coach Duncan Fletcher would instead succeed Kirsten removed any doubt that Flower would be staying \u2013 but on his own terms. The 43-year-old Zimbabwean had already set the team fresh goals of climbing to the top of the ICC&apos;s world Test rankings and improving their standing in one-day cricket. They were sixth in the Test rankings when he took over in unenviable circumstances in early 2009 after Kevin Pietersen had in effect driven out Peter Moores, Flower&apos;s predecessor as coach who initially brought him into the England set-up as batting coach. But they have now climbed to third, in addition to winning the ICC World Twenty20 this time last year, and Flower said: &quot;I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to build on the considerable progress we have made to date as a squad and remain fully committed to developing the side and ensuring we are in a position to realise our objective of becoming the No1 side in the world.&quot;When I was appointed England team director in 2009 I stated that I wanted to create a winning England team and I am very pleased with the advances we have made as a squad over the last two years in all formats of the game. Regaining the Ashes in 2009 and retaining them last winter and the 2010 World Twenty20 title are obvious highlights, but there is still plenty more we want to achieve in the longer term. &quot;We have made no secret of our determination to become the No1 side in the world and challenge for global titles and I feel we have been making steady progress. I firmly believe we have the talent among the playing squad and management team to help us realise our ambitions and am looking forward to testing ourselves against quality opposition this summer and beyond.&quot; After home series against Sri Lanka and India this summer, England have a less gruelling winter schedule than the one they have endured. After a few one-day games in India in October, they have a two-month window until Christmas, although they then have away Test series in Pakistan (likely to be played in Abu Dhabi and Dubai) and Sri Lanka early in 2012. Other decisions to be made concern the rest of Flower&apos;s support staff. Richard Halsall, the fielding coach who was put in temporary charge when Flower had his health scare during the first Test of the Ashes series in Brisbane, will remain a key figure, while Graham Gooch and Mushtaq Ahmed were the other high-profile coaches used in Australia. &quot;It&apos;s great news,&quot; said the England spin bowler, Graeme Swann. &quot;From an English perspective he&apos;s the greatest coach in the world and we&apos;re more than happy to see him put pen-to-paper again,&quot; he told Sky Sports. &quot;He has formed an excellent partnership with Strauss, which is important.

Meanwhile, some activists expressed concerns that protests could fizzle out as Syrians, who have braved security services&apos; gunfire, fear becoming one of thousands being rounded up. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said hundreds had been charged with &quot;maligning the prestige of the state&quot;, which carries a three-year sentence. &quot;I would rather be killed than be locked up and tortured,&quot; said one young man in the capital, echoing many others. &quot;We know what happens to people inside.&quot; Amnesty International, which has not been allowed access to Syria, on Tuesday revealed details of detainees who said they were beaten with batons and cables and subjected to harsh conditions.

It was not merely what he won. It was how he played. He made birdies from locations where anyone else would have been content with a bogey; he would hit great shots and bad shots, not only in the same round, but on the same hole. This mercurial trait was also part of his personality. He was a complex character \u2013 charming and manipulative, gregarious and withdrawn, open and suspicious, generous and mean. The sparkling eyes and infectious smile enchanted everyone he came into contact with. On the other hand, as observed by his first biographer, Dudley Doust, his mind could be a &quot;private forest, a place impenetrable, indeed dangerous to others&quot;. The first occasion I spent any length of time with Seve was in Dubai in February 1990, as part of a team shooting a short-game instruction video. The first thing we noticed was that we&apos;d got the timing wrong. Because he&apos;d not been on tour for a few months, Seve&apos;s English was horribly rusty (as his BBC commentary work would later emphasise). The second thing was his sense of competitiveness. He demonstrated to me the &quot;parachute shot&quot;, which Phil Mickelson has since made routine. Seve placed my body and the club in the necessarily exaggerated positions and told me to have a go. My second effort finished six inches from the hole. He&apos;d not come that close himself. He took the club back and holed his next one. The extraordinary imagination, delicacy of touch and range of shots around the green that he possessed were legendary, a consequence of learning the fundamentals of the game with just one club, and that a three iron. &quot;He was a genius,&quot; said Tiger Woods on Seve&apos;s formal retirement from competitive golf in 2007, &quot;probably the most creative player who&apos;s ever played the game.&quot; One year, I was in Spain for a magazine photoshoot to feature this particular talent. At the time, Seve had a running joke with me based on the (false) assumption that I had only one jacket, a blue one. I was never sure whether he thought I was impecunious or had a one-colour fetish, but he turned up this day with a pure silk, olive-green Hugo Boss number. &quot;Here,&quot; he said, &quot;another colour for you.&quot; Boss was his sponsor, so I was sure he hadn&apos;t paid for it, but he didn&apos;t have to do this. I still have the jacket. I always will. Another year, I had dinner with him at the French Open. Seve was notoriously tight when it came to paying his caddies, but he insisted on dealing with this, even though he surely realised I could claim the cost on expenses. The proprietor then said it was on the house. It would not have happened the other way\u00a0around. I spent most time with Seve between 2000 and 2003, working on his autobiography, a project we not only failed to deliver once \u2013 we managed the trick again, to the chagrin of the publisher who had twice publicised its imminent arrival. This was the Seve it was preferable not to encounter, the man of whom one of his coaches, Mac O&apos;Grady, when explaining their split, said: &quot;I finally found someone more neurotic than me.&quot; Seve eventually published his book in 2007. More happily, the memories I chiefly retain are ones such as the meal in a restaurant in his home village of Pedre\u00f1a, where the geese we ate were the ones he had shot, and the football match we attended at Racing Santander. Seve wasn&apos;t cloistered in some executive box. He had a season ticket with the fans; amid his people. Seve was also at ease among the media, notably in this country. They loved his golf and his sense of mischief, and the fact he didn&apos;t duck a question. Why would he? He was fireproof, the best in the world, and he knew it. &quot;Controversy can be a good thing,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s boring if everyone thinks the same.&quot; The appreciation was reciprocated. At the Open in 1992, the week Nick Faldo thanked the press &quot;from the heart of my bottom&quot;, Seve expressed his gratitude to golf writers &quot;for making me more famous than I really am&quot;. The affection for Seve meant the press never delved into stories about his eager pursuit of women who were not his wife, which contributed to the divorce from the one who was, Carmen Bot\u00edn, mother of his three children. And the media was gentler with him than it would have been for any equivalent sporting figure when, in 2003, his behaviour at times was an unappealing mixture of the vainglorious and the quixotic as he upbraided tour officials if they dared to question his slow play and then accused the European Tour of being &quot;nearly like a Mafia&quot; \u2013 unfortunately, being in Italy when he said it. As always, you could see the grounds for his consternation. As often, he didn&apos;t help his cause by the way he conducted his grievance. From the clubhouse at Pedre\u00f1a, the golf course where, in the 1960s, a small boy named Severiano Ballesteros was introduced to the game he was to embellish so marvellously, you can see the house where he had lived since 1994. He was famous throughout the world, but within a thousand metres are the places where Seve&apos;s livelihood effectively started and where his life ended. His story endures.

In early February, the newspaper reported, at the Conservatives&apos; annual Black and White Party, a lavish London fundraiser from which journalists are barred, a selection of prestigious internships had been auctioned off to party donors. For between \u00a32,000 and \u00a34,000, wealthy Tory supporters were able to secure a week or a fortnight&apos;s work experience for their children, at employers ranging from City firms to Tatler magazine to the PR company Bell Pottinger. Since the Mail on Sunday story, internships \u2013 who gets them, whether they should be paid, whether they hinder social mobility \u2013 have become a significant British political issue: dividing the erstwhile Downing Street honeymooners Nick Clegg and David Cameron, and fascinating a media in which well-connected twentysomethings on work experience, sometimes frighteningly eager, sometimes staring out of the window, are increasingly ubiquitous. Yet strikingly, almost everyone involved in the controversy seems to agree on one thing: that a few days&apos; vaguely defined work as an intern is now a crucial early building block for a desirable, decades-long white-collar career. As Ross Perlin puts it in this timely and clear-sighted book, the first on the internship boom, &quot;In much of the developed world, the subtle, relentless pressure to do an internship is now simply part of being young.&quot; His preface offers an overview: &quot;Interns . . . shuttle coffee in a thousand newsrooms, Congressional offices and Hollywood studios . . . deliver aid in Afghanistan . . . build the human genome, deliver the weather report on TV . . . Internships have spread to virtually every industry and almost every country, while internship-related businesses and campus career offices also proliferate, hawking internships, organizing internship fairs.&quot; Perlin&apos;s energetic exploration of this world is mostly confined to America, with a few British detours, but the questions he asks are profound and wide-ranging. Why has there been such\u00a0an explosion of them? What exactly are the social implications of their &quot;curious blend of privilege and exploitation&quot;? And, most interestingly perhaps, what does the intern boom tell us about the modern workplace and modern capitalism? He begins at Disney World in Florida. Thirty years ago, faced with a local labour shortage that threatened to undermine its plans to expand the immense theme park, Disney contacted American universities to see if they would be happy to lend students as temporary workers. The universities, writes Perlin, &quot;were strongly supportive . . . stressing only that Disney should handle housing and provide some sort of classroom experience&quot;. Out of this usefully flexible arrangement \u2013 for the company at least \u2013 has grown one of the biggest internship programmes in the world: 8,000 students a year from America and abroad, working for stints of up to seven months as everything from costumed cartoon characters to monorail drivers. Disney does pay; but only &quot;near minimum wage&quot;, and interns work almost full time, &quot;without sick days or time off, without grievance procedures, without protection against harassment or unfair treatment&quot;. Disney interns are also required to live in gated company compounds, with the rent deducted from their pay. Perlin sneaks into one, and finds barrack-like apartment blocks where tired interns live two to a room and &quot;regular searches . . . are conducted&quot; by the company to root out anything that breaks the compound&apos;s many rules. Like the immigrant construction workers who live in similar camps in Dubai, the Disney interns, you realise, are really a permanent low-cost workforce. That the notoriously hard-nosed Disney company has such an attitude to interns may not come as a complete surprise, but Perlin quickly shifts his focus to employers you might imagine would be more enlightened. &quot;Recent cases of intern abuse in [reputedly liberal] Oregon,&quot; he writes, &quot;involved a solar panel company, an organic farm and an interior design firm.&quot; The American Cancer Society &quot;offers scores of unpaid internships . . . while paying its chief executive a salary of $1.2 million&quot;. In law, in politics, in entertainment conglomerates \u2013 in many of the most glamorous parts of the economy for ambitious young people \u2013 hungry, exploitable interns proliferate. One consequence has been to make possible the kind of multi-tasking careers now enjoyed by media celebrities. Perlin quotes John Stossel, a well-known rightwing American broadcaster: &quot;I&apos;ve employed interns my whole career. They&apos;ve done most of the research for my books and most of the research that won me Emmy Awards. I asked my TV bosses to pay for the research help, but they laughed at me, saying, &apos;You think we&apos;re made of money?&apos;&quot; This book is important because Perlin has spotted that the internship phenomenon is a symptom of broader changes in business and the psyche of the middle-class worker. The increasingly entrepreneurial mindset of young professionals, seeing themselves as brands that require investment, such as unpaid work, to get established; the assumption of most companies that, executive salaries aside, labour costs should be ruthlessly minimised; the vogue for things being given away or done for &quot;free&quot;, in business strategies and even political programmes such as Cameron&apos;s Big Society \u2013 all these trends may make the internship the quintessential modern workplace experience. Half a century ago it was very different. &quot;Almost no one worked for free in the offices of mid-century America,&quot; points out Perlin. Instead, there were paid apprenticeships and structured training programmes, sometimes oppressive and stifling compared to the open-ended experiences of the luckiest or most able of today&apos;s interns, but more egalitarian: parental financial support or personal connections were much less essential for the aspiring young professional. The supplanting of this system by internships started in late 19th-century medicine \u2013 would-be doctors were &quot;interned&quot; for a year or more within the walls of a hospital \u2013 then spread through the expanding bureaucracies of American government in the 30s, and into the private sector during the 50s and 60s. Perlin tells this story briskly, with a touch of the faintly fogeyish longing for older versions of America that has often characterised writing by young American leftists over the last 20 years. But he does concede that internships (he has done them himself) can be useful: &quot;Even if their exact content often remains murky, [they] signal a go-getter applicant, already fluent in office culture . . . internships are a &apos;test-drive&apos; for both the intern and the employer.&quot; With so much white-collar work changing so fast and unpredictably, thanks to digital technology, it can be argued that an on-call army of millions of keen, pragmatic, all-purpose office juniors is just what a modern economy needs. Yet the social costs are considerable. Besides the exploitation, boredom and cynicism that blight many internships \u2013 trying to look busy for days on end in return for a line on your CV \u2013 there is also their infantilising quality. Perlin interviews many serial interns: deep into their 20s, and already burdened with debts from university, they are still not earning, still without a solid career trajectory, still living with their parents, still only semi-adult. The steep rise in youth unemployment across the world since the financial crisis has made the job prospects of these perpetual interns even worse. Occasionally, Perlin&apos;s cataloguing of such hardships feels too conscientious. His quietly furious paragraphs become choked with multiple examples, and for all his hostility to the internship culture, the obsessive, workaholic American impulses that often drive it \u2013 when I was a student at Berkeley in the 90s, I remember peers routinely sending out 50 internship applications \u2013 seem at work here too. Meanwhile, the book does not say quite enough about those the internship game excludes: the young people who cannot afford, or do not have the confidence or the contacts or the parental backing, to take part. The growth of internships has almost certainly contributed to the narrowing class composition of many professions, not least newspaper journalism. However, as a portrait of how white-collar work is changing, this book is thought-provoking and at times jaw-dropping \u2013 almost a companion volume to Naomi Klein&apos;s celebrated 2000 expos\u00e9 of modern sweatshops, No Logo. Britain, Perlin warns, is &quot;about five years behind&quot; the United States in the development of its intern culture. This could be over-cautious: 10 days ago a survey of British companies by the pollsters YouGov found almost a fifth admitted to taking interns on as cheap labour. Eventually the boom may become a bubble and burst, as the sheer ubiquity of internships makes them yield diminishing returns, in CV terms, and shrewd would-be professionals find more effective ways to spend their early 20s. Or perhaps, as Clegg argues, the internship system can be reformed, to make it more inclusive, and more concrete in its rewards. But both these scenarios feel quite remote. The world this book anatomises, like so much of current office life, feels as if it will get a lot crueller before it gets kinder.

The colt, a narrow 9-4 favourite for the Dante at the best prices available on Monday evening, has also attracted money for the Derby and is top-priced at 8-1 for the Epsom Classic on 4 June. Jockeys who are apparently out of the running for the ride on Seville include Pat Smullen, the reigning Irish champion jockey, who is booked to ride at Gowran Park the same day, and Kieren Fallon, who steered O&apos;Brien&apos;s Recital to victory in the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial at Leopardstown on Sunday. Terry Norman, Fallon&apos;s agent, said on Monday that he had had no contact from O&apos;Brien over the mount on Seville.

The Dante Stakes is widely expected to determine the Derby favourite if it results in an impressive victory for Seville, Henry Cecil&apos;s World Domination or The Queen&apos;s colt Carlton House. This year&apos;s renewal looks so competitive, however, that the second- and third-placed horses could remain serious contenders for Epsom. Seville&apos;s rider on Thursday can expect to keep the ride in the Derby, just as O&apos;Brien seems confident that Fallon will ride Recital at Epsom, having booked him for Leopardstown with the Classic in mind. However, Ed Dunlop, who trains Native Khan, still seems certain that Fallon will ride his colt next month and it may be some time before it is clear where the loyalties of the finest Epsom jockey of his generation will prove to lie.

A US government watchdog finds highly-paid western contractors working in the Afghan Central Bank failed to raise the alarm even after they received death threats when they tried to audit Kabul Bank. The bank nearly collapsed last year after revelations that most of its money had been loaned to its politically powerful managers and shareholders and their associates to fund reckless investments and beachfront mansions in Dubai. With losses estimated at up to $850m in an economy with GDP of $12bn it has been likened to a pyramid scheme and described by western officials as &quot;the biggest per capita fraud in history&quot;. A report by the Office of Inspector General at the US Agency for International Development (USaid) reveals that the private consultants employed by the US government body repeatedly stumbled across &quot;red flags&quot; which they ignored. They include an incident in November 2008 when an expatriate adviser employed by BearingPoint, a company later bought by Deloitte, received two death threats after participating in a regular Central Bank inspection of the offices of Kabul Bank. The company responded by banning its consultants from taking part in any more inspections and &quot;limited its technical assistance to classroom training&quot;. The report said that, had inspections not been halted, &quot;the fraud could have been detected earlier, and the magnitude of losses would have been smaller&quot;. The following year, the consultants failed to report the &quot;incredulous&quot; response of Central Bank officials when the foreign advisers told them they, as regulators of Afghanistan&apos;s banking system, had the legal powers to remove the chief executive of Kabul Bank. On the contrary, &quot;he can remove us&quot;, the officials are reported to have said. In other incidents, the Central Bank governor raised &quot;serious concerns&quot; to Deloitte&apos;s lead adviser and consultants picked up rumours about the Dubai property investments, which were ignored. &quot;Because Deloitte staff did not follow up aggressively on indications of fraud at Kabul Bank, Deloitte and the mission lost opportunities to contain the problems at Kabul Bank,&quot; the report said. It said BearingPoint and Deloitte, which had staff working on the Central Bank project for seven years, felt unable to share information with the US government, which was paying them as part of a $92m contract for their work, in order to preserve their relationship with Central Bank staff. USaid, responding to the Inspector General&apos;s report, said: &quot;Deloitte could not have stopped the massive fraud that occurred in Kabul Bank.&quot; It said the criminal fraud was &quot;deliberately concealed&quot; by channelling illegal loans to individuals through fictitious companies.

At its LevelUp showcase in Dubai on Tuesday, the company announced that Soul Calibur V will tread the boards of destiny again next year, continuing the weapons-based fighting series famed for its mighty swords, sumptuous visuals and S&amp;M tinged outfits. Set 17 years after Soul Calibur IV, the game represents a generational shift for the series. Siegfried is 39 years old and no longer wields the eponymous Soul Calibur sword. The lineage of power has instead passed to Sophitia&apos;s son Patroklos, whose prominence in the new trailer suggests a leading role in the forthcoming brawler. In an unexpectedly phallic plot twist, however, the Soul Edge and Soul Calibur swords have been reduced in length to short swords. Apparently all will be revealed later. That, I&apos;m almost certain, is the first time a game&apos;s story has hinged on the varying lengths of a sharp instrument \u2014 let alone two sharp instruments.     Soul Calibur V    The key news is that the combat system is being overhauled to make it more reactive, while combos will be easier to access and perform. &quot;Soul Calibur IV was a little heavy and there was often a delay between the button press and the action, especially online,&quot; explains producer Hisaharu Tago. He refers to the new system as &quot;much lighter, sharper and more elegant&quot;. Tago would not reveal much more about the game at the demo event. He says there will be a mixture of favourite characters and newcomers and that we can possibly expect to see the children of other long-time cast members in the title (apparently, Patroklos&apos;s fighting style is a more agile version of Sophitia&apos;s so we can probably expect more of these inherited and adapted brawling styles). Personally, I&apos;m hoping for the lovechild of Ada and Voldo \u2013 although I wouldn&apos;t want to bump into this monstrous progeny in a dark alley. Elsewhere, Tago has confirmed that the &quot;create a character&quot; mode will return from the previous game, and that the online modes will be updated and expanded. In a Q&amp;A session at the end of his demo, there was even confirmation we can expect at least one surprise guest character, in the manner of Darth Vader and Yoda, appearing in IV. He also hinted that we may one day see a modern day setting for the series, which is currently set in a hazy 16th century timeframe. On a roll now, the producer, suggested that in the wake of the newly announced Tekken: Blood Vengeance animated movie, there&apos;s a chance we&apos;ll see a full-length Soul Calibur anime, possibly set in that 17-year gap between IV and V. There will be much more info \u2013 and hopefully some in-game footage \u2013 at E3 in June, but this is an intriguing direction for the series, which some felt lost its edge in the previous instalment. One thing is certain, the narrator&apos;s sense of sonorous melodrama is still very much intact.

The relatives of Amal Ahmed al-Sadah, who became the al-Qaida leader&apos;s fifth wife in late 1999, spoke of a &quot;sincere&quot; husband \u2013 though one who apparently exaggerated tales of his own bravado for the sake of his in-laws. Sadah, who Pakistani officials say was wounded in the calf during the operation that killed her husband, was among at least a dozen women and children detained by Pakistani security officials after the raid on the Abbottabad compound where Bin Laden had been living for several years. It is believed the American special forces team that carried out the operation was forced to abandon plans to evacuate survivors after losing of one of their four helicopters because of a technical problem. Among those detained are two other women who have also been identified as wives of Bin Laden by Pakistani officials. However, this is unconfirmed. If true both would be Saudi nationals. The children appear to be a mixture of Bin Laden&apos;s own and his grandchildren. They include Sadah&apos;s daughter, Safiya, who was born shortly before the 9/11 attacks. Pakistani officials have repeated that all those detained will be repatriated to their countries of origin. Sadah&apos;s family spoke to a reporter from the Associated Press news agency in their two-storey traditional home in Ibb, an agricultural town in the mountains about 100 miles south of the Yemeni capital, Sana&apos;a. They said they saw Sadah, who was 17 when she was married, only once after her wedding, in 2000. Communication was largely limited to messages delivered by couriers. The family said Sadah was a simple but determined and &quot;courageous&quot; young woman who was religiously conservative but not fundamentalist and who may have seen marriage with Bin Laden, a hero for some in the Islamic world and the son of a major construction magnate, as a means of social mobility. Sadah, whose father is a minor civil servant, always told her friends and family that she wanted to &quot;go down in history&quot;, according to her cousin Waleed Hashem Abdel-Fatah al-Sadah. A cleric based in Kabul called Rasheed Mohammed Saeed, who had radical Islamist contacts, relayed the demand for marriage with Bin Laden. Sadah&apos;s uncle Hashem recalled telling her he knew Bin Laden was from a &quot;devout and respectable family&quot; in Saudi Arabia, though he was unaware that the militant leader &quot;was wanted by the Americans&quot; for the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. &quot;The choice is yours,&quot; the uncle said he told her. &quot;It&apos;s your future.&quot; The answer was unequivocal: &quot;This is destiny from God, and I accept it.&quot; Weeks after the proposal, a dowry of $5,000 was wired by Bin Laden. After two wedding parties, including one in a Sana&apos;a hotel, Sadah left Yemen. Accompanied by the intermediary, she travelled via Dubai and Pakistan to meet her bridegroom for the first time. When the family learned through a courier that she had given birth to a daughter, a group of relatives travelled via Pakistan to Afghanistan, where they spent a month. On the final day of the visit, a cousin recalled Bin Laden telling the young mother that she could stay with him in Afghanistan or return home with her family. &quot;I want to be martyred with you and I won&apos;t leave as long as you&apos;re alive,&quot; he recalled her saying. When Bin Laden told her he was &quot;subject at any moment to death&quot;, Sadah told him curtly: &quot;I&apos;ve made my decision.&quot; The woman&apos;s cousin recalled her describing Bin Laden as a &quot;noble&quot; man who treated her well. &quot;&apos;It&apos;s true that my life is one of moving between caves in Afghanistan, but despite the bitterness of this life ... I&apos;m comfortable with Osama,&quot; she told her father. Sadah&apos;s uncle said Bin Laden complained about Arab leaders and said he had been the focus of several &quot;assassination&quot; attempts by Arab and US intelligence services. The al-Qaida leader appears to have exaggerated his anecdotes for the benefit of his in-laws, telling them that a mosque in which he was delivering a sermon was struck by a cruise missile. &quot;I was injured ... and a lot of people were killed,&quot; Bin Laden reportedly said. &quot;But I was spared from death because God wished it.&quot; There is no other record of such an incident. When in August 1998 the US fired cruise missiles at four militant training camps in Afghanistan in retaliation for the bombings of American embassies in east Africa, Bin Laden was many miles away. The cousin said Bin Laden told the family during their visit to Afghanistan &quot;of a big event that will occur in the world&quot;. Later, when the cousin and Sadah&apos;s father heard the news of the 9/11 attacks, the father had now doubt who was behind them. &quot;Osama bin Laden did it,&quot; he said. For the moment, the future of Sadah and the other women in Pakistani custody is unclear. American intelligence services are keen to interview those detained in the raid in the belief that they could provide crucial intelligence about the workings of al-Qaida, the recent activities of Bin Laden and his personal life, and whether they had received support from Pakistani authorities. &quot;It is fairly unlikely that Bin Laden would be sharing operational details with his wives. That isn&apos;t his way or his culture. But there are other things they should know about, such as the whereabouts of other relatives,&quot; one recently retired US intelligence official told the Guardian. One key topic, the former official said, would be the exact conditions of the large numbers of Bin Laden&apos;s close family who have been detained in Iran since they fled Afghanistan in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and the fall of the Taliban regime.", "title": "Osama bin Laden's youngest wife wanted to be martyred, says family", "sentences": ["Accompanied by the intermediary, she travelled via Dubai and Pakistan to meet her bridegroom for the first time."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-12T16:58:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/may/13/dark-sould-game-preview-namco", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "PS3", "Xbox", "Microsoft", "PlayStation", "Sony", "Culture"], "article": "The developers of Dark Souls are not afraid of death. Or more specifically, they&apos;re not afraid of you dying, in their game. A lot. Following the release of Demon&apos;s Souls, the oblique RPG adventure that became a surprise international hit last year, they revelled in the game&apos;s reputation as a relentlessly tough and demanding taskmaster. Now, at Namco Bandai&apos;s showcase in Dubai, they&apos;re showing off the follow up, and they want to make it absolutely clear that the greater profile of this title won&apos;t mean a more accessible experience. &quot;Demon&apos;s Souls provided thousands of deaths to players,&quot; grins producer Kei Hirono. &quot;This one is going to be even more difficult.&quot; It is, once again, a dark fantasy adventure, in which players must gingerly creep through a series of dungeon hellholes, fighting off a vast menagerie of really-quite-insistent enemies. Our demo begins outside a vast citadel named &quot;Sen&apos;s Fortress&quot;. &quot;We picked a level that will illustrate how many different deaths will be brought upon the player,&quot; laughs Hirono. Apparently, this stage earned the nickname &quot;trap themepark&quot; during development. We don&apos;t have to wait long to find out why: as soon as the armour-clad lead character enters the building, he steps on a booby-trapped flagstone, sending an arrow shooting out of the far wall into his stomach. That&apos;s a big chunk out of the health bar and we&apos;ve barely made it over the threshold. There are lots more of these arrow triggers to come. The aim with Dark Souls, explains Hirono, has been to capitalise on the three key concepts of the original game: deep, strategic sword fighting, highly explorable environments and the unique online element, which allowed participants to drop in to each other&apos;s single-player campaigns, leaving messages, co-operating or engaging in competitive duels. In Dark Souls, you once again get to build the specific warrior you want, customising gender, size and build as well as the all-important equipment load-out. Through the game, different forms of armour and weaponry become available, allowing the construction of extremely individual warrior types. It&apos;s an extension of the Demon&apos;s Souls system, with some interesting outcomes: Hirono shows us one example the team has built, a short, rotund character in strange bulbous armour, which severely restricts speed and agility. &quot;We call him the onion knight,&quot; he says. &quot;We don&apos;t know if he&apos;s of any use, but he&apos;s in there!&quot; Sen&apos;s Fortress is a labyrinth of winding staircases and narrow corridors, the way ahead only dimly lit as you make progress. On our route to the battlements, we encounter several four-armed, snake-headed warriors \u2013 they charge out of the darkness, hissing and flailing, and need to be dealt with via skilled swordplay or quick use of magic (fireballs do the trick rather nicely).     Dark Souls    Early on, we lumber into a caverous chamber where four huge axe-like pendulums swing over a narrow pathway. It&apos;s a very familiar platformer challenge, but here it requires particularly precise timing, and there&apos;s a snake man at the end firing arrows, just to add to the fun. Up some stairs, we come across a doorway to the same vast chamber, with another higher, narrower walkway and another set of pendulums; below, we can see the challenge we just completed, and on looking up, it&apos;s obvious there are more of them above. It is a great chasm of tense timing tasks. Elsewhere, there&apos;s a section where we have to run up a staircase while avoiding the constant flow of huge boulders crashing through in the opposite direction. As we get higher into the building, we find a gigantic machine that&apos;s directing these rocks into certain funnels, via a series of massive cogs and wheels, and a lever to change the route, making it a gigantic environmental puzzle. It&apos;s the typical mix, then, of short, sharp dexterity challenges with longer term tests. En route, Hirono teases us with a few observations that may hint at a new take on Demon&apos;s Souls&apos; ingenious online element. In a couple of rooms, there are several large stone statues of knights, which he says are a key part of the game; at one point he also passes a group of man-sized cages suspended from the ceiling. &quot;Hmm, these probably mean something, but we&apos;ll ignore them for now,&quot; he says. Could they be possible traps for fellow gamers? Namco will not confirm anything until E3 in June, but Hirono offers a few scraps of further information. &quot;There will be co-operation, there will be competition, the system has similarities with Demon&apos;s Souls, but it will be totally revamped and a lot of new features will be available,&quot; he says. &quot;What we want to emphasise is the amount of role-playing in the game. We want each player to really take on a role, and we&apos;ve implemented a new system \u2013 we&apos;re not sure what to call it yet \u2013 sort of a contract to help determine the player&apos;s role in the Dark Souls universe. That role will determine whether you want to become enemies or allies with other players.&quot; It&apos;s typical, though, that the game has us looking at seemingly mundane scenic props and features and pondering over their significance. What Demon&apos;s Souls quickly taught players was that nothing could be taken for granted; conventions were exploited and warped, everyday RPG items were imbued with new significance. Darks Souls is playing the same game. There&apos;s a great bit where Hirono goes to open a treasure chest, in which you&apos;re conditioned to expect valuable items. But here, the lid whips open and reveals a monstrous mouth lined with sharp teeth. Suddenly a pair of arms emerge from the sides of the box, pulling the character towards its bloody maw. When we break away, two long spindly legs grow from the base and it stumbles at us greedily. Out on the battlements, Hirono pans the camera around. We can see a see vast castle on a cliff edge hundreds of metres above us and another in the valley below \u2013 apparently all of these are explorable and the game panoramas will constantly hint at the next torture chamber to come. Beyond another staircase we find the source of those huge boulders; a grey, stone-like giant is picking them from a pile and lobbing them into a chute.     Dark Souls    A long fight follows, and once he&apos;s downed, we&apos;re expecting the demo to finish. &quot;That wasn&apos;t a boss fight,&quot; cautions Hirono. Suddenly, he looks out to another building close by \u2013 in its doorway stands a gigantic warrior monster, many times large than the one we&apos;ve just slayed. It is the Iron Golem glimpsed in a recent Dark Souls trailer. &quot;This boss is perhaps one that you can&apos;t beat alone,&quot; says Hirono, suggesting that co-op play could be an essential element in end-of-level encounters. This is, then, an uncompromising continuation of the Demon&apos;s Soul approach to the action RPG genre. There is no softening in the search for a larger mainstream audience \u2013 although Hirono is keen to point out that the challenge is carefully tweaked, and always fair. &quot;There&apos;s a fine line, it&apos;s difficult to tune, but that&apos;s what we&apos;re doing now,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;re playing though, trying to envision how people will play, and where enemies spawn from. We&apos;re trying to reach a point where the game is difficult, but the player is entertained. &quot;The way that Hidetaka Miyazaki [the game&apos;s director] tunes the game is that, it is difficult, but there are aways several ways to conquer the difficulty, and players will be able to learn from their mistakes. It&apos;s not just about making the enemies stronger, we have to provide enough choices for the user.&quot; \u2022 Dark Souls will be released for PS3 and Xbox 360 in October", "title": "Dark Souls \u2013 preview", "sentences": ["Now, at Namco Bandai&apos;s showcase in Dubai, they&apos;re showing off the follow up, and they want to make it absolutely clear that the greater profile of this title won&apos;t mean a more accessible experience."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-13T12:08:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/may/14/talking-horses-horse-racing-tips", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Horse racing tips", "Sport"], "article": "Today&apos;s TV races, by Will Hayler Twice Over (3.45) looks a sensible value bet to prove sharp enough for the return to one mile in the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury. He has as many Group One wins as hot favourite Canford Cliffs and is an improved performer since he finished third in this race two years ago, his most recent start over a mile. Canford Cliffs has reportedly had a couple of racecourse gallops in recent weeks to try and put an edge on him, but it took two runs for the horse to reach his peak last year and with a long campaign in front of him, it is wise to presume that he will not be quite at his peak here. Even if he is at his best, he has only a marginal amount in hand over Twice Over and Dick Turpin, both of whom have been in action this year and could hold an important fitness advantage. The Henry Cecil-trained Twice Over will need to be ridden \u00adprominently if his \u00adstamina is to be fully \u00adutilised over this trip, but he seemed to enjoy himself when winning from the front on rain-\u00adsoftened ground in \u00adNewmarket&apos;s Champion Stakes last season and it may also pay to be \u00adforgiving towards his \u00adlatest effort in the Dubai World Cup where a slow pace essentially rendered the form worthless. His other outstanding run last season, when second to Rip Van Winkle in the International at York, also came on a slightly easier surface, so any rain would not pose a problem. Back him and a saver on Dick Turpin, whose third to Goldikova and Paco Boy in the Prix du Moulin has possibly been undervalued. Newbury 2.00 Lack of tactical pace proved the undoing of Drunken Sailor in Dubai, where the races were not run at a sufficiently fast pace to bring his relentless gallop into play. But this looks a good opportunity to resume winning ways with a handful of possible pacesetters in opposition. Trainer Luca Cumani has his team in much better form now. Newmarket 2.15 Codemaster is one of a number of exciting prospects for Henry Candy this year. He was still learning about the game when a fast-finishing second in the Two-Year-Old Trophy on his final start last season, and looks as if he has further improvement to offer. Newbury 2.35 In-form horses are thin on the ground here. Addictive Dream sets the standard but has found it difficult to win, so a chance is taken on Oil Strike on his seasonal bow. He climbed the \u00adladder steadily last year and is lightly raced enough to improve further still. Newmarket 2.50 Cosmic Sun, the only horse able to come out of the pack and challenge the aggressively ridden Red Cadeaux at Kempton last month, will need a career-best effort to win this off his revised mark. But the handicapper could have been harsher and he proved his stamina for this kind of trip last season. Newbury 3.10 To some extent, jockey Steve Drowne was tactically undone when second to Cai Shen aboard Al Kazeem on the colt&apos;s recent reappearance, but Roger Charlton&apos;s runner probably needed the race in any case and could take this handicap before going on to better things. Horse sense Midsummer Sun (5.30) looked uncomfortable on the quick ground when failing to live up to market expectations on his racecourse debut at Newmarket&apos;s Craven meeting. Forecast showers ought to ensure conditions are not as fast at Newbury this afternoon and the Henry Cecil-trained colt can show his true colours. Despite changing his legs a couple of times and being eased down in the closing stages, Midsummer Sun, a half-brother to outstanding mare Midday, was not ultimately beaten that far on his debut and his homework since the race has been very smart. The Queen&apos;s Plimsoll Line is one to look out for in the same contest, although it may not be until switched to handicap company that the best is seen of Michael Bell&apos;s runner. The previous race can go to Rougette (4.55), representing the in-form yard of Barry Hills. A well-regarded filly, she did not get the clearest of runs on her recent debut at this track, but she was fresh enough that day in any case and the experience definitely seems to have brought her on. Loving Spirit (3.10) worked like a smart horse on the Watered Gallop before the 2,000 Guineas and has again gone particularly well since, despite only an ordinary performance in the big race itself. He has something to prove now, but should not be ruled out despite top weight as he moves up to a mile and a quarter. Kieren Fallon has high hopes for Drunken Sailor (2.00) having partnered him on the gallops recently. He has been given time to get over his latest exertions in Dubai and is going well. At Newmarket, Glencadam Gold (3.25) moved smartly at home in midweek. Seen and heard Barolo Top, a two-year-old who shaped with some promise when fifth at York on Thursday, is part-owned by the Tottenham footballer Jonathan Woodgate, who in 2007 was voted the worst Real Madrid signing of the 21st century by readers of Spanish newspaper Marca. But is the England international also the world&apos;s worst wine buff? On trainer Tom Dascombe&apos;s website, there is an explanation of how the colt was named: &quot;While enjoying a rather expensive bottle of Italian red called Barolo, Jonathan requested the waiter to add Coca-Cola to his glass,&quot; writes Dascombe. &quot;The waiter was not impressed and hence the name Barolo Top.&quot;", "title": "Talking horses | Will Hayler", "sentences": ["The Henry Cecil-trained Twice Over will need to be ridden \u00adprominently if his \u00adstamina is to be fully \u00adutilised over this trip, but he seemed to enjoy himself when winning from the front on rain-\u00adsoftened ground in \u00adNewmarket&apos;s Champion Stakes last season and it may also pay to be \u00adforgiving towards his \u00adlatest effort in the Dubai World Cup where a slow pace essentially rendered the form worthless.", "Newbury 2.00 Lack of tactical pace proved the undoing of Drunken Sailor in Dubai, where the races were not run at a sufficiently fast pace to bring his relentless gallop into play.", "He has been given time to get over his latest exertions in Dubai and is going well."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-14T07:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/may/14/canford-cliffs-lockinge-newbury", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Richard Hughes"], "article": "Canford Cliffs added to the rich promise of this Flat season with an authoritative victory in the Lockinge Stakes here, overcoming doubts about his fitness for this first outing in 10 months. His next race, expected to be against Goldikova at Royal Ascot next month, will be one to savour and there is the thrilling prospect of a clash with Frankel at some point after that. Richard Hannon, his trainer, had cried openly in the winner&apos;s enclosure when he won this last year with Paco Boy, a worthy veteran who was loved at home but failed to attract anything like the public enthusiasm for Canford Cliffs. Hannon was clearly moved once more and could manage only short replies for a television interview in the immediate aftermath of Saturday&apos;srace as he struggled to master his emotions. Like his horse, however, Hannon was hard to stop once he hit his stride. He was at full tilt when asked about next month&apos;s Queen Anne, which will pit Canford Cliffs against Goldikova, saying: &quot;I&apos;ll take her on wherever she goes. It doesn&apos;t make any difference to me, now.&quot; Rather unkindly, he added that Goldikova was &quot;getting on&quot;, though, at six, she is only two years ahead of Canford Cliffs. The French mare beat Paco Boy by a neck when winning last year&apos;s Queen Anne. &quot;Bring &apos;em on,&quot; Hannon added when the subject of Frankel came up. &quot;He won&apos;t be able to do what he did to the Guineas field the other day.&quot; Frankel may meet Saturday&apos;s winner in the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood. &quot;He&apos;s the best horse I&apos;ve ever had,&quot; Hannon said. &quot;He can cruise, this horse, but when you pick him up, he can increase [his pace] too. And they&apos;re very rare, those horses.&quot; Despite a recent racecourse gallop, Canford Cliffs was &quot;a bit rusty&quot; according to his rider, Richard Hughes, who said: &quot;I wasn&apos;t quite certain we had him 100% fit. Talented horses take a bit of graft, but he&apos;s a clean-winded horse so we got away with it.&quot; The main opposition was expected to come from Twice Over, who faded after chasing the pace, and the winner&apos;s stablemate Dick Turpin, who finished fourth of the seven. His rider, Ryan Moore, reported to Hannon that the horse had found the ground uncomfortably quick. Longchamp&apos;s Prix d&apos;Ispahan may be the next target. Canford Cliffs took some time to master Italian raider Worthadd, sent off 25-1 despite having been the first horse for 46 years to win both the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby in his home country. Worthadd is not entered in the Queen Anne and his trainer indicated that he would not be supplemented. Deauville&apos;s Prix Jacques le Marois is the main aim and he may run into Goldikova there. This was another advert for the skills of Worthadd&apos;s jockey, Mirco Demuro, who earned so many plaudits for his audacious theft of the Dubai World Cup on Victoire Pisa in March. A familiar face for punters in Italy and Japan, his few opportunities in Britain have largely come from his fellow Italians Luca Cumani and Marco Botti, both based in Newmarket, or in the Shergar Cup, a competition between jockeys from around the world. It seems Demuro would welcome more chances to prove himself on these shores, judging from what he said before the Lockinge. &quot;I have been riding for a long time in Japan, 13 years now, but in England it is very hard to ride,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s very competitive, there are many jockeys and everybody has their trainer. Nobody wants to change their jockey to try the Italian one.&quot; Earlier, Drunken Sailor had attracted quotes of 25-1 for the Melbourne Cup after winning the Listed Aston Park Stakes. Trained by Cumani, he narrowly missed the cut for last year&apos;s race. Odds of 100-1 were still available about Fiorente for the Derby after he was a promising winner of the opening maiden.

The very first point was: &quot;appoint the right manager&quot;. And how did they go about fulfilling that? By hiring the ace who had just guided Portsmouth to relegation. Clearly, then, Gollivan are a lot like a man who has been hit over the head with a bag full of tiny echolocating mammals \u2013 totally shrewd. Gollivan then spent the whole season giving the impression that they knew they&apos;d made a mistake but were either too indecisive to replace Grant or too full of crud to attract anyone else. Possibly both. Thus Grant remained in situ, like a sheet of bog-roll wedged twixt two buttocks. And West Ham stayed stuck to the bottom. Now they&apos;ve been flushed away. &quot;This is undoubtedly the worst moment in all the years I&apos;ve been supporting West Ham &amp; and of course I wish I&apos;d done things differently,&quot; spurted Gold on his Twitter feed after his team threw away a two-goal lead at Wigan and, along with it, their Premier League status. &quot;I honestly believed with the players we brought in in Jan + the imminent return of Hitzlsperger, we had done enough to pull clear of danger,&quot; drooled Gold, having first demonstrated all the class you&apos;d expect from a bongo-tycoon by sacking Grant within minutes of the final whistle. It is ironic that in their eagerness to cast Grant as the most convincing fall guy since Lee Majors, Gollivan in fact demonstrated that the manager alone was not to blame for West Ham&apos;s malfunctioning. And indeed, in a wonky show of solidarity, all of the players except Scott Parker and Ibrahima Ba chipped in slapstick performance after slapstick performance to prove that it wasn&apos;t all Golivan&apos;s fault either. So hail West Ham, their demotion in a season in which god awful sides like Birmingham, Wigan and Blackburn might survive was a genuinely team-wide achievement. QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;MUFC 19 TIMES&quot; \u2013 In what may be the most daring stunt at a football ground since Evil Knievel knacked himself into retirement while jumping over 13 London buses at Wembley, Manchester United fans wait until You&apos;ll Never Walk Alone is being played and unfurl a banner at Anfield reminding their Scouse chums that they have won more league pots than them. Before promptly doing one into a waiting getaway car and setting a new Liverpool to Manchester land-speed record along the M62. THE BATTLE TO AVOID QUALIFICATION What with so little of interest happening at either end of the Premier League or in the FA Cup over the weekend, the Fiver&apos;s thoughts have naturally turned to the ongoing battle for those last remaining qualification spots for next year&apos;s Big Vase; specifically, the frantic race between assorted clubs to avoid filling them. As things stand, Birmingham have already qualified for next year&apos;s competition courtesy of their unlikely victory in the League Cup, which means there&apos;s only one qualifying place up for grabs based on Premier League standings. That goes to whoever finishes fifth. And having shot themselves in the foot yesterday with an away win over a Liverpool side that was suspiciously less resurgent than usual, Spurs are currently in the box seat and desperately need to lose their home game against relegation-threatened Birmingham next weekend to maintain their faint hopes of avoiding the ignominy of having to play on Channel 5 or ITV4 on Thursday nights next season. Liverpool, by contrast, remain firmly in control of their own destiny: defeat at Aston Villa will guarantee their safety and consign Tottenham to second-tier European football. But now the surprising revelation that England has topped the Uefa Fair Play League and have been &quot;rewarded&quot; with an extra Euro Vase spot has really put the cat among the pigeons, with Fulham having been sucked into the equation, where previously they&apos;d presumed they were safe from qualification. With one match to go, the Cottagers find themselves in pole position, despite their heroic attempts to extricate themselves from the Euro Vase mire by racking up 10 bookings in their last two matches \u2013 exactly the same number they&apos;d accumulated in their previous nine. Currently just a flurry of bookings and a mass-brawl away from saving themselves from qualification at the expense of poor old Tottenham, the Cottagers are almost certain to come out punching, kicking and possibly even biting in their season finale against Arsenal. All of which duplicitous chicanery means that, with Tottenham now looking Euro Vase qualification certainties one way or the other, they might as well earn a berth in what passes for the competition proper by dint of their league position, which would at least spare them the ignominy of having to play a first round qualifier against Lokomotiv Dogski &amp; Duckzov in four weeks time.

Plans by the LSE to merge with the Toronto stock exchange have been jeopardised by the intervention of nine of Canada&apos;s banks and pension funds, which tabled an alternative, higher offer for the Canadian exchange. The consortium, which has nationalistically dubbed itself the Maple Group, has proposed paying C$3.58bn (\u00a32.27bn) for TMX Group. The Maple proposal is worth $48 per TMX share, while the LSE merger values the exchange at about $40 a share. In another twist to the consolidation under way among the world&apos;s exchanges as they race to cut costs, a two-way tussle for the New York stock exchange drew to a close after two US exchanges \u2013 Nasdaq and ICE \u2013 dropped their challenge to an agreed deal by Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Nasdaq and ICE cited insurmountable regulatory hurdles to their rival offer for NYSE Euronext. This led to speculation that the acquisition-hungry Nasdaq could look elsewhere, possibly even to the LSE, which has fended off its advances in the past. James Hamilton, a Numis analyst, pointed out that the LSE&apos;s relatively small size could make it attractive to a predator if the TMX deal folded. But he also noted that LSE could increase its bid \u2013 it expects \u00a3100m of cost savings \u2013 and still justify this higher price. This, though, would mean the LSE might find it harder to win regulatory approval for the deal. &quot;The main problem here, however, becomes regulatory,&quot; said Hamilton, &quot;as any increased offer removes the concept of a merger of equals.&quot; Keith Baird, an Oriel analyst, said: &quot;If the counter-offer succeeds, as it might well do, it would be a severe blow for the LSE&apos;s response to global exchange consolidation and specifically the NYSE/Deutsche B\u00f6rse [merger]. The LSE&apos;s strategy of diversification away from dependence on London (and to a lesser extent Milan) and securing extra growth would be badly damaged.&quot; Deutsche B\u00f6rse, an arch-rival of the LSE, is now at an advantage, analysts believe. Konrad Becker, at Merck Finck, said: &quot;The fact that Nasdaq and ICE are withdrawing their offer for NYSE is no surprise. It became clear already that the offer wouldn&apos;t be successful. It&apos;s good news for Deutsche B\u00f6rse.&quot; If Nasdaq and ICE had succeeded in buying NYSE Euronext, they would have split it up. Nasdaq would have acquired NYSE&apos;s equities and equities options business, and ICE would have bought its London-based futures unit, Liffe. NYSE had rejected the unsolicited offer, and Nasdaq and ICE had been ready to launch a hostile bid. Now, though, they recognise it would fail. Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, said: &quot;We took the decision to withdraw our offer when it became clear that we would not be successful in securing regulatory approval for our proposal despite offering a variety of substantial remedies. &quot;We saw a unique opportunity to create more value for stockholders and strengthen the US as a centre for capital formation amid an ongoing shift of these vital activities and jobs outside of our country.&quot; Deals diary The London Stock Exchange (LSE) has been at the centre of a string of proposed merger and acquisitions in the last decade. May 2000 The LSE and Germany&apos;s Deutsche B\u00f6rse unveil plans to merge, after Euronext is set up by Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels. August 2000 A hostile \u00a3808m bid from Sweden&apos;s OM exchange for the LSE scuppers its Deutsche B\u00f6rse merger. December 2004 Deutsche B\u00f6rse tables a \u00a31.3bn offer for the LSE but is rebuffed. February 2005 Euronext outlines the terms of a potential offer for the LSE but fails to put a price on its plans. December 2005 LSE rejects a &quot;derisory&quot; \u00a31.5bn takeover offer from Australia&apos;s Macquarie Bank. March 2006 Nasdaq makes a \u00a32.4bn bid for the LSE, which is also rejected. May 2006 NYSE bids $8bn (\u00a315bn) for Euronext; Deutsche B\u00f6rse then makes a counter offer valuing the European bourses at $11bn. December 2006 Nasdaq raises its LSE stake to 28.75% and makes a \u00a32.7bn hostile offer. An $11bn deal between NYSE and Euronext is approved. February 2007 Nasdaq wins just 0.41% of acceptances from LSE shareholders. June 2007 The LSE seals a \u00a31.1bn deal to buy Italy&apos;s Borsa Italiana. August 2007 Nasdaq agrees to sell most of its LSE shares to Borse Dubai. February 2011 The LSE and TMX, the Canadian stock exchange, agree to merge, with the LSE owning 55%. May 2011 The Maple Group, made up of nine Canadian banks and pension funds, propose a counter offer for TMX.

As the campaign draws to a close, we want you to help us find the most spectacular goal, biggest flop and best signing, as well as the winner in seven other categories. Our writers have nominated some contenders, but this is just the starting point for the conversation: we would like your suggestions so that we can compile the best into final polls that you can vote on. As the season obviously doesn&apos;t finish until Sunday afternoon, the nomination blogs will be open until later that evening, with the polls then open from Monday 23 May. Thanks. Sir Alex Ferguson The Manchester United manager has stamped his name all over this record 19th title. He jumped on Wayne Rooney&apos;s transfer request in October and got the sulky striker firing again. He took United to 29 games unbeaten in the Premier League with an average midfield. He motivated Dimitar Berbatov. He rotated his squad to perfection. He used his FA charge to foster a sense of being embattled and further fuelled his team. And while on the road United were nothing special, at home he ensured his side steamrollered the teams that Arsenal, Chelsea, Spurs and the rest could not beat. And when it really mattered \u2013 against Chelsea in the title decider and against Blackburn away \u2013 his players did exactly what they had to. He also made the signing of the season in Javier Hern\u00e1ndez. Ian Holloway Blackpool should already be relegated. Only one professional club \u2013 Stockport County who are bottom of League Two \u2013 have conceded more than Blackpool&apos;s average of two goals a game. The fact that at the time of writing they have got to the final game and have a chance of staying up with a squad assembled for around \u00a35m, is a miracle of sorts. Ian Holloway&apos;s team has played with a carefree spirit seldom seen from newcomers to the top flight (just look at the 4-3 win against Bolton for evidence), where survival is often synonymous with physicality and Neanderthal tactics. Without Charlie Adam the Seasiders would have hit the rocks and sunk into the second tier many games ago, but Holloway&apos;s resolve in keeping his captain when Liverpool came knocking with \u00a312m in January, may yet be his greatest feat. Even if Blackpool go down, Holloway is more than a worthy contender. Kenny Dalglish Liverpool were languishing only four points off the relegation zone in January when Kenny Dalglish received a call while entertaining guests on a cruise in Dubai asking him if he&apos;d come back to Anfield as caretaker manager. After 11 years out of the game, the sceptics believed his expertise lay in selecting golf clubs, not footballers. But after overseeing a defeat at Blackpool in his first league match in charge, Liverpool have lost only three games, scoring more goals than any other club and ranking third in the form table since the turn of the year. He has played the role of returning legend to perfection. The negative tactics employed by Roy Hodgson have been cast aside. Replacing a moody, misfiring Fernando Torres with Luis Su\u00e1rez and Andy Carroll looks to be a masterstroke. Previously maligned players such as Lucas Leiva, Jay Spearing and Dirk Kuyt are now lauded. Liverpool are no longer reliant on two players and local youngsters can see a path into the first team once more. There was only really one man capable of uniting a club torn asunder by the mismanagement of George Gillett and Tom Hicks, but Dalglish has done much more than that. In five months he has got a train wreck back on the rails and given it momentum. Roy Hodgson If Dalglish can be nominated for his effectiveness in half a season, then it&apos;s only fair that the man whose mess he swept up be recognised for his impact at West Brom since 11 February. After wearing the look of a condemned man for much of his time at Anfield \u2013 where fans never really wanted him in the first place \u2013 it is testament to Hodgson&apos;s strength of character that he was willing to take the job, and the pressure, at the Hawthorns. West Brom were joint-third bottom with Wigan when he took over. Five wins, five draws and only two defeats later the Baggies have bounced back up to 11th in the league and fifth in the form table since his appointment, with the highlight being the victory over Liverpool, which probably gave him more personal satisfaction than his politeness would allow him to admit. Some people are better at driving hatchbacks than fancy saloons. Hodgson is clearly one of those men. Tony Pulis In their third season in the top flight it says much for Stoke&apos;s consistency that they have never really been considered serious contenders to go down. Tony Pulis still uses the long-throw tactic to good effect at home, but they are not only about physicality and set pieces anymore \u2013 Rory Delap is no longer a guaranteed starter for example. From the flanks they have been as dangerous as any other team except Manchester United. A rejuvenated Jermaine Pennant looks to be a steal at \u00a31.7m. His prolific crosses, allied with those of Matthew Etherington, enjoying one of his best ever seasons on the left wing, have utilised the aerial prowess of Kenwyne Jones (another shrewd signing at \u00a38m), Ricardo Fuller and Jon Walters to great effect. Stoke&apos;s strength has been their ability to beat the teams around, not above them. Roberth Huth and Ryan Shawcross are a formidable obstacle at the back. Pulis&apos;s evolution is a slow one, but by playing on their known strengths, and slowly improving the team in areas where they previously lacked, he is establishing Stoke as a fixture in the Premier League. And for that, he deserves high praise. \u2022 Now check out the other nine categories: Player of the season Goal of the season Match of the season Signing of the season Flop of the season Gripe of the season Pundit of the season Innovations needed for next season League of the season", "title": "Manager of the season: Premier League 2010-11 review | Gregg Roughley", "sentences": ["Kenny Dalglish Liverpool were languishing only four points off the relegation zone in January when Kenny Dalglish received a call while entertaining guests on a cruise in Dubai asking him if he&apos;d come back to Anfield as caretaker manager."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-18T08:33:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/may/18/ridge-racer-unbounded-preview", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "PlayStation", "Xbox", "PC", "Racing games", "Culture"], "article": "There is an argument to be made (at least by me, and I could be alone) that Ridge Racer has always worked more like a platformer than a racing simulation. You run along the straights occasionally jumping over enemies (or, if you prefer, &quot;overtaking other drivers&quot;) and at the end of each section there&apos;s a boss encounter (a corner) with a very specific set of weaknesses that must be assessed and exploited. It&apos;s not you against physics, it&apos;s you against a highly controlled and malevolent environment.  I don&apos;t know where drifting fits into this analogy. The point is, Ridge Racer is unique. It&apos;s all flash and dash, all style over substance; you swerve through each scene like the Connery-era Bond, directed by Michael Mann. It doesn&apos;t work like Burnout or Need for Speed. It is its own universe.  It isn&apos;t any more. For Ridge Racer Unbounded (&quot;It IS a word,&quot; shouts producer Jonaas Laakso during our demo of the game at Namco&apos;s showcase event in Dubai), the rules have been torn up and atomised. Under development at Finnish studio Bugbear, responsible for the chaotic and thrilling FlatOut titles, the famed Namco &quot;brand&quot; is being transformed into a much more destructive experience. &quot;Namco Bandai wanted us to re-interpret Ridge Racer with our technology and the way we think about games, and to see what comes out,&quot; Laakso explains. &quot;We figured out the elements of Ridge Racer that we could use and put those into the kind of game worlds WE build: dynamic and destructible. It&apos;s not cool and laid-back, it&apos;s aggressive and in-your-face.&quot; What does this mean in practise? Well, drifting is still present (although the mechanic has apparently been radically remodelled), but here, it powers a meter that eventually gives the player access to a range of destructive features, marked by orange triangle icons.     Ridge Racer: Unbounded    On one track we see, based in the downtown area of the game&apos;s fictitious Shatter Bay setting, the car drives straight through the wall of a glass skyscraper, then explodes through the other side in a mass of debris \u2013 presumably cutting seconds from the lap times. Later, we see the driver crash into a set of bridge supports, bringing tons of rubble down onto the car behind.  Wait, Laakso knows what you are thinking. Split/Second. But Unbounded is different, he says. Whereas Black Rock&apos;s game was based around enormous set-piece destructions that played out the same way every time, Unbounded is based around a physics engine that ensures every blown out building collapses differently every time. &quot;We&apos;re really good at smashing things up,&quot; he shrugs. &quot;The dynamic worlds we create are built to be broken down. Where our competition has pre-set destruction, instead of animation, we use physics and we see what happens.&quot; As well as the main destructive areas, there are also &quot;collateral&quot; objects littering the roadsides. These can be smashed into rival cars for extra points.  In terms of architecture and layout, Shatter Bay is apparently a cross between New York and Chicago, with dense city centre areas flanked by more open suburban roadways. There are intentional hints of Ridge City too, including an extended underpass section lit in orange neon that will be familiar to all fans of the series. Apparently, players will also be able to discover new shortcuts and hazards through exploration, although it&apos;s not clear whether this happens through an open-world structure, a la Burnout, or while racing.  In the main Crash Race mode, the player becomes a rookie member of the Unbounded street gang, helping to secure areas of the city through illegal racing. There will be other modes, though, including one based much more heavily on pure racing, and conversely another (even) more destruction-based option. As for multiplayer, Namco is saying nothing right now, but intriguingly during the demo, Laakso revealed a map of the entire playing area and it showed that there are &quot;thousands&quot; of other cities in the game as well as Shatter Bay. Could it be that players will be able to create their own urban race zones?      Ridge Racer: Unbounded    It&apos;s also likely we&apos;ll see a split-screen two-player mode (when questioned on this, there was a long pause and a vague &quot;no comment&quot;, from Namco which is tantamount to &quot;yes, but we&apos;re saving that for E3&quot;). Expect some kind of social networking mechanic, too. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t call it Autolog,&quot; says Laakso, referencing the innovative feature in the latest Need For Speed titles. &quot;We were talking about something similar before we even saw Hot Pursuit \u2013 but a feature like that is becoming a requirement in the racing genre so we think that you should be able to track how your friends are doing in the game \u2026&quot; So this is Ridge Racer, but also not Ridge Racer; a sleek urban racer that also piles on the environmental destruction. There will be dozens of fictitious cars, some of them drawn from the classic Ridge Racer garage, but there will be a more aggressive handling system. Interestingly, Laakso made the point during our interview that Unbounded doesn&apos;t necessarily represent the end of the traditional Ridge Racer experience. It could be that we see a more conventional iteration from Namco Bandai in the future.  In this way, the publisher may well be looking to create a Need For Speed-style umbrella brand, with a range of offshoots. The granddaddy of the arcade racing genre is not slowing down into retirement, it is accelerating into the evolving universe of the 21st century driving sim. The question is, can it bring its veteran fans along for the ride? \u2022 Ridge Racer Unbounded will be released on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2012.", "title": "Ridge Racer Unbounded \u2013 preview", "sentences": ["For Ridge Racer Unbounded (&quot;It IS a word,&quot; shouts producer Jonaas Laakso during our demo of the game at Namco&apos;s showcase event in Dubai), the rules have been torn up and atomised."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-18T13:18:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/may/19/ace-combat-assault-horizon-preview", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Xbox", "PS3", "Culture"], "article": "Namco has had a great idea with Assault Horizon, the latest title in the long-running Ace Combat series. Turn it into a first-person shooter. Of course, it&apos;s still about flying billion-dollar jets above intricately detailed cities, taking down bogeys. But now the intricacies of flight control have been slashed, and there&apos;s a new emphasis on close-quarters combat. The world has clearly been falling out of love with flight sim shooters for years \u2013 so creating Call of Duty in the stratosphere seems like a good idea.  At the controls of an F-22 swooping above Miami, it all makes sense. The analogue sticks let me look around and &quot;steer&quot;, while I can also use the shoulder buttons if a want to &quot;yaw&quot; it up a bit. I really don&apos;t. The triggers handle acceleration and deceleration, while weapons are on the fire buttons. I have a machine gun, a standard missile, and a mere handful of multiple missiles that will target up to four enemy craft simultaneously. A sort of mid-air smart bomb.  I don&apos;t really know who I&apos;m fighting, something about insurgents developing a powerful bomb as part of a fictional global uprising. There&apos;s a Russian pilot named Andrei Markov at the centre of it all. He&apos;s a mercenary and he has drawn shark&apos;s teeth on the nose of his plane to communicate the fact that he&apos;s not to be messed about with. None of this matters. What matters is that the skies above Miami are filled with enemy craft, swooping over the beach, and I have to shoot them down.      Ace Combat: Assault Horizon    The key new innovation here is the dogfight (or &quot;close-range assault&quot; mode. When a plane is in your reticule, you can press the two shoulder buttons to go into a sort of iron sight over-the-shoulder view, which also zooms in on your target, making it easier to strafe them with gunfire and missiles. The idea is to get away from that whole &quot;shooting at distant dots&quot; thing that people hate about air combat sims. In this view, the camera shakes, the action is fast and close; it&apos;s as if Marcus Fenix has donned a jet pack. Propeller heads will probably find it distracting and inauthentic, and weirdly, it reminds me of Namco&apos;s forgotten 1995 footie game, J-League Prime Goal EX, in which the camera would adopt a behind-the-shoulder view for every tackle, allowing players to try to outsmart each other in a quick QTE-style mini-game.  Here though, the trick works quite nicely, and adds an exhilarating sense of physical danger to the shoot-outs. Namco has also added zonal damage, so you can take out an enemy craft&apos;s tail or landing gear \u2013 which of course, mimics the contextual damage employed in most first-person shooters. And when a plane is taken out in this mode there&apos;s a mammoth explosion that sprays your screen with black engine oil \u2013 the mechanical blood of your nose-diving victim. At the same time, enemies are able to lock on to your craft in the same way, opening up a counter-manoeuvres mini-game requiring you to change speed and direction very quickly. Damage is represented as, yes, a red haze around the edges of the screen, in yet another sly nod to the FPS genre. It&apos;s so much more intense than getting a little beeping warning light telling you that a missile is hurtling toward your back-end.      Ace Combat: Assault Horizon    The game also looks impressively sharp, with detailed scenery pulled from satellite data. The Dubai map is spectacular, capturing every one of those looming hubristic skyscrapers. Some missions require the player to fly low over the cityscape on bombing runs, and the camera zooms in greedily on particularly impressive explosions. There are also helicopter-based missions, in which ground troops and armoured vehicles need to be taken out. The American military advised on the technical accuracy of all this. I&apos;m sure Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is being installed into every air force recruitment centre in the country.  \u2022 Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is released on Xbox 360 and PS3 on 14 October.

The roundabouts are pockmarked with signs for the &quot;oil capital of Europe&quot;. The old-money granite houses in the West End have been turned into offices for the big energy firms, their former servants&apos; quarters crammed with accountants and lawyers poring over contracts. And to get to the Patricia Cornwells at the airport&apos;s WH Smith you must first squeeze past shelves of books on all things crude, from Deepwater Horizon to a memoir called Don&apos;t Tell Mum I Work on the Rigs (subtitle: She Thinks I&apos;m a Piano Player in a Whorehouse). It&apos;s oil that gives Aberdeen a special status in the litany of national grievances. Early in the North Sea bonanza, Scottish nationalists argued that the gusher of cash could be used in one of two ways: to prop up the British economy or to transform Scotland: &quot;What do you want to be, rich Scots or poor Brits?&quot; That question was settled decades ago \u2013 by a woman from Grantham. &quot;Margaret Thatcher destroyed British industry, and she paid off the unemployed with benefits using North Sea oil,&quot; says Allan MacAskill, a petroleum engineer for more than 30 years. MacAskill is not a dispassionate observer \u2013 he joined the SNP when he was 18, and has a brother, Kenny, in the Scottish cabinet \u2013 but on this issue he seems to be voicing the local consensus. Nationalist movements usually seek sustenance in stories of ancient wrongs and recent lost opportunities. Over the past few years, however, the SNP has had less recourse to What Might Have Beens and more scope to exercise greater power. Then came the elections of a fortnight ago, when the party won 53% of all seats at Holyrood, under an electoral system designed to prevent such majorities. &quot;You were just watching the map of Scotland flip from orange and red to [SNP] yellow,&quot; says Karen, the PR manager showing me round the local harbour. &quot;And there were all these people on telly chanting, &apos;Scotland! Scotland!&apos;&quot; That night, the idea of an independent Scotland lurched from counterfactual fantasy to outside possibility. What that possibility amounts to might well be decided in Aberdeen. The biggest, most seductive election promise made by Salmond was that he would &quot;re-industrialise Scotland&quot;, starting here. Those who say the oil is running out overstate rather than fabricate: more than half the local reserves have already been extracted and what&apos;s left will be harder and more expensive to pump out. In a manifesto festooned with pictures of windmills looming out of the water, the SNP laid out a plan to succeed North Sea oil with a giant renewable-energy industry. MacAskill likes the idea so much he recently jumped tanker from the oil industry to set up an offshore-wind business. &quot;You&apos;ll have cutting-edge technology developed right here, in Aberdeen; you&apos;ll have wind turbines made in Glasgow and throughout the central belt. We&apos;ll have jobs again where our industries used to be.&quot; There is more to his enthusiasm than profit-seeking; this is the Scots&apos; riposte to &quot;the old Thatcherite idea of a post-industrial future&quot;. For anyone bored with Ed Miliband and David Cameron arguing whether the spending cuts are &quot;too far, too fast&quot;, the political debate north of the border can seem as starkly different as switching from black-and-white to colour. In place of desiccated managerialism, Salmond and his finance minister John Swinney have come up with an economic strategy that serves also as a job-creation policy and a metaphor for national renewal. A re-energised Scotland: in the nation where it was once said that Clydeside built not only ships but men, such rhetoric resonates. It&apos;s also pie in the sky, say critics. Across town, a huddle of oil executives is having lunch with Brian Wilson, former energy minister under Tony Blair. &quot;Nationalism is a fundamentalist belief, which uses economics as a rationale,&quot; he says, to nods around the table. &quot;Scottish nationalism existed before the oil industry, but then oil became the answer. The SNP was around before renewables, but now Alex Salmond talks about the North Sea becoming &apos;the Saudi Arabia of wind&apos;.&quot; My neighbour quotes some research showing that on present trends renewables will bring only 5,000 jobs to the north- east of Scotland: hardly an economic renaissance. It&apos;s true that the clean-energy revolution is not yet visible to the naked eye. There&apos;s money for a European offshore wind centre, and talk of a green-manufacturing hub in the old oil platform-building site of Nigg on the Cromarty Firth \u2013 but the most noteworthy recent local development is Donald Trump&apos;s \u00a31bn golf course at Balmedie. This vacuum neatly expresses the big economic problem for nationalists: in the 70s and 80s, their key task was to figure how best to spend the oil money; nowadays, the challenge is the more fundamental one of how to generate the cash for a post-North Sea future. In the 90s, nationalist pound notes were staked on hi-tech industry. But as foreign businesses bolted from Silicon Glen to Asia, 20,000 people lost their jobs. After that came finance: Edinburgh was going to be &quot;the Zurich of Scotland&quot;. Then came the collapse of Royal Bank of Scotland and Halifax Bank of Scotland. &quot;It would be wrong to describe the SNP as making it up as they go along,&quot; says Brian Ashcroft, an economist at the University of Strathclyde. &quot;But they are trying one thing after another.&quot; Right now, though, the oilmen round this table are fuming over George Osborne&apos;s decision in March to jack up taxes on North Sea profits. &quot;London behaves like an absentee landlord that just racks up tenants&apos; rates,&quot; says one, to murmurs of agreement. That complaint is at the heart of the economic case for an independent Scotland. The SNP promises that self-determination will mean a smaller, closer government that tends to Scottish industry alone rather than trading it off against, say, the City. How will that help? To find out, I speak to Graeme Bell, head of Green Ocean Energy and a poster boy for Salmond&apos;s renewables policy (not that he&apos;ll tell me which way he votes). We begin a game of Home Rule tennis, in which I serve the obvious question: what would an Edinburgh government give you that a London one couldn&apos;t? &quot;Regulatory clarity?&quot; Ah, but you can get muddled regulation out of Holyrood just as easily as Westminster. &quot;More funding to develop new technology?&quot; There&apos;s plenty of cash in London and Dubai. &quot;We&apos;d hope to have access to the Green Investment Bank.&quot; What, the institution brought to you by 11 Downing Street? The point is almost mine, but then Bell lobs this in: &quot;Sometimes you need an event to get people and things and an economy moving.&quot; And that event could be a severing of the union? &quot;Possibly. I haven&apos;t seen a balance sheet that lays out the costs and benefits of independence, but I suspect that the result would be slightly positive.&quot; If it&apos;s a cost-benefit analysis you&apos;re after you probably need an economist. Three hours south, in a glass-fronted cafe in the University of Edinburgh, I put Bell&apos;s challenge to a group of academics. Simon Clark, head of the university&apos;s economics department, remarks that money would never be the deciding factor in any case for independence: &quot;That would be like becoming a monarchist for economic reasons.&quot; But if Scotland were to cut itself loose now, what would its economy look like? Well, pretty similar to the rest of the UK. Debates about the economics of independence often understate that it&apos;s London and the south-east \u2013 with its turbocapitalism and its chokehold on the Treasury \u2013 which is the regional anomaly. In Scotland, the public sector is a bit larger than the rest of the UK, providing employment for 25% of the workforce, above the national average of around 21%. Scotland&apos;s economy is more sluggish, growing by an average of 2% a year between 1997 and 2007, against 2.4% for the country as a whole. That may not sound much, but over the decades it adds up to a significant shortfall. Notice what&apos;s missing from the economists&apos; discussion: an argument about whether an independent nation could pay its way. That&apos;s partly because, so soon after Salmond&apos;s rout, the terms of separation are vague \u2013 how much of the oil revenues would go to Edinburgh; the public debt that Westminster would dump on Holyrood; even what currency it would adopt over the long run. But it&apos;s also because those Kelvin MacKenzie-isms about Scotland the Subsidy Junkie are \u2013 shock! \u2013 not wholly true.     Wind turbines in East Renfrewshire: could wind power offer a new economic miracle for Scotland? Photograph: Murdo Macleod    The last set of figures from Holyrood statisticians show that for 2008-9, Scotland provided \u00a31.3bn more in revenue than was spent north of the border. At less than 1% of Scotland&apos;s GDP, that&apos;s not a huge surplus, and it does include a due share of North Sea revenues. Strip out crude and the deficit goes up sharply, to \u00a310.5bn (or 9% of GDP). If those were your family&apos;s accounts you wouldn&apos;t want to be depending on one source of income that yo-yos so much (oil prices hit a record-high in 2008). But beware of double standards: hardly anyone put such objections to chancellor Gordon Brown during the bubble years. The larger question that preoccupies the Edinburgh economists is what the business model for a stand-alone Scotland would look like. Unlike Graeme Bell, academic Stuart Sayer does not think the very fact of independence would change much: &quot;It&apos;s like faith-healing. If you believe, wonderful things can happen \u2013 but I&apos;d hate to rely on it as my sole treatment.&quot; Follow Sayer&apos;s taxonomy and that makes Stephen Noon faith-healer-in-chief. He was in charge of putting together the SNP&apos;s manifesto for the last elections; and when we meet in in Edinburgh&apos;s George Street, he makes the case for nimble government: &quot;Under our own government we could act now, rather than lobby the UK government for five years.&quot; There would be extra money coming in too, he thinks, from revenues collected by Westminster but which belong to Scotland. &quot;Because of Crown Estate, London collects hundreds of millions from renting out the UK seabed to offshore firms. That could be ours.&quot; The argument that Edinburgh stands to rake in a tax bonanza is a familiar one to Michael Keating, a political scientist at the University of Aberdeen. For him it&apos;s the flipside of a devolution system in which Westminster passes most of Scotland&apos;s budget to Holyrood, which then spends it. No wonder Salmond now talks of an interim Basque option, based on the Spanish system. In this system, the majority of tax is raised locally and Edinburgh pays London for services such as defence and foreign embassies. But as things stand, Edinburgh is about as fiscally autonomous as a teenager living off pocket money. The result, says Keating, is a nationalist movement that hugs both the Swedish model of high public spending and the Irish example of low business taxes. &quot;It&apos;s voodoo economics,&quot; he says. It&apos;s also voodoo politics. This result is an SNP of both left and right, with frontbenchers well to the left of Labour and business supporters such as Sir George Mathewson, the former chairman of RBS. In the lobby of a hotel outside Holyrood, he tells me that &quot;independence is the best way to deal with Scotland&apos;s dependency culture. If the country stops taking money from London, then perhaps that will encourage our welfare claimants to stop taking benefits from the state.&quot; Still, the left of the party would share Mathewson&apos;s view that separation would make for a more productive Scotland. In this argument, the country that brought you David Hume and Adam Smith and the Scottish Enlightenment still has what urban theorists call the three Ts: &quot;talent, technology, tolerance&quot;. Small and energetic, coffee-drinking and open-necked: the image projected is of Catalonia in woolly jumpers. There is one problem with this, which you might call the revenge of geography. The SNP has spent decades arguing that small independent nations can thrive: trade and technology mean that Sweden, Denmark, Norway and others can take on big countries. Then came the financial crisis. Over the past couple of years, small countries on the periphery of Europe \u2013 from Ireland to Greece to Portugal \u2013 have had to deal with hot money rushing out of their markets, and then struggled under bailouts with tight repayment terms imposed on them by foreign governments. &quot;The paymaster problem&quot; is what Clark calls this. &quot;Who&apos;s going to look after you when things get tough?&quot; This isn&apos;t a problem the SNP have taken on board, but it will have to. However patchy and contradictory and sometimes downright infuriating the nationalists&apos; arguments, the SNP remains one of the most engaging teams around. Unlike the big Westminster parties, which pay lipservice to rebalancing, the Scottish Nationalists acknowledge the need to rethink their country&apos;s economic model. Nor do they shy away from calling themselves social democrats, rather than the party of aspiration or other such knackered Blairisms. James Robertson is an author, whose novel And the Land Lay Still is also one of the best guides to modern Scottish politics. Salmond chose it last Christmas as his book of the year. I met him in Dundee, a city that long ago lost its textiles and jute industries but now pins its hopes on a new cultural quarter. &quot;Some of what the Nationalists say about ill-treatment by the London government is bollocks, but it makes sense to people who&apos;ve seen what&apos;s happened to industry and jobs in Scotland,&quot; he told me. The intriguing thing is, it might well apply further south too, from Newcastle down to the Midlands.", "title": "Can Scotland pay its own way?", "sentences": ["&quot;More funding to develop new technology?&quot; There&apos;s plenty of cash in London and Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-20T06:00:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/may/20/architecture-liverpool-shoreditch", "tags": ["Architecture", "Skyscrapers"], "article": "Ambition can get the better of architects, buildings and even entire cities.

Sore-ditch ... will Amanda Levete be the woman to ruin east London? Photograph: David Levene    Amanda Levete was also in hot water this week, criticised by Turner prize winning artist Rachel Whiteread over her design for a twisting, shining and very prominent 225ft skyscraper planned for Shoreditch, north of the City of London. As Chris Dyson, a local architect, told Building Design, &quot;The choice of architect is glamorous and she [Levete] is very good, but the building is inappropriate for the context.&quot; Shoreditch is not downtown Chicago, where Jeanne Gang has designed an eye-catching skyscraper that rises elegantly and appropriately from its site. In her tower&apos;s defence, Levete told The Architects&apos; Journal: &quot;I understand the emotional issues raised by large developments. But the evolution of a city is bigger than us all.&quot; And, so much so, that if and when Shoreditch shoots skywards and goes slickly corporate, the very artists who have done so much to inject new life into this old quarter will probably move elsewhere.

People want her to do well, as they did the melancholy French chanteuse, not just because she is an outsider but because she fights like one. Sparrow-like, too, but with a bulldog&apos;s gait, Frankie, as her many friends call her, shares with Piaf not only Italian heritage and a love of Paris but a determination to beat life&apos;s odds and preconceptions that is frightening in its intensity. For Schiavone it never burned more fiercely than on the red brick dust of Roland Garros a year ago when she outhustled the young Australian and firm favourite, Sam Stosur, to lift the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen, becoming the first woman outside the top 10 to do so in 77 years and the first Italian woman to win a grand slam title. Schiavone&apos;s humility lit up Court Philippe Chatrier. &quot;You are a great, great person,&quot; she told Stosur, knowing that emotion only too well in a career of serial striving. She spoke of &quot;the big champions&quot; who had gone before and how she dared not tempt fate by preparing a victory speech, so the words babbled forth, without artifice: &quot;I didn&apos;t prepared nothing. If I prepare something in the future, it never happen.&quot; She kissed the clay that day and rolled in it like a young girl in love, talked courtside on the phone to her country&apos;s president, charmed even those cynics who had only disdainfully mentioned her in their previews to the final and, late into the night, treated herself to a glass or three of champagne, another new thrill. Now she is back but the champion is still on the outside looking in. She is fifth seed,\u00a0in keeping with her WTA ranking, although some hard-headed observers consider it generous, even so. Schiavone\u00a0has struggled\u00a0as if flung back to her appointed place after the intoxicating high\u00a0she experienced for the first and only\u00a0time in her life in Paris. Kim Clijsters,\u00a0the sport&apos;s darling, returns as No2 seed. But this is sport, not a reality TV weep-fest. This year Schiavone went out in the quarter-finals in the Australian Open, her feet badly blistered. There followed a third-round exit in Dubai, the first round in Doha and Kuala Lumpur. She got as far as the fourth round at Indian Wells and Miami, suffered another early defeat in Stuttgart, the third round in Madrid and then, finally last weekend, a rematch with Stosur, in her country&apos;s main tournament, the Rome Masters. Schiavone had shown a lot of grit to get past the infuriating Daniela Hantuchova, whose prissy delaying tics and twitches drove the Roman audience into a frenzy of booing. The Italian favourite got it together after looking shot in the first set to grind out one of her most pleasing wins \u2013 but Stosur was too good in the third round, too strong and direct for her, and won handsomely. Schiavone has not long turned 31. She has drawn in the first round an opponent who would not normally be considered a major threat, the young American Melanie Oudin \u2013 but this is another fight for the veteran against a pretty poppet, a product of New Tennis, an American teenager with potential, marketing and sporting. Her results are poor but her smile is wide. Schiavone is beguilingly philosophical about every aspect of her life. &quot;Ha ha! Changed my life?&quot; she says, asked about her title in Paris. &quot;Hmm. I can say that some things not change. Maybe I can go some places, for sure, but family, no. In the street, the people that love what happen to me, maybe today I have to give them more. So that&apos;s different. But the rest is more request from you, the media. I think you want to know little bit more about me. &quot;Also, football here is the first sport, yes. Absolutely. But, on the way to the stadium,\u00a0they stopping and say me: &apos;You are victor! Congratulations.&apos; That&apos;s really fantastic. Some are really passionate about tennis, but not all. They just know\u00a0me.&quot; As for her tennis, it is as conventional as she is old-fashioned in the nicest way. Not for her the double-fisted backhand. Nor does she shriek as if programmed like a wind-up doll. She sweats honestly.

Non\u2011surgical procedures one can book\u00a0at the hotel&apos;s Kallima Spa. They are carried out by staff specially trained\u00a0by a top London cosmetic surgeon and include laser hair removal,\u00a0chemical peels and something called micro needling (which I can&apos;t quite bring myself to read about). Very LA. Woken by the sound of planes (yes, this 167-room hotel is under the Heathrow flight path), I slipped into the basement spa early for a (wonderfully solitary) swim and steam\u00a0(the hottest ever). Now I&apos;m returning, after breakfast, for a treatment custom chosen for me from a choice of brands that include current spa fave Anne S\u00e9monin, a &quot;sensorial&quot; French range called Terrak\u00e9 and organic Voya. The original New York Waldorf Astoria is a legend. Cole Porter wrote about it; Marilyn Monroe lived in it. Waldorf Astoria is now Hilton&apos;s luxury brand, with hotels in countless capitals and beach resorts. The latest in its portfolio is here, newly built on the Syon Park estate just across the Thames from Kew Gardens. Syon Park is the home of the Duke of Northumberland, known for the dome on its magnificent conservatory, its Robert Adam interior and its Capability Brown park. The hotel is next to the stable-block-turned-upmarket-garden-centre, and poses no threat that I can discern to Syon House on the architectural front. The lobby has something of the Dubai shopping mall about it. Glass display cabinets house sapphire-, diamond- and ruby-encrusted pieces by a Swiss jeweller. A glass butterfly house (yes, really, complete with tropical plants but also rotting fruit) divides seating areas of pale yellow butter-soft leather. At one end is a sundae bar serving ice-cream, coffee and crepes. Eventually you reach the martini bar, Peacock Alley. Mirrors glint, powder-blue leather bar stools hug the semi-circular bar, lime velvet sofas clash with multicoloured Warhol portraits, and a champagne trolley shimmers with ice. Things are calmer in the bedroom. My first-floor room is reached along a glassed-in walkway with extraordinary piped-in sound effects (geese, birdsong, voices) and seems to owe much to the monochrome, wenge wood-obsessed 1990s. No arguing with sheets so fine they feel like silk, a private balcony, bathroom with TV, lights on dimmers and Ferragamo toiletries. Wi\u2011Fi is free, but only in the communal areas. Service at tea, down in the courtyard when I arrived yesterday afternoon, was hit and miss until a man (who turned out to be the sommelier) took control, ran through the loose tea selection and got it delivered in half the time we waited for a menu. &quot;Very Silence of the Lambs,&quot; said my friend, examining the butterflies on Villeroy &amp; Boch china. The very same sommelier persuaded her to try an English sparkling wine in the Capability restaurant later that evening. We liked the menu from executive chef Lee Streeton (ex-Browns and Caprice Holdings), which made much of Cornish seafood and lamb, 28-day-aged Aberdeen beef, wild garlic, English cheese and even cider. For once, there were three vegetarian options, though none (noted my nutritionist pal) contained any protein. Now, after Anne S\u00e9monin&apos;s black Polynesian sand scrub, then skin massaged and brushed as part of Terrak\u00e9&apos;s Of Air and Light detox treatment, and chilling in the spa&apos;s candlelit purpleness, I have resurfaced,\u00a0glowing and relaxed, into the lobby. All\u00a0this glitz on a very English estate is plain weird, but I must admit I feel great.\u2022 Around \u00a350 for three-course dinner, excluding drinks  WHAT TO DO IN THE AREA: BY THE LOCALS A picnic spot The Duke of Northumberland&apos;s family has lived in Syon House (syonpark.co.uk) for more than 400 years. Take a tour of the magnificent estate and private apartments; enjoy the spectacular glass conservatory and 40 acres of gardens. Then you can have a picnic in the &quot;secret garden&quot; at the back. (The hotel will pack a spread and\u00a0deliver it to you, with some bubbly.)Kelly Jackson, marketing manager, Syon Park Wardorf Astoria A bike ride There are lots of great bike rides right from the door. You can explore the Syon Park estate or nearby Richmond Park. Or you could ride to Kew Gardens (adults \u00a313.90, concessions \u00a311.90, under-17s free, kew.org) just over Kew Bridge. It&apos;s one of four Unesco world heritage sites in London, with 43 listed buildings and more plant varieties than at any other point on the Earth&apos;s surface. Children will like it here too: there&apos;s the Climbers &amp; Creepers interactive play zone for under-nines, the Treetop Towers adventure playground and the Treetop Walkway, which teenagers will enjoy. Bicycles and even some tandem bikes can be borrowed from the hotel without charge. KJ A great pint O&apos;Riordans, up the road in Brentford (3 High Street), is a traditional Irish pub with great stout and an excellent informal band that assembles every Thursday evening and jams the night away. All are welcome and the atmosphere is great.Nigel Taylor, curator at Kew Gardens A long walk Take the Grand Union Canal towpath northwards from the bridge on the A315 London Road, a few minutes from the hotel. This makes for an interesting walk, with good interpretation of canal history and local industry, while getting you away from busy traffic. You can reach Southall and experience a complete Indian community with colourful culture and great food. The River Thames towpath is also beautiful in either direction, but much more popular and can get crowded, especially with cyclists. NT Retail therapy West London&apos;s super-shopping centre \u2013 Westfield in Shepherds Bush, with more than 300 shops \u2013 is nearby and easily accessible from Syon Park on the 237 bus.

This is Azerbaijan. Proud winner of Eurovision and proudly independent since 1991, Azerbaijan is probably where the Vikings came from, and definitely has the most mud volcanoes in the world. But a herdsman living 2km from the volcanoes had never heard of them. Tourism is in its infancy here. You share your flight to the capital, Baku, with a load of oilmen. Sundry Nobels and Rothschilds helped found the world&apos;s first oil and gas industry here, and today you fly in over thousands of smudgy, nodding-donkey wells, and a city of rigs sitting in the lapis blue Caspian, some linked by causeways that look like Scalextric sets. Baku has a pretty medieval core surrounded by an old city and a new one. Old Baku is elegant, with sturdy turreted and cupola&apos;d stone buildings. New Baku is brash, boom-built and crowned by three almost-finished skyscrapers shaped like flames, for Azer means &quot;fire&quot;. In between, there are rather a lot of concrete apartment blocks, gifts from the eastern bloc. Tom Ford has three shops here; a babushka sells tomatoes from a doorway next to the Dior store; boys too young to shave drive around in Lamborghinis. Baku intends to become the Dubai of the Caspian, and its permissive atmosphere makes it more swingy than its neighbours. But oil money means Baku is pricey, so I head south, towards the border with Iran. Azerbaijanis have two driving styles: dawdle or hurtle. Samir, our driver, does both on the way to the seaside city of Lenkoran. We detour to Qobustan national park, where ancient man left cave graffiti clearly showing the longships that led Thor Heyerdahl to trace his Viking roots here. More of Thor later. There are no road signs to the mud volcanoes, nor are they marked on the map. We eventually find them up the roughest of tracks, where they squelch, grepse and fart in a lunar, Clanger world.     Mud volcanoes in Qobustan.    Back on the coast road, recumbent, rusting oil rigs and glamorously ruined Soviet-era factories give way to wetlands where men on horseback herd flocks of buffalo. The Soviet legacy of overworked Ladas and churches with Iced Gem roofs is evident, and the sense is of a peaceful, fertile land, where you show your wealth in the artistry and gleam of your zinc roof and the gold in your teeth. Flashy smiles are an Azerbaijani speciality, as is an irresistibly gallant form of hospitality. By the end of the day, we&apos;ve seen miles of vineyards, and tremendous birdlife, and beautiful women in fuschia headscarves tending fields of greens. There are chaikhana (tea houses) every 500m, where the traditional offering of a pot of good tea and a bowl of jam is yours for a manat \u2013 less than a quid. Outside Baku, food is consistently delicious, and good value: Azerbaijani cuisine is a lovely mixture of Turkish, Iranian, Caucasian and Mongolian, characterised by impeccably fresh ingredients served in Brobdingnagian proportions. Lenkoran is low-built and pretty, with Lada taxis a go-go, and a shoreline of charcoal sand. At Astara, close to the Iranian border, there are cloud forests, flower meadows, open-air roadside bread ovens, tea plantations and sheep sheltering in petrol stations. We wave across desultory barbed wire at bored border guards sheltering from the sub-tropical rain. Azerbaijan was, in 1918, the world&apos;s first Islamic democracy. Though nominally Shia, the people have developed remarkable tolerance through millennia of invasions (Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Seljuks, Mongols, Arabs \u2026) leavened with 120 years of Soviet rule. Muslims, Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians live in peace here, and all communities seem very partial to a drink. A blight on this tolerance is the Armenian occupation of the Nagorno-Karabakh region in the west. Everyone I speak to is hurt and angered by this, and confused at the UN&apos;s refusal to intervene, despite four resolutions demanding an immediate, unconditional Armenian withdrawal. After Lenkoran we have to retrace our route to Baku, as Azerbaijan is cleaved by huge, unspanned gorges and mountain ranges. Another day, and we&apos;re on our way north to Gabala. One of many ancient khanates (an area traditionally ruled by a Khan), it is now home to Gabala FC, managed by Tony Adams, ex of Arsenal and Engerland. As we climb out of dusty Baku, the landscape gets greener and more wooded. In this Xanadu, wild horses nibble and gallop free, and we graze on tea and spoonfuls of carnelian cherry jam. There&apos;s a river called A Gazelle Cannot Cross It, and isolated villages whose zinc roofs are a mix of Mongol and Moorish styles. A mountainside of butcher&apos;s shops features adjoining penned flocks of sheep, in the local before-and-after style. High above, an eagle eyes us. At Vandam (cue Jean-Claude jokes) we drive through a magical pistachio forest, and here&apos;s the ancient mountain city of Gabala, which is roughly the size of Stroud. Swish hotel complexes cater for Bakuvians who come for the alpine air and views, and in one of these live Tony and his assistant, Gary Stevens. Gabala FC attracts crowds of up to 300, and lies seventh in a league of 12 teams. But Tony and Gary are upbeat optimism personified, and are enjoying the adventure and the anonymity. &quot;They don&apos;t know me from Adam,&quot; says Tony, toasting Azerbaijan in sweet tea. On to Shaki, (&quot;Shaky&quot; in football circles), while Samir talks music: Nazareth, Suzi Quatro and Shakatak are all Big in Baku. In the charming hill village of Kish, the Albanian temple has been restored by the Norwegian government. Outside it, men are playing nerd, the local backgammon, and keeping score on an abacus, under a bust of Heyerdahl with the quotation: &quot;Scandinavian mythology describes a god called Odin that came to northern Europe from a place called Azer. I have studied the writings and concluded that it is not mythology. It is real history and geography.&quot; By local legend a skeleton found underneath the temple showed these early Vikings to have been two metres tall, and blond with blue eyes.     One man and his wolf in Shaki.    The inhabitants of Shaki are short and dark, but wear very tall hats made of lambskin. Shaki is a glory: wooden and stone houses strung either side of a steep mountain river, a grand caravanserai-turned-scruffy hotel and a richly decorated khan&apos;s palace, outside of which a man with a stuffed wolf charges one manat to make the bulbs in its eyes flash weakly. Shaki is famous for its walnut and honey halva. A halva kitchen is called a sexi. We breakfast the following day in Shaki&apos;s market on chewy bread, rich butter, runny honey, salty cheese and thick cream. Next stop will be Ganja, home to Nizami Ganjavi, a 12th-century poet who wrote the story Majnun and Layla, a precursor to Romeo and Juliet. Outside Ganja is the village of Hash. I can report that Ganja is smoking, as it is wedding season. Shadliq sarayi (palaces of joy) are banqueting suites where people stuff themselves silly and dance artfully. The bride and groom, tightly primped, are enthroned upon a flower-decked plinth. Azerbaijani hospitality being generous as it is, I am invited that night to Two Weddings and a Circumcision. Our last excursion is to Quba, up near the Dagestan border. It lies on the banks of the Qudryal\u00e7ay river and is everything you&apos;d imagine a beautiful, remote Caucasus town to be, and more. Its left bank is a grid of low-built villas hung with cherry blossom and wisteria. There&apos;s a fascinating carpet workshop where you can have your photo woven into a rug, and a forest restaurant serving the best lula (minced lamb) kebabs you will ever taste. Guba&apos;s right bank is even more remarkable. This is Krasnaya Sloboda, or &quot;red village&quot;, home to 3,500 Mountain Jews, whose forefathers came from Iran and Iraq a few thousand years ago, and who live today in perfect tranquillity. Rav Adam runs the yeshiva religious school and preaches tolerance and love to his skullcapped charges. In Soviet times one of the synagogues became a sock factory; now restored it commands a view of the wide river and the shiny mosque on the opposite bank.     A wedding party at Ganja.    Oil wealth means that Azerbaijan is developing fast, but outside Baku time is still a commodity to be spent freely on many small pleasures. Over many pots of tea, I muse that Azerbaijan isn&apos;t everyone&apos;s cuppa, but if you&apos;re an aficionado of post-industrial ruins, of amazing nature, of exotic headgear, of world history, of kind gentleness and wild strangeness, Azerbaijan will surely light your fire. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 May 2011.

Absolutely ram-a-jam, chock-full: hundreds of holidaying workers walking arm in arm along promenades, giggling as they lean over railings, perching atop one another&apos;s knees on beaches so pebbly that every deckchair looks as though it&apos;s about to snap shut and swallow them. Where did they go, those people? Why did they abandon Blackpool and Skegness and Margate and Rye? The usual line is that, some time in the 70s, the holidaying Brits discovered the package tour and departed en masse to southern Spain and Florida and, now, to Dubai. That&apos;s true. But an awful lot of their children decided to go to festivals. Over the past decade, festivals have become more and more like old-fashioned holidays. You book upfront. You take your mates, or your family, as you prefer. You camp if you&apos;re poor or you B&amp;B if you&apos;re not. You make an entire week out of what used to be a long weekend: rocking up to site on Wednesday night, leaving late Monday, so you&apos;ve got Tuesday to recover before you&apos;re back to work the next day. Like those ancient seaside jaunts, festivals are properly communal experiences. Like campsites or Butlins or end-of-the-pier shows, festivals are nothing without you and everyone else, all those similarly fun-seeking strangers that you end up having a laugh with, dancing with, running away with, running away from. All laughs are a zillion times more hilarious when you&apos;re surrounded by strangers. The music business would have you believe that festivals are about who&apos;s playing: U2, Beyonc\u00e9, the Cure, the National, Rastamouse. And they are, for the music business. Playing live is how most bands make their money and the biggest earn a fortune during the festival season. But for us punters, the headliners are a minor part of the appeal. I know of a teenager who informed her parents that she was going to Reading this year. When they said: &quot;Why, who&apos;s playing?&quot;, she didn&apos;t know. She wants to go, not because of My Chemical Romance. Not because of Pulp. Not even because of a Reading crowd&apos;s long-term dedication to the idea that it&apos;s entertaining to burn bin-bags of an evening. But because everyone else is going. Hanging out with a group of like-minded people is the stuff of life, but these days, your friends aren&apos;t enough. Everyone&apos;s searching for a crowd. Not only virtually \u2013 how many lonely evenings have been saved by Facebook or Twitter? \u2013 but offline too. As society becomes more atomised, as we live more singly, there&apos;s something thrilling about hanging out in a big group, whether that&apos;s at a football match, a royal wedding or crammed in a small urban space surrounded by policemen who won&apos;t let you out to have a wee. It&apos;s all about the throng, the swarm, the get-together. Mobile phone companies build campaigns around flash-mobs. The BBC spends our licence fee on Radio 1&apos;s Big Weekend and the Proms (good things). There are now so many festivals that you could spend your whole summer bouncing from one to another, whether you fancy communing with people who are into books, comedy, music or watching military aircraft fly by in choreographed patterns. I actually don&apos;t know anyone over 18 who hasn&apos;t been to a festival in their time. It&apos;s what we do now, as a nation. It&apos;s how we relax. You know how your gran says: &quot;We made our own fun back then?&quot; We still do. The celebrity entertainment might be what gets the column inches, but it&apos;s pretty irrelevant to your good time. Even the weather doesn&apos;t matter that much. It&apos;s the crowd that makes the fun. A mass of people all doing much the same thing will start acting as one entity very quickly. Like Twitter, with its hashtags and quick-to-conform opinion, a crowd knows what it thinks. If a band is boring, the crowd lets them know: drifts away, or doesn&apos;t respond, or starts singing something else. If, however, a band \u2013 or a speaker, or a comedian, or an actor \u2013 does what the audience wants, then the atmosphere at a festival is second to none. Which leaves the photos. We need a documentary snapper to start taking proper pictures. Of parades of spacemen at Bestival. Of befuddled hordes on the train-track to Lost Vagueness. Polite Hay-goers queuing for Alexander McCall Smith. Head-phoned ravers at a silent club tent. Someone should document them properly, take festivals seriously as the UK&apos;s chosen form of recreation. Because, in the future, when we holiday in a different way \u2013 all staying at home and Skyping in sync? \u2013 such photos will seem as heartbreaking, as optimistic and quaint as those pictures of packed piers and seaside treats.", "title": "How music festivals have replaced seaside holidays", "sentences": ["The usual line is that, some time in the 70s, the holidaying Brits discovered the package tour and departed en masse to southern Spain and Florida and, now, to Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-21T23:05:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/may/22/bbc-north-mediacityuk-salford-quays-review", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Culture", "BBC", "Norman Foster"], "article": "The BBC has long been bipolar when it comes to its buildings. The balance of power has long swung between its visionaries and bean-counters, at least since the rising architect Norman Foster designed a dazzling new building for BBC Radio in 1982, only for it to be scrapped in favour of some dim sheds in White City. Early in the last decade the Beeb tried to play Medici again, lining up an array of distinguished and up-and-coming practices: Sir David Chipperfield, Sir Richard MacCormac, Foreign Office Architects. There was much talk of creating buildings equal to the majesty and history of the organisation. This time the visionaries got further before the bean-counters chopped their legs off. MacCormac&apos;s extension of Broadcasting House and Chipperfield&apos;s BBC Scotland in Glasgow were both built, but only after both architects had been dumped, in order that their designs could be dumbed down. The creation of BBC North in Salford is the Naseby of the corporation&apos;s Roundheads, the decisive triumph of a managerial New Model Army who trounced the Prince Ruperts and their fancy architects, and dispatched them to oblivion. This group of three glass buildings, which now houses 13% of the BBC&apos;s public service staff, is so scrupulously practical and self-effacing, so determined to avoid any suggestion of wasting licence fees, that it is hard to know it is there at all. &quot;Nation shall speak peace unto nation&quot; is not carved here in stone, as it is in Broadcasting House, not least because there is little stone in which to carve it, apart from some cheap paving from China. BBC North is the result of a deal signed with the property developers Peel Holdings, following a bidding process in which other sites, including the centre of Manchester, were considered. The Peel Holdings offer was to make something with the web-friendly brand name of MediaCityUK, which would include huge production studios laid on by the management, the media studies department of Salford University, and other media companies. ITV would later take a building on the site, and the new Coronation Street is being built nearby, in full view of the BBC&apos;s offices. Faced with fierce competition from new media and the forces of Murdoch, former rivals now like to huddle together for comfort. MediaCityUK&apos;s avowed inspirations are places like Internet City and Media City in Dubai, enclaves with special rules that allow businesses to prosper. &quot;The driver was to create a cluster with facilities and infrastructure,&quot; say Peel, clunkily, by which they mean that the different media companies and institutions would benefit from each other&apos;s presence: &quot;students can bump into executive producers&quot;. By taking care of the production studios, they would relieve the BBC of the burden of managing them. Located on a brownfield site by the Manchester Ship Canal, at the end of a 20-minute tram ride from the centre of Manchester, it helps that space here is cheap. And with staff now moving in, less than four years after the deal was signed, delivery was fast and efficient. MediaCityUK stands amid the vast wilderness formed by the devastation of industry under Margaret Thatcher, since filled by chunks of regeneration. It is a land of lumps, of Manchester United&apos;s stadium red and angry as Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s face; of the green dome of Peel Holdings&apos; vast Trafford shopping centre; of the convulsed forms, intended to express anguish, of Daniel Libeskind&apos;s Imperial War Museum, of blocks of contemporary-lifestyle apartments. There are the shiny shapes of the Lowry Centre, and of the Lowry Outlet Mall, with the name of the grumpy old artist standing for everything that is not here. There is nothing less Lowryesque than this landscape of gloss, in which everything \u2013 culture, shopping, the pain of war \u2013 achieves a kind of equivalence. Salford contains some of the most repulsive buildings in Britain, gesticulating monsters designed to lure buy-to-let investors to their doom. It is some relief that MediaCity, apart from a jazzy diamond pattern on ITV&apos;s future premises, has gone for plain glass buildings arranged around a piazza. It offers rather what is best called CostaSpace, as in Costa coffee, the by-now standard form of &quot;public&quot; space in Britain. Like the half-competent cappuccinos and soft furnishings of the coffee chain, CostaSpace offers things that are desirable and reasonable, such as good maintenance, open space, trees and access to waterfronts, yet fail absolutely to capture the essence of the continental coffee bar/public piazza which are the supposed models. What is lacking is a sense of spontaneity, individual enterprise or, ultimately, freedom. Everything is laid on, planned, managed in advance, plotted in powerpoints and business plans. Desire is programmed: a spiritless tower of flats is called the Heart, so that you might know in the absence of other evidence that is where the home is. The Dubai models for MediaCity are gated and controlled, and help sustain an illiberal and divided society, and while the Salford version is less extreme, private security still prevents behaviour thought inappropriate. When I ask BBC people if they won&apos;t miss the liveliness of a city centre, they give the same answer: there is a Costa here, and will be a Booths food store, and a Prezzo, and a WHSmith. Really? Is that all there is to life? Do they truly want to spend their days somewhere like the concourse of a medium-sized railway station?     Inside BBC North is \u2018a domestic, sometimes childlike feel that tries to bring some of the vivacity elsewhere lacking\u2019. Photograph: Jon Super    The BBC&apos;s departments, including sport, children&apos;s, Radio 5 Live and breakfast news, are spread around three buildings whose design was started by Wilkinson Eyre Architects and finished by Chapman Taylor. Inside they are fitted out to designs by ID:SR, with open plan everywhere, and cheerful dabs of colour and patterned wallpaper, and a domestic, sometimes childlike feel that tries to bring some of the vivacity elsewhere lacking. It looks well-organised and sensible. Extravagance is avoided: images of the 1958 classic Artichoke light are printed on the wallpaper, presumably because the real thing was beyond the budget. I meet the BBC people who have organised the installation of the BBC in their new buildings, and I have every reason to think they have done a good job. You can&apos;t blame the BBC for wanting to be efficient and economical. It&apos;s also good that they use their economic might to bring employment to deprived places, even if the supposed beneficiaries, the people of the ordinary streets of Salford, are nearly invisible. But is there really no third way between the pomp of expensive architecture and this place, stripped of ceremony and liveliness and surprise? And should a public body in pursuit of a good idea surrender itself so completely to the priorities of a private development company?

Trouble, it seems, is never far away when the Englishman opens his mouth or logs another entry into his Twitter feed or, as happened last weekend at the Players Championship, tries to finish his round before darkness falls and forces him to come back very early the next morning to play only one hole. The sight of him sprinting around Sawgrass&apos;s famous 17th hole provided just the kind of eye-catching footage that helps golf break out of its niche and interest a broader audience. Alas, it offended some purists, including the doyen of American television&apos;s golf coverage, Johnny Miller. Apparently, the Englishman was disrespecting the game\u00a0\u2013 placing more importance on getting a long lie-in the next day than on playing his best. &quot;I&apos;m stunned at some of the stuff Johnny Miller comes out with sometimes,&quot; Poulter says. &quot;He is very harsh and frankly I find some of the stuff he sees very disrespectful. Yes, I ran to the green and yes I took the flag out quickly. But I prepared to putt in exactly the same way I prepare for every putt \u2013 I lined it up three times. If I had failed to take due care and attention he might have had a point. But I did [take care] and he doesn&apos;t have a point. It is very frustrating.&quot; Poulter is often frustrated when he finds himself in the spotlight for anything other than the quality of his golf but he should not be surprised. In a monochromatic sport he is literally and figuratively a splash of colour. There are benefits to that but there are also drawbacks, not least that the &quot;Poulter causes fuss&quot; headline is halfway round the world before the &quot;Poulter provides plausible explanation&quot; back-story has got its trousers on. It was the same at this year&apos;s Masters, when he was asked if he believed Tiger Woods would finish in the top five (as he had counterintuitively predicted the year before, correctly as it turned\u00a0out). &quot;No ...&quot; started what was a nuanced reply. The next thing he found himself in the midst of a &quot;Poulter v Tiger&quot; firestorm. (&quot;I haven&apos;t spoken to Tiger since but he knows me well enough, and he knows the press well enough, to take that stuff with a pinch of salt. We get on brilliantly, actually.&quot;) It is on such occasions the Englishman instinctively turns to the social network site Twitter, which he believes is his best hope of setting the record straight. &quot;Sometimes how I explain myself to the media can come across in a slightly different way to how I would mean to say things,&quot; he says. &quot;I get pissed off if I feel someone hasn&apos;t written the story in the way that I tried to explain because people&apos;s and fans&apos; opinions of me get swayed one way or another by what they read in the papers. With Twitter I am in control of whatever it is I\u00a0want to say.&quot; Clearly, people are interested in what Poulter has to say. More than one million followers cannot be wrong, although surely some of them will have been taken aback by what passes as &quot;banter&quot; in the world\u00a0of professional golfer. Most of the leading European players are on Twitter these days. If they use the medium to communicate with their fans, they also use it to bait each other. It is fun, insightful and occasionally brutal \u2013 witness the &quot;choker&quot; road sign Poulter tweeted to Rory McIlroy in the immediate aftermath of the Northern Irishman&apos;s final-round calamity at the Masters. &quot;It&apos;s the same kind of thing that happens in a football changing room; practical jokes and guys taking the piss out of one another,&quot; Poulter says. &quot;I think it is quite good bonding, actually. I have got closer to some of the guys through Twitter. I don&apos;t need to name names but I have found I have more of a connection with some players than I did before \u2013 not to say that I wasn&apos;t friends with them anyway but just that I&apos;m better friends with them now. This game gets stressful enough. We do take it seriously, but sometimes you have to break it down and laugh at the silly mistakes you make. It helps you get over things quicker.&quot; Maybe so, but what about that tweet to McIlroy? &quot;We have both been ribbing each other \u2013 tweet after another after another \u2013 but I did wonder about that one. But where do you draw the line?&quot; he says. &quot;I spoke to Rory this week [in Spain] about that one. It was the first time I have seen him face-to-face since sending it. I said &apos;I hope you didn&apos;t take offence&apos; and he said: &apos;Listen, it was all fine. I was firing at you and you fired back nicely.&apos; Obviously, Rory is going to get me at some stage.&quot; Obviously McIlroy will, and maybe as soon as this week, when the cream of European golf get together at Wentworth for the BMW Championship, the flagship event of the European Tour season. In the newly merciless world of professional golf, Poulter will arrive there in a vulnerable position, coming off the back of a run of mediocre form that stretches back to the start of this year. In 12 events he has managed only one top-10 finish and that came at the Tournament of Champions in Hawaii \u2013a limited field curtain-raiser to the PGA Tour season. &quot;I have just had a spell of not holing putts and it&apos;s been really frustrating,&quot; he says. &quot;I am working on my putting to try and get it right but sometimes the harder you try, the more frustrated you become. You get to the stage you say: &apos;Oh bollocks to it, I am just going to go and play golf.&quot; He sounds a little worried. Is he? &quot;I have been in this position more than once or twice in my career, where I haven&apos;t played well for four months or five months, then all of a sudden it clicks, like at the end of last season when I was nowhere in the Race to Dubai and end up finishing fourth,&quot; he says. &quot;Golf is like that. It is easy to turn round. But right now I need to make that happen.&quot; He had better make it happen, the sooner the better.

Maria Sharapova is the Sugar Ray of tennis. She stands 6ft 2in on legs of alabaster, her blonde hair silky atop a face from Vogue and she talks with the demure calm of Ingrid Bergman \u2013 but the Russian is as tough as anyone on the women&apos;s circuit, or maybe the men&apos;s for that matter. Few players belie their image so starkly. Martina Hingis, welcoming Sharapova&apos;s return to form after a disturbing longueur, described her this week as &quot;a great competitor, so strong in the mind&quot;. As she reaches for a career grand slam on the most demanding of the game&apos;s three surfaces, the seventh seed will need all that resolve and more to prevail in a French Open field stripped of the Williams sisters but still full of landmines. And there can be little denying hers would be a popular win in both the stands and the corporate boxes; she is tennis gold dust. When she withdrew from tournaments in Paris, Doha and Dubai in February with a viral illness, panic spread among sponsors and tournament organisers, but her rehabilitation looked secure in Rome last weekend when she produced some impressive form to win her 23rd WTA title. She beat the world No1, Caroline Wozniacki, on her way to the Masters final, where she made short work of the Australian Sam Stosur. A feature of her game was her resolve under pressure, as the strokes began to flow fluidly again and her smile returned. Never as open as her image suggests, she was nevertheless a happy player in victory, batting away the predictable questions with patience and pointing out to those who could not work it out from the evidence in front of them that there was still a little work to do. Arriving in Paris, her confidence buoyed, she was asked if she thought she had re-entered the frontline of contenders again. &quot;I think that&apos;s more of your job [to judge] than mine,&quot; she said. &quot;My job is to go out and play tennis, and I was really happy with the way last week turned out. I played great tennis. I had some great matches and wins over good players.&quot; But the prosaic is rarely good enough for Sharapova&apos;s ever-drooling audience. She did say, though, that she thought Kim Clijsters, also coming back and seeded second, was favourite to win ahead of Wozniacki \u2013 and Clijsters is on her side of the draw. So she cannot be accused of complacency. Her first match is straightforward enough, against the one-time Croatian prodigy Mirjana Lucic. At 29, though, Lucic&apos;s best days are a long way behind her. There are three British players in the draw \u2013 and the very slimmest of chances that two of them, Elena Baltacha and Heather Watson, could meet in the quarter\u2011finals. Baltacha meets a qualifier, the young American Sloane Stephens, while Watson, who is on the rise, plays France&apos;s St\u00e9phanie Foretz Gacon. But to progress to an all-British match, Baltacha would almost certainly have to get past ninth seed Petra Kvitova, and Watson has fourth seed Victoria Azarenka in her way. So, unlikely. Anne Keothavong&apos;s task on the other side of the draw is no picnic. She has the 21-year-old Russian Vesna Dolonts, ranked 111th, in the first round \u2013 but the defending champion, Francesca Schiavone, waiting for her after that, provided the Italian gets past another young American hope, Melanie Oudin. If Clijsters, who specialises in coming from nowhere to shock the world and is the WTA&apos;s Player of the Year, finds form quickly, she should go deep into the tournament. Whether she has enough to get past the redoubtable Sharapova, we will not learn until the semi-finals, and that could be the match of the tournament.", "title": "Reborn Maria Sharapova gunning for career grand slam at French Open", "sentences": ["When she withdrew from tournaments in Paris, Doha and Dubai in February with a viral illness, panic spread among sponsors and tournament organisers, but her rehabilitation looked secure in Rome last weekend when she produced some impressive form to win her 23rd WTA title."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-21T23:07:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/may/22/horse-racing", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Gitano Hernando, formerly with Marco Botti at Newmarket but now trained by South African Herman Brown, although the horse has never yet visited his new homeland, won the S$3,000,000 (\u00a31.5m) Singapore Airlines International Cup at Kranji on Sunday with a burst of speed that took him to the lead early in the straight and stamina which kept him going right to the line as pursuers vainly tried to claw him back. To general amazement many fans&apos; idea of the most likely winner, the Hong Kong Gold Cup winner California Memory, a confirmed hold up horse, was sent on from the start by Matthew Chadwick, and his famed finishing kick was lost long before the business end of the race. Gitano Hernando&apos;s jockey, the British born but South African resident Glyn Schofield, took the perfect opportunity to sit on the leader&apos;s shoulder, kick early in the straight and make the most of his horse&apos;s resolution. South African champion mare River Jetez led the final pursuers but could get no closer than the half length by which she was beaten, with former German 2,000 Guineas winner Irian, now trained in Hong Kong by John Moore, deadheating with last year&apos;s fourth, the locally trained Waikato, a length away in third. Richard Hughes on Presvis could never get near the leaders as he chased a steady pace that saw the 10f completed in the relatively slow time for the course of 2.03.93 and finished 10th of the twelve runners, while Wigmore Hall, trained by Michael Bell, kept on for seventh, beaten a total of around five lengths. If there was any bitterness on a great night for South African racing connections it was the thought that the brave winner is owned by Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, a person whose personal form is unappealing to say the least, but otherwise it was a satisfying performance by a horse who has clearly come to himself in maturity and is already being talked of as a potential Melbourne Cup winner. There was no real money to be made out of Rocket Man&apos;s imperious victory in the KrisFlyer International Sprint, but there is quite ridiculous pleasure in seeing a good horse do exactly what you expect him to and when that horse is the standard bearer of an entire nation&apos;s racing the rush is amplified to an absurd extent. On the local tote Singapore&apos;s national hero started at his now regular odds of 1-5, and only if you had the foresight to visualise a situation in which neither of the much vaunted Hong Kong duo of Sacred Kingdom and Green Birdie could get in a blow at him and the supposedly best of the Singaporean rest could do no more than examine his retreating tail could you have turned any sort of profit on the race. But this was not really about the financial end of racing but about the emotional side. Rocket Man jumped fastest of all and that in itself drew a huge cheer from the crowd. Then Better Be The One and Perfect Pins, no respecters of persons clearly, pushed up on the inside to deprive him of the easy lead that would have ended all semblance of competition. The cheering resumed with renewed force when Felix Coetzee asked Rocket Man to take over at the top of the straight, and continued all down the straight as Rocket Man righted the wrong of the past two seasons when he was defeated by about the width of a man&apos;s arms in the island nation&apos;s only international sprint. After his victory in the Dubai Golden Shaheen it might be reasonable in any normal year to assume that Rocket Man, whose record now reads 16 victories and four very close seconds from 20 starts, has established himself as the fastest horse on earth. But normality doesn&apos;t reign at the moment and fans of Frankel and Black Caviar will no doubt dispute the claim of the Asian champion&apos;s besotted trainer, South African Patrick Shaw, that: &quot;I know I&apos;m biased but I don&apos;t care. He is the best in the world.&quot; Fellow South African Felix Coetzee, the man who rode Silent Witness, the other Asian champion worth mentioning in the same breath as Rocket Man, was almost equally convinced. &quot;He was just so good when he changed legs to pick them up as they turned in,&quot; he said. &quot;Oh I don&apos;t know I shouldn&apos;t have hit him, but, but you just want to make sure, don&apos;t you? These champions just tell you what to do. They do it all for you.&quot; Ascot and the Golden Jubilee now await, and Nick Smith, Ascot&apos;s international recruiter who was present and willing to put bags over people&apos;s heads if that was what it took to get Rocket Man to Berkshire may not even have to twist any arms to get him on the plane.

As the protest movement against President Bashar al-Assad has accelerated, intensified and then reeled in the face of a brutal crackdown, tourist numbers have dried up - and the country has lost a vital source of income and foreign currency. The impact on an already weakened economy is palpable. &quot;I have made nothing this week,&quot; says one seller on the old city&apos;s Straight Street, adding that the situation was even worse in other cities. After three months of unrest and crackdowns, tourism is not the only industry that is suffering. &quot;The whole economy is grinding to a halt,&quot; says one local economic analyst, who asked for anonymity. Some business owners have laid off workers, shortened working hours or reduced employees&apos; pay. Small-scale traders say business is down while manufacturers report difficulties in getting their goods to market. &quot;I have to fly my goods out as I cannot rely on the road to be open or passable,&quot; says one clothing manufacturer. &quot;It costs me so much more but I can&apos;t raise my prices.&quot; Big businesses are also feeling the pain. Before the recent unrest, Syria&apos;s economy - based primarily on agriculture and manufacturing - was already struggling. Liberalisation since 2005 caused inflation to soar to 15% in 2008 and cheaper goods coming in from Turkey and China have forced many manufacturers out of business, especially textiles factories in Aleppo. Drought has also caused thousands to migrate to the cities from rural areas. In recent years, Syria&apos;s government started to encourage foreign investment, with French supermarket Carrefour and the cafe chain Costa opening branches in the country. But many foreign investors are starting to consider pulling out and the trend is likely to be accelerated by the imposition of international sanctions on Assad and other senior officials. Qatar Electricity and Water has cancelled a $900m (\u00a3558m) project to build power plants. British companies are reported to be considering pulling out. &quot;Capital is flying out the country and the brain drain is increasing as some professionals look to relocate to Dubai and Paris,&quot; says the analyst. Dollars are scarce in Damascus and the Syrian pound has fallen on the black market. Shortages have not yet been reported, although rumours of a run on bread led to long queues at bakeries. Economic woes, and the economic dominance of friends and relatives of the president, have been one of the sparks of the protests. Much of the anger has focused on Rami Makhlouf, Assad&apos;s cousin whose interests in telecommunications, transport, banking, tourism, real estate and construction dominate the economy. Foreign and local investors are often forced to partner with Makhlouf, earning him the nickname Mr Ten Percent. With protests failing to gain momentum, some opposition activists are looking to the Sunni merchants of Damascus and Aleppo for signs they might join the fray. But business leaders remain wary and even the most disaffected are more likely to leave the country than protest, according to the analyst: &quot;It is easier to go to Dubai than try to turn against the regime - they have too much to lose.&quot; But Assad may only be putting off the inevitable. As the government seeks to appease protesters, it has reversed economic policy, stemming plans to cut subsidies and pledged pay rises and extra jobs in an already burgeoning public sector. This has found favour with some ordinary families but is unaffordable in the long term. Inflation is almost certain to rise as the government signs up a company to print more money. Investor confidence has dropped and EU sanctions on Makhlouf, who is already under US sanctions, will make people wary of dealing with him. &quot;I want stability,&quot; says one shopkeeper in the new area of the city. &quot;But if none of us can make money, maybe I will consider protesting.&quot; Nidaa Hassan is the pseudonym of a reporter in Syria", "title": "Syrian business dries up after Assad's crackdown on dissent", "sentences": ["&quot;Capital is flying out the country and the brain drain is increasing as some professionals look to relocate to Dubai and Paris,&quot; says the analyst.", "But business leaders remain wary and even the most disaffected are more likely to leave the country than protest, according to the analyst: &quot;It is easier to go to Dubai than try to turn against the regime - they have too much to lose.&quot; But Assad may only be putting off the inevitable."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-23T12:55:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/may/23/teachers-leave-uk-work-abroad", "tags": ["Teaching", "United Arab Emirates", "Schools", "Education"], "article": "Beverley Wade is poised to sever her final ties with Britain. She has sold her horse and her house in Kent. And got rid of the dog, too. It has been a heartbreaking process. Wade, an English teacher, saw no other way to clear her debts. Wade is disillusioned with the cost of living and what she sees as a lack of respect for teachers. After 13 years teaching in secondary schools, she is also disenchanted with the education system. It has, she says, succeeded in building many &quot;flashy&quot; new schools, but failed to fix the more fundamental problems faced by many of the pupils inside them. So Wade is off to the Gulf. Tempted by sunshine, a generous tax-free salary and a free furnished apartment, she has got herself a job in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates. Oozing with oil dollars, the UAE is an oasis of relative political stability in this troubled region. &quot;From the moment I step on their soil, they&apos;re going to be putting me up in five-star hotels,&quot; says Wade. &quot;I&apos;m thinking of staying as long as possible. I&apos;ll be able to save money. The weather will be glorious and there&apos;ll be horses, too.&quot; More than 70,000 teachers have left the UK for sunnier climes in recent years. Usually, they head for the fee-paying international schools, the rapidly growing sector that caters for the children of expats or wealthy locals. But Wade is not destined for quite such a comfortable setting. She is going to work in Abu Dhabi&apos;s state system. The emirates&apos; 300-plus state schools are the focus of an ambitious 10-year plan, launched in 2009 by the ruling Sheikh Khalifa. He aims to raise a sophisticated and entrepreneurial workforce. A new curriculum is being introduced and all children are to become Arab-English bilinguals \u2013 which is where Wade fits in. A recruitment drive swept up 1,000 English-speaking teachers last year and is aiming for another 1,100 this year. The recruits are lured by tax-free salaries of up to \u00a340,000, depending on experience, and free accommodation. Should Wade ever meet the Sheikh, she would discover that he shares her passion for horses \u2013 though he is unlikely to have got backache mucking out a stable on a wet winter&apos;s evening after a hard day at school. Similarly, with a fortune in excess of \u00a310bn, he would probably struggle to relate to her difficulty financing her hobby. &quot;When I had the horse bug, I didn&apos;t save a penny,&quot; says Wade. &quot;But now I haven&apos;t got anything. I&apos;ve got to start from scratch and be sensible. In England, saving money is so difficult. You&apos;re usually locked into a mortgage, trying to run a car and chasing your tail trying to pay everything off.&quot; Wade should be able to save about half her salary in Abu Dhabi, according to Diane Jacoutot, general manager of Teachanywhere.com, the recruitment company scouring the world for staff. Aside from the money, she says, the cities of Abu Dhabi and Dubai offer a relatively westernised society, with beaches, malls, bars and restaurants \u2013 never mind the opportunity to try hang-gliding, scuba-diving and dune-bashing. For teachers with at least three years&apos; experience, Jacoutot says this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. &quot;It&apos;s really exciting and completely fascinating for a government to try to change its society through education.&quot; Plus it&apos;s a good time for teachers to get out of the UK, according to recruitment expert John Howson. &quot;We&apos;ve been training teachers like crazy. Now there&apos;s a recession and secondary pupil numbers are falling. The era of plenty is over and people are being made redundant.&quot; One of those is Sheelagh Lundy, another Abu Dhabi recruit. For nearly a decade, Lundy has worked teaching nine- to 12-year-olds at the Playing for Success centre at Manchester City football club. The after-school project, intended to raise standards in literacy, numeracy and ICT, ran at all the Premier League clubs for 11 years, but is now dead \u2013 a victim of the public-sector cuts. &quot;As a teacher at the top of the scale, I knew it would be hard to get another job in England,&quot; says Lundy. &quot;My husband and I always wanted to travel \u2013 we&apos;re just doing it a little sooner than we intended.&quot; Lundy says she is impressed by the way the leaders of the UAE &quot;want their children to be able to compete with the western world and are willing to do what they can to achieve that. &quot;I&apos;m not ignoring the financial incentives, but it is just as important for me to think that my skills are in demand.&quot; Lundy concedes she is taking a big step \u2013 especially as not all the teachers in whose footsteps she is following have had good experiences. Some say they lacked support and were resented by Arab colleagues. Others complain about bureaucracy and the greed of the western companies helping to implement the 10-year plan. The recruits also face the uncertainty of not knowing where they will be working until they get to Abu Dhabi. And the standard of state schools is variable. &quot;You can get lucky and get a school that is well-resourced \u2013 the sort of school we&apos;re used to,&quot; says Alan Moody, who will be flying out with his wife and seven-month-old daughter. &quot;I kind of hope I don&apos;t get lucky.&quot; Before he qualified, Moody spent some time helping out at a Masai village school in Kenya. It made him determined not to work in an international school. &quot;I need to be challenged,&quot; he says. Since qualifying three years ago, Moody has worked at the outstanding Beeston Hill St Luke&apos;s primary in Leeds. But England was only ever going to be a stepping stone. &quot;I grew up in Dublin and came over here to train as a teacher,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve always wanted to work abroad and, like everyone in public service, I want to effect the biggest change I can within my field. This is a great opportunity for me to be at the cutting edge of something new \u2013 a personal and professional challenge.&quot; Is he worried about moving to the Middle East with a baby when parts of the region are in such turmoil? No, he says. &quot;Though everyone else has a heart attack when we tell them. But we&apos;ve always liked going against the norm and trying to prove people wrong.&quot; Moody is not fazed by the prospect of walking into a classroom where no one speaks English. His experience in a multicultural primary has prepared him, he says, and he has had the foresight to get a Saudi Arabian friend to teach him all the swear words \u2013 &quot;so I&apos;ll know what they&apos;re calling me&quot;.

He was about to turn from model citizen into a terror suspect, one of 85,000 people who met a similar fate that year. Officers met the couple just after they got off the flight from Stansted and told them Ahmed needed to come with them for a &quot;normal check&quot;. The couple were returning from a weekend break and Ahmed saw no reason why he might be suspected of anything. Indeed, after London was attacked by terrorists in July 2005, Ahmed worked for the mayor of London and in Scotland to improve relations between Muslims and the rest of the population. He was taken to a room by two officers who told him they were from special branch, a police department that deals in intelligence and security matters. Ahmed, 28, was told he was being questioned under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. When he asked why, an officer replied: &quot;No reason, it is just a random stop.&quot; Ahmed told them they had stopped the only two people on the flight who looked like Muslims. They said they did not know he was Muslim, which he did not believe. The officers Ahmed remembers were detectives \u2013 a sergeant and a constable. They did not give their names but did give their identification numbers. Ahmed says he felt compelled to answer their questions: &quot;I had no choice, I was told I had no right to refuse.&quot; He says the officers told him that if he exercised the right to remain silent, he could be detained further and eventually face jail. Ahmed says he was questioned about his job, where he prayed, the Muslim groups he was active in. He was asked for a definition of extremism and what he would do if he found out someone was going to carry out an act of terrorism. He got the answer to that correct: he would tell the police. In another room his wife was questioned. She was upset about being asked details about her sister, who was seriously ill at the time. Ahmed says the policemen interviewing him kept saying that he and his wife, studying for a PhD in political science, were &quot;interesting people&quot;. Then one of the officers asked if he would become a spy: &quot;They asked if I would like to work with special branch, to keep an eye on the Muslim community in Edinburgh ... They asked me three times. They said do it covertly.&quot; He refused. A similar scene played out at Stansted on 31 December 2007. Abdullah, a youth worker from east London, had returned from a Haj tour in Saudi Arabia with a tour group. &quot;I was told that there was a problem with my passport and two white men in dark suits approached me and said that they needed to talk to me.&quot; They were police officers and he was taken to a room: &quot;I was told that I had been stopped under terrorism-related legislation ... I was given a sheet of paper that basically said that they were allowed by law to do this to me and I\u00a0needed to comply with questioning.&quot; He was asked about his family, how his trip had been paid for, which mosque he prayed at and if he had &quot;any additional training or skills&quot;. His mobile phones were taken away and searched. Then his questioning was disrupted by the arrival of another man, who said he was called Matthew, and a woman. &quot;They were casually dressed and took over from the previous two men. They introduced themselves as MI5. I was concerned why MI5 would want to speak to me and listened attentively.&quot; In a written statement Abdullah says the officers quizzed him and said his &quot;name had come up in circles discussing terrorist activity and it was up to me to prove where I stood. They wanted my help in tackling potential terrorists and related activity&quot;. He added: &quot;They showed me some photos of a number individuals. I knew most of them well as they were friends and local associates. Some I didn&apos;t recognise and one I wasn&apos;t too sure about. &quot;This was the one they pressed me on. They also wanted details about the individuals that I knew, which I provided. I tried to be as co-operative as possible and in the end they took my number and left me theirs. &quot;Strangely, Matthew insisted that I save it discreetly under work or taxi. I was then escorted out and was free to leave.&quot; Abdullah believes MI5 wanted to turn him into a spy. &quot;Matthew called me several times to arrange a follow-up meeting. He said he wanted me to help him in the work MI5 does. We had a phone discussion and I said that I thought that what they were trying to do was noble but I had reservations about the way in which they operate on an ethical level and was uncomfortable with that. He insisted that I meet him and said that &apos;it was in my long-term interest&apos; to do so.&quot; A meeting was arranged for 22 January 2008 outside a tube station. &quot;I was told to meet Matthew outside Farringdon station but was directed by phone from there to a nearby location and Matthew walked with me to a hotel.&quot; He said he was asked about &quot;my personal and work details \u2013 past and present. I mentioned here that I had visited Egypt in the summer of 2004 for six months to study Arabic. &quot;I was asked about my future plans \u2013 I mentioned that I planned to return to Egypt shortly to continue with my Arabic and Islamic studies. &quot;He mentioned that he really wanted me to help him with the photos. I said that I had already told him what I knew. &quot;In the end Matthew said that he wanted to meet me again but I wasn&apos;t so sure any more as I could see that something was wrong.&quot; Despite telling MI5 he was not interested, the barrage of calls and texts pleading for a meeting just kept coming. After that &quot;Matthew called me a few times to arrange a further meeting. He gave me a mobile number but I decided that I didn&apos;t want to have any more contact.&quot; By mid-February Abdullah was fed up. &quot;I texted Matthew to explicitly say I wasn&apos;t interested in any further contact and for him not to contact me anymore,&quot; he said. &quot;I also mentioned that if I did have any information about any threat, terrorist or otherwise, that I would naturally report it to the police. I then called my phone provider and changed my number.&quot; In May 2008, Matthew obtained the new number and called again. He wanted information, which Abdullah said he did not have. But the MI5 officer, Abdullah alleges, made a threat. &quot;He said I needed to see him before I travelled to Egypt, for my own good. Otherwise I would find it difficult over there because they had &apos;international partners&apos;.&quot; Abdullah said: &quot;He was threatening me \u2013 if I go to Egypt, I might be arrested and ill treated. I took it as a threat. They could have me arrested, and tortured there. It was quite clear.&quot; There is no independent evidence to support the claims that police and MI5 are abusing schedule 7 stop and search powers by trying to turn innocent people into informers. But there is a consistency of testimony from those who have been stopped and pressured to inform. Solicitor Alastair Lyon, who has advised dozens affected by schedule 7, said: &quot;This is a power which has sowed fear in the most vulnerable of our communities. The security services and special branch are operating in an unregulated and unchecked way without legal observers, to put pressure on people. This is a legal black hole allowing them to question thousands of people about very personal details without any of the usual human rights safeguards.&quot; He added: &quot;It has created a legal black hole where personal and sensitive information is, on pain of imprisonment, forced from individuals who are told that in effect they have no rights. It is a complete abuse of authority.&quot; For youth worker Mohammed, the link between his being stopped under schedule 7 and other approaches is clear. For a year security service officers tried to recruit him, approaching him at home, in the street, even as he ate at a tandoori restaurant. One of them, called Jeff, showed him pictures of various people. Then on 5 November 2008, he was stopped at Stansted airport while returning from Spain and taken to a room. Mohammed said: &quot;Then Tim came in. [He] showed me a badge and said he&apos;s from MI5. He spoke about Jeff. &apos;He&apos;s been trying to meet me but you haven&apos;t responded,&apos; said Tim. &quot;He reminded me that he is working for my best interest: he doesn&apos;t want this to come out, doesn&apos;t want for my workplace to become dirtied, my reputation \u2013 as if I&apos;ve got something to hide and I&apos;ve done something wrong in the first place.&quot; He added: &quot;We know that you went to a terror camp, transited in Dubai and changed passports. We know you went to Dubai in 2006 and met AQ figures.&quot; Mohammed said: &quot;I told him these were crazy allegations and how would they have this info anyway.&quot; Tim said: &quot;We don&apos;t need to go there ourselves, we have info from locals.&quot; Mohammed was let go with the promise that Tim would be in touch. He did indeed call several days later, but Mohammed did not reply. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 May 2011 to remove text that was inconsistent with Guardian editorial guidelines.", "title": "Terrorism Act: 'They asked me to keep an eye on the Muslim community'", "sentences": ["&quot;He reminded me that he is working for my best interest: he doesn&apos;t want this to come out, doesn&apos;t want for my workplace to become dirtied, my reputation \u2013 as if I&apos;ve got something to hide and I&apos;ve done something wrong in the first place.&quot; He added: &quot;We know that you went to a terror camp, transited in Dubai and changed passports.", "We know you went to Dubai in 2006 and met AQ figures.&quot; Mohammed said: &quot;I told him these were crazy allegations and how would they have this info anyway.&quot; Tim said: &quot;We don&apos;t need to go there ourselves, we have info from locals.&quot; Mohammed was let go with the promise that Tim would be in touch."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-23T22:09:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/may/24/mahela-jayawardene-sri-lanka-attack-interview", "tags": ["Sri Lanka cricket team", "Sri Lanka in England 2011", "England cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "You should have seen me a few days ago, when I was really knackered,&quot; Mahela Jayawardene says, his face crinkling with amusement as he remembers his arrival in England last week. Three days before Thursday&apos;s start of the first Test against England in Cardiff, and having flown in from the Indian Premier League, Jayawardene appears less concerned with adapting to Test cricket than charting his recovery from exhaustion and jet\u2011lag. &quot;I had four flights in 30 hours,&quot; he says, &quot;with two in India and then from Colombo to Dubai and on to London. And as soon as we landed I travelled to Derby for the game against the England Lions [which finished on Sunday]. It was good to win, because they had a good team, and I&apos;m not so tired now.&quot; Jayawardene laughs, having conceded that his rigorous schedule is driven in part by the lucrative demands of limited-overs cricket. Having helped Sri Lanka to reach the World Cup final in early April, when even his beautifully-constructed century could not prevent India&apos;s victory, he immediately set off for the IPL to captain the Kochi Tuskers. Risking the wrath of the Sri Lankan authorities, Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara arrived late in England for this three-match Test series. But such incessant cricket also makes the 33-year-old become more serious. &quot;Over the last three months I&apos;ve spent less than 24 hours in my own home,&quot; he says. &quot;It can be tough to keep your hunger, especially between games. As soon as you wake on the morning of a game then the hunger to get a hundred or win a match is there. But in-between matches you feel tired and a bit down sometimes.&quot; Jayawardene has played 116 Tests, and with a batting average of 53.82 he is one of the great modern cricketers, but he feels empathy with an international journeyman like Michael Yardy \u2013 who returned home early from the World Cup because of depression. &quot;We definitely sympathise with him. We all go through tough periods when you&apos;re really down and not performing,&quot; he says. &quot;The schedule is hard and it&apos;s\u00a0not an individual sport like golf when you can\u00a0take a couple of weeks off. But you&apos;re not going to play cricket forever. You&apos;ve got about a 15-year span. You have to enjoy it and when it&apos;s over there&apos;ll be time to reflect.&quot; Jayawardene, however, has endured experiences which induce reflection even amid his relentless travelling and playing. In March 2009, when still captaining Sri\u00a0Lanka, he and his team were targeted by a terrorist group in Pakistan. &quot;I still get flashbacks,&quot; he says of that day in Lahore when a dozen masked gunmen attacked them. &quot;At first, the guys were saying, &apos;Why would anyone let off crackers at eight in the morning?&apos; But then someone shouted: &apos;No, they&apos;re shooting at us \u2013 get down.&apos;&quot; Jayawardene flinches at the memory, but his voice is clear when asked if he thought that he would die as bullets smashed into the bus. &quot;Definitely. Two or\u00a0three times, lying on the floor, I thought, &apos;There is no way we&apos;re going to get through this.&apos; There was no talking \u2013 just screaming and shouting. Whenever anyone got hit by shrapnel they would scream. We were very, very lucky to be alive at the end of it.&quot; Six people died: five policemen and the driver of the coach carrying the umpires and match referee. &quot;We were very angry when we get off the bus and it took us a long time to calm down,&quot; Jayawardene says. &quot;We were angry that, as innocent people, we had been placed at such risk.\u00a0We had no one to protect us. Obviously we can&apos;t forget the five policemen who died trying to save us. We remember them, dearly, but even those men were left to die. &quot;We know it&apos;s difficult to prevent terrorism but we asked for security and didn&apos;t get it. People died needlessly \u2013 and our wives back home were going crazy. They knew seven of our guys were in hospital and they thought some had died.&quot; Beyond the fact that teams have not toured Pakistan since, have cricket&apos;s administrators learnt from mistakes shaped by greed and political naivety? &quot;Fingers crossed. We need to realize that it is not about money. There is a bigger picture and we need to be more vigilant.&quot; The scars remain. During the World Cup, &quot;we were on a bus in India and crackers went off. A couple of guys almost went down because it was the exact noise we&apos;d heard in Pakistan.&quot; Jayawardene is a composed man, but his serenity has been hard won and stems from personal tragedy. &quot;I was 17 when my brother [Dhishal] died [from a brain tumour]. He was 16 and so it was really devastating. He was a great cricketer and my grandfather always says he was better than me. He was an opening batsman and\u00a0he played in the school side I captained when he was 14. He was too sick to play at 15 and 16 but we had one special season together.&quot; Jayawardene smiles sadly. &quot;I always carry a photograph of him and it&apos;s been the same every day for 16 years,&quot; he says. &quot;But as a youngster it made me look at the world differently. We went through the whole scenario for two and a half years of him coming to the UK for treatment. How many people have the chance to come here for an operation? I see many families struggle without this chance and so we now think, &apos;let&apos;s help other people.&apos;&quot; He has led plans to build a 750-bed unit in Maharagama \u2013 at Sri Lanka&apos;s only hospital dedicated to cancer patients. &quot;I started this some time ago and recently we had good news. The government is going to finish the project and we&apos;ll have a really good hospital. I can take little credit \u2013 apart from the start when, as a cricketer, you can help create the buzz. But I&apos;ve moved on to other cancer projects because this is close to my heart.&quot; Listening to Jayawardene talk so calmly and intelligently, it is easier to understand how he could bat in a World Cup final with such assurance. His unbeaten 103 off 88 balls was a masterpiece even if it saw him become the only player to score a century in the final and end up on the losing side. &quot;A few weeks ago I actually watched it again,&quot; he says. &quot;My dad records all my innings and even if I would have preferred to win, I was happy with my batting. When you consider the occasion, and the situation we were in, it was good. If we hadn&apos;t lost wickets I could have accelerated earlier but I had to make sure I batted with the tail. 275 in a World Cup final is a good score and when we had them 30-2 it was hopeful. But India deserved to win.&quot; The subsequent retirement of Muttiah Muralitharan, and that of Lasith Malinga from Test cricket, marks the end of a glorious era in Sri Lankan cricket. However, Jayawardene dismisses concerns of a wider crisis in the wake of Kumar Sangakkara and him stepping down as captain and vice\u2011captain just before the mass resignation of the Sri Lankan selection committee. &quot;It&apos;s less dramatic than it sounds. Murali was always going to retire and I stepped in as temporary vice-captain to help Kumar. But Kumar told us months ago he would step down after the World Cup. And the selectors made it clear their time would also end then. We need to build the next generation of leaders and it&apos;s important to start when senior guys like me and Kumar and [Tillakaratne] Dilshan are around. Dilshan&apos;s very street-smart and he&apos;ll do well as captain. It&apos;s not a bad situation.&quot; During Sri Lanka&apos;s last tour of England, when they drew the Test series 1-1 in 2006, Jayawardene proved himself a resourceful leader. But the draining nature of the role convinced him it&apos;s not a position that can be assumed for more than a few years in Sri Lanka. &quot;It&apos;s the stuff happening off the field which you can&apos;t control. You are often fighting a lone battle and a time comes when you have to say &apos;Enough&apos; because it affects your own cricket.&quot; Back in the ranks, Jayawardene seems relaxed in discussing the allegations of match-fixing made by Hashan Tillakaratne, a former Sri Lanka Test cricketer. &quot;I think it&apos;s hot air. If he&apos;s got evidence it&apos;s great because we can&apos;t have this in our cricket. But we need solid proof. He&apos;s had enough time to speak to the ICC and he&apos;s not gone\u00a0about it in the right manner.&quot; In more innocent sporting terms, Jayawardene can marvel at Murali and anticipate the rise of a new team during this series. &quot;It&apos;s a challenging time \u2013 especially as we won&apos;t have a genius bowling from one end. We&apos;ll need a different mentality to win games without Murali, and it&apos;s going to be much tougher, but I liked the way we came back against England Lions. We had to follow on and after two days we were down in the dumps. But we had a meeting and said, &apos;Come on, we&apos;re better than this.&apos; Our young bowlers put their hands up and bowled us to a win. &quot;But we&apos;ll miss Murali. I loved fielding in the slips to him and I took 63 Test catches off his bowling. The most special was the final one, when he got his 800th wicket with his last ball in Test cricket. Even if the boys were nervous they were going to drop a chance and leave him on 799 it was the perfect script for a wonderful cricketer. He got his 800th wicket, which meant we beat India. If I&apos;d dropped it I think I would&apos;ve been the most cursed person in Sri Lanka.&quot; Jayawardene laughs again. He knows how much his poise and dedication is revered and, having scored 9,527 Test runs, he is aiming to reach his next milestone. &quot;Let&apos;s hope the 10,000 mark comes against England. I set this target three years ago and once I make it I&apos;ll decide what&apos;s next. But there will be another target because that keeps the hunger going. You&apos;ve always got to challenge yourself \u2013 because you never know what might happen next.&quot;", "title": "Mahela Jayawardene: 'I still get flashbacks.

Denying reports that the government would allow universities to recruit above their student number limit so long as the extra students paid higher fees, he was adamant. &quot;There is no question of people being able to buy their way into university,&quot; he said. But universities are already allowed to recruit extra students who pay higher fees \u2013 if those students are foreign. With students carrying more of the burden of funding in future, as home and EU tuition fees rise to up to \u00a39,000, and with government support for humanities subjects being withdrawn, will foreign students become ever more valuable as cash cows? &quot;Most universities&apos; costs are close to \u00a39,000 or very nearly,&quot; says Les Ebdon, vice-chancellor of the University of Bedfordshire and chair of the university thinktank Million+. &quot;Many people feel that by the time they have made provision for the spending required by access agreements and the abolition of the Hefce [Higher Education Funding Council for England] central grant, they will be getting less from home students than they are at the moment, so it makes them even more interested in the international market.&quot; The average overseas student fee for 2010-11 was \u00a311,435 \u2013 more than \u00a32,700 higher than the average home/EU fee expected to be charged from 2012. Unlike for home students, there is no cap \u2013 Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial College, London, all charged more than \u00a318,000 for lab-based subjects last year \u2013 and no obligation to ensure fair access for different social groups. Institutions can recruit as many international students as they like and recruitment is positively encouraged by the government as foreign students contribute an estimated \u00a38bn in fees and other spending to the UK economy. Financial forecasts published by Hefce last month showed that universities&apos; income from overseas students had more than doubled over the last 10 years, rising to 9.6% of the higher education sector&apos;s total income by the end of 2009-10. For 2010-11, English higher education institutions aimed to increase this income still further, from \u00a32.1bn to \u00a32.3bn, a rise of 9.5% \u2013 higher than for any other income source. While 21 institutions forecast a reduction in overseas income this year, they were in the clear minority, and the same number were expecting this source of income to increase by more than 25%, prompting Hefce, which will publish the sector&apos;s longer-term forecasts in July, to warn of &quot;optimism in current growth forecasts&quot;. Among those looking to increase overseas recruitment are Durham, which aims for a 97% increase in the number of non-EU undergraduates by 2015, increasing their proportion of the student body from 9% to 16%; Exeter, which plans a 28% rise in the same timescale \u2013 73% in colleges other than the business school \u2013 and Middlesex, which recently won a Queen&apos;s Award for Enterprise for outstanding achievement in international trade, after growing its overseas income by \u00a310m over the last three years. It has overseas campuses in Dubai and Mauritius and a new centre opening near Delhi in October. Michael Driscoll, Middlesex&apos;s vice-chancellor, says: &quot;Because of changes to the way English universities will be funded, the success of our international operations is more important than ever.&quot; Ebdon echoes this sentiment. Bedfordshire, which also received a Queen&apos;s Award this year, has nearly trebled its number of international students in the last three years to nearly 4,000, and wants to increase this by another 1,000. &quot;We spent some time concentrating on growing our home market and then growth in the home market was stopped, so it has been the only growth area available to us,&quot; says Ebdon. He says that, like other universities, Bedfordshire is looking to offer a wider range of programmes on its UK campus that appeal to students from different countries, such as international business and law programmes, and possibly a degree programme in Islamic banking, and is also considering partnership arrangements with campuses overseas. But Shaun Curtis, director of International Exeter, a new internationalisation strategy at the University of Exeter, says that his university&apos;s plans to increase overseas student numbers from just under 3,000 last year to 4,000 by 2015 is not about raising money \u2013 he argues that the shrinking differential between home and overseas student fees will actually make this less of an issue. Instead, it is about ensuring a diverse student body. &quot;We believe that if we want to be a global university as opposed to a national one we have to recruit the best students, not just around the UK but around the world,&quot; he says. Exeter has just become the first British university to open an office in Bangalore, and in the last couple of years has opened offices in Shanghai and Beijing. But its Chinese offices are looking not at recruitment, but at employability options for returning Chinese and home students, raising Exeter&apos;s profile and keeping in touch with alumni. &quot;With the new fee regime, the pressure on universities to demonstrate value for money in the student experience is going to be immense and every good university is going to want to be able to offer a proper international experience,&quot; he says. Durham University also insists that recruiting more international students is less about the bottom line than about ensuring that &quot;all of our students benefit from the diverse educational environment which produces global citizens&quot;. Matthew Andrews, academic registrar at Oxford Brookes University and chair of the Admissions Practitioners Group, says that all universities recognise the importance of having dynamic international student bodies, but they also realise that having too many overseas students could put pressure on facilities and make for a worse student experience. As a result, he does not anticipate that the new fee regime will lead to huge increases in overseas recruitment. &quot;Universities want to maintain their overseas numbers, and that&apos;s certainly our position at Oxford Brookes,&quot; he says. For many institutions, simply maintaining numbers is becoming more difficult. While the exchange rate has been in their favour in recent months, they are facing increasing competition from within the UK and abroad, and must now cope with changes to the visa system. These state that from July, foreign students at private colleges will no longer be able to work during their studies, and the right of foreign students at all institutions to work in the UK after graduating will be restricted. Dominic Scott, chief executive of the UK Council for International Student Affairs (Ukcisa), says that these changes will make the UK a far less attractive option for overseas study and predicts that many private feeder colleges could go under by the summer, with knock-on effects for universities. Worst hit are likely to be poorer overseas students. While foreign students from wealthier backgrounds tend to go to Russell Group institutions, he says, those who are less well-off often choose private colleges in the UK that charge much lower fees for franchised courses. &quot;The ones going into the private colleges will be the ones no longer entitled to work part-time,&quot; he says. &quot;The sad thing is, those kids will suddenly realise that the package doesn&apos;t add up any more.&quot; He suggests that some will calculate that it is worth paying a higher fee for a university course if it means they can work part-time, which could benefit some universities lower down the league tables. Others could choose to study elsewhere, or stay at home. Whatever the government&apos;s intentions for home students, when it comes to international students, ability to pay and ability to learn have long been hard to separate. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 May 2011.

As we report elsewhere, PC Simon Harwood, an officer in the Met, will face criminal prosecution for striking Tomlinson with a baton and pushing him to the ground during the G20 protests in April 2009. The wheels of justice will turn, as they should, but they turn slowly and the process is never cheap. During this month&apos;s inquest into the death of Tomlinson \u2013 which found unlawful killing \u2013 the officer was accompanied to and from the hearing by two fellow constables and one police sergeant, also members of his unit, the Territorial Support Group (TSG). Over three days, that alone, we learn, cost the taxpayer \u00a32,300. \u2022 Still, we live, we learn. And they teach many things in the army: when to advance, when to retreat, lessons well taught to Patrick Mercer, the Tory MP for Newark, and 25 years a soldier. As he spoke at the House of Commons on Monday, all of his strategic skills were on display. Addressing a meeting organised by the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, and a dozen members of both houses, Mercer told them that all the men under his command had loved every minute of it; he&apos;d never heard an unhappy word from any of them. You&apos;re &quot;talking bollocks&quot;, cried a member of the invited audience. This turned out to be the author of The Skinback Fusiliers, a no-holds-barred expos\u00e9. He told Mercer in no uncertain terms that life at Catterick Garrison was very far from happy, a view reinforced by another speaker, Lynn Farr, who set up &quot;Daniel&apos;s Trust&quot; after her son died at Catterick in suspicious circumstances. Points both critics were keen to raise with the Tory action man. But pretty quickly, he was gone. \u2022 And following the sudden disappearance of Bahrain&apos;s ruler, King Hamad al-Khalifa, from the list of attendees at last month&apos;s royal wedding, the issue of the brutal suppression of popular protest in Bahrain looms again for the Queen \u2013 in the shape of a horse. Not just any horse. The Queen&apos;s three-year-old Carlton House is hot favourite for the Derby at Epsom on 4 June. The colt, as a yearling, was a gift from Sheikh Mohammed, who is the ruler of Dubai, its defence minister and vice-president of the United Arab Emirates. The UAE has sent 500 troops plus armoured vehicles to Bahrain where they were welcomed by al-Khalifa, who said they would be used to &quot;secure stability&quot; in the kingdom. The UAE has also sent troops and police to Saudi Arabia to help &quot;guard government buildings&quot;. If Carlton House, trained in Newmarket by Sir Michael Stoute, wins a fortnight on Saturday it would be the first royal winner of the Derby in 102 years. No wonder the Windsors are excited. Principles are principles, it is true. But then, a gift&apos;s a gift. \u2022 Shock in Brussels where Ukip MEPs are coming to terms with the defection of David Campbell Bannerman to the Conservatives. No warning from him, apparently; just crowing from the Tories. But we should have known, dejected Ukipians say. The defection deal was apparently struck a month ago over steaks with the enemy in Piccadilly. But just last week Campbell Bannerman joined five Tories on a jolly to Taiwan. That&apos;s strange, the Ukipians said, we don&apos;t take junkets; what&apos;s he up to. So\u00a0the signs were there. Still hurts. \u2022 Finally, Buckingham Palace was the place to be yesterday, but, slowly, the masses are gathering in London&apos;s Mayfair. They gather for the Hef. Not Simon Heffer, unfortunately. No, Hugh Hefner who is flying over from Los Angeles for tomorrow&apos;s launch of a new Playboy Club. So many look forward to greeting him with their slogan &quot;Eff Off, Hef!&quot;. The new club is opening 30 years after the closure of its predecessor establishment, which was also based in Mayfair. It was targeted by a police raid and then by the licensing authorities. No such risk this time, for everything will be above board, and in any event our police long ago got bored of raiding nightclubs. So save for the protest, everything is set fair.

The move by the group&apos;s subsidiary, Port &amp; Free Zone World (P&amp;FZ), is revealed in a prospectus produced by ports operator, DP World, which is due to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange next week. &quot;[DP World] understands that Port &amp; Free Zone World FZE is considering refinancing its outstanding net debt facilities of approximately $850m, secured in part against certain of its shares in the company, in the short to medium term,&quot; it states. &quot;Options to refinance the facilities include, inter alia, further bank loans, asset disposals, public market bond issues (including equity-linked bonds) or the sale of shares in the company.&quot; DP World first attracted the attentions of UK investors in 2006 when it seized control of P&amp;O, in a \u00a33.3bn takeover. The deal caused controversy in the US, where P&amp;O ran six ports, with some US politicians arguing that allowing Arab ownership of US ports made the country more vulnerable to terrorism. DP World eventually sold the US port contracts for an undisclosed sum to AIG Global Investment Group. State-owned conglomerate Dubai World is the parent company of P&amp;FZ, which owns 80.5% of DP World, one of the group&apos;s more profitable investments. P&amp;FZ has two representatives on the port operator&apos;s board: chairman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem and vice-chairman Jamal Majid Bin Thaniah. Dubai has been restructuring state-linked firms to deal with an estimated $115bn debt pile, which was built up during the boom years when the emirate became infamous for extravagant construction projects. The fall-out from the hubris forced Dubai World into renegotiating $26bn of borrowings with creditors last year, although P&amp;FZ was excluded from that deal. At the time, it is understood that bankers did not believe the P&amp;FZ debts needed restructuring. The news of further potential negotiations has emerged as DP World prepares for the long-awaited listing of its shares on the London Stock Exchange, which will begin trading on 1 June. The company said it believes the dual listing between the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Dubai, where the shares are currently traded, will help &quot;attract a broader range of investors&quot;. It added that gross container volumes grew by 12% across its 49 operational terminals in the first three months of this year. However, the performance of the company&apos;s share price has not always shown such strong growth. Since floating in Dubai in November 2007, DP World shares have halved to $13.30, giving it a market capitalisation of around $11bn.

Manal al-Sharif, a 32-year old mother who drove around the eastern city of Khobar last Saturday, had been expecting to be released on Friday after five days in jail on charges that her lawyer described as driving without a licence, provoking other women to do the same and provoking public opinion in Saudi Arabia. It is disputed by lawyers whether it is illegal for women to drive under national law but it is socially and religiously unacceptable in many quarters. &quot;The investigator needs another 10 days to complete his investigation,&quot; said Sharif&apos;s lawyer, Adnan al-Salah. &quot;He will decide whether Manal is innocent and has to be released or he will refer her to the prosecution unit, a government organisation and they might refer her to a special prosecutor to deal with the case. I feel the fair and right thing would have been to release her on bail.&quot; The extension of the investigation was interpreted as a show of defiance by the Saudi authorities in the face of growing domestic and international pressure to release Sharif. &quot;They have added 10 days to the investigation,&quot; said Waleed Abu Alkhair, a human rights activist, who knows Sharif. &quot;This is very, very disappointing. The authorities want to show they are strong and don&apos;t care about any pressure.&quot; The move is likely to fuel anger in Saudi Arabia and abroad at what is seen by some as an overzealous reaction to a woman driving her car. Sharif&apos;s case had already become a cause celebre among reformers and human rights activists in the highly conservative kingdom who are hoping to emulate aspects of the Arab spring freedom movements. King Abdullah is facing direct pressure from around 1,500 Saudis who have signed a petition calling for Sharif&apos;s immediate release and to clarify the law on whether women are allowed to drive. The authorities were already braced for a planned mass-drive protest on 17\u00a0June, which was being organised by Sharif, an executive at the Saudi state oil giant Aramco. Since her arrest, several more videos showing women driving have been posted online in defiance of the state and conservative clerics. The Guardian has learned that Saudi women are planning another mass drive within days to protest against a de facto driving ban in force across much of the kingdom. The event is being organised covertly with details circulated by email and text message in an attempt to catch the Saudi authorities off guard, human rights campaigners told the Guardian. &quot;There are many underground calls to take advantage of momentum and to do something right now,&quot; said one female organiser, under anonymity. &quot;People are talking about women going out and driving and it is not just women who are supporting us, men are too.&quot; On Thursday, the deputy interior minister, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, appeared to try to end debate about the issue by affirming that women cannot drive under a law decided in 1411, or in the Christian calender 1991, apparently contradicting previous remarks by senior members of the rulers saying it is a matter of social custom, not law. &quot;Women driving cars in Saudi Arabia has already been decided on in 1411 [and we decided] to not allow women driving,&quot; he said. &quot;And this for us, the Ministry of the Interior, continues to stand.&quot; He added: &quot;Our mission is to implement the system, but whether this action is right or wrong is not for us to say.&quot; Salah insists it is not illegal for women\u00a0to drive, even though only a handful in remote desert areas or in private compounds feel comfortable doing so and anyone with enough money\u00a0hires a driver. As a result there are around 750,000 drivers in\u00a0the kingdom, mostly migrant workers. &quot;You can&apos;t find any article in Saudi law relating to traffic that prevents women from driving,&quot; said Salah. &quot;The government is taking this line because if they don&apos;t they may provoke the conservative part of society and they do not want to upset those people.&quot; Sharif was first released after just five hours only to be rearrested in the early hours of Sunday when the authorities learned she had posted a video and encouraged other women to do the same. It showed her driving through the streets wearing a headscarf and black sunglasses telling the camera in Arabic: &quot;If a husband has a heart attack what is a wife to do if there no one else around and she can&apos;t drive ... Not everyone is able to afford a driver. It&apos;s just too expensive for poorer families.&quot; In an earlier interview, she said she was inspired to organise the Women2Drive movement by the experience of Bahia al-Mansour, a 20-year-old student at King Faisal University who started to struggle in her studies after difficulties in arranging transport. &quot;Every lady has something to do in the city, she&apos;ll just drive, do her business and come back,&quot; Sharif told the Dubai-based Gulf News. &quot;So, it&apos;s as simple as that. People can&apos;t call it a demonstration, we&apos;re not going against the law, we&apos;re not going against anyone, we&apos;re not even demonstrating.&quot; Her imprisonment sparked a furious reaction among some Saudis and social networking websites, Twitter and Facebook, buzzed with anger. Eman al-Nafjan, a teacher and PhD student in Riyadh who writes a blog under the name Saudiwoman, told the Guardian that Saudi conservatives and the wealthy were determined to keep women from driving because it blocks anyone who cannot afford a driver from competing for jobs. &quot;Only the upper middle classes have drivers and that gives so much power to them,&quot; she said. &quot;If you lift these obstacles then a lot of women will go out to work and society will change, they believe for the worse. Women will compete with men and they even believe it will cause more bastards to be left on the steps of mosques.&quot; Sharif&apos;s arrest quickly became highly politicised. Her background as part of Saudi Arabia&apos;s minority Shia population was used by some to allege she was an agent of foreign powers, including Iran, aimed at destabilising the kingdom. She is not alone in speaking up in favour of women driving. Najla Hariri, a 45-year old mother of five in Jeddah, started driving her own car earlier this month when her driver left and she had to take her son to school. Now she believes a challenge to the social stigma around women driving could be the first of many changes in the kingdom. &quot;Most of us have drivers, but sometimes we find ourselves in need,&quot; she said. &quot;It is a very small thing, but we have the right to move from place to place. It is about independence. My driver left the job and I needed to take my son to school, so I took the car and went. That&apos;s all. I did it twice. The next day I went to the grocery shop to get some things. It shocked us all when Manal was arrested because she didn&apos;t break any law or breach any fatwa.&quot; Samar Badawi, a human rights campaigner also from Jeddah, said she believes only a minority of men would object to women driving. &quot;It would change everything if women drove,&quot; she said. &quot;Women would be able to go to hospital, take their children to school and do all this without a man. It would allow women to respect themselves if they drove their own cars. Maybe 15% of men would be offended, the rest would like women to drive. I know lots of women that drive, but Manal was the first to film it and put it on YouTube. This is why the government was angry.&quot; Waleed Abu Alkhair, a human rights activist, who knows Al-Sharif, said his contacts in the Saudi court say they have to keep good relationships with the religious leaders. &quot;They feel sorry about what has happened to Manal but they don&apos;t want a bad situation with the clerics,&quot; he said. Rumours circulated that she had broken down in custody and apologised, which was firmly denied by her lawyer. &quot;She didn&apos;t apologise for anything,&quot; Salah said. &quot;She would have apologised if she had caused harm to anyone and she says she hasn&apos;t.&quot; Hired male driver Babal lives in a small hut at the front of Eman Al Nafjan&apos;s house in Riyadh. Whenever Eman wants to go somewhere the Bangladeshi man is always ready to drive her. Eman, the 32-year-old daughter of a military officer who works as a teacher and is also studying for a PhD in linguistics would rather Babal didn&apos;t have to. Babal is one of an estimated 750,000 drivers employed in Saudi Arabia, many from abroad, who ferry the richer women in the kingdom around because social custom, religious edict and possibly common law forbids them from driving themselves. He earns \u00a3196 per month and the family sometimes feed him, &quot;but not three meals a day&quot;. &quot;Babal is there all the time,&quot; said Al Nafjan, the relatively affluent. &quot;He has been with me for four years. He has a son, his wife is pregnant and he goes back to Bangladesh to see them once a year. I am very mobile but it is still inconvenient. Riyadh is a city of a million people and it&apos;s a one-and-half-hour trip to get to classes and I am there for three hours. There is no time to turn round and go back again so Babal waits. It is hot and I feel bad for the driver. He shouldn&apos;t have to. I should be able to drive myself.&quot; \u2022 The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday 15 June 2011.

The piece described her as part of the country&apos;s minority Shia population: she is, in fact, Sunni.

Heathrow will have its busiest Whitsun bank holiday for at least 10 years with New York, Dubai and Dublin the top three destinations for its expected 800,000 passengers. The Grimsv\u00f6tn volcano in Iceland remained active on Thursday but was spewing out steam and smoke rather than the ash particles that grounded 900 flights in northern Europe at the start of the week, threatening a repeat of last year&apos;s volcano crisis, when 100,000 flights were cancelled. Eurocontrol, the continent&apos;s air traffic control body, said it expected a trouble-free weekend. &quot;Any significant ash concentrations are far out over the sea, at very low altitudes and well away from the air routes or airports,&quot; said Eurocontrol&apos;s head of network operations, Brian Flynn. &quot;The expectation for the next couple of days is that there will be no disturbances to air traffic whatsoever.&quot; However, the UK&apos;s unusual bank holiday luck this year seems certain to run out over the weekend, with cool and showery weather forecast until well into next week. In place of the sunlit Easter period, when temperatures topped 28C (82F), and the warmth over the royal wedding and May Day, much of the country will be lucky to manage more than 16C (61F).

There were also heavy falls in London and the Midlands, much to the relief of gardeners and water companies after a prolonged dry period. The AA says 15m cars will hit the roads with traffic building from Friday afternoon. It warned of particularly busy roads between 10am and 2pm on Saturday, with less congestion on Sunday and bank holiday Monday. According to Trafficmaster, the top five traffic hotspots will be: the A303 through Hampshire, Wiltshire and Somerset; the M5 from Bristol to Exeter; the M3, M27 and A31 between Winchester and the Dorset coast; the M6 north of Birmingham to Lancashire; and the westbound M25 between junctions 21 and 12. The AA warned that motorists could be caught out by high fuel prices because a \u00a340 purchase at the pump will cover less distance than it did last year. Edmund King, AA president, said: &quot;There are too many drivers out there running on fumes and the AA has experienced an 18% increase in call-outs call to drivers running on empty.&quot; The Icelandic ash plume will bring an unexpected benefit to rail passengers travelling between London and Glasgow after Network Rail lifted engineering works on the west coast main line amid fears that Grimsv\u00f6tn would erupt over the weekend. The works will not be reinstated. &quot;We are just doing our bit,&quot; said a Network Rail spokesman. More than 5 million rail passengers are expected to travel on the network this weekend.

Some of the hotel staff were scurrying about, looking obviously distressed. I asked one of them if there was any trouble and he responded with a glossy smile. There was no trouble, madam, and was there anything he could help me with? A few hours later, I discovered that there had indeed been trouble. A man \u2013 an Indian worker \u2013 had jumped from Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, and a symbol of Dubai&apos;s prowess. It is a needle-shaped skyscraper which impales the bleak Dubai sky. Originally known as Burj Dubai, the building was planned during the city&apos;s orgiastic construction phase, where the sky was the limit, but completed after the bubble had burst. It was then renamed in honour of Abu Dhabi&apos;s ruler, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed, who rescued Dubai from its debt crisis. Gossip about the suicide was horrifyingly callous. &quot;It only took 10 months&quot; [after the opening of the hotel], one person said. &quot;He&apos;s inaugurated the building,&quot; another almost laughed. &quot;Why did he jump?&quot; I asked. People shrugged. He&apos;s probably an expatriate worker, I was told \u2013 it&apos;s usually them. There is nothing remarkable about people being desensitised to suicides. London commuters on the underground can probably understand, but when the suicides are almost exclusively from one minority working in certain jobs, it is nothing short of inhumane. The dark underbelly of Dubai is never far away and sometimes we see the effect of this uglier side lying lifeless on a pavement. The man, apparently an Indian cleaner who had been denied a holiday, was scraped off the floor on which he landed on and life went back to normal. Tourists and expats lapped up the luxury and sunshine, while workers from south Asia, little moving dots on the facades of the buildings under construction throughout the city, were ferried in buses to and from their living quarters. A couple of days later, another Indian man jumped from Jumeirah Lake Towers. The Indian consulate in Dubai has since revealed that at least two Indian expats commit suicide each week. The consul-general stated that most are blue-collar workers who are either semi-skilled or skilled. There is something deeply sinister about Dubai luxury, even more so since the local economy went into spectacular decline with the sovereign debt default in 2009. Fawning staff (almost exclusively expatriate) encircle you from the moment you arrive. From handler to driver to receptionist to concierge, the over-the-top attention is underpinned not by a dedication to a superlative service, but by fear. If there is a problem, grovelling apologies are proffered and olive branches extended \u2013 all to prevent a complaint that in today&apos;s economic climate almost certainly means dismissal or extreme chastisement. People, nationalities and jobs exist in silos, isolated from each other. You can be in Dubai for days and not interact with a local. It seems to me a place where the worst of western capitalism and the worst of Gulf Arab racism meet in a horrible vortex. The most pervasive feeling is of a lack of compassion, where the commoditisation of everything and the disdain for certain nationalities thickens the skin to the tragic plight of fellow human beings. Psychologically, these workers are isolated and alienated; practically, they are trapped by draconian sponsorship laws in the UAE, and in debt to agents back home. This is exacerbated by the fact that there is such little enforceable employment law in these markets. Such economies have developed so rapidly that social and civic attitudes have not kept pace, and the sponsorship system is open to abuse and still victimises migrant workers throughout the Gulf. Dubai is considered an emirate under a popular, liberal, benevolent and forward-looking ruling family that has managed to develop the economy and extend its hands to the outside world without compromising its culture or values.

The prospect of those millions of fans looking over your shoulder, nit-picking at every potential failure of tone or detail, must daunt even the most ardent admirer of Ian Fleming&apos;s urbane hero. Sebastian Faulks, the last contemporary writer to receive the imprimatur of the Fleming estate for an adult Bond novel, took a lot of flak on fan sites for his 2008 addition to the canon, Devil May Care. There was a suspicion that the highly regarded literary novelist viewed this excursion into genre as slumming it, and that the resulting book was little more than an exercise in pastiche. The Fleming estate has perhaps decided to avoid any such criticism this time around by commissioning veteran thriller writer Jeffery Deaver, who unwittingly revealed his credentials when he spoke warmly of his admiration for Bond&apos;s creator after winning the Ian Fleming Steel Dagger award in 2004. After 28 suspense novels, there is no doubt that Deaver knows his way around a thriller plot, and Bond fans should be satisfied with the rollicking pace of 007&apos;s new adventure, which barely gives our hero time to sit down for a martini or glance at his Rolex Oyster Perpetual before the plot twists and lurches off on another page-turning race against the clock. Unlike Faulks&apos;s novel, which was set in 1967 as a direct continuation of Fleming&apos;s original series, Deaver has chosen to transport the character firmly into the present. There&apos;s an initial jarring when you read, a few pages in, that Bond is &quot;in his thirties&quot;, but suspension of disbelief is a requirement for any Bond novel, regardless of decade. So it&apos;s just taken for granted that Bond has, like the Doctor, somehow regenerated. Deaver&apos;s challenge is to achieve a balance between redrawing Bond as a plausible 21st-century hero and retaining the familiar characteristics that make him uniquely Bond \u2013 something which the films have long grappled with. The most obvious innovation is that Bond now belongs to a new and highly secret division of British intelligence known as the Overseas Development Group, an outfit modelled on the Special Operations Executive in the second world war, but tailored to counter post-9/11 threats. Its agents are charged with defending the realm &quot;by any means necessary&quot; \u2013 carte blanche, in other words, to step outside the law when the situation demands. M, Moneypenny and Mary Goodnight are all present and recognisable (none of this reinventing M as a woman), though Q has become a cricket-loving techno wizard of Indian heritage named Sanu Hirani, and Bond&apos;s most trusted gadget is an advanced version of the iPhone (nicknamed, naturally, the iQphone) with all manner of apps for surveillance. After a hair-raising opening sequence in Serbia featuring car chase, shoot-out and the near-derailment of a train carrying lethal chemicals, Bond&apos;s main mission is to prevent a massive terrorist atrocity. The only clue is an intercept promising thousands of deaths on the night of Friday 20th, with British interests adversely affected. Bond has only five days to determine the nature of the threat, identify its main players and stop them, while dodging unknown assailants who want him dead and the usual buffoonery of chinless incompetents within the British security services, sticklers for procedure who oblige him\u00a0to interpret carte blanche in his own way. Bond finds himself pitted against the murky Severan Hydt, magnate of a global empire of refuse collection and recycling \u2013 a nicely topical metaphor. Hydt is a particularly Deaveresque villain, a man whose macabre fascination with death and decay verges on pornographic. With the help of his old friends Felix Leiter and Ren\u00e9 Mathis, Bond follows Hydt&apos;s trail from the Balkans to Dubai to South Africa. Deaver is a master of the twist in the tale and he deploys it here with cinematic verve, keeping the reader biting their nails until the last minute (perhaps unsurprisingly, the novel feels coloured by a consciousness of Bond&apos;s screen legacy \u2013 one character is even described as resembling Kate Winslet, for the benefit of future casting directors). But the author&apos;s affection for Bond and for all the tropes that surround him is abundantly clear, so that Carte Blanche reads like a lovingly crafted homage rather than deliberate pastiche.

A sixth sense told Dunne he was being watched and he slid out of sight. A seventh sense told Bond the Irishman had moved out of position. Bond reacted in an instant. A large explosion tore the track in two and Bond looked on as the train came to a halt short of the river. The world was saved.

A 10th sense had told him that the Irishman was expecting to be watched and he had organised a decoy surveillance. He tailed them to an underground dump; an 11th sense told him someone was going to die there and he would have to go to Dubai. The heat was stifling in the Emirate as Bond met up with his old CIA contact, Felix Leiter. &quot;You&apos;re being followed, Bond,&quot; Leiter said. &quot;I know,&quot; Bond had replied evenly, checking the time on his Rolex. &quot;It&apos;s better to keep your enemies where you can see them.&quot; Hydt and Dunne were relieved a 12th sense had told them they were being followed and had doubled back on themselves. Bond was ahead of them. A 13th sense had told him Hydt and the Irishman would double back on themselves. Now he knew he had to go to South Africa. &quot;Welcome to South Africa, Mr Bond,&quot; said Bheka Jordaan, the head of Cape Town counterintelligence. &quot;With a name like that you are obviously not going to try to have sex with me, much as you are obviously gagging for it.&quot; &quot;Correct, Mr Bond,&quot; Bheka replied longingly. &quot;Now, how can I help?&quot; &quot;You can create me an identity as Mr Theron.&quot; &quot;We can do business, Mr Theron,&quot; said Hydt. &quot;But first we must go to a charity auction.&quot; Hydt left early to look at some decaying flesh, leaving Bond with the head of the food programme. &quot;I&apos;m Felicity Shagwell,&quot; she said. &quot;Something tells me we are going to end up in bed,&quot; Bond smirked. A 14th sense told Bond he was being followed. &quot;Who are you?&quot; he asked, trapping him in a corner. &quot;I&apos;m not sure. I think I&apos;ve got into the story by mistake.&quot; Bond tied him up and mused on whether his parents had been Russian spies. It was good to have some pathos in the backstory. He checked his Rolex. Time to break into Hydt&apos;s plant and foil Gehennna. He called M on his iPhone: &quot;They are planning to blow up York University.&quot; A shot rang out. Hydt fell dead. &quot;Congratulations, Bond,&quot; said Bheka, &quot;case over.&quot; &quot;Not quite,&quot; said Felicity Shagwell triumphantly, as she put a gun to Bond&apos;s head. &quot;Dunne is working for me and Hydt was a decoy. The world is about to be destroyed.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s what you think,&quot; Bond laughed, evading her aim. &quot;A 15th sense told me you were a baddy and I had to pretend to let you capture me to find out.&quot; &quot;It could have been so different, James,&quot; Felicity cried, as Bheka handcuffed her. &quot;Indeed it could,&quot; said Bheka. &quot;If you had stayed a bit longer you could have slept with me too.&quot; &quot;Another time, maybe,&quot; Bond replied. &quot;M needs me in London.

A popular horse in the ante-post betting for many months, his price, until Tuesday morning, had gone in only one direction since the start of the year. Even if he does makes the Epsom line-up on Saturday, he still remains a horse with questions to answer, not least over his ability to see out the mile-and-a-half trip. However, pedigree experts believe that the favourite will not be found out, despite startling statistics about the record of stallion Street Cry. The Melbourne Cup winner Shocking is the only one of the 20 highest-rated horses that the Dubai World Cup winner has produced to have won any sort of race at further than a mile and a quarter. Admittedly, the American race programme is heavily slanted towards races at shorter trips, but nevertheless it is horses such as Street Boss, a Grade One-winning sprinter at six and seven furlongs in the US, the Breeders&apos; Cup Juvenile winner Street Sense and the crack Aussie miler Whobegatyou who dominate his progeny statistics. At trips between five and nine furlongs, his runners have a 12% winning strike rate. At a mile and a quarter and beyond, that figure drops to a less-inspiring 5%. Instead, it is the influence of Carlton House&apos;s dam, Talented, not to mention the manner in which he powerfully saw out the race in last month&apos;s Dante Stakes that must give punters optimism over the colt&apos;s ability to stay the 12 furlongs. Even John Warren, the Queen&apos;s racing manager, has admitted that it is &quot;far from certain&quot; that the trip will suit as well as shorter distances. &quot;The dam&apos;s side of the pedigree is certainly encouraging, but we&apos;ve never taken it for granted,&quot; he said. &quot;Ryan Moore is an outstanding jockey and he believes that stamina won&apos;t be an issue, so we&apos;ve got to be encouraged by that but he isn&apos;t a horse with a pedigree which says &apos;guaranteed stayer&apos;.&quot; Alex Scrope, a bloodstock expert, is clear that the horse&apos;s top line \u2013 his stallion and stallion&apos;s stallion \u2013 is the only concern for those believing that he will see out the trip. &quot;Street Cry is still quite young, but his sire Machiavellian was successful for many years and never managed to produce a Group One winner over a mile and a half,&quot; she explained. &quot;The rest of his pedigree is full of mile-and-a-half horses and his damsire is an obvious influence for stamina. I imagine that they&apos;ve tried to breed a horse who stays a mile and a half, but who would have the extra speed influence of his top line. Hopefully we&apos;ll find out on Saturday if they got it right.&quot; John Ingles, pedigree expert at Timeform, said he thought Carlton House would have &quot;no trouble&quot; staying. &quot;Although his dam, Talented, didn&apos;t win beyond a mile and a quarter herself, she was placed in the Ribblesdale and Lancashire Oaks,&quot; he said. &quot;Also, Talented&apos;s best horse before Carlton House was Friston Forest, a winner up to 15 furlongs. I always think a bit of doubt in a Derby horse&apos;s pedigree about him getting the trip isn&apos;t necessarily bad \u2013 Sea The Stars is a good example \u2013 because if you look at a horse&apos;s breeding and it&apos;s shouting out that it&apos;s a cast-iron certainty to stay, then it&apos;s probably going to be found out by something with a bit more speed.&quot;", "title": "Pedigree experts confident Carlton House will stay the Derby trip", "sentences": ["The Melbourne Cup winner Shocking is the only one of the 20 highest-rated horses that the Dubai World Cup winner has produced to have won any sort of race at further than a mile and a quarter."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-01T17:54:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jun/02/james-bond-changing-incarnations", "tags": ["Ian Fleming", "Books", "Kingsley Amis", "Thrillers", "Fiction", "Culture"], "article": "Carte Blanche, the latest novel in the James Bond franchise by crime writer Jeffery Deaver, was launched with great fanfare at its launch last Thursday. Despite a lukewarm critical reception, it is currently riding high in the Amazon bestseller charts; its predecessor, Sebastian Faulks&apos;s Devil May Care, was the fastest-selling hardback of 2008. But literary Bond wasn&apos;t always big business. In fact, he&apos;s had quite an ordeal over the last four decades. 1967. Kingsley Amis was 45, divorced, and languishing in literary purgatory (a lecturing job in Nashville, Tennessee to be precise). His great first novel, Lucky Jim, was 13 years behind him. His latest, The Anti-Death League, was struggling to sell out its first printing. Amis needed glory. Amis needed money. Along came Gildrose Productions, literary executors of the Ian Fleming estate. This was four years after Fleming&apos;s death. Gildrose offered Amis \u00a310,000 to pen a Bond sequel. Amis agreed. Colonel Sun - published under the pseudonym Robert Markham \u2013 was out within the year. Colonel Sun is not a literary novel \u2013 it is, however, stylish. Gone is Fleming&apos;s grandiloquence (nipples were &quot;the pointed stigma of desire&quot; in Live and Let Die; eyes became &quot;mouths which licked their lips&quot; in Dr No). Amis writes straight, with a relish for sadistic detail. One chapter includes a three-page sermon on torture methods (disembowelment, genital cutting, and so on). Later, Bond gets a kitchen skewer through his right eardrum. Amis also develops the rather startling suggestion, set out by the female narrator of Fleming&apos;s The Spy Who Loved Me, that &quot;All women love semi-rape&quot;. His heroine, Ariadne, spends three chapters with gang-banging Greek heavies and still concludes with the line, &quot;I don&apos;t mind anything now you&apos;re here James.&quot; Sales soared. But Amis&apos;s reputation dipped. His biographer, Neil Powell, describes the novel as &quot;completely worthless&quot;. Ian Fleming&apos;s widow, Ann, was disgusted for other reasons: &quot;Amis will slip Lucky Jim into Bond&apos;s clothing,&quot; she wrote in a Sunday Telegraph review. &quot;We shall have a petit bourgeois red-brick Bond [who will] end up selling his country.&quot; She needn&apos;t have worried. Amis declined to write a follow-up. For 13 years, literary Bond went quiet. Then, in 1981, Ann Fleming died. Within months a new Bond sequel was ready. Its title: Licence Renewed. Its author: John Gardner, a former Anglican priest. Gardner went on to write 16 Bond novels, four more than Fleming. All 16 are readable, yet all are dogged by silliness: Bond gets chummy with an unconvincing Maggie Thatcher in Win Lose Or Die; half of Scorpius takes place in the glamourous locale of Chippenham. The novels were a three-way trade-off between Gardner, Gildrose and the American publisher Putnam. Gardner would spend six weeks writing each novel; Putnam would spend six months adjusting it to their requirements. By publication Americanisms were everywhere: a waiter wears &quot;pants&quot; in The Man From Barbarossa; Bond asks &quot;what&apos;s up?&quot; in Brokenclaw. Even worse were the titles (1987&apos;s Win Lose Or Die pales in comparison to Putnam&apos;s suggestion: Oh No, Mr Bond). In 1997 Gardner was diagnosed with terminal oesophageal cancer. He quit to work on his own fiction. Fourth to the Bond helm, in 1997, was American novelist Raymond Benson. Fleming&apos;s Bond had been an Express reader; Benson&apos;s is positively red top. He&apos;s the first to have group sex \u2013 in the appallingly titled Midsummer Night&apos;s Doom \u2013 and the first to visit a prostitute, though &quot;she was having a good time too&quot;, apparently. Benson&apos;s final novel, The Man with the Red Tattoo, sees Bond at a YBA show, destroying an Emin-esque sculpture entitled &quot;Love Hurts&quot;. In 2002, the Fleming family bought a controlling stake in Gildrose (soon re-branded as Ian Fleming Publications). By mid-2003, Benson and Gardner were completely out of print. Then came the movie re-boot, Casino Royale, in 2006 and, as cultural amnesia reached fever pitch, Fleming&apos;s estate re-launched the book series. First up was Sebastian Faulks with Devil May Care, his classy pastiche. It certainly sold like a Fleming novel (50,000 copies in the first week) and neatly shifted the focus from Soviet supervillains to zeitgeisty middle-eastern regimes. Now we have Deaver: an ersatz-Patricia Cornwell whose O Henry endings and risible prose (&quot;as soon as he stepped into the dim apartment he knew he was dead&quot;) have shifted 20m paperbacks. Deaver&apos;s Bond is a 21st-century spy. A spy, as Deaver says, who &quot;travels with Emirates Airline and spends a number of thrilling hours in Dubai&quot;. (Deaver was a speaker at the 2010 Emirates Airline Festival of Literature in Dubai.) Fleming too wrote for money, of course: he admitted as much in the 1962 essay How To Write A Thriller. Dostoevsky wrote Crime And Punishment to avoid debtors&apos; prison (though Dostoevsky didn&apos;t write sentences like &quot;all women love semi-rape&quot;). So what&apos;s next for Bond?

In a further sign that the luxury goods market is booming while the high street stagnates, the private equity firm Graphite Capital sold Kurt Geiger to Jones Group, the US owner of Nine West, just three years after buying it for \u00a395m \u2013 turning a profit of about \u00a3120m. The sale comes less than a fortnight after shoe designer Jimmy Choo was bought for \u00a3500m by investment firm Labelux, the luxury goods group backed by Germany&apos;s billionaire Reimann family, nearly three times the sum that was paid by its private equity owners four years ago. The senior management of Kurt Geiger, led by chief executive Neil Clifford and buying and creative director Rebecca Farrar Hockley, will stay in place and retain an undisclosed stake in the retailer, which Graphite acquired from rival Barclays Private Equity in February 2008. Clifford declined to comment on the size of the management&apos;s windfall , although he did concede &quot;there are a few smiling faces at Kurt Geiger today&quot;. Graphite and Kurt Geiger&apos;s management team have benefited from soaring demand for luxury goods as fast-growing emerging markets develop a taste for the high life and British consumers adopt an increasingly polarised approach to shopping. Markus Golser, senior partner at Graphite, said: &quot;The growth is largely being driven by demand from the Middle East and Asia. But closer to home, consumer patterns are changing, with people increasingly opting for discount retailers and luxury goods \u2013 and squeezing out the middle players.&quot; &quot;UK shoppers are becoming more cost-conscious but they decide to treat themselves from time to time,&quot; Golser added. Under Graphite&apos;s ownership, Kurt Geiger has seen significant sales growth, with revenues jumping by 70% to \u00a3205m in the year to April 2011. This comes against a backdrop of a booming market for luxury goods, with global sales expected to have risen by 12% to a record \u20ac172bn (\u00a3152bn) in 2010 and forecast to increase a further 7% this year to \u20ac185bn, according to research by Bain &amp; Company. Now Europe&apos;s largest luxury shoe retailer, Kurt Geiger benefited from opening 24 stand-alone stores in Britain as well as new outlets in Russia, Turkey, Dubai, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain. The sale to Jones will give Kurt Geiger a good platform to expand into the US and Asia, while serving as a &quot;hub&quot; for the American retail group in Europe. Clifford said: &quot;I&apos;d be very disappointed if we didn&apos;t see Kurt Geiger opening in America next year. Jones Group is huge in America \u2013 they&apos;ve got 700 stores, while we&apos;ve got none, and we&apos;ve never had the bottle to try it before.&quot; Clifford said New York, Dallas and Los Angeles would be suitable US locations for Kurt Geiger stores and said he was also hoping to open outlets in Asia, in cities such as the South Korean capital Seoul. After working under two private equity owners, Clifford said he would relish the longer-term perspective implicit in control by a retail group. &quot;We&apos;ve had a brilliant ride with private equity but now we&apos;d like to park the company for the long term and not look over our shoulders every three or four years. It&apos;s been a great journey but we now want to think about the next 10 years,&quot; Clifford added. Richard Dickson, president of Jones Group, said: &quot;By leveraging our deep retail networks worldwide, there is substantial opportunity to grow Jones&apos; revenue base internationally and to introduce Kurt Geiger&apos;s brands to the US.&quot; In addition to selling through its standalone outlets, Kurt Geiger&apos;s four brands \u2013 Kurt Geiger, KG, Carvela and Miss KG \u2013 are also available in department store chains such as Harrods, Selfridges, House of Fraser, John Lewis and Liberty.", "title": "Kurt Geiger sale to Jones Group means \u00a320m windfall for shoe chain managers", "sentences": ["Now Europe&apos;s largest luxury shoe retailer, Kurt Geiger benefited from opening 24 stand-alone stores in Britain as well as new outlets in Russia, Turkey, Dubai, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-02T18:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jun/02/mark-hughes-fulham-aston-villa", "tags": ["Mark Hughes", "Fulham", "Aston Villa", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Mark Hughes will not be the new Aston Villa manager and has been left without a club after walking out on Fulham on Thursday night. The Welshman had been the favourite to succeed G\u00e9rard Houllier but Villa, unimpressed with the course of events that culminated in Hughes activating a break clause in his contract and leaving Fulham, have turned their attention elsewhere. Martin Jol and Steve McClaren are at the top of Villa&apos;s shortlist. In a further twist Jol and McClaren, who are out of work and eager to return to employment in the Premier League, will also be leading candidates to take over at Craven Cottage, where Hughes had been expected to sign an improved two-year contract. Martin O&apos;Neill, a former Villa manager, will be another major contender for that post. Mohamed Al Fayed, the Fulham chairman, was furious after Hughes activated the break clause and tendered his resignation. A Fulham spokesperson said: &quot;The chairman became increasingly annoyed by Mark positioning himself for another club, whilst still negotiating with us, and having agreed terms.&quot; Fayed was, however, ready to extend Hughes&apos;s deal. One view from sources at the club is that contract talks with Hughes fell apart when Fulham felt unable to match the fees demanded by his representative, Kia Joorabchian. Villa&apos;s reluctance to move for Hughes comes as something of a surprise. He has been the frontrunner for the Villa post since it emerged this week that Houllier would be stepping down on health grounds. Villa, however, told Fulham that they would not be making an approach for Hughes in the hours before his decision to leave. The Midlands club have since made it clear that their stance has not changed after Hughes&apos;s departure from Fulham. It is understood they would have grave reservations about appointing the former Blackburn Rovers and Manchester City manager because of how his departure from Fulham has been handled. Hughes, who is on holiday in Dubai, said in a statement: &quot;I would like to take this opportunity to clarify that neither myself nor my representative have approached or have been approached by another club. This decision to leave Fulham has not been influenced by any outside party.&quot; When Villa parted company with Houllier on Wednesday evening, Fulham believed that Hughes would stay loyal to them, as Fayed had done with him on Boxing Day, when the Craven Cottage crowd had called for Hughes&apos;s sacking after a 3-1 home defeat by West Ham United that dropped the club into the relegation zone. Hughes&apos;s new contract had even gone to the lawyers, with the terms and conditions agreed, in readiness for his signature. Yet in the hours that followed Villa&apos;s announcement of Houllier&apos;s departure, Hughes went cold on Fulham \u2013 and nobody at the London club considered the two events to be unrelated. What Fulham could not understand, however, was that Paul Faulkner, the Villa chief executive, had made it clear to Alistair Mackintosh, his counterpart at Craven Cottage, with whom he gets on well, that Villa did not want Hughes. The Welshman, who describes himself as an ambitious young manager, may have taken a leap of faith as there was a deadline of midnight on Wednesday on the activation of his break clause. The clause permits him to walk away from the club as a free agent at the end of June. Premier League rules prevent him or his representative from contacting or being contacted by other clubs until after that. His back-room entourage, which includes Mark Bowen, Eddie Niedzwiecki, Glyn Hodges and Kevin Hitchcock, remain under contract at Fulham for another year, with no break clauses in their deals. Fulham accepted Hughes&apos;s resignation and their impression was that he thought he would get the Villa job, despite the assurances they had received from Faulkner that he would not. Fayed is clear that there is no way back for Hughes at the club. &quot;Roy Hodgson appreciated the club after he had left and [Fayed] believes Mark will do the same,&quot; a spokesperson said. Villa say they have an open mind about filling their vacancy. Speculation that Carlo Ancelotti is among their leading candidates is wide of the mark, however. The former Chelsea manager has not received any contact from Villa and he is known to have no interest in the position. Ancelotti, according to sources close to the Italian, is holding out for a club that can offer Champions League football. Roberto Mart\u00ednez, the Wigan Athletic manager, has, however, emerged as an outsider for the Villa post. O&apos;Neill, who has been out of work since leaving Villa last August, is the bookmakers&apos; favourite for the Fulham jobAs well as Jol and McClaren, other names likely to feature on Fulham&apos;s shortlist may include Gianfranco Zola, the former West Ham manager, and Chris Hughton, who led Newcastle United back to the Premier League at the first attempt before being sacked in December.

Quite frankly, it&apos;s too busy making sure Roland Bunce is made the face of Next in the most farcical vote since Uncle Sepp beat himself to the Fifa presidency on Wednesday. Vote Bunce! It&apos;s a year to the day since England flew out for their unforgettable summer holiday in South Africa, where they were hired to provide much of the entertainment at the last World Cup. Come to think of it, if anything, Fifa has been treating the FA with a little too much respect this past week, hasn&apos;t it? Sadly, unlike his defending on the pitch last summer, England&apos;s Brave and Loyal John Terry wasn&apos;t giving away much this afternoon, playing down any notion of a rift developing between him and Rio Ferdinand over The Armband ahead of tomorrow&apos;s Euro 2012 qualifier against Switzerland at Wembley. &quot;I&apos;m delighted seeing him come back from injury at Manchester United and he&apos;s been different class in the Premier League and Big Cup.

His squad has been hit by injuries to Andy Carroll, Peter Crouch, Jermain Defoe and Bobby Zamora, while Wayne Rooney is suspended meaning that England&apos;s only fit striker is Darren Bent. Not that Capello&apos;s worried. &quot;I know him [Bent] very well, in the box when he sees the ball he scores goals. I hope on Saturday he will do the same.&quot; You heard it here first folks: manager hopes his striker scores goals. Amusingly, despite England&apos;s striking crisis, there&apos;s still no place in the squad for Michael Owen, currently below Dixie Dean, Roy Race and Sandra Redknapp in the pecking order. At this rate, he&apos;s never going to get that important goal he&apos;s been banging on about.

HUGHES GOING TO GIVE YOU A HOME, MARK? When the Fiver was a pretentious traffic cone-thieving, Wonder Stuff-loving, subsidised ale-quaffing, library-avoiding student type, it spent half an hour every afternoon marvelling at the resemblance between Ailsa Stewart from Home and Away and the then Manchester United striker Mark Hughes. An ex-con who was possibly shipped in from Prisoner Cell Block H, Ailsa led an eventful life, talking a lot on a phone shaped like a hamburger and occasionally seeing the ghost of her step-daughter Bobby in the fridge of a diner that somehow turned a profit despite nobody ever paying for anything, before dying from a heart attack and appearing as a ghost that only her Bait Shop-owning husband Alf could see. By contrast, her doppelganger Mark Hughes has led a comparatively serene existence, at least until yesterday when his managerial career took a decidedly absurd turn when he activated a break clause in his contract as Fulham manager, apparently labouring under the misapprehension that he was on the verge of being appointed as Ged Houllier&apos;s replacement at Aston Villa, despite the Midlands underachievers telling Fulham they would not be making an approach for Hughes in the hours before he severed all ties with Craven Cottage. &quot;I would like to take this opportunity to clarify that neither myself nor my representative have approached or have been approached by another club,&quot; harrumphed Hughes in a statement issued from a sun-lounger somewhere in the English football community&apos;s holiday destination-cum-building site of choice, Dubai. &quot;This decision to leave Fulham has not been influenced by any outside party.&quot; While the Fiver can only engage in the kind of wild, utterly baseless speculation for which the name of the world&apos;s most tea-timely email has long been a byword, we reckon Hughes took a punt on being approached by Villa and activated the break clause in his contract by its deadline of midnight on Wednesday accordingly, mainly because that&apos;s what we read in Big Paper. But with Martins Jol and O&apos;Neill, along with Roberto Martinez, now being touted as potential replacements for Ged at Villa, it looks like the now unemployed Hughes will have to bide his time on the lucrative Ailsa-from-Home-and-Away-lookalike-circuit while waiting for some other Premier League club to serenade him with a winsome rendition of You Know We Belong Together.

Meir Dagan stepped down as the head of Mossad six months ago but has gone on the offensive in a series of briefings with journalists and public appearances because he feels that Israel&apos;s security is being mismanaged by Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and Ehud Barak, the defence minister. One newspaper quotes him as saying that he, as head of Mossad, Yuval Diskin, the head of Sin Bet \u2013 the internal security agency, and Gabi Ashkenazi, the head of the army, could prevent Netanyahu and Barak from making mistakes but all three have left their positions and have been replaced by men chosen by the current government. &quot;I decided to speak because when I was in office, Diskin, Ashkenazi and I could block any dangerous adventure. Now I am afraid that there is no one to stop Bibi [Netanyahu] and Barak,&quot; said Dagan. Upon leaving his post, Dagan publicly warned against Israel attacking Iran to stop it from acquiring nuclear weapons. In his latest comments, he said that if Israel attacks Iran, it will find itself at the centre of a regional war that would endanger the state&apos;s existence. Dagan&apos;s intervention is dangerous for Netanyahu because it comes from the right wing of Israeli opinion rather than the left, where the prime minister would expect criticism. Dagan has been in charge of aggressive Israeli actions abroad in recent years, that have included assassinations in Lebanon, Syria and Dubai and an air attack on a suspected nuclear reactor in Syria. He also criticised Israel&apos;s failure to offer any initiative to resolve the conflict with the Palestinians . The absence of any workable plan, he said, will leave Israel in a dangerous and weak situation if the Palestinians push for UN recognition of a state later this year. Dagan also endorsed Saudi Arabia&apos;s peace plan which offered Israel normal relations with all Arab countries if it reaches a peace agreement with the Palestinians. Leading columnist Ari Shavit summarised Dagan&apos;s point of view in the Ha&apos;aretz newspaper: &quot;Dagan is extremely concerned about September 2011. He is not afraid that tens of thousands of demonstrators may overrun the settlements. He is afraid that Israel&apos;s subsequent isolation will push its leaders to the wall and cause them to take reckless action against Iran.&quot; Ben Caspit of the Maariv newspaper wrote: &quot;He is one of the most rightwing militant people ever born here ... who ate Arabs for breakfast, lunch and dinner. &quot;When this man says that the leadership has no vision and is irresponsible, we should stop sleeping soundly at night.&quot; Dagan was quoted in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth describing Netanyahu and Barak as &quot;irresponsible and reckless individuals&quot;. Dagan&apos;s criticism of Netanyahu comes when the prime minister is enjoying popular support following his trip to Washington and his speech to Congress. Opinion polls suggest that Netanyahu has a nine-point lead over his nearest challenger and his Likud party is the most popular in the country. However, Dagan&apos;s intervention suggests that while Netanyahu is seen as an able performer in public, he believes that behind the scenes he is less astute. A spokesman for the prime minister said that he would not discuss Dagan&apos;s comments. However members of the cabinet told the Israeli media: &quot;Dagan was out of line on the Iranian issue. This damages deterrence, because the military option must be on the table as a credible option after sanctions. &quot;If you come and say, &apos;we can&apos;t attack Iran, it&apos;s impossible,&apos; you project weakness to the Iranians and make it look like you don&apos;t have the courage to do it, and that they can do whatever they want. &quot;More seriously, it sends a message to the world that they can take their foot off the gas pedal of sanctions.&quot;", "title": "Israel government 'reckless and irresponsible' says ex-Mossad chief", "sentences": ["Dagan has been in charge of aggressive Israeli actions abroad in recent years, that have included assassinations in Lebanon, Syria and Dubai and an air attack on a suspected nuclear reactor in Syria."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-03T17:01:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/03/carlton-house-derby-the-queen", "tags": ["The Derby", "Carlton House", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Even the Queen knows better than to look a gift horse in the mouth and it should prove wise to follow Her Majesty&apos;s lead and cheer home Carlton House (4.00) in today&apos;s Investec Derby at Epsom. Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s decision to send four horses back to the Queen in exchange for one he received could prove an act of generosity which costs Dubai&apos;s leader his first victory in the world&apos;s most famous Flat race. Various strands have emerged in the Derby story in recent days, but Carlton House simply looks to have an obvious and outstanding chance of giving the contest another memorable chapter. He pulled hard for his head in the early stages of York&apos;s Dante Stakes, a race which critics have panned for its inconsistent pace fractions, and those looking to get him beaten will have taken further encouragement when the colt&apos;s participation appeared in doubt this week because of a swollen ankle. But the improvement that Workforce found 12 months ago, between defeat in the Dante and victory at Epsom, is an important reminder that Sir Michael Stoute&apos;s runner will undoubtedly have been some way short of his peak on his prep race. Furthermore, it was despite the way the race was run, rather than because of it, that he triumphed with such authority over Seville. And although Carlton House&apos;s injury scare was an understandable concern to his backers, less-celebrated horses up and down the country receive treatment for similar conditions every hour of the day. In this matter, and indeed in the overall preparation of the colt, it can pay to put your trust in Stoute&apos;s judgment that Carlton House is fully prepared to do himself justice. Seville chased Carlton House home at York but stablemate Recital could prove the greatest threat to the favourite, Kieren Fallon&apos;s decision to forgo the ride on Native Khan itself an interesting pointer to his chances of Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s runner. Other progeny of outstanding sire Montjeu have come into this contest having shown similarly temperamental tendencies as Recital has displayed in both starts this season, but have found that the unique Epsom track and atmosphere brings them alive. Recital looks just the type to appreciate racing behind a faster gallop than he has encountered before and a big showing is expected. He has been considered Ballydoyle&apos;s premier contender for the race for months now, even after defeat in the Ballysax Stakes. O&apos;Brien-trained outsiders have made the frame in the Derby on a number of occasions and Treasure Beach may reward each-way backers at longer odds. He pulled out more when Nathaniel came to his quarters in last month&apos;s Chester Vase and can also be expected to have come on considerably for that run, his first since last September. Native Khan would be a major player if his stamina was guaranteed to hold out over a mile and a half, but that looks as much of a concern now as it did before his admirable effort in the 2,000 Guineas. Ed Dunlop, the colt&apos;s trainer, admitted before Newmarket that he was leaning towards the Prix du Jockey-Club, over a furlong and a half less, ahead of Epsom. Perhaps the change of heart he has seemingly experienced is more to do with pressure from the colt&apos;s owners than a genuine belief that moving up by half a mile will suit. 1.40 Having gone down by a length attempting to give 5lb to Dubai Queen at Goodwood last month, that filly&apos;s subsequent big run off a mark of 83 suggests that Trojan Nights is at least realistically treated off 84 for his handicap bow and he also has the potential of further improvement. The maiden he won at Ripon may have proved to be lacking in depth, runner-up Sir Francis Drake is reportedly held in some regard by Godolphin. 2.10 An impressive winner on his debut, Caspar Netscher was hindered by a slow gallop last time, when trying to give 8lb to Misty Conquest at Pontefract and should be better suited by the likelihood of a faster pace here. An expensive purchase at the breeze-up sales last month, he landed a gamble when coming from well back to score at Beverley on his debut despite showing obvious signs of inexperience and the booking of Johnny Murtagh also takes the eye. 2.40 Rio De La Plata and Premio Loco have both held their own in far better races than this and look a class apart from their rivals, but receiving 6lb, the latter can notch a 12th career victory. He looked as good as ever last time out in the Lockinge, staying on steadily into third place behind rivals against whom he had little chance of victory. Favourites do not have a good record in this race of late though, and those fancying a surprise may want to consider backing veteran Mac Love, who won this race two years ago. 3.15 Despite the burden of top weight, Captain Dunne looks sure to be involved in the finish. He arrives here on the crest of a wave having come within centimetres of claiming a first Group race victory in France last month. Well in at the weights now following that run, he can avenge his 2008 short-head defeat by Indian Trail in this contest. A higher draw would have been ideal, but if able to slipstream the speedy Masamah from his adjacent stall, the race should pan out ideally.", "title": "Carlton House can deliver a first Derby success for the Queen", "sentences": ["Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s decision to send four horses back to the Queen in exchange for one he received could prove an act of generosity which costs Dubai&apos;s leader his first victory in the world&apos;s most famous Flat race.", "1.40 Having gone down by a length attempting to give 5lb to Dubai Queen at Goodwood last month, that filly&apos;s subsequent big run off a mark of 83 suggests that Trojan Nights is at least realistically treated off 84 for his handicap bow and he also has the potential of further improvement."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-03T20:06:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/04/the-queen-carlton-house-derby", "tags": ["The Derby", "The Queen", "Carlton House", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "If you knew nothing about horse racing, it would be easy to look at the field for Saturday&apos;s Derby and wonder what the fuss is about. The Queen owns Carlton House, the favourite, but so what? She has a lifelong passion for breeding and racing horses, and is one of the richest women in the world. If money can buy championships in football, then why not Classics in the sport of kings? Scratch a little harder, though, and a more interesting truth emerges, about a horse race and a sport that has tantalised the rich and powerful for more than 200 years, and still has the power to tweak the nose of the mightiest. The Queen has spent nearly 60 years trying to breed a Derby winner, carefully choosing which of her mares to send to which stallion in the hope that, if the coin spins the right way and the foal is a colt, it might be good enough to emerge from the annual crop of thousands to win at Epsom three years later. Yet now she could finally win the only Classic to elude her with a horse that arrived as a present, from a man who has himself spent 30 years trying, and failing, to buy a Derby winner of his own. Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai, has put billions into racing since the mid-1970s. He has won all four of English racing&apos;s other five Classics at least twice, and if the Derby were inclined to yield to money and desire, the sheikh would have won half a dozen by now. Instead, he will watch Saturday&apos;s race knowing that had he not set his heart on acquiring a horse called Highland Glen to race in Dubai, Carlton House would almost certainly be running for him. When the sheikh asked to purchase Highland Glen, a useful horse but no great champion, from the Queen, she offered him as a present to her fellow head of state instead. The sheikh expressed his gratitude by sending her four yearlings \u2013 well-bred, of course, but complete blank canvases, a season away from their first start on the track. Who could have guessed that one of the four, from the hundreds of yearlings to pass through the sheikh&apos;s immense bloodstock operation in 2009, would end up as the favourite for the Derby this afternoon? But then that&apos;s the Derby, a race that defies assumptions. You can&apos;t plan or choose to win it with any certainty, even with all the money in the world. Instead, you must wait and hope that, one day, the Derby chooses you. And the Queen has certainly been patient. It must have seemed like just a matter of time when, only a few weeks after her Coronation in 1953, her colt Aureole finished second at Epsom. But even then there was a reminder of how capricious this Classic can be, as the winner, Pinza, was ridden by Sir Gordon Richards. Despite winning the jockeys&apos; championship 25 times in the preceding 28 years, this was Richards&apos;s first, and only, Derby winner, at the 28th attempt. Fifty-eight years later, that second place is the best that a runner in her colours has managed. Five subsequent challengers in the 50s achieved a best of two fifth-place finishes, while the 1960s and much of the 70s passed without a royal runner at all. The last three, the most recent of which was Church Parade in 1981, finished 18th, 10th and fifth. Twenty years, then, without even a runner, and it is not for want of trying. When Free Agent won at Royal Ascot in June 2008, for instance, the bookies soon quoted him for the 2009 Derby, nearly 12 months later. But, like so many colts with the right kind of pedigree, it transpired that he did not have the engine to match. The Queen&apos;s suitably reserved celebration in the royal box that day made the evening news as an &quot;and finally&quot; item. If Carlton House wins on Saturday, it is more likely to be the lead item, and a significant PR coup for the sport that has kept her fascinated for six decades. This is a woman who spends much of her life doing things because she must. She breeds and races thoroughbreds because she wants to. &quot;Like anyone with a Derby runner, Her Majesty is very excited about the race,&quot; John Warren, her racing manager, has said, &quot;looking at the Racing Post, and getting all the news, while trying to keep calm. &quot;It is hugely exciting. Her real passion and pleasure is the development and breeding of the stock. She has a routine every spring, looking at the foals and the development of the yearlings.&quot; Both the sport and Carlton House&apos;s owner know that she will never get a better chance to win a Derby, and extend the monarchy&apos;s long association with racing into another century. It was Queen Anne who founded Ascot in 1711, while even before that, Charles II settled on Newmarket as an ideal place to indulge his passion for racing, gambling and general hedonism away from the prying eyes of Londoners. But there has been only one Derby winner in the colours of a reigning monarch, which was Minoru, owned \u2014 though not bred \u2014 by King Edward VII in 1909. Should Carlton House fail on Saturday, racing will wonder if there will ever be another, as the next generations of the royal family show no sign of having inherited the Queen&apos;s fascination with the turf. When Minoru won the Classic, there were no photo-finishes and judging the result could be erratic, at best. Four years later, in the notorious race when the suffragette Emily Davison was killed as she brought down Anmer, owned by King George V, the third horse home was missed completely by the judge, and it has even been suggested that, in a driving finish, Minoru got the nod from the official because anything else might have instigated a riot. A contemporary report described how the &quot;bubbling enthusiasm which permeated the huge crowd, bursting with loyalty and the love of a splendid sport, was a sight which will never fade from the memory of those who were fortunate enough to witness it&quot;. The fervour is unlikely to reach such a height even if Carlton House wins on Saturday, but at least 100,000 people are expected to crowd on to the Surrey Downs in the hope of seeing a moment of sporting history. And for all the wealth and advantage that accompanies her status, the Queen will, in one sense at least, be no different from any of them. Carlton House is a 9-4 chance, which means that he is twice as likely to lose as he is to win. Like everyone else at Epsom on Saturday, the Queen urgently needs a little bit of luck.", "title": "Favourite Carlton House grants the Queen a date with Derby destiny", "sentences": ["Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai, has put billions into racing since the mid-1970s.", "Instead, he will watch Saturday&apos;s race knowing that had he not set his heart on acquiring a horse called Highland Glen to race in Dubai, Carlton House would almost certainly be running for him."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-03T23:15:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/04/afghans-enjoy-prosperity-fear-coalition", "tags": ["Afghanistan", "World news", "Taliban", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "Under the trees, the Karimi family have spread out a rug. The Afghan summer sun filters through the leaves. There is chicken, fried potato cakes, salad and water melon. This is a Friday afternoon ritual, at least since the security improved enough to allow the family to drive the 10 miles from Kabul without fear of insurgents or robbers. The Karimis came back to the city in 2002, after living as refugees in Iran through the civil war of the early 1990s and the rule of the Taliban that followed. Now three generations live together in Kabul: 70-year-old Syed Hussein, Fatima, 29, a student teacher, her husband and her two children. And every Friday they come to this patch of riverside woodland on the outskirts of the city. &quot;When we came back, life was very hard,&quot; Fatima says. &quot;But every year that has passed things have got better.&quot; Syed Hussein, her father, smiles when asked when times were best in his long life \u2013 the average life expectancy for Afghans is still only 44, two years more than a decade ago. &quot;Afghanistan is a wonderful country\u2026 the only problem is the Afghans!&quot; he says and chuckles at his own joke. &quot;The best times were when I was a teenager. Since, it has been just trouble after trouble.&quot; Physical reminders of those troubles surround the family&apos;s picnic site, known as Daoud&apos;s Garden after Mohammed Daoud Khan, the president deposed and assassinated in a communist coup in 1978. There is a large military base less than a mile away. Once manned by Afghan auxiliaries fighting alongside the Soviets, it is now full of Afghans being trained to fight with, or instead of, US-led coalition forces. A major American base is close by too. An Afghan commando unit guards the approaches to the gardens. &quot;Without these soldiers we could not come here,&quot; says Fatima. &quot;In fact, we could barely go anywhere.&quot; For behind the bucolic scene lies deep anxiety. Every year in Kabul there is a different theme to the interminable conversations about &quot;the situation&quot;. In 2008 it was the apparently inexorable advance of the Taliban, almost to where Fatima and her family were picnicking. In 2009, it was the new &quot;surge&quot; of troops and money announced by President Barack Obama. In 2010, it was the success or failure of the expanded campaign. Now, without exception, talk is of the withdrawal of western troops, aid and attention from Afghanistan. Within weeks, Obama is expected to announce the first departures. David Cameron has already said he wants 450 of Britain&apos;s 9,500 men out within months. The international community has agreed that all foreign combat troops are to be gone by 2014, leaving the Afghans to fight the Afghans. &quot;This is a very worrying thing,&quot; says Fatima, and the festive atmosphere of the picnic cools. &quot;If the west go, then it will all fall apart and the Taliban will come back.&quot; The Karimis are from the Hazara ethnic minority, persecuted under the largely Pashtun Taliban&apos;s rule. They are also Shia Muslims, whom the Taliban once saw as heretics. Their moderate traditions \u2013 Fatima wears a simple white headscarf rather than the all-covering burqa \u2013 meant they suffered greatly when the radical movement were in power. Now there are functioning universities, schools, relative law and order and even improving electricity. &quot;But we still have much to fear,&quot; Mousa, Fatima&apos;s husband, said. Many in Kabul are more worried about their wallets than persecution. The 10-year international effort has seen Kabul change from being a moribund city of fewer than 400,000 to a bustling metropolis of 4.5 million flush with cash. The last two years have seen an explosion in conspicuous consumption. There are blocks of luxury apartments under construction, giant video hoardings advertising energy drinks, BMWs and Hummers blasting their way through the traffic with overpowered horns. Miralam Hosseini, 56, sells at least two $140,000 4x4s every week. Across the street from his showroom, an electronics shops stocks the latest 52in flat screen. &quot;We sell one every few days,&quot; said Mahmud Shah, who returned to Kabul earlier this year after seven years in London. Cars and televisions alike are always paid for in cash. &quot;Narc-hitecture&quot; \u2013 vast and garish villas built by those said to be involved in Afghanistan&apos;s $4bn drugs trade \u2013 is becoming increasingly visible. There are also the new restaurants where lunch is 30 times the average daily wage. If soaring food prices pose a huge problem to millions in the city, they do not bother those who have profited from the boom. But there is a sense now that the party is over. Little of the money in Kabul \u2013 other than the profits of the narcotics trade \u2013 has been created here. Beyond drugs, Afghanistan still produces very little. Profits from the country&apos;s vast mineral or metal deposits are a distant prospect. &quot;No one is within a decade of even beginning to successfully mine, process, transport and sell all the copper and iron that is here,&quot; one European diplomat admitted. Much of the economy has thus been built on the tens of billions poured into Afghanistan by the west. Huge sums have been embezzled, vast wasteful contracts have fuelled a &quot;construction sector on speed&quot; and the main bank is alleged to have made $500m in undocumented and potentially fraudulent loans, many to associates or relatives of the president, Hamid Karzai. Once much disappeared to Dubai. More recently, following the global turndown, the cash has stayed in Kabul. Land prices have risen fivefold. Then there are the tens of thousands of consultants, translators and office staff working for international NGOs or foreign government contractors. Salaries of $3,000 are common, an enormous sum locally. The best paid earn much more. &quot;I vetoed a contract giving a local consultant a salary three times that of the president of my country,&quot; said the diplomat. &quot;Then I found out it had been done anyway behind my back.&quot; The new money and the westernisation that has gone with it is most evident in places like the Gulbahar Centre, a recently opened complex of luxury flats, shops and fast-food restaurants in the heart of Kabul, only a hundred metres from the new main mosque. Last week Samer, 18, and Zohour, 21, were having lunch in Big Chief Burger on the ground floor of the complex. One was a &quot;cultural adviser&quot; for the US embassy; the other a business student and son of a major government transport contractor. &quot;It&apos;s a stressful place to live. I relax by going to the gym or hanging out. This is an Islamic country so there are no bars or clubs,&quot; said Zohour, wearing a sweatshirt, baggy shorts and flip-flops. &quot;I&apos;m worried about when the Americans go. Now the war is a long way from here. We don&apos;t want it any closer.&quot; Some observers have noted a parallel with the 1980s, when Kabul benefited from Soviet aid, reconstruction projects and jobs while the war continued in the countryside. As early as 2005, a World Bank report noted that &quot;the main beneficiaries of [overseas] assistance have been the urban elite&quot;. There are bombings and attacks in Kabul but few casualties and little destruction compared to the south or east. A Nato military intelligence officer told the Observer that the economic &quot;rural-urban divide&quot; was one of the biggest drivers of the insurgency. When the Soviets left, Afghanistan was plunged into civil war and much of Kabul destroyed. Now all in Kabul are worrying what the departure of the most recent batch of foreigners to intervene in their country will bring. &quot;The whole of the American effort and that of our allies is starting to be framed around this concept of 2014 and the need for an Afghan lead by then,&quot; a US official told the Observer. &quot;Is there a rush for the exit? Absolutely not. Too many people have lost their lives, too many valuable things have been gained.&quot; This at least is a sentiment Fatima and her family would agree with. &quot;They can&apos;t leave, they simply can&apos;t,&quot; said Mohammed, Fatima&apos;s brother-in-law. &quot;It&apos;ll be chaos, anarchy. The Taliban will be back. Everything that has got better will get worse. I am certain the foreign troops will still be here in many, many years.&quot;", "title": "Afghans enjoy a new prosperity but fear for a future without the coalition", "sentences": ["Once much disappeared to Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-04T21:25:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/jun/05/derby-pour-moi-horse-racing-best-bets", "tags": ["The Derby", "Horse racing", "Horse racing tips", "Sport"], "article": "Reliable Man takes Prix du Jockey Club 2.30pm: Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s Roderic O&apos;Connor and Godolphin hope Casamento were unable to sustain their challenges as Alain de Royer-Dupr\u00e9&apos;s Reliable Man took the glory in the Prix du Jockey Club at Chantilly.

Press Association Pour Moi win fails to impress handicapper 1.10pm: Official handicapper Phil Smith is planning to give Pour Moi the lowest rating for a Derby winner since Sir Percy in 2006. The French colt showed tremendous acceleration to come from last to first at Epsom and claim a famous victory. But while Smith feels there is every chance Pour Moi will improve through the year, he is finding it difficult to rate him too highly due to proximity of some of the beaten horses. &quot;My view is that while I think we will find both the first and the third will go on to show they are very high quality horses, it is very difficult to give them very high ratings at this stage,&quot; said Smith. &quot;You have to look at the performances of the horses that finished sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth and I think it is difficult to rate the winner as high as the last four Derby winners. I need to speak to a colleague but my tentative rating for the winner is 122, which is the lowest for a Derby winner since Sir Percy. We rated him 121. Workforce was 128 after winning last year.&quot; Press Association Today&apos;s best bets, by Will Hayler If ever a Derby required three or four viewings of the recording, then it&apos;s this year&apos;s, so that&apos;s what I did last night. The official replay hadn&apos;t been posted on Youtube but I found a poor-quality Italian recording which did the job. The hard-luck stories were a little less overt than usual, but having said that, about the only horses for whom the plan seemed to go perfectly throughout were the winner and runner-up. Pour Moi turned for home stone last of the 13 runners, but that was always going to be the case, as Andr\u00e9 Fabre had made clear at the Breakfast With The Stars event. Memphis Tennessee appeared to set good fractions from the front, which no doubt helped Micka\u00ebl Barzalona execute waiting tactics, but nevertheless it was hard not to be impressed with the way in which Pour Moi cut down his rivals in the closing strides, even if there was a hint of the &apos;Montjeus&apos; to his head-carriage under maximum pressure. Fabre said after the race that the horse is now likely to have a summer break before coming back for a campaign geared around the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe, but the 7-1 with Paddy Power about him winning that race would make more appeal if he was not likely to come up against a couple of very smart four-year-olds in Workforce and So You Think. Those wanting to crab the race will point to the fact that only a couple of lengths separated the first five home, and the time was more than three seconds outside Workforce&apos;s clockbusting effort last year. But my feeling is that it wasn&apos;t a bad Derby. Carlton House had to come from further back than ideal after finding trouble and Native Khan would have run a big race and franked the 2,000 Guineas form but for his stamina giving out up the final incline. Seville looked as if he completely failed to act on the track, and was given a very easy time in the final furlong by Christophe Soumillon. If he&apos;s none the worse this morning, he&apos;d be interesting in the Irish Derby. One would have thought that the day after the Derby deserves something better than two dreary jumps cards in Britain, but maybe the powers that be are just trying to give racing fans a rest after the excitement of the previous days. Kings Legacy (3.15) fell on his chasing debut, but had jumped satisfactorily up to the point of his departure and it will be disappointing if he fails to account for obviously inferior rivals at Worcester. Odds-on favourite Dubai Crest failed to win as many races as his ability should have permitted him to on the Flat and looks opposable at today&apos;s price in the following contest.

So the ancien regime has been restored in Paris. For the first time since the 2009 Australian Open, and for just the second time since that Wimbledon encounter in 2008, it&apos;s Roger versus Rafa in a grand slam final.  Few at Roland Garros would have predicted this scenario a fortnight ago, when one bookmaker offered odds of 18-1 on Federer prevailing. The 29-year-old, down to No3 in the world and without a major final appearance in 16 months, was the half-forgotten man. All the talk was of Nadal and Novak Djokovic&apos;s tussle for the No1 spot and whether Nadal could recover from back-to-back defeats to the Serb in the Madrid and Rome finals. But then Federer went and broke Djokovic&apos;s 43-match, six-month stranglehold on the men&apos;s game in a remarkable semi-final on Friday. &quot;I wasn&apos;t lying on the beach,&apos; said Federer after that match. &quot;I continue to make sacrifices and, when it really counts, I&apos;m at the big occasion. I have another opportunity here to beat Rafa and take another French Open title. I&apos;m aware that I&apos;ve got to play some extraordinary tennis, but I never stopped believing.&quot;  Weather-permitting, play is due to get under way at 2pm BST. But the weathermen say there&apos;s only a 20% chance of Roland Garros dodging the forecast storms this afternoon. Which could make it a rerun of the 2008 Wimbledon final. I doubt many would say no if it was.  I think I&apos;d rather sit on a sharp and rusty fence than call this one. Sure, Nadal&apos;s the favourite with the bookies and rightly so, he&apos;s priced at around 4-9 compared to Federer at 7-4. There&apos;s no doubt he&apos;s the better clay-court player, he&apos;s only lost once at Roland Garros in 45 matches and has beaten Federer in the three previous French Open finals they&apos;ve contested.  But throughout this tournament it&apos;s Federer who&apos;s been playing the better tennis, and he produced the performance of the fortnight \u2013 and one of the best of the year so far - to end Djokovic&apos;s unbeaten run. And having finally won the Coupe des Mousquetaires two years ago (after Robin Soderling accounted for Nadal in the fourth round), the pressure is off. For the first time against the Spaniard at Roland Garros, Federer can enjoy the occasion. And that might just allow him to pull off what would be, even by his standards, one of his greatest ever wins.  Tale of the tape (well we do it for boxers, right?)Nadal-Federer25 Age 296ft 1in Height 6ft 1in13st 6lb Weight 13st 4lb1 World ranking 345 Career titles 679 Grand slam titles 16$40,052,402 Career prize money $62,497,31016 Wins in past meetings 8  In Nadal&apos;s corner: Uncle Toni, Rafa&apos;s girlfriend, probably a token Spanish sportsman or two. In Federer&apos;s corner: Mrs Federer, coach Paul Annacone, the slightly scary Anna Wintour.  Another name that can probably be added to the Team Federer list is Novak Djokovic. Should Federer win this afternoon and prevent Nadal from equalling Bjorn Borg&apos;s record of six French Open titles, Djokovic would be propelled to the world No1 ranking for the first time. If Nadal emerges victorious, he&apos;ll keep hold of the top spot for another few weeks - at least until Wimbledon.  A weather update.  British Eurosport are currently showing cycling and BBC Two seem more interested in the MotoGP, but according to Twitter at least the weather is holding at the moment, and there&apos;s even a bit of sun. So we&apos;re on for a 2pm start.  Here comes Roger. He does a quick interview in French, but the Eurosport translator comes to my rescue. Apparently Federer hopes things are going to be different to his previous French Open finals against Nadal and he&apos;s out to do his very best. And here&apos;s Rafa. He says it&apos;s a big honour to play Federer and he&apos;s looking forward to a really good match. And that&apos;s about that.  Tok, tok, tok, tok, tok, they&apos;re warming up. Nadal is once again wearing his blue and white ensemble, Federer his red and white Swiss number. Not surprisingly, the Parisians sound quite up for this one. A few former champions are presented to the crowd, including Gustavo Kuerten and Jim Courier. And talking of former French Open champions, over on the BBC, Sue Barker is doing her best to flirt with Boris Becker. Meanwhile Federer will serve first.  *Nadal 0-1 Federer (*denotes next server)Nadal sets out his tactics from the start, attacking Federer&apos;s backhand in a lengthy exchange, but he goes long. An ace from Federer makes it 40-0, Nadal demands the umpire gets down from his chair to inspect the line but the call stands. Federer then finds the line with a volley to rattle through his opening service game to 15.  Nadal 0-2 Federer*Federer&apos;s on the attack straight away, thumping a forehand drive volley and then forcing Nadal into an error. 0-30. Two points later and it&apos;s 15-40. Two break points. Nadal saves the first with a great body serve and follow-up, and then Federer misses the second as he goes for broke on a forehand down the line. Deuce. Advantage Federer. Deuce. Advantage Federer. Nadal looks for all the world like he&apos;s going to bury a short ball, but slams it into the net. Jeu and break Federer. And this from a slightly excited Gary Naylor: &quot;Seeing the same individuals or teams in finals year-in year-out can get dull as familiarity breeds contempt. Doesn&apos;t apply to these two though.&quot;  *Nadal 0-3 FedererBig serving from Federer. 15-0. 30-0. 40-0. 40-15. Game. What a start from the Swiss. And this from Matt Byron: &quot;Is Nadal basically going to win this because of his fitness? He doesn&apos;t seem as much of a tennis player as simply a human Duracell bunny, whose speed and power save him more often than his tennis abilities. For that reason, I think Federer is a much worthier champion. Even though he increasingly just looks like a faded star.&quot;  Nadal 1-3 Federer*At 30-all, Federer briefly thinks he&apos;s brought up a break point with a forehand down the line, but the umpire overrules. Federer goes for another winner on the next point but miscues into the tramlines. Nadal gets his first game on the board, but he really hasn&apos;t settled into this final yet. He looks strangely nervous.  *Nadal 1-4 FedererThe longest rally of the match so far sees Nadal come out on top, 30-all. But Federer dismisses the danger by rattling off the next two points. He couldn&apos;t have asked for a better start. A few umbrellas go up on Philippe Chatrier, by the way. But thankfully they&apos;re because of the sun rather than any imminent threat of rain.  Nadal 2-4 Federer*A rocket of a return from Federer gets it to 15-all. Nadal gives the line a fierce glare, before trudging over to serve again. He comes through the game to 30, finishing it off with a cross-court winner. Meanwhile Mick James is swearing at his TV: &quot;Who is the BBC commentator who keeps saying &quot;changeup&quot; when he means &quot;variation&quot;? It&apos;s so annoying, if this was Wimbledon I&apos;d suggest sending someone round to punch him.&quot; Not sure Mick - I switched over to Eurosport when Sue Barker started flirting with Boris.  *Nadal 2-5 FedererA hint of danger for Federer at 15-30, but he thumps down an ace and forces Nadal into a backhand error. Nadal then has a chat with the umpire, it&apos;s not too clear why, perhaps he&apos;s calling for the trainer. Federer takes the game and yes, the trainer is on. It&apos;s a problem with Nadal&apos;s foot, which is heavily bandaged. The trainer snips off a bit of the bandage and puts a bit of talc on (will that really help?) and then scurries off court. And in answer to Mick - I&apos;ve narrowed the culprits down to John Lloyd and Andrew Castle. And then George emails to confirm that it&apos;s Mr Castle.  Nadal 3-5 Federer*Thwack. Uggh. Thwack. Uggh. Thwack. Uggh. Thwack. Uggh. Thwack. Uggh. Deuce. Advantage Federer - set point - but he attempts a drop shot, which just sneaks wide. It&apos;s then Nadal&apos;s turn to bring up advantage, and he takes the game with a backhand cross-court winner, one of his best shots of the match so far. Federer will serve for the set. And while Mick James wants to have a fight with the TV, Dave Freeman seems to want to have a fight with Matt Byron: &quot;I think Matt misses the point. You don&apos;t win nine grand slams simply by being fitter than your opponents. Nadal is a champion and world No1 because he is so mentally strong and technically and tactically great. There&apos;s a reason even greats like Federer can&apos;t cope with Nadal&apos;s top spin \u2013 just look at how his normally excellent backhand unravels against Nadal. That said it seems to be holding up for now.&quot;  *Nadal 4-5 FedererSome forehand missiles from Nadal get it to 30-all. And Federer nets a backhand. 30-40, Nadal has the chance to break. And that he does, with a fantastic running forehand down the line which Federer can only volley into the net. My my. An email appears in my inbox in French, but I think it&apos;s most likely spam: &quot;Excuser moi de vous d\u00e9ranger, le plaisir pour moi de faire votre connaissance, li\u00e9e une amiti\u00e9 et une relation sinc\u00e8re avec vous. je vous laisse sur ce mot en esp\u00e9rant vous relire.&quot;  Nadal 5-5 Federer*From 30-all, Federer miscues on a return to give Nadal game point. Federer goes wide with a backhand and for the first time in this match, we&apos;re on level terms. And an email from Matt Bryon entitled FIGHT!: &quot;I notice that while Dave Freeman points out Nadal&apos;s technical, mental and tactical abilities, he doesn&apos;t point out that he is a great tennis player, though. Which was kind of my point.&quot;  *Nadal 6-5 FedererSome magnificent hitting from Nadal - two forehand passes down the line - make it 0-30. Nadal jumps up in the air a few times and pumps his fist a lot. Federer restores parity at 30-all, but he&apos;s powerless to prevent Nadal thumping his way to break point.  Federer just makes a forehand winner, which somehow dips and clips the line. Deuce. A fantastic reflex volley from Nadal and it&apos;s another break point. And that&apos;s four straight games for the defending champion, who will serve for the set.  Nadal wins the first set 7-5From 30-all, an error from Federer brings up set point.  Nadal absolutely wallops a forehand cross-court winner past a stranded Federer and from 5-2 down, it&apos;s first blood to Nadal. Can Federer recover from this? The first set seemed a vital one for him, momentum and confidence-wise. It&apos;s a tough ask for him now. Meanwhile the multi-tasking Kevin Alvarez is somehow managing to read this game-by-game, coach tennis, and send me an email all at once: &quot;Am making my squad of players sit in the club house at Surbiton and take note of the game. Federer&apos;s guile and Nadal&apos;s doggedness are things I&apos;m trying to instill in them.&quot;  *Nadal 7-5 1-0 FedererA shell-shocked Federer slips to 0-30 down and then dumps a smash into the net to present Nadal with three break points. Nadal can&apos;t take the first, but makes no mistake on the second, reading Federer&apos;s drop shot and putting the ball away. Worrying times for Federer. That&apos;s six games on the spin he&apos;s lost now.  Nadal 7-5 2-0 Federer*15-0. 30-0. 40-0. Jeu Nadal. Make that seven in a row.  *Nadal 7-5 2-1 FedererFederer stops the rot, holding to 30. His first game on the board for around 35 or 40 minutes. Cue a slightly ironic cheer from the crowd. Meanwhile Cormac Mee is mulling over Roger and Rafa&apos;s choice of changeover drinks: &quot;So Roger&apos;s an orange juice man and Rafa&apos;s a water pater. What does this say about there personalities?&quot; Not sure Cormac, but Federer could do with something slightly stronger in his orange juice right now.  Nadal 7-5 3-1 Federer*Federer makes inroads on Nadal&apos;s serve by getting to 30-all, but Nadal takes the next point and is handed the second when Federer nets. And some more thoughts from Gary Naylor: &quot;Can we talk of Federer&apos;s guile these days? He knows that he&apos;s unlikely to win long matches, maybe even long rallies, against the top men, so he appears to take too many risks looking for winners. The guile may still be in his head, but it&apos;s not in his play. No wonder - with all those miles on the clock.&quot;  *Nadal 7-5 3-2 FedererFederer slips to 15-40 down. Two break points.  He saves both with two strong serves, but even that doesn&apos;t really buoy the muted crowd up. Deuce. And then it&apos;s another break point for Nadal. Mrs Federer is grimacing in the players&apos; box, but her man eventually comes through, finishing off with a rare backhand winner. The crowd cheer a bit louder. And this from a helpful Peter Darbyshire: &quot;Writing here from Quebec where I work as a translator from English to French. The &quot;French&quot; e-mail at 4-5 is horribly written. It hurt my eyes just reading it. I think you can take it for granted it&apos;s a wind-up.&quot;  Nadal 7-5 4-2 Federer*Nadal is cruising at 40-0, throwing in his first ace of the day to get there, but a couple of beautiful backhands from Federer and he forges his way to deuce. That has some of the crowd on their feet, as they desperately try and gee the underdog up, but Nadal then goes and ruins things by winning the next two points.  *Nadal 7-5 4-3 Federer15-0. 30-0. 40-0. Game. Federer&apos;s clearly been listening to Paul Stephens: &quot;Roger needs to take a leaf out of John Isner&apos;s book - serve four aces on his service games then get a mis-hit off Rafa in the tie-breaks. At the moment this is one-way traffic, Rafa is just relentless.&quot;  Nadal 7-5 4-4 Federer*Federer works his way to 30-40 with a tremendous forehand winner on the run and a backhand missile down the line after a lengthy baseline dual. He can&apos;t take the break point. Deuce. Advantage Federer. Deuce. Advantage Federer. And this time he does break, as Nadal nets. A &quot;Rojaair, Rojaair&quot; or three follows.  *Nadal 7-5 5-4 FedererBut no sooner does Federer break, than he&apos;s broken. He manages to save two break points at 15-40, but from deuce he nets a forehand volley on the stretch and sends a backhand into the tramlines. Mrs Federer again mutters something to herself, while Rafa&apos;s girlfriend is not surprisingly looking rather serene. Once again Nadal manages to step it up when he needs to, he&apos;s just such a formidable match player and will serve for a two sets to love lead.  Play is suspendedFrom 30-all, a backhand from Federer goes an inch or two long. Set point. And it&apos;s raining. Play continues though and a Nadal forehand clips the net and sails into the tramlines. Deuce. And now it&apos;s really raining. The umbrellas are up. The players move towards the umpire and play is suspended. What a time to stop. The cover&apos;s haven&apos;t come on though, so hopefully it&apos;ll be a brief delay.  Meanwhile in the BBC studio it&apos;s back to Sue&apos;s flirting with Boris. Which seems like a good time to bring in the monikered Fernando. &quot;You can measure the level of tennis in a country by its TV commentators. While foreign TV has multiple grand slam champions who do we have in the UK? Becker in the studios in London.&quot;  And after what can only be a delay of about 10 minutes, they&apos;re back on. And because the stoppage was so brief, there&apos;ll be no warm-up. Nadal immediately brings up his second set point, but Federer charges into the net to advert the danger. Deuce. Nadal goes long and then completely shanks a forehand. Federer breaks. We&apos;re back on serve at 5-all.  *Nadal 7-5 5-6 FedererYou&apos;d think the damper, slower conditions would favour Nadal but not so. Federer races through his service game to love, not that half the crowd saw it because they&apos;re still taking their seats after that rain break.  Nadal 7-5 6-6 FedererA couple of errors on the Federer backhand get Nadal to 40-15. Federer then overcooks a forehand and we&apos;re into a second set tie-break, a breaker the world No3 surely has to win if he&apos;s to have any chance of turning this match around.  Nadal wins the second set tie-break 7-3Nadal wins the opening point against serve and then opens up on the forehand to go 2-0 up. Then it&apos;s 3-0. A big miss from Federer and it&apos;s 4-zip. Then it&apos;s Nadal&apos;s turn to throw in an error to make it 4-1. Federer pulls back one of the mini-breaks to get to 4-2, but misses a chance on Nadal&apos;s second serve. 5-2. Nadal rattles off a backhand winner and it&apos;s four set points. 6-2. Uncle Toni leaps out of his seat. Nadal misses the first set point but another backhand missile and that&apos;s the set. Nadal screams very loudly. Surely there&apos;s no way back for Federer now? A flat tie-break from him, especially considering how hard he worked to get back into the set.  Nadal 7-5 7-6 1-0 Federer*Nadal holds to 15. &quot;Is it just me or are you also getting confused that Nadal is wearing blue and Federer is red?&quot; asks Darren Holliday. &quot;I seem to be programmed to think it should be the other way around. I feel like I&apos;m watching the Merseyside derby with Everton and Liverpool swapping shirts before the game.&quot;  *Nadal 7-5 7-6 1-1 FedererFederer holds to love, while I try to digest the stats from the match so far. Nadal&apos;s hit just 18 winners compared to Federer&apos;s 41, but only 16 unforced errors compared to Federer&apos;s 39. Which is the story of the match really. Federer is having to force the issue and it&apos;s just not quite coming off.  Nadal 7-5 7-6 2-1 Federer*Nadal comes through to 30. Meanwhile Will Paterson seems to be accusing me of making him fail law school. &quot;We have our final exams on Tuesday and everyone is sat on the computers refreshing the live blog as the computers are too antiquated to handle video. If you could also tell us to get back to work that would be great as if they start doing it I will too...&quot; Give it 30 minutes or so Will and I reckon you&apos;ll have to come up with another excuse not to work.  *Nadal 7-5 7-6 2-2 FedererA nice mix-up from Federer at 30-all as he comes into the net and controls a volley. He bludgeons a forehand wide on the next point and it&apos;s deuce. But his aim is better at advantage and this time his forehand whistles past Nadal for the game.   Nadal 7-5 7-6 3-2 Federer*A hint of danger for Nadal at 15-30. He nudges ahead to get to 40-30, but an attempted lob goes long and it&apos;s deuce. Federer throws in a loose return to gift Nadal advantage. And Nadal digs out a backhand winner to stay ahead in the set.  *Nadal 7-5 7-6 4-2 FedererAt 0-30, Federer tries to be too clever which a drop shot and it slides into the net. 0-40. Three break points. And a very poor forehand gifts Nadal the break. Probably one of Federer&apos;s weakest games of the entire match. His first serve percentage is now down at 50% for the set, compared to Nadal&apos;s at around the 70 mark.  Nadal 7-5 7-6 4-3 Federer*A wounded Federer responds immediately, charging 0-30 ahead on Nadal&apos;s serve and then thumping away a smash from the back of the court. 0-40. Three break points. And just the one will do, as this time his drop shot does come off. Meanwhile Kate Robinson is feeling Will Paterson&apos;s pain. &quot;My friend, Dee, and I are doing exactly the same thing in Australia. Trying to study for exams, but in reality just constantly refreshing the tennis scores.&quot; And a pedant&apos;s email from Ian Copestake: &quot;I hope Will is not &quot;sat&quot; on an exam that tests the use of the passive tense in English.&quot;  *Nadal 7-5 7-6 4-4 FedererAn impressive hold from Federer, to 15, and he finishes it off with an ace. With a spring in his step, he charges up to the chair for a quick racket change. And here&apos;s David Holmes (not the DJ, I don&apos;t think), extolling the virtues of 3D tennis: &quot;I&apos;ve been watching the coverage on Eurosport 3D and, while the 3D doesn&apos;t add much, how nice it is to follow sporting events where the director is made to focus on only the action. Instead of the MTV-ization of live television that requires 20 camera angles pre-serve followed by super slow mo followed by crowd shots of who-knows-what. Hooray for technology that actually limits your viewpoint! Who knew that would be the main benefit of 3D?&quot; Who knew indeed, David.  Nadal 7-5 7-6 5-4 Federer*Nadal holds comfortably, not that I saw any of it because my computer crashed and the multi-coloured swirling umbrella of doom appeared. But I can tell you that it means Federer will have to serve to stay in the final ...  *Nadal 7-5 7-6 5-5 Federer... and that he does, holding to 15 with some excellent serving, far more efficient than my computer which is still rousing itself back into action.  Nadal 7-5 7-6 5-6 Federer*Some vicious strikes from Federer on the forehand side and suddenly it&apos;s three break points at 0-40. The first goes begging, but Federer then constructs a wonderful point to nudge 6-5 ahead. Cue by far the loudest cheer from the crowd so far. The Parisians are willing this into a fourth set, can Federer oblige? And all of this from 4-2 down.  Federer wins the third set 7-515-0. &quot;COME ON,&quot; shouts Federer. Backhand winner down the line, 30-0. A perfectly-executed drop shot, 40-0. Three set points. Federer misses on the first, but then absolutely wallops away an inside out forehand and that&apos;s the set. Game on.  Nadal 7-5 7-6 5-7 1-0 Federer*Federer&apos;s flying right now. At 0-15, Nadal thinks he&apos;s produced a passing winner, but Federer somehow conjures up a wonderful volley. Nadal nets on the next point and it&apos;s 0-40. Three break points. Nadal saves the first, saves the second, stepping into mid-court to punch away a forehand winner, and then saves the third with an ace. Three superb points. And then Federer goes wide on the return. &quot;VAMOS,&quot; screams Nadal. And he holds.  *Nadal 7-5 7-6 5-7 1-1 FedererFederer holds to 15 with some brutal serving, just as Will Paterson decides to get nasty. &quot;In answer to Ian, no, I don&apos;t think it is on the exam, but there&apos;s plenty of divorce law so give me a call when you need me - grammatical pedancy is a real passion killer I hear.&quot; Ouch.  Nadal 7-5 7-6 5-7 2-1 Federer*Anything Federer can do ... Nadal responds in kind with a convincing hold of his own. And this from Dr David Kirkpatrick, who by the sounds of it could soon have a medical malpractice suit on his hands: &quot;Will&apos;s &quot;homework&quot; may be stalled, but my patients in Dubai are confused by their erratic consultation timings as I switch between their notes and yours between consults.&quot;  *Nadal 7-5 7-6 5-7 3-1 FedererBut suddenly Federer&apos;s serve deserts him and his first double fault of the day brings up three break points at 0-40. Federer nets. Jeu and break Nadal. Meanwhile another pedant writes: &quot;It would be remiss of me not to point out to young Will that the word he&apos;s looking for is &apos;pedantry&apos; not &apos;pedancy&apos;. Good luck with the exam, old boy - Dan Shute.&quot;  Nadal 7-5 7-6 5-7 4-1 Federer*Nadal consolidates the break by coming through to 30. But I was putting a nice new picture above so I didn&apos;t see much of it to be honest. But here&apos;s something from Freddie O&apos;Farrell to keep you going: &quot;A2 revision on hold. Right now this match is far more important than any measly university place.&quot;  *Nadal 7-5 7-6 5-7 5-1 FedererFederer staves off a break point at 30-40, but can&apos;t repeat the trick at advantage after a brutal onslaught from Nadal. Nadal breaks and will serve for the championship. And it&apos;s not just Federer who&apos;s waving the white flag, here&apos;s Ian Copestake: &quot;My thanks to Will. All joshing aside hope his exams go well. I would call on his services but being single restricts my need both for divorce lawyers and the use of the possessive.&quot;  Nadal beats Federer to win the French Open 7-5 7-6 5-7 6-1Nadal whips a forehand down the line. 15-0. Another forehand rifle. 30-0. Federer nets a return. 40-0. Three championship points. Nadal looks like he&apos;s welling up and misses with his first serve. He regathers to get the second serve in, a quick rally ensues, and Federer goes long. Nadal falls down, his face buried in the red clay, but he picks himself up pretty quickly and scampers up to the net to embrace his opponent.  Nadal has a few quick words for the courtside reporter: He speaks in Spanish, but apparently he says what a hard and special tournament it is to win, and what&apos;s happened to him at Roland Garros is better than anything, it&apos;s a dream.  Trophy time. Federer trudges up first and is presented with the runners-up trophy by Jim Courier, before Nadal comes forward to get his hands on the Coupe des Mousquetaires for a record-equalling sixth time. Cue the Spanish national anthem.  Federer then takes the microphone and, in French, congratulates Nadal, says he&apos;s sad to lose to him, but that he&apos;s proud to play him again in a grand slam final. Nadal kindly decides to speak in English and apologises to Federer for beating him (for the sixth time in eight grand slam finals no less), but then opts to switch to Spanish. Gah. But all he seems to do is the obligatory thanking of the tournament organisers, sponsors and his team.  So there you go. It was another magnificent clay-court display from Nadal, every time Federer got near him, he managed to find a way to raise his game. It&apos;s just a shame Federer couldn&apos;t push him closer in that fourth set. And by matching Bjorn Borg&apos;s tally of six Roland Garros crowns, and claiming a 10th grand slam title overall, Nadal&apos;s also ensured he&apos;ll stay as the world No1 ahead of Novak Djokovic.

The warning comes as US airlines prepare to launch a legal challenge against the ETS in Luxembourg next month, adding to unease from the Russian and Chinese governments. From January carriers flying in and out of the European Union must join power companies in the EU in the cap-and-trade system, where they will have to acquire carbon credits to account for the emissions generated by their flights. Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s rating agency said return fares could rise by between \u20ac4.60 and \u20ac39.60 by 2020 to offset carbon costs of about \u20ac30 a tonne. However, the Association of European Airlines (AEA) warned that the proposals have yet to secure the backing of non-EU carriers and could spark tit-for-tat trade measures. &quot;If this is not sorted out in the next six months we run the risk of a trade conflict between the EU and third countries,&quot; said Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, secretary general of the AEA, whose members include British Airways, bmi and Virgin Atlantic. Speaking at the annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association in Singapore, Schulte-Strathaus said some airlines could be forced to cede routes to non-EU carriers because they would not be able to pass extra costs on to passengers. Non-EU carriers, by contrast, will be able to offset the higher costs as the rest of their network will not fly via the EU. Iata, the trade body whose members include British Airways, Air France and American Airlines, said the ETS would would increase annual industry costs by more than \u20ac1bn to Europe&apos;s airline industry expected to make a profit of $500m (\u00a3304m) this year. The worldwide profit, generated by Asian and US carriers, is expected to be $8.6bn. &quot;It makes Europe completely uncompetitive,&quot; said an Iata spokesman, who said airlines already faced an expected rise in fuel bills of $27bn this year. &quot;Whether the airlines can recover it from passengers depends on market conditions.&quot; US airlines will take their legal fight against ETS to the European court of justice next month where they will argue that the system breaches international law. The Air Transport Association of America (ATA) believes that imposing a European scheme on non-EU airlines contravenes various agreements including the Chicago Convention, which regulates the global airline industry. ATA argues that it breaches article 1 of the convention, which states that countries have sovereignty over airlines in their airspace. By that rationale, the EU has no right to tax a carrier flying out of, say, Dubai or New York. The US government has backed ATA, claiming that the scheme takes money away from airlines that could otherwise be invested in greener aircraft and engines. Nicholas Calio, ATA chief and an experienced Washington lobbyist who worked as an aide for President Bush, said a global trading scheme was the best solution. &quot;The legal case is important as a means of addressing what is wrong with the European scheme, but also as an opportunity for us to continue to pursue an approach that is appropriate for this global industry,&quot; he said. Meanwhile, Calio added, US airlines were preparing to join the ETS &quot;under protest&quot;.", "title": "European airlines fear trade war with US over carbon emissions levy", "sentences": ["By that rationale, the EU has no right to tax a carrier flying out of, say, Dubai or New York."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-05T14:29:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/london-2012-olympics-blog/2011/jun/07/running-kenyans-half-marathon-fluorspar", "tags": ["Running", "Fitness", "Life and style", "Kenya", "Africa", "World news", "Athletics", "Sport"], "article": "It&apos;s a long way down. We&apos;re parked at the edge of the Rift Valley, looking out over the vast, faded mass of land stretched out below. In the back of the van are about 10 Kenyan runners, including David Barmasai, who a few months ago won the Dubai marathon (the most handsomely remunerated race in the world) and is part of the Kenyan team for the upcoming world championships. The driver starts the engine and we bump along the uneven dirt road winding its way down into the valley. Far below, small, cone-shaped mountains poke up like grassy knolls. Forty-five minutes later, we come to a stop at the bottom. From here, the cone-shaped mountains tower above us, tiny farms perched somehow on the steep edges. We gather together for a group photograph and then, without any ceremony, start our run back up the dirt road to the top. The Fluorspar run is a rite of passage for any runner in Iten. Most of the athletes here have done it at least once and like to compare best times. The record is apparently 1 hour 23 minutes. It&apos;s exactly 21km \u2013 a half marathon \u2013 from bottom to top. Uphill the whole way: a rise of around 4,000ft. If the challenge of running up a 21km hill isn&apos;t enough, my day began at 4.30am when one of the other runners called me to ask what time we were leaving. He was ready to go, he told me. Soon after, we were all packed into the van and heading off through the darkness. The other athletes chattered excitedly as we went, while I closed my eyes and tried to get some kip.     Getting down to it ... in the Rift Valley before the run    When we start the run at the Fluorspar mineral mine, the morning sun is up and it&apos;s already fairly hot. After about five minutes, I&apos;m drenched in sweat and starting to lose touch with the other runners. Hill climbing has never been my strong point so this is going to be tough. &quot;Sure and steady,&quot; I tell myself as I pitter-patter along, avoiding the biggest stones and trying to take the shortest line around the innumerable switchbacks. But whenever I look up, the others are further ahead, until soon they disappear completely. People stop to watch me as I pass. At first they&apos;re friendly and I greet them happily. I&apos;m feeling fine, just taking my time. But as we go on, I start to feel faint. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m imagining things, but everyone I pass seems to be laughing at me. I try laughing back, but it just makes them cackle even more. It&apos;s like a bad dream: the manic laughter, the dirt road that never ends, the aching in my legs, the pounding sun. At one point, a lorry slips by \u2013 except it&apos;s moving barely faster than I am, and so for about five minutes to be following me, its straining engine growling at me to move aside. Up and up, back and forth goes the road, rising above the cone-shaped hills into the cooler air, where the clouds cling to the chiselled rock face that holds back the highlands. Finally, with one last push, I reach the top. The rest of them are all sitting on the grass drinking lemonade and eating peanuts and boiled eggs. My legs are wobbly as I stand there, feeling like Edmund Hillary on the peak of Everest. In the end it took me 1 hour 58 minutes, which isn&apos;t too bad. The others tell me kindly that anyone who can run it in under two hours is &quot;very strong&quot;. They all, of course, completed it much quicker, in just over 1 hour 30 minutes.

With Frankie Dettori sitting out the final two days of the Royal meeting as a consequence of the 10-day ban he collected for fading to ride out Blue Bunting for third place in last Friday&apos;s Oaks, an opening emerged for Godolphin to renew a connection with the 19-year-old Derby-winning jockey which has produced winners in Dubai and the UK already this year. Barzalona, whose stock has never been higher after his memorable Derby victory aboard Pour Moi, will also be picking up other rides for Godolphin at the meeting, including in the Hardwicke Stakes, while Freddie Head has booked him to ride Flash Dance, pacemaker to Goldikova, in the Queen Anne Stakes. Goldikova&apos;s clash with Canford Cliffs is the first of three Group One contests that form a memorable opening to the meeting. Intriguingly, the prospect of having to tackle Frankel has not deterred a number of the big stables from making entries in the St James&apos;s Palace Stakes, while the presence of the dual Japanese Group One winner Grand Prix Boss in the line-up adds further spice. Frankel is the 1-3 favourite with Totesport, with Dubawi Gold \u2013 who has six lengths to make up with Frankel on 2000 Guineas form \u2013 next in the betting at 9-1.

In 2009, Henderson was fined a record \u00a340,000 and banned from racing for three months when a horse he trained for the Queen failed a drugs test.

But the Scot survived all four obstacles at London&apos;s Queen&apos;s Club as he made a solid start to his title bid at the Aegon Championships. It was not particularly pretty but Murray will not have cared as he disposed of Xavier Malisse, the talented but erratic Belgian 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 in a match interrupted for an hour by rain midway through the first set. The world No4 pronounced himself satisfied with his &quot;first real test&quot; of his sore right ankle but Murray knows he is treading a tightrope, trying to get match practice on grass but trying not to do any more damage to the ankle he turned at the French Open in Paris just under a fortnight ago. Apart from the odd wince and groan, there were very few obvious signs of discomfort but having needed pain-killers to help him through to the semi-finals at Roland Garros, Murray is coping with just anti-inflammatories here. With Wimbledon beginning a week on Monday, there is no real time for Murray to let it heal on its own, a situation the Scot readily admits. &quot;I want to play as many matches as possible here but I also want to go into Wimbledon pain-free,&quot; he said. &quot;The good thing is that from playing matches here I am not doing it any damage but also by playing matches the pain is not going away. If this tournament was irrelevant then I wouldn&apos;t be playing. But it is relevant.&quot; Murray wore a brace on his right ankle to match the one he always wears on his left and there were a couple of grimaces and stifled yells from the Scot. &quot;It is really sore to touch but when I am walking around or running on it, it&apos;s OK,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve just got to get used to the new surface and I&apos;ve just got to keep doing the right things. The movement is something that takes a bit of time but I actually moved pretty well considering it was the first match. That was the first real test so it&apos;s good to get through.&quot; Murray had already broken the Malisse serve when the rain came at 3-1 to the world No4 and when they returned after an hour, he quickly wrapped up the first set as Malisse seemed set on going for winners at every opportunity. A semi-finalist at Wimbledon in 2002, the Belgian is hugely talented but is error-prone. Murray, by contrast, played within himself and rarely looked as aggressive as he had in Paris. The Scot looked ready to wrap up victory when he forced two break points for a 6-5 lead but an improving Malisse saved both and then a third to hold. Murray then threw in his only loose service game of the match and the Belgian broke to force a decider. It was Ivan Ljubicic, the Croatian, who earlier in the week described the grass at Queen&apos;s as slower than the clay of Roland Garros and there were times when it looked like he was right. Murray and Malisse shared a host of lengthy baseline rallies and it took 51 minutes before the Scot even served and volleyed for the first time. But having annoyed himself by dropping the second set Murray quickly refocused and forced an early break in the decider to lead 2-1. Malisse had two break points to get back on level terms at 3-3 but Murray dug deep to hold and from then on, he was in control, breaking for a second time to clinch victory. &quot;I don&apos;t understand why it was so slow,&quot; Murray said. &quot;I don&apos;t mind a slow grass court but it&apos;s the slowest I&apos;ve seen it. But it&apos;s good because I&apos;ve got to play a lot of rallies and test it out and do a lot of running, so in that respect it&apos;s good.&quot; Murray will need to step it up on Thursday when he plays the Serb Janko Tipsarevic, who saw off the American Michael Russell, 7-6, 7-6. Tipsarevic beat Murray at Queen&apos;s in 2006 when the Scot was only 19 years old and has won three of their six meetings, including their last encounter, in Dubai last year. &quot;He&apos;s a very good player,&quot; Murray said of Tipsarevic. &quot;I lost to him here a few years ago and he&apos;s a good grass court player, a tricky opponent. Normally he plays better against better opposition, I think he&apos;s said that quite a few times. He does like the grass and he&apos;ll be tough. I&apos;ll have to play better than today if I want to win.&quot; The former US Open champion, Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro of Argentina, continued his fine progress here with a 6-4, 6-4 win over the Russian Igor Kunitsyn.", "title": "Andy Murray's right ankle stands up to Xavier Malisse test at Queen's", "sentences": ["Tipsarevic beat Murray at Queen&apos;s in 2006 when the Scot was only 19 years old and has won three of their six meetings, including their last encounter, in Dubai last year."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-08T20:45:11Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/10/oscar-pistorius-small-talk", "tags": ["Oscar Pistorius", "Athletics", "Paralympics 2012", "Sport"], "article": "[Small Talk has already had to vamp for a couple of minutes, having pressed record on his dictaphone only to be greeted with BATTERY LOW and a unilateral decision to switch off.

[On a very fuzzy line] Yeah, preparations are going quite well. I&apos;ve had a good start to the season and I&apos;m on track for next year. We&apos;ll take this year as a stepping stone, there&apos;s a couple of goals that I&apos;d like to hit this season, so I think it&apos;ll end up being a successful year. You&apos;ve been keeping pretty busy too, we noticed on your Twitter feed that you&apos;ve been to Amsterdam, Venice and London in the last week. Yeah, I&apos;ve had a busy time lately, setting up the season. After Manchester, I&apos;m in Ostrava, then Portland, then New York then I&apos;ll be back here in the UK and Europe so it&apos;s a busy couple of months. Where&apos;s your favourite place to be? I must admit I quite like Mozambique, it&apos;s pretty unspoiled, pretty rural. It&apos;s a beautiful place, really low-key and down-to-earth and the people are friendly. I really enjoy it there, apart from the fact that there&apos;s no cell phone signal, although I guess that might be a perk. There are a couple of places that have captured my heart for different reasons, and that&apos;s one of them. You&apos;re going to be based in Italy for the season? Yeah, we&apos;re going to be based in Gemona, which is not far from Venice and Trieste. It&apos;s a beautiful city, very quiet, only about 1,500 people, but the facilities there are nice and it&apos;s quite central to fly anywhere in Europe so it&apos;ll be a nice place to stay. Now you&apos;re a Lazio fan \u2013will you have chance to get to the Stadio Olimpico? Yeah I should get some time for a game or two. I think being a Lazio supporter in Italy is not always a good thing, but it&apos;s a team that I&apos;ve supported from a young age. A friend of mine&apos;s parents came from Rome and I used to go to their house at the weekend to watch the games and it became second nature for me to shout for them. So I&apos;ve stuck to my guns there, though I must admit there&apos;s been some [CRACKLE, CRACKLE, CRACKLE] but there have been some good moments too. Did you manage to get to any World Cup matches? [CRACKLE, CRACKLE, CRACKLE continues ominously] I didn&apos;t unfortunately. Half of Europe went to South Africa, I think I was the only South African to come to Europe. I didn&apos;t get chance to see any, which was quite depressing for me, but I&apos;ve made athletics my No1 priority so I have to make sacrifices. Speaking of sacrifices, you&apos;ve lost a bit of weight I believe? [Chuckle] Yeah, I&apos;ve been quite strong in the past but my power-to-weight threshold could have been better. I&apos;m just about as strong as I was before, but I&apos;ve lost a kilogram or two. It could make a real difference. What are your top dieting tips? My top [FUZZY CRACKLE] Yeah, if I was going to lose a few pounds [FUZZY CRACKLING ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE] what advice would you give me? [STATIC SILENCE] Can you repeat that?

Unplanned tunnel. Sorry about that. Not a problem. Can&apos;t hold you responsible for the layout of the British railway system. You were about to tell me about your top dieting tips. Just lots of veggies and no carbs after seven at night. Sound advice. What would you cook us if we came round for dinner? If we weren&apos;t on a diet that is. Oooh. I&apos;d make a homemade bread with jalapenos, then we&apos;d have a lasagne and then molten [?] pudding with chocolate truffles for dessert. That sounds really good although I don&apos;t really remember what it tastes like. So are you a bit of a chef in the kitchen? Yeah, I lived by myself for a couple of years so I&apos;m quite used to cooking and I really do enjoy it. You&apos;ve got a racehorse as well. How did that happen? I&apos;ve got a couple at the moment. I grouped up with a family who were very big on racehorses and I used to go and watch some races. The horseracing culture in South Africa is quite big. I&apos;ve got a horse that won the Epsom Derby and the Dubai Duty Free \u2013 it&apos;s a really top-bred horse, so hopefully we&apos;re going to travel a bit with him I&apos;m hoping. And when you&apos;re at the races do you stick your mortgage on the outsider or keep your powder dry? I&apos;m not much of a punter, I just really enjoy the sport. It&apos;s a beautiful, beautiful sport. Horses aren&apos;t the only animals in your life. You&apos;ve got a couple of white tigers too. Hahahaha. You&apos;ve really done your research [this is the first time anyone has ever said this to Small Talk. Ever]. Yeah, I keep them in my house and they&apos;re getting a bit big now, the male is 200kg and the female 150 or 160, so I&apos;m going to have to find something to do with them and I hope everything&apos;s in one piece when I get home. One question we always ask is &apos;Who would win a fight between a lion and a tiger?&apos; and it seems you might be able to give us a definite answer. I think a tiger. They&apos;re both the same weight up front but not at the back and I think they&apos;re used to fighting by themselves, they don&apos;t fight in a pack. One-on-one they&apos;d be best equipped for a fight. Your autobiography is Blade Runner \u2013 have you ever seen the film? I actually haven&apos;t. I&apos;ve got it on my computer, so I need to watch it. I should, I really should. What&apos;s your favourite film then, if you haven&apos;t seen that one? I really like Guy Ritchie films, old Stanley Kubrick films, Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, Snatch, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, those are the movies I really enjoy. Do you ever do karaoke? I did karaoke in a Chinese bar in [OMINOUS FUZZY DISTORTION] about three or four years ago but that was probably the first and last time, not because I didn&apos;t enjoy it but because the people in the bar didn&apos;t enjoy it. It was the one that goes [ADOPTS DEEP VOICE] &quot;You got me on my knees, baby. Doo doo do doo.&quot; Hey? Oh, we&apos;re going through a tunnel so if the phone cuts off.

Yeah, she&apos;s [OBSCURED BY STATICFUZZ that ends with a happy cackle]. She&apos;s just got divorced recently, not that I follow all the social movements. Have you ever seen a UFO? I&apos;ve probably thought that I&apos;ve seen a UFO, but I don&apos;t think it would have been one. Might have been a bit late in the day or early in the morning. What would you put in Room 101? Room 101? Oof. Erm. Jeez. I don&apos;t think [FUZZYSTATIC] asked a question like that before. [STATICFUZZINESS] like a cocktail bar? Er, OK. This is becoming slightly impossible. Last of all then, can you tell us a joke? Yes. I should be able to tell you a joke. [FUZZ! FUZZ!] sure. I&apos;m really slow today, nothing is coming to mind. [CCRRRACKLE STATIC! FUZZ! FUZZYSTATIC!

Amid a thicket of slogans, one stood out: &quot;A kilo of meat costs 100 pounds, yet a square metre in Madinaty costs half a pound,&quot; it read in Arabic. For most of the foreign journalists, those words meant nothing. For most Egyptians, they meant everything. If you had to tell the story of Egypt&apos;s popular revolt through one patch of land, that patch of land would be Madinaty \u2013 a dust-blown wasteland deep in the desert to the east of the capital, and eventual home to a $3bn commercial complex featuring 80,000 villas and townhouses, as well as new hotels, hospitals and schools. Madinaty is just one of a rash of desert developments taking shape on Cairo&apos;s sandy fringes, where signature Greg Norman golf courses sprout from some of the most arid land imaginable and Zaha Hadid-designed office blocks are winched skyward at addresses that can be expressed only in kilometre distance-markers. These are the satellite cities: half-built emblems of the country&apos;s institutionalised corruption under Mubarak. Both the cities and the gated compounds within them mushroomed on the back of dirt-cheap land sales by the state; deals signed as food inflation spiralled and the most basic daily staples were put beyond the reach of millions of ordinary Egyptians. &quot;You may call them satellite cities, but they&apos;re not satellites any more \u2013 now they&apos;ve become the planets themselves,&quot; claimed former minister Adel Naguib in an interview with the Guardian last year. At the time, he was senior vice president of Cairo&apos;s New Urban Communities Authority. Twelve months on, most of Naguib&apos;s senior colleagues are in jail, and, along with several other real estate developers, the firm behind Madinaty is being dragged through the courts. Yet in a country where 42% of the population lives below the poverty line, glossy promotional catalogues for residential developments in the desert continue to proliferate, promising 14 different underfloor-heated bathroom configurations and urging prospective customers to buy into the surrounding desert and, more importantly, into the concept of an exclusive, secluded future. For 14 centuries, Cairo grew only within the natural confines of the Moqattam clifftops to the east and the Saharan desert to the west. Now it is one of the\u00a0densest urban areas in the world; today, Cairo \u2013 the biggest city in Africa and the Middle East \u2013 creaks under the weight of up to 20 million people, more than the populations of Libya, Lebanon and Jordan combined. But over the past decade, the contours of this megacity have changed. Within the next five years, the two biggest hubs of desert development \u2013 6th October City to the west and New Cairo to the east \u2013 are each set to house up to 5\u00a0million people. By 2030, when Greater Cairo&apos;s population is predicted to top 30 million, government estimates suggest that half of those residents will live not in Cairo itself, but in a satellite city. No matter which direction you look out of Cairo, the pace of construction is breathtaking. &quot;If you leave the area for two months and then come back, the whole place is unrecognisable,&quot; says one project manager at a major New Cairo development. &quot;This is probably the fastest-growing urban area you&apos;ll see in your life.&quot; Next Move is Egypt&apos;s biggest annual property expo, and last year&apos;s event saw Ferraris, speedboats and string quartets wheeled out by competing companies looking to broaden their share of a real estate market that has been growing by 22% per annum in recent years and that contributes $16bn annually to the country&apos;s GDP. Of the 67 major construction projects represented, only three were in Cairo &quot;proper&quot;, the rest lying in the desert beyond. It&apos;s a far cry from the early 1990s, when New Cairo consisted of little more than a ragtag settlement at Katameya, inhabited by a handful of Egyptians relocated there by the government after their homes were lost in a devastating earthquake. That was when Khaled and Tarek Abu Talib bought 250 acres of remote desert land and announced plans to build an 18-hole golf course and residential complex on the site. Most people thought they were mad. Today, their private gated compound is one of the ritziest in the country and its pool terrace looks out over an ocean of busily twitching cranes. The name Katameya Heights, like other developments that sprung up at the same time \u2013 Beverly Hills, Dreamland, Utopia \u2013 is now synonymous with the best in upper-class living; nearly a third of Egyptian children may be malnourished, but you wouldn&apos;t know it from these toy-town driveways, where clubhouse membership packages start at $22,000. The suburban drift of the Cairene elite has been going on for the best part of two decades, but in the past few years it has accelerated sharply. Whereas older developments were strictly for the\u00a0extravagantly wealthy, today&apos;s are targeted at\u00a0a wider band of Egyptians, many of whom need\u00a0little persuasion to vacate the choked city centre. When asked why they wanted to relocate, customers at the Next Move conference used the\u00a0same word time and again: zahma, meaning &quot;traffic&quot; or &quot;crowds&quot;. It was Gamal Abdel Nasser&apos;s policy of handing out an acre of agricultural land to each nuclear family in the aftermath of his coup against British rule in 1952 that sowed the seeds of Cairo&apos;s demographic explosion; as rural families grew bigger and dwindling land supplies got spliced up between children, waves of migration began into the capital, swelling its already saturated streets. Much of the construction that took place to accommodate these newcomers was informal; without a parallel upgrade in infrastructure, pressure on public services has been at a critical stage for years. Traffic congestion means it can take more than an hour to cross the Nile; green space is in such short supply that picnicking families have nowhere to gather but on the threadbare grass verges beside the city&apos;s highways. &quot;Years ago my home was a nice place, but now I barely recognise it,&quot; says Anton Girgis, a\u00a0telecoms engineer living in Giza. &quot;The whole city has been transformed into one big shanty town.&quot; On the clifftop above Cairo&apos;s imposing 12th century Citadel, a new fortress is taking shape. It\u00a0is being built by the Egyptian arm of Emaar, a\u00a0Dubai-based company responsible for the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. Their project here is called Uptown, and the long approach to its sales centre is lined by giant pictures of light-skinned families having barbecues and parking their Mercedes in the garage. The biggest challenge facing architects of the new urban communities was always the need to rebrand the desert into a hospitable zone of aspiration, rather than condemnation. &quot;It&apos;s where children can play safely, where neighbours foster long-lasting relationships, and where the community really cares,&quot; declares a sign at the Emaar Misr sales centre above the maquette of Mivida, a\u00a0$1bn Emaar villa complex in New Cairo. Every developer I spoke to insisted that the satellite cities represented a return to community, not an\u00a0escape from it; the desert project reconstituted not as an act of elite self-interest, but rather as a\u00a0progressive national mission for all Egyptians. The current development is cited as the latest effort in a continuous line of post-independence expansion; both Nasser and Sadat, the argument goes, initiated building projects that were infused with a revolutionary legitimacy \u2013 industrial zones and workers&apos; compounds taming the wilderness into green pastures for a newly independent country. Yet the notion of the heroic desert pioneer hardly fits the satellite city dweller of today, sequestered behind high walls over which most of Cairo&apos;s residents will never get to glimpse \u2013 unless they happen to work there as guards, nannies or cleaners. On the second storey of a skeleton-villa in a New Cairo compound named La Reve, I spoke to labourer Mohammed Sayed Mohammed, kefiya-clad and busy directing a team of seven workers \u2013 all relatives of his from the Upper Egyptian city of Sohag. &quot;We make the villas and move on,&quot; said Mohammed, who is paid $15 per square metre of construction \u2013 money that is then split between the family members assisting him. &quot;I have no idea who will end up living here \u2013 someone higher than me! After I finish this villa, I&apos;ll be lucky ever to be allowed back in; that&apos;s why the owner is paying so much, to get away from the people.&quot; He poured some water over his face and motioned his barefoot cousins to take a break from their bricklaying and plastering. &quot;The people who will end up living here, they want the calm. It makes sense; everyone wants a corner of the world to themselves.&quot; Mohammed is getting married this year. Although he currently lives at La Reve, should he and his new wife move to Cairo, they will doubtless end up in one of the city&apos;s informal settlements known as ashwai&apos;yat, an Arabic word that means random or haphazard. Out near the ring road, mile upon mile of these soaring redbrick apartment blocks jostle for space, all permanently unfinished, clumps of steel rebars sprouting from their rooftops ready to shoulder the next illegally constructed storey. They are home to 10 million of Cairo&apos;s poorer residents, paying between \u00a31 and \u00a340 a month in rent per family. The rise of the satellite cities and the consequent spread of the ashwa&apos;iyat became two sides of the same coin under Mubarak; the two spaces could not be more different, and yet each is a result of the retreat of central government \u2013 an abandonment to privatised luxury on the one hand, and a virtually nonexistent infrastructure of crumbling public services on the other. In the desert&apos;s gated communities, where a two-bedroom flat costs \u00a360,000 and\u00a0a villa anywhere between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a310m, residents were encouraged to &quot;vote&quot; among themselves on what day to have their grass cut or trash collected, comfortably sheltered from the problems of less privileged Cairenes downtown. &quot;For any social system to flourish,&quot; claims Professor Ahmed Okasha, Egypt&apos;s preeminent expert on mental health and a former president of\u00a0the World Psychiatric Association, &quot;you need different classes to have a symbiotic relationship. But here there has been a breakdown in social cohesion, which has gone hand in hand with the changes to land use engineered by the satellite cities. They intensify the gap between rich and poor, and that gap has produced a very dangerous situation for Egypt.&quot; Mubarak&apos;s dictatorship relied on a rhetoric of &quot;stability&quot; and the value of &quot;security&quot; over freedom. The satellite cities took this idea to its most extreme conclusion \u2013 little surprise, then, that they became an early target for those seeking to bring down his regime. Long before Egyptians took to the streets on 25 January this year, a campaigning lawyer named Hamdy El-Fakharany was attacking the new developments head on. Last September, judges were asked to rule on whether the Mubarak regime had broken the law by flogging desert land to developers without holding competitive auctions. Madinaty and its parent company, TMG, were first up. Already rocked by the arrest, trial and death sentence (subsequently commuted) of TMG director and leading light of the ruling National Democratic party, Hisham Talaat Moustafa,following the murder of his ex-girlfriend, the company&apos;s lawyer argued that El-Fakharany&apos;s legal challenges would frighten off investors and &quot;open the gates of hell&quot;. Prime minister Ahmed Nazif also\u00a0weighed in, saying that Egypt would be committing &quot;economic suicide&quot; if any land sales were annulled. The judges were unmoved; Madinaty&apos;s land acquisition was ruled illegal. El-Fakharany, who saw the original contract, says it ensured that the state was entitled to 7% of\u00a0the residential properties built, while Talaat Moustafa \u2013 a close friend of Gamal Mubarak, the\u00a0former president&apos;s son \u2013 would get 93%. The\u00a0government had also agreed to exempt the developer from all taxes and fees incurred during construction and relinquished rights to any commercial or retail space. &quot;The deal couldn&apos;t have been any more slanted to the side of the developer against Egypt,&quot; says El-Fakharany. &quot;It was as if it was drafted by an enemy of the state.&quot; A hasty government effort to reissue the relevant sales contracts, through a legal sleight of hand, was cut short by January&apos;s popular uprising. Now Mubarak has gone and Madinaty has been joined in the dock by another mega-developer, Palm Hills, prompting many other companies to try to ward off legal action by voluntarily handing back land to the state. Two former housing ministers have been put behind bars and public anger against property developers has reached a\u00a0climax. And yet no coherent alternative to the\u00a0satellite city project \u2013 and its correlating boom in the ashwa&apos;iyat \u2013 has so far been articulated. Driving down an empty highway on a recent visit to New Cairo, I was struck by the bleakness of the building sites, the craters rupturing the street, the water pipes, phone cables and traffic signs left strewn across the roadside. Central Cairo may, as the writer Maria Golia once put it, hang together only by rubber bands, but New Cairo is a mess. The future of these reclaimed lands will depend largely on the government that is elected later this year; many want to see them set aside for affordable developments with a community-driven public services infrastructure. But it is also possible they will simply be re-auctioned and new gated compounds built. Whether Egyptians will accept that as a solution to Cairo&apos;s housing crisis remains to be seen. The only thing certain is\u00a0that this megacity will keep growing. \u2022 This article was edited on 13 June 2011.

His runaway success in the 2,000 Guineas was the most amazing performance in an English Classic of my racing lifetime and the Ascot crowd will doubtless hope he can do something similar in the St James&apos;s Palace Stakes on Tuesday. Betting at odds of 1-3 will have no appeal for most punters, even though Frankel seems a horse of rare brilliance. It should be remembered that his exertions at Newmarket may have taken a heavy toll, the effects of which may not be apparent until he is tested on a racecourse again. Still, if he runs to his best form, he will surely provide Henry Cecil with his 73rd success at the royal jamboree. Rather than try to find something to beat him, those who like to bet at bigger odds might be better advised to save their pennies for Cecil&apos;s other big hope of the week, Twice Over, a 10-1 shot for the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes on Wednesday. Three times a Group One winner at this distance, Twice Over is nevertheless seen as being just a little way short of top class and he has certainly done nothing to shore up his reputation this year, having been stuffed in the Dubai World Cup and the Lockinge. But he was badly drawn and got no run in the Middle East, while the drop back to a mile did not suit him at Newbury. He has run with credit on three previous visits to Ascot, all at the royal meeting. Third in the St James&apos;s Palace Stakes in 2008, he was beaten just a length in this race in 2009 and half as far when a shade unlucky behind Byword last year. So You Think is an exciting prospect, but he has not proved himself at this level in the northern hemisphere. His ability is entirely factored into his current odds of 1-2 and Twice Over is an attractive each-way alternative. Another trainer who may have a productive week is Saeed bin Suroor. The Godolphin man could certainly do with a change of fortune, having sent out just six winners in Britain this year, while the firm&apos;s other trainer, Mahmood al-Zarooni, has had three times as many, including the 1,000 Guineas. Delegator was one of Bin Suroor&apos;s winners when he took the Duke of York Stakes last month. It is a pity it has taken so long for connections to discover that he might be a sprinter, but this five-year-old is a solid favourite for the Golden Jubilee on Saturday, when the Derby-winning Micka\u00ebl Barzalona will deputise for the suspended Frankie Dettori. The yard also have a fine chance with Sajjhaa in Wednesday&apos;s Windsor Forest Stakes. This filly gave Midday a race at York, the pair pulling four lengths clear, and that effort looks still more admirable in the light of Midday&apos;s performance in the Coronation Cup. Seta, favourite for the Windsor Forest, has been winning in Listed company and has more to prove than Sajjhaa. Seta&apos;s trainer, Luca Cumani, may have more luck an hour later in the Royal Hunt Cup, for which he fields Start Right, third from a horrible draw at Epsom last time. The meeting begins with a sensational clash of talent when Goldikova and Canford Cliffs meet in the Queen Anne. Canford Cliffs is favourite and has a rare turn of foot, but narrow victories over Dick Turpin, Rip Van\u00a0Winkle and Worthadd do not amount to the same as Goldikova&apos;s many achievements. The French mare may repeat her success in this race last year. Much as I would love to be able to tip Frederick Engels for success at Royal Ascot, Bannock is the two-year-old I am most looking forward to seeing. Mark Johnston&apos;s charge did not get the run of Sandown&apos;s National Stakes when last seen and will be interesting in whichever race is chosen for him.", "title": "Frankel is Henry Cecil's Royal Ascot star turn but Twice Over is value", "sentences": ["Three times a Group One winner at this distance, Twice Over is nevertheless seen as being just a little way short of top class and he has certainly done nothing to shore up his reputation this year, having been stuffed in the Dubai World Cup and the Lockinge."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-11T16:19:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/jun/13/bodycount-hands-on", "tags": ["E3 2011", "Games", "Technology", "PS3", "Xbox", "PlayStation", "Culture"], "article": "&quot;We have just come through Alpha. We are screaming and on fire.&quot; Andy Wilson, producer of Bodycount, was, I believe, speaking metaphorically when he showed off the latest build of the game at Namco Bandai&apos;s big press event in Dubai last month. And after a decent E3 showing last week, the flames must be well and truly doused.  It has certainly been an interesting development story. The title drew an explosion of press interest earlier this year when the game&apos;s director Stuart Black left the project under something of a cloud. Everyone wanted to turn it into a &quot;studio in chaos&quot; story, but the studio selfishly wrecked those plans by quietly getting on with the job at hand.  &quot;It kind of did a disservice to the 110 people who have worked really bloody hard on Bodycount to suggest that one guy going is actually going to make that big a difference,&quot; says Wilson. &quot;But, then, if you look like you&apos;ve been through turbulence, when you get press stories about your &apos;problem project&apos;, it does give you a real underdog feeling. It really makes you want to prove people wrong.&quot;  But then, many of the staff here have already proved themselves in this sector. A majority previously worked on Black, Criterion&apos;s aggressively stylised, effects-laden shooter, that arrived to critical acclaim at the end of the PlayStation 2&apos;s glory days. When a proposed sequel fell-through, they joined what would become Codemasters Guildford, apparently to continue Black&apos;s legacy. &quot;One of the reasons Stuart leaving hasn&apos;t had the impact it could have been is that we locked the content pretty early, which you have to do when you&apos;re building a team. If we came racing through production, experimenting all the way, it would have had a bigger impact. I&apos;m happy that the core of everything is what we set out two years ago. We stayed true to it.&quot;  The result could well be one of the most progressive and individual shooters for a number of years. Set in a dystopian, war-ravaged near-future, the action follows an ex-forces hard nut employed by shadowy private security firm, The Network, to fix combat hotpots around the world (imagine Country House Rescue, but with more gunfire and less country houses). It soon becomes clear that these seemingly unrelated localised disputes are being manipulated by another high-tech corporate presence named Target. Just what the heck is going on?      The gameplay high concept is simple; almost every scenic element in Bodycount can be shredded to pieces by bullets and grenades. Brick walls, wooden fences, metal barrels \u2013 they&apos;re all vulnerable. At the same time, the levels are generally open and expansive, with multiple routes between the mission start point and the eventual destination. The result is an ever-changing, high-octane battlefield, in which cover positions become exposed in seconds as bullet-fire rips through the scenery.  It&apos;s also unashamedly non-&quot;realistic&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s an arcade-style experience,&quot; says Wilson. &quot;This is not a grim and gritty real-world shooter, it&apos;s not set in any particular conflict. It&apos;s about accessibility and immediacy.&quot; But he&apos;s keen that we don&apos;t read &quot;arcade&quot; as &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;shallow&quot;. Judging by the level I played, set in and around a decrepit dock site, Bodycount should be neither. Within these splintering worlds are enemies who don&apos;t infinitely respawn and don&apos;t perform endless re-enactments of the charge of the light brigade. Instead, the team has implemented a class-based AI system, allowing computer soldiers to attempt rudimentary squad tactics, or simply to sneak up and pepper you with lead while you&apos;re looking in the other direction. At one point during my hands-on, a lone infantryman tailed me up some stairs, through a building, and along a steep incline before taking his chance to blast me in the back. That was quite a surprise. Adding to the chaos is the presence of two warring factions: the army and the militia. Each of these features specialist combatants, such as medics and commanders (who can call in airstrikes) and they&apos;ll all fight each other if they meet in the warzone. As everything is procedurally generated, the skirmishes play out differently every time. It might be tempting to sit back and enjoy the carnage, but this isn&apos;t a good idea \u2013 kills are needed for intel, the in-game currency that every dead body drops. This stuff fills up a meter at the base of the screen, which eventually provides access to four temporary special abilities: explosive ammo, the ability to call in airstrikes, invincibility and a radar, which highlights enemy positions. Each of these can also be upgraded to a second level of lethality.      But there&apos;s a two-tier system here, which is where the arcade thinking comes in. Just shooting a guy earns you blue &quot;low-yield&quot; intel that takes a while to fill up the gauge. However, perform a skill kill such as a headshot or a multiple kill with a grenade and you pick up yellow &quot;high-yield&quot; intel that powers you up much faster. It&apos;s also possible to chain skill kills together, which not only gives almost instant access to abilities, it also multiples your score count for the level. An extra complication is added by the presence of battlefield scavengers, specialist enemies who&apos;ll steal intel and ammo if you don&apos;t get there quick enough; the equivalent of bonus items flashing and then disappearing in an old school arcade title. This coin-op shooter feel is accentuated by the offbeat sound design. When ammo runs low, every bullet fired is accompanied by a musical note, warning you to re-load. Musical themes also play when you grab intel, which is represented on screen by the glowing neon icons. It all brings to mind the aesthetics of Cave or Treasure title, rather than the slavish authenticity of CoD and its ilk. &quot;This is a deliberate design decision,&quot; says Wilson. &quot;We wanted to hark back to the arcade experiences we grew up with. It even extends to the score, where we occasionally introduce the odd 16bit-sounding riff over the soaring strings.&quot; In short, this is bullet hell projected into a 3D landscape.  These idiosyncratic style decisions extend to the environmental designs. Each of the game&apos;s three chapters are colour-coded; the opening is all greens and yellows, denoting a rotting, sickly landscape. When the action moves to Asia in chapter two, it&apos;s all Bladerunner-style neon, rain and electric blues. The closing section moves into the Target HQ, where hellish reds dominate. There&apos;s a real sense of cinematography and mood; an attempt to convey something else apart from photographic &quot;realism&quot;. &quot;A lot of games go down the route of using photographic textures, even Split/Second was like this; you&apos;d use a lot of photographic reference to build your textures \u2013 and even if you paint over or into them you still have this real-world basis to the art. Bodycount is very different \u2013 it&apos;s an artist-crafted game, the art director Max Cant was very keen on this. It&apos;s almost painted, it&apos;s taken a lot of fine art skill from the design team, and it&apos;s tested abilities that a lot of artists in the industry don&apos;t have anymore because it&apos;s all so machine driven now.&quot;      This is particularly defined in the Target buildings that players must raid at the end of key missions. These are ominous slabs of cutting edge architecture, the interiors all brushed aluminium, glass and gloss surfaces. We&apos;re shown one example, which is all minimalist black and red interiors sectioned off into glass compartments. Target guards, dressed entirely in black, pour out at us, splitting off into flanking squads and whipping in and out between support beams. The whole set up oozes style and threat, like a cyberpunk action sequence directed by Stanley Kubrick. Wilson also references Star Wars and Tron: Legacy as influences. Possibly though, the most interesting facet of the game is its modestly revolutionary cover lean system. Instead of having to &quot;stick&quot; to cover objects, players simply press down the left trigger to go into an iron sight view; while the button is held, you&apos;re rooted to the spot, but you can still use each of the analogue sticks to bob about and look around. As Wilson explains, &quot;Not only can I hunker down behind cover and pick out targets, but as the environment shreds down around me, I can get really nice lines of sight through objects.&quot; It takes several minutes to get the hang of and may be too much of a lateral step for the CoD crew, but it&apos;s a really nice, highly adaptive system that emancipates the whole cover mechanic. I tended to use it when ever I had a slightly obscured vantage point, even if I was several metres form the nearest cover object, playing the angles and, as Wilson says, just seeking out those unexpected engagement lines.  Bodycount will be steaming into a crowded marketplace of established FPS mega-brands as well as hyped newcomers such as Bulletstorm and Rage. But it has a very different feel, an openness, a playfulness and a sense of style that will remind many of the classic Rare/Free Radical Design shooters Perfect Dark and Time Splitters. &quot;It&apos;s been a great project to work on,&quot; says Wilson. &quot;It was a proper trial by fire in terms of building a studio, but it&apos;s a brilliant end result as far as I&apos;m concerned.&quot; At E3, amid the gritty military shooters and straight-faced sci-fi blasters, he no doubt discovered more about whether the gaming world is ready for a combination of Perfect Dark, Black and Bangai-O. The staff at Codemasters Guildford have built a studio and a fascinating game, the next task \u2013 pushing an original IP in the world of franchised super-series \u2013 will be their greatest challenge yet.

Jane Andrews suffered a shattered heel in the alleged attack by the Mercury prize winner \u2013 real name Ryan Williams \u2013 at his home. They allegedly had a row about who she was with the night before and Size, 41, is said to have become aggressive after she told him: &quot;This relationship is over.&quot; He grabbed her by her hair, armpits and head before pushing her down the stairs, the jury heard. Andrews told Bristol crown court that she landed in a crumpled heap at the bottom of the stairs screaming in agony. She said: &quot;I went down like a ragdoll from top to bottom. I put my good leg out after I&apos;d hit the third step but just watched my leg go over and I didn&apos;t touch anything else before I hit the bottom. &quot;My bone came out all the way. It was like a mushroom cloud when a bomb goes off. I sat there crumpled. He stood halfway down the stairs and just smiled. I asked him several times to call an ambulance. But he just kept smiling and saying there was nothing wrong with it.&quot; Size denies committing grievous bodily harm at his house in Bristol on a Sunday morning in July last year and has pleaded not guilty to damaging Andrews&apos; phone during the same incident. Andrews said that following the alleged attack she was &quot;screaming&quot; and &quot;foaming at the mouth&quot;. She claims Size refused to help her and she was forced to drag herself out of the house and flag down a passerby, who dialled 999. &quot;When the surgeon saw my heel it was completely smashed up in three bits. He said it was like someone had stepped on a Crunchie bar. I was bed-bound for six months and on crutches until Christmas,&quot; she said. Andrews alleges that Size later tried to make her change her police statement after a meeting at his house in September or October last year. &quot;He said he was sorry, a moment of madness. He was just worried about his career, not me.&quot; Size admits they argued but claims Andrews had actually stormed out of a nearby bathroom and, with no force from him, they both fell down the stairs. Andrew Langdon, defending Size, said Andrews had drunk six or seven shots of vodka at a party the night before the attack. She confirmed this but said that the attack happened &quot;a good 11 hours later&quot;. Andrews conceded she had enjoyed good times with Size, having been taken to the Hotel du Vin for Valentine&apos;s Day, given a diamond necklace and taken to Dubai for a week&apos;s holiday. But she added: &quot;He was very controlling, and was always having a go at me. He was showing off as he always did with his money. I was a trophy to him and he made that clear to me.&quot; She disputed Langdon&apos;s claims that Size had wanted to end the relationship before the incident. Andrews said: &quot;He didn&apos;t want out.

In a memorable fight to the winning post, it was the two equine superpowers who dominate British racing, that squared up once again. Coolmore&apos;s So You Think, hailed as a superhorse since arriving at Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s yard from Australia, hit the front coming off the home turn and quickly pulled clear of his rivals. But the Godolphin-owned winner, off the track since winning the Sheema Classic in Dubai in March, gradually inched towards the leader from the two-furlong pole and hit the front with perfect timing to win by a neck. Dettori, whose finest hour came at Ascot in 1996 when he rode his &quot;magnificent seven&quot;, said: &quot;It was a tremendous gallop with two great horses. The second never gave up. When I got past him it was sheer joy. It was sheer joy to be in the race. I&apos;m delighted for Rewilding as he doesn&apos;t get the recognition he deserves. He&apos;s a very good horse and he showed his true colours today. &quot;They are two great teams and we put our life and soul into the job and into the sport. This is what we are here for \u2013 to ride these kind of finishes in great races.&quot; The winning trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni deflected praise to the Godolphin supremo Sheikh Mohammed, saying: &quot;I have to be honest, it is not me, it&apos;s him. He always gives us instructions on how to deal with horses \u2013 from training them, to feeding them and everything.&quot; In contrast, So You Think&apos;s trainer O&apos;Brien was carrying the weight of the world on his own shoulders. &quot;I will take responsibility for this totally,&quot; he said. &quot;He won his first two starts very easily and I was letting him come along too easily. He went and won the race but just got tired in the final half a furlong. I would think it was trainer&apos;s error maybe not having him fit enough for this race on the day. &quot;He would never have had this kind of strong, competitive race and in this kind of atmosphere. I would say that I am sorry and that he will go on from here. He had a big, strong, heavy blow after. &quot;We&apos;ll see what will happen next time but I would expect plenty of improvement next time. He had to tank early and then settle into a strong pace. I would put today down to fitness.&quot; Strong Suit (11-1) could have teed up a clash with stablemate Canford Cliffs when returning to form to win the Jersey Stakes under Richard Hughes. Strong Suit was a winner of the Coventry Stakes at this meeting 12 months ago, but breathing problems had held back his career more recently and he was all but pulled up when last behind Frankel in the Greenham Stakes on his reappearance.

Everything about him was played out on the largest scale: his obsessions with personalities such as the former prime minister Indira Gandhi, Mother Teresa or the Bollywood heroine Madhuri Dixit; his passionate incursions into Hindu religion and mythology; the size of the canvases that he loved executing in front of audiences; or his trademark style of vast, serial productions. Phenomenal, too, were the prices of\u00a0his paintings at international auctions and the energy with which the artist, in\u00a0his 90s, travelled the world while an\u00a0unceasing Hindu rightwing vendetta against his output prevented his return to his homeland. A resident of Dubai since 2006, Husain moved frequently between there, New York and London, where he has died at the age of 95 after a heart attack. He had recently been working on a series sponsored by the steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal on the history of Indian civilisation from 2600BC to the present; a sequence of 99 paintings on Arabic and Islamic civilisation, commissioned by Sheikha Mozah of Qatar; and another series on his favourite subject, the history of Indian cinema.     The controversial painting by MF Husain known as Bharat Mata (Mother India), though the artist maintained that the title did not come from him.     That the nation&apos;s leading modern artist had to spend the last years of his life in self-imposed exile, taking Qatari citizenship in 2010, was a matter of\u00a0regret to many in India. His painting of a nude Hindu goddess, Saraswati, became the target of protests in 1996. But for all their invocations of the rich precedents of nudity in India&apos;s art history and religious iconography, Husain&apos;s defenders could do little to stem the tide of attacks \u2013 notably over the internet \u2013 on more and more of\u00a0his images. Further outrage followed his unclothed female figuration of the national map \u2013 the title of Bharat Mata (Mother India) did not come from him, he maintained \u2013 in 2006. Later that year, with criminal charges pending against him and threats to his life and property, the artist left India for good. Faultlessly secular and a great promoter of Indian identity, Husain never let his Muslim background stand in the way of his celebration of what he saw as his own heritage of Hindu myth and religion. With his usual aplomb, he\u00a0turned his back on his detractors and\u00a0continued to paint in the name of\u00a0his multireligious India elsewhere. He often expressed his desire to go back. However, despite supreme court rulings in 2008 exonerating him, and despite the money and glamour he had brought to Indian art, propelling it to great international success, fear of controversy and vandalism stood in\u00a0the way of moves to encourage his return. Born into a large, working-class Suleimani Muslim family in the Vaishnava (Hindu) temple town of Pandharpur, now in western Maharashtra, Maqbool Fida Husain grew up with a limited formal education. He dabbled in Urdu poetry and took evening classes in painting, but his father, who for some of the time worked in a mill, and stepmother were unable to support him in taking up a place at the Sir JJ School of Art in Bombay (Mumbai). So when he did move to the city at the age of 20, it was as a cinema hoarding painter. In 1947, the year of India&apos;s independence, the artist Francis Newton Souza invited Husain to join the Bombay Progressive Artists&apos; Group, which provided him with an\u00a0arena for the shaping of a modernist vocabulary. Opportunities to exhibit in Bombay followed, and during the 1950s Husain began to receive international recognition. Though the progressive group eventually dispersed \u2013 Souza made his career in London, and Syed Haider Raza in Paris \u2013 Husain remained steadfastly in Bombay, becoming a\u00a0household name. Awards such as the Padma Shri (1955), Padma Bhushan (1973) and Padma Vibhushan (1991) cemented his status. Abroad, he won a Golden Bear award at the Berlin Film Festival in 1967 for Through the Eyes of a Painter, and in 1971 was invited to show his works alongside those of Pablo Picasso at the S\u00e3o Paolo Biennale. As well as delving into the Hindu epic poems, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, and making capital out of many living politicians and cultural figures, Husain&apos;s projection of himself as the national artist drew him to popular outlets. These included putting his signature sketches on restaurant walls and textiles, producing nude images of female film stars, and launching his own much-hyped film ventures \u2013 Gaja Gamini with Dixit in 2000 and Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities with the actress Tabu in 2004 \u2013 both of which flopped at the box office. By this late phase of his career, Husain had become to many a jaded star on the contemporary Indian art scene, with what they saw as his outdated, overdone, repetitive brand of national modernism. There were strong criticisms, in particular, of his sycophantic paintings of Indira Gandhi as the goddess Durga during the state of emergency of 1975-76, of his courting of rich patrons and of his penchant for gimmickry and showmanship. Left to his own devices, the ageing barefoot artist would have carried on as prolifically as ever \u2013 he produced quite possibly between 30,000 and 40,000 paintings \u2013 ensconced in the past to\u00a0which he belonged. But the wave of\u00a0bigotry that bore down on him from the mid-1990s kept Husain in the headlines. Even after his departure, he continued to dominate the national imagination, both for those he outraged and for those who saw him as a great secular cause. Stock can now be taken of the art that he did so much to shape, while refusing to accept limitations on\u00a0his freedom of expression. Husain&apos;s wife, Fazila, whom he married in 1941, predeceased him, as did one of their children. He is survived by four sons and two daughters. \u2022 Maqbool Fida Husain, artist, born 17\u00a0September 1915; died 9 June 2011", "title": "MF Husain obituary", "sentences": ["A resident of Dubai since 2006, Husain moved frequently between there, New York and London, where he has died at the age of 95 after a heart attack."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-15T16:26:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/15/aidan-obrien-so-you-think-sorry", "tags": ["Ascot", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "The Princess Royal offered Aidan O&apos;Brien an opportunity to duck responsibility for So You Think&apos;s defeat at odds of 4-11 in the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes here yesterday but O&apos;Brien would not hear of it. &quot;That wasn&apos;t quite what you hoped for,&quot; she said. &quot;Do we blame the jockey?&quot; she asked. &quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;blame the trainer.&quot; O&apos;Brien was convinced that he had not given So You Think sufficient work before the race, allowing Rewilding to run him down in the closing stages under a strong drive by Frankie Dettori to win by a neck. &quot;He went there, quickened, went and won his race, got a little bit tired in the last half-furlong and got beaten by a horse that gets a mile and a half really well,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe because he was doing such a demolition job on horses at home, he was finding his work so easy, maybe I should have said, &apos;Go on and beat them another 20 lengths.&apos; Next time I&apos;ll be a little bit harder [and] all I can say is I&apos;m sorry.&quot; O&apos;Brien will clearly be a little harder on So You Think before his next race but whether he should be quite so hard on himself is open to question. The five-year-old is a brute of a horse, a magnificent physical specimen who is as strong as he is tall and an athlete too, yet the way that the contest developed may have had more to do with his defeat than lack of fitness. Ballydoyle has had problems with pacemakers over the years and, while Jan Vermeer, with O&apos;Brien&apos;s son Joseph in the saddle, had been entered to ensure a strong pace, he ended up doing more to assist Rewilding than So You Think. In the early stages Jan Vermeer could not get to the front and, when he did, he quickly went so far clear that the rest of the runners effectively ignored him. That meant that he came back to them well before the straight and Ryan Moore, on So You Think, was forced to commit for home with the whole of Ascot&apos;s home stretch in front of him. He did not tire as visibly as Frankel in Tuesday&apos;s big race but it was clear from just inside the furlong pole that Dettori&apos;s finishing run would overwhelm him with something to spare. Had Jan Vermeer been able to carry So You Think further into the race, the outcome might have been different but that is not to say that the &quot;wrong&quot; horse won in any way. Rewilding was a disappointing favourite for last year&apos;s St Leger but the performance in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York that made him the market leader in the first place was deeply impressive. Now that Mahmood al Zarooni, his trainer, has worked out that he needs a break between races, there is no reason why he should not build on this victory, Al Zarooni&apos;s first at the Royal meeting. As such, it was a significant moment for his trainer, as well as for Godolphin and its founder Sheikh Mohammed, who is desperate to compete with Ballydoyle and Coolmore in the international bloodstock business. &quot;All the races give you pleasure but this is a special one because of the way Rewilding was trained and prepared for this race after winning in Dubai [in March],&quot; the sheikh said. &quot;He has speed so we thought we would try this shorter distance and he did it, he was the better horse.&quot; The victory came at a price for Dettori, however, as he picked up a nine-day ban for using his whip with excessive frequency on the winner. Godolphin will now be without his services in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown early next month and for 19 days in all over the next few weeks thanks to a 10-day ban \u2013 which starts on Friday \u2013 for failing to ride out for third place on Godolphin&apos;s Blue Bunting in the Oaks at Epsom. That ride was a low point for Dettori, who was an also-ran in the following day&apos;s Derby as Micka\u00ebl Barzalona, one of the brightest young riding talents for many years, won a race that Dettori needed 15 attempts to secure. This race seemed to be Dettori&apos;s way to announce that he has plenty left to give at the highest level but the sting he received from the stewards will remove just a little of the shine. He will be free to ride in the King George in late July, however, and at Ascot in particular, he can never be written off.

Nor does he seem worried that he might have to answer for his role in what is, in relative terms given Afghanistan&apos;s tiny economy, the biggest bank collapse in history. Khalilullah Ferozi, supposedly under house arrest, settles into a seat and orders a shisha and several plates of rice and kebab. On his wrist sits a diamond-studded watch. As he talks, getting animated, a steady spray of half-masticated kebab flies across the table. Ferozi, a pillar of the Afghan business establishment, lost his job as chief executive of Kabul Bank last year after the Afghan Central Bank belatedly realised he had been in effect running it, along with the bank&apos;s former chairman, Sherkhan Farnood, as a giant pyramid scheme. Yet none of the other well-heeled diners at the shisha bar, largely members of Afghanistan&apos;s post-2001 nouveau riche, bat an eyelid. Nobody seems disturbed by the presence of a man who helped drain the savings of thousands of depositors totalling $579m (\u00a3359m) in a binge of insider lending by the bank&apos;s politically powerful shareholders. Because there was never any obligation to pay any interest on these &quot;loans&quot;, the total unaccounted sum is $910m. In a country where GDP is just $12bn, that is an extraordinary figure. The fallout has been immensely damaging as Afghanistan heads towards 2014, when the foreign presence in the country is to be dramatically reduced. One of the world&apos;s poorest nations, Afghanistan has to finance a $820m bailout of the bank and the ministry of finance is ramping up its tax collection efforts to pay for it. Public confidence in the banking system, non-existent under the Taliban, has been shattered \u2013 24,000 safes were sold during the run on the bank last summer, as people hoarded cash at home. Of all the problems in Afghanistan the role of people close to the president, Hamid Karzai, in the scandal has soured support for the war in the US Congress. Foreign donors are refusing to make aid payments until the mess is cleared up to the satisfaction of the International Monetary Fund. If a deal isn&apos;t reached soon, the Afghan government will, within a month or so, struggle to pay civil servant salaries. Yet Ferozi seems genuinely perplexed by all the fuss, bemused by the idea that the bank should be constrained by banking laws designed to stop irresponsible lending. To his mind the bank&apos;s strategy made perfect business sense. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows that line the restaurant he points to some of his excellent investments around the city. Over there, the Gulbahar Centre, a giant building of shops and unfinished apartments. &quot;We invested $35m in that and it is now worth $350m,&quot; he claims. &quot;The money is not lost, it is sitting right in front of you!&quot; Had he got his way he would have added an even more grandiose monument to the Kabul skyline: a multi-million dollar Kabul Bank headquarters with three office towers encased in bulletproof glass, three underground garages, a waterfall and a rotating restaurant on the top floor. He despatches a suited minion to retrieve a March 2010 letter which, he says, shows how well the Americans thought Kabul Bank was being run. The letter from the assistant US treasury secretary is actually a diplomatically worded reminder of the need for &quot;complete compliance with Afghan law by financial institutions&quot;. Those charged with cleaning up the mess are far less optimistic that the missing money will be recovered. With shareholders accused of deliberately hiding the scale of their withdrawals, often made in the names of fake companies or other people, including domestic servants, experts believe it would take a miracle to recover half the money. So far just $61m has been recovered. Massoud Ghazi, a 33-year-old Central Bank official, was put in charge of the broken bank earlier this year after the government took it over and stripped the shareholders of their rights. Now, as CEO of a reborn &quot;New Kabul Bank&quot;, he knows more about the mess Ferozi and Farnood left behind than almost anyone else. An inquiry found that 207 borrowers took out undocumented loans. &quot;The management claimed they were profitable, but if you did the correct calculation you see they lost money for three years,&quot; he says. &quot;That was because they took the money and then made no repayment of the principal or any interest payments.&quot; In other words, they were not really loans at all. Dodgy dealings in Dubai The most notorious of Kabul Bank&apos;s &quot;investments&quot; are in Dubai, where Ferozi says $160m was spent on 35 luxury villas on the Palm Jumeirah, the artificial sand banks that jut out in &quot;fronds&quot; into the Arabian Sea. Many of the houses were registered in Farnood&apos;s name and handed out to bank shareholders. I visited house No1 on Frond O \u2013 a huge five-bedroom &quot;Riviera&quot;-style mansion occupied by Ferozi. Others owned by the bank showed every sign of occupation \u2013 pools were full of water, and cushioned garden furniture was set up in the sticky summer heat.     Khalilullah Ferozi leaves a news conference in Kabul, September 2010.  Photograph:   /Ahmad Masood     It was in these houses that Afghan MPs were entertained with drink and &quot;Russian girls&quot;, according to one Afghan intelligence official, who says the bank deliberately sought to compromise the politically powerful. Ferozi frankly admits that millions of dollars were lost on these villas after Dubai&apos;s real estate bubble burst in 2008. He firmly pins the blame on Farnood (who promised to answer my questions by email, but never did), saying most of the disastrous lending, particularly in Dubai, happened before he became CEO. Less well known is Business Bay, perhaps Dubai&apos;s most catastrophic property development, where property developers and speculators flipped off-plan properties during the Emirate&apos;s real estate bubble. What was meant to be home to 240 towers is now a ghostly wasteland of half-finished buildings. On the edge of this empty quarter are two massive holes in the ground \u2013 the planned sites for 20-storey apartment complexes. Victims of the real estate crash, they will almost certainly never be built, according to a British property expert who shows me around. They are literally money pits for Afghan money: each swallowed almost $20m of Kabul Bank money, according to Ferozi. The wreckage of Kabul Bank is also visible on the edge of the runway at Dubai airport, where a Pamir Airways jet has been stranded ever since the carrier was shut down by Afghan authorities for flouting safety rules. The five planes were bought by Farnood in 2009 for $54m \u2013 apparently after no discussion with Ferozi \u2013 in blatant disregard for the country&apos;s banking laws that bans direct investment in non-banking companies. Last year one of Pamir&apos;s ancient Antonov planes, later discovered to be flying under fake documentation, came down in the mountains of Afghanistan, killing all on board. During the disaster I met Ferozi, still CEO of Kabul Bank, at the airport. He was sporting bizarre dyed blond hair (in the winter he roamed town in full-length fur coats) and in a remarkable display of his unorthodox business skills he managed to re-write the rules of plane-crash public relations. Rather than promising an investigation, he hosted a press conference where some of the wives of the passengers, who had been promised handsome compensation, told the media that Pamir was blameless and that Nato air-traffic controllers were responsible. Financial novices Some say the collapse of Kabul Bank was only to be expected given the backgrounds of the men who ran it. Both Ferozi and Farnood spent time in Moscow in the 1980s, running businesses that occasionally ran afoul of the criminal underworld. Farnood used to run hawalas, the regulation-free money exchange systems found all over South Asia. Ferozi says he was a small-time trader exporting goods from Russia to Afghanistan. Nothing fancy: flour, cooking oil and water pumps. And yet he was put in charge of Afghanistan&apos;s largest commercial bank, a decision approved by the Central Bank governor Abdul Qadeer Fitrat. Despite being novices in the world of legitimate finance, they knew that a pyramid scheme, with so much money being taken out of the top, desperately needed to attract new people to deposit money at the bottom to preserve the bank&apos;s liquidity. This they did by running ethically questionable and expensive-to-run &quot;fortune&quot; lottery accounts that attracted customers with the chance of a cash prize. Such accounts have since been banned. But salvation came when the government gave Kabul Bank responsibility for handling the payroll accounts of all the country&apos;s civil servants, soldiers and policemen, guaranteeing regular infusions of cash. The deal was all the sweeter, Ferozi says, because he would usually lend the money straight back to the Central Bank on time deposit accounts at interest rates of up to 10% \u2013 meaning the government was paying interest on its own money. By his own admission, the key to this contract was the currying of favour with Karzai&apos;s family. In one of Kabul Bank&apos;s most outrageous loans, it gave $22m to Mahmoud Karzai, one of the president&apos;s brothers, and a former restaurant owner from Maryland. Karzai used the interest-free loan to buy a share in the bank itself. Thus did the president&apos;s brother become the third biggest shareholder in the country&apos;s biggest bank without spending a penny of his own money. Then there was the $4m in bank money for Karzai&apos;s 2009 re-election campaign. &quot;We didn&apos;t give [the $4m] for free,&quot; Ferozi tells me. &quot;For that we got 430,000 government accounts and from those accounts the bank made a profit of $4m a month. If we had not done it, other banks were ready to give $20m to get the accounts.&quot; At the time, such practices were common knowledge in Kabul but nobody could prove it. I first learned about the corruption one evening three years ago in the garden of Ashraf Ghani, a former finance minister who was considering running for president against Hamid Karzai. The former World Bank technocrat outlined precisely the insider lending and the systematic flouting of the banking law. The only way it made any sense to his famously logical mind was that the management must be deliberately conspiring to destroy the bank and, calculating that it was far too big to fail, would force the Americans into a quiet bailout. (Others doubt this level of sophistication \u2013 Ghazi, the new CEO of Kabul Bank, believes that shareholders helped themselves to cash &quot;because they saw everyone else doing it&quot;.) Cover-ups and corruption     The Palm Jumeirah, Dubai, where $160m of Kabul Bank money was invested in luxury villas. Photograph: PA    I spent weeks trying to prove even a fraction of what Ghani told me. Fitrat, the diminutive Central Bank governor, said he had ordered an investigation that showed Kabul Bank was in rude health. He pointed out that the bank&apos;s external auditors had also found nothing. That was because they were taking the bank&apos;s numbers at face value. We now know these numbers were, according to Ghazi, meaningless, as the bank&apos;s management simply entered fake information into the internal audit system. For example, loans that had existed for more than 180 days without any repayments being made should have been recorded as &quot;lost&quot;. Instead, they were shown to be fine. A secret ledger of the actual state of the bank was kept by Farnood, Ghazi says. Despite such outright cheating there was one group of people who might have been expected to know that things were not as they seemed: western consultants on six-figure salaries paid by the US government. Working for a company called BearingPoint, which has since been bought up by Deloitte, they were embedded inside government departments where they were supposed to raise standards among their Afghan colleagues. According to a damning recent report by the US government&apos;s inspector general that was briefly leaked on the internet, these consultants saw ample &quot;red flags&quot; but failed to raise the alarm. These included death threats made by the management of Kabul Bank against an expat adviser who was part of an inspection team from the Central Bank. In 2009 I was shown an email from one consultant who tried to blow the whistle. Writing to the Central Bank&apos;s board, he claimed he was sacked after daring to raise concerns that people in the financial oversight department were being paid to turn a blind eye to the affairs of Kabul Bank. Fitrat denied the allegations to me, saying the consultant had been fired because of poor work and for &quot;creating ethnic discord&quot; within the bank. The consultant was banned by BearingPoint from raising his concerns with anyone outside the Central Bank \u2013 including the US government that paid his salary or, as I discovered, with the media. When I phoned him at the time at his home in California he initially seemed happy to talk, but when I made an appointment to call him back, he never picked up. Ethnic divisions There were other factors at work that stopped the truth about Kabul Bank from coming out, principally the problem of an ethnic Pashtun having to keep the Tajiks, the country&apos;s second biggest ethnic group, happy. Despite having some Pashtun shareholders, Kabul Bank was a cornerstone of the Tajik establishment of northern Afghanistan, with close ties to top warlords, including Marshal Fahim, whom Karzai chose \u2013 to the consternation of the UN \u2013 to be his vice-president in 2009. Fahim&apos;s brother and family received at least $78m in Kabul Bank loans, according to figures provided by Ghazi. According to a US official, Fahim vowed, during the fight to prevent the bank being taken over by the government, never to allow it be &quot;taken over by the Pashtuns&quot;. Ghazi now works out of the wood-panelled office once occupied by Ferozi. On the wall there is still a portrait of Ahmed Shah Massoud, a guerilla commander who resisted the Taliban and is a hero to the Tajiks. He recalls that when his colleagues from the Central Bank tried to investigate Kabul Bank, they were warned: &quot;We can take you to the north of the country and maybe something will happen to you there that you can&apos;t control.&quot; Ferozi, for his part, says the bank purge has been orchestrated by Pakistan&apos;s Inter-Services Intelligence agency, which has traditionally supported the Pashtun Taliban against Tajiks and Uzbeks. &quot;Because the CEO and other top members of the bank came from the north, the government of Pakistan felt threatened and feared the northerners would use the bank to have great influence on the politics of Afghanistan,&quot; he says. He promises to publish a book detailing his claims. With such blatant playing of the ethnic card at a time of growing Tajik concern that Karzai might cut a &quot;deal&quot; with the Taliban, there are doubts over whether the people involved in this epic raid on the taxpayers of one of the world&apos;s poorest countries will be brought to book. Finance minister Omar Zakhilwal assured me it is all in the hands of the attorney general, but he enjoys little confidence and is viewed as politically tainted after abandoning a fraud inquiry into one of Karzai&apos;s key aides last year. Fitrat wants a &quot;special court&quot; of handpicked judges deemed reasonably clean and versed in financial law. Another problem is the fear that Farnood possesses compromising information about the involvement of some of the most important people in the government in the Kabul Bank affair. &quot;What they are saying is they have a little black book so you better not push too hard,&quot; one western official closely involved in the issue says. Afghan officials say the shareholders are lying about how much money they took out of the bank, in the hope of holding on to some of it \u2013 for example, Farnood says he only spent $17m of Kabul Bank&apos;s money on Gulbahar, although Ferozi cheerfully tells me it was $35m. Three weeks ago, Karzai summoned the shareholders and disgraced managers and begged them to hand over the money. In a sign that he would like to avoid the political fallout of prosecutions, he gave them one last chance to hand over the cash voluntarily. But a full-blown inquiry is vital, not least because the law of the United Arab Emirates makes it impossible to seize any assets in Dubai until proper criminal procedures have begun. Also, the IMF is unlikely to declare the country &quot;investment worthy&quot; without a commitment to lock people up. &quot;They should all go to jail immediately,&quot; Ghazi tells me, with a look of bafflement that these men had not been jailed months ago.

This was Apple&apos;s colossal new headquarters building in Cupertino, California \u2013 a gigantic white UFO sitting in 150 acres of landscaped parkland, designed for 12,000 workers. For obvious reasons, it has already been dubbed the &quot;mothership&quot;. Nor has its designer been widely publicised, but we can reveal it&apos;s good old Norman Foster \u2013 who else? Foster&apos;s people wouldn&apos;t reveal any details, but there are some in this video of Jobs presenting the scheme to Cupertino City Council, where it was received just as rapturously as a new iPad. &quot;We do have a shot at building the best office building in the world,&quot; Jobs tells the awestruck councillors. &quot;I really do think architecture students will come here to see this.&quot; So what about the design? Foster has obviously taken a leaf out of Apple&apos;s chief designer Jonathan Ive&apos;s book \u2013 sorry, iPad. It looks like the circular trackpad of a giant iPod. If you run around the building very quickly, does a giant playlist light up in the sky? Mind you, by the time it&apos;s finished in 2015, it could look out of date. The purity of the four-storey doughnut&apos;s impact on the landscape is also slightly compromised, it emerges, by other buildings on the site, including a four-storey car park. But none of the councillors seem to raise any objections; they&apos;re too busy geeking out their celebrity guest. &quot;The word spectacular would be an understatement,&quot; grovels one of them, Mr Smithers-style. Just to drive the point home, Jobs mentions that Apple is the largest taxpayer in Cupertino, and hints that if he doesn&apos;t get his way, Apple will take their business elsewhere. Presumably the whole building will be able to take off and land in New Mexico, or something. More good news for Foster and other British architects at this year&apos;s spurious but intriguing Best Tall Building awards. Foster&apos;s 80-storey Dubai tower, known as The Index \u2013 an energy-efficient, Italian futurist-looking affair \u2013 won in the Middle East and Africa category. Wilkinson Eyre won the Asia award for their colossal but elegant Guangzhou International Finance Centre \u2013 all 103 storeys of it. And Anglo-German architects Sauerbruch Hutton won the Europe award for their tasteful, low-energy Frankfurt office building, KfW Westarkade. The other winner was Frank Gehry&apos;s stunning Eight Spruce Street, a shimmering, steel-clad skyscraper that looks better than anything we&apos;re likely to find on the nearby World Trade Centre site. Though it does go by the pretentious name New York by Gehry, which makes it sound uncomfortably like a perfume.     Ditched ... Richard Rogers's original Chelsea Barracks design    Richard Rogers probably wishes he&apos;d had Apple-style planning meetings over the Chelsea Barracks redevelopment in London. Instead, his design was controversially rejected when Prince Charles threw a royal spanner in the works last year, complaining about that vulgar hi-techie stuff to the Qatari royals.     Revised design for the Chelsea Barracks    No surprise that the revised design for the \u00a33bn scheme is expected to be approved by Westminster council today, although the Qatari developers are said to be trying to reduce the amount of affordable housing in the scheme. No surprise, either, that the new plan, by Squire and Partners, Dixon Jones and landscape architect Kim Wilkie, is considerably more &quot;traditional&quot;, laid out around London squares. Whoever designs the actual buildings will have to adhere to a preordained design code, which insists they &quot;work in sympathy with surrounding character areas and architectural types without resorting to pastiche&quot;. Apparently Prince Charles is pleased. After all this high-flying power architecture, we finally come right down to earth \u2013 to a little spot underneath a motorway flyover in east London. Here, a delightful temporary structure is under construction called Folly for a Flyover, as part of this year&apos;s Create festival. As designers Assemble explain, it&apos;s almost a stage set of a building, with curtain walls of wooden &quot;bricks&quot; made from salvaged timber, hung from scaffolding and held in place by cords running through the bricks. The pitched roof of the folly will poke out between the two roadways, and next to it are steps that serve as an outdoor seating area.     Getting the London look ... architects Assemble build Folly for a Flyover    Not only is the folly ingenious and low-impact, it poetically turns a patch of dead urban space into a living venue. As the romantic engraving suggests, it&apos;s intended to feel like a forgotten piece of architecture which existed long before they built the A12 over the top of it \u2013 a building with a fictional history. Assemble, a collective of young designers and artists, were also behind last year&apos;s Cineroleum, a temporary cinema in a disused petrol station in Clerkenwell. This serves a similar function: it&apos;ll be a bar/cafe during the day, and in the evening you&apos;ll be able to watch films and performances on city themes, while traffic rumbles overhead, the Olympic building site bustles nearby and barges chug past on the canal.

Although the war-torn country&apos;s biggest bank nearly collapsed last September, the government of Hamid Karzai and the international community are still at loggerheads over plans to fund an $820m (\u00a3507m) bailout as well as how the disgraced former managers and shareholders who helped themselves to hundreds of millions of dollars should be prosecuted. As long as the IMF declares the plans to be inadequate, many countries, including Britain, are legally barred from pumping money into a government that is almost completely reliant on foreign cash to pay civil servants&apos; salaries. It was reported by Reuters that the IMF has now formally rejected the Afghan government&apos;s proposals, meaning aid disbursements will remain on hold. The failure to reach a deal by a deadline of last Saturday also meant a $70m payment from the World Bank&apos;s Afghan reconstruction trust fund was automatically withheld. Two senior western officials said the government will face a cash crisis in the coming weeks and could struggle to pay staff bills, although one predicted this would be avoided by cutting other spending priorities. Last month, Omar Zakhilwal, the country&apos;s finance minister, told the Guardian that suspension of aid payments &quot;has already had an effect on us, no doubt about it&quot;. He insisted that the Afghan government had done &quot;95% of what was asked of us&quot; by the IMF, including effectively nationalising Kabul Bank, stripping the shareholders of their rights and putting all unrecovered loans into receivership. But although he claimed the remaining issues &quot;were inconsequential to Kabul Bank&quot; the IMF sees two aspects as vitally important. Firstly, an agreement that Afghan taxes, not foreign aid, will repay the $820m taken out of central bank reserves last year to prop up the bank. Second, they want serious criminal investigations against managers and shareholders, many of whom enjoy high level political support, who illegally borrowed huge sums of interest-free cash from the bank. Although the finance ministry has drawn up plans to increase its tax-raising efforts in order to pay off the bailout in annual instalments, horrified MPs have already rejected one budget request for $73m and is also likely to reject a supplemental budget due to be presented by Zakhilwal soon. &quot;The IMF tells me, this is our demand, give me condition by this date the parliament must approve this line in the budget,&quot; explained Zakhilwal. &quot;I am a minister, can I chose the parliament timeline? On these issues the international community totally disregards the legal processes of Afghanistan.&quot; Many MPs argue that the money should be found by simply selling off the assets illegally bought by shareholders and managers, including a gas distribution company, an airline and luxury villas in Dubai. Although a $10m forensic audit by Kroll may help identify many deliberately hidden assets, most western experts doubt more than half of the outstanding $910m will be recovered. So far just $61m has been retrieved. Zakhilwal also argued that prosecutions could only be handled by the attorney general and warned that the complicated inquiry cannot be rushed. &quot;The attorney general can arrest people, but after 15 days with not case they have to be acquitted \u2013 that would be even more embarrassing for us,&quot; Zakhilwal said. Although the finance minister insisted the attorney general was &quot;absolutely committed&quot; to a thorough investigation, the international community is sceptical, not least after Afghanistan&apos;s top law officer threw out a case last year against one of Karzai&apos;s key aides who had been wire-tapped soliciting a bribe. One alternative plan is for a special court of handpicked judges deemed to be reasonably honest and well-versed in finance to hear the case. Credible prosecutions are vital, not just to appease public anger, but also because many of Kabul Bank&apos;s assets are in Dubai. Under United Arab Emirates law it is impossible to seize properties until criminal investigations have begun. Not only does Afghanistan face a cash crunch, the showdown with the IMF also threatens to derail plans, pushed hard by Hamid Karzai, for a far greater proportion of international aid to be spent through official channels, rather than on projects outside the control of the government. A key element of the &quot;transition&quot; strategy by which the foreign intervention in Afghanistan will be greatly reduced by the end of 2014, the international community last year agreed that 50% of spending will go through the government by 2012. But it is now feared that if the Afghan government continues to be considered unworthy of international investment by the IMF the country will have to return to patchwork of bilateral funding agreements.", "title": "Afghanistan facing insolvency within a month, say officials", "sentences": ["On these issues the international community totally disregards the legal processes of Afghanistan.&quot; Many MPs argue that the money should be found by simply selling off the assets illegally bought by shareholders and managers, including a gas distribution company, an airline and luxury villas in Dubai.", "Credible prosecutions are vital, not just to appease public anger, but also because many of Kabul Bank&apos;s assets are in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-17T16:15:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jun/18/middle-east-bargain-holidays-egypt", "tags": ["Middle East holidays", "Egypt holidays", "Morocco holidays", "Jordan holidays", "Tunisia holidays", "United Arab Emirates holidays", "Family holidays", "Adventure travel", "Safaris", "Beach holidays", "Travel", "Africa holidays"], "article": "Egypt \u2022 To fly to Cairo, Egypt Air (egyptair.com) has flights departing Heathrow 17 June , returning 27 June for around \u00a3375, or on Saturday 9 July, returning Saturday 16 July, for \u00a3458; a long weekend in September is around \u00a3350pp. EasyJet (easyjet.com) flies to Sharm el-Sheikh from Manchester, Luton and Gatwick (from around \u00a3300 return in summer); also from Gatwick to Hurghada (from around \u00a3280 return in summer) and Gatwick to Luxor (from around \u00a3230 return in summer).

Since 2008 Royal Ascot has started with three of the meeting&apos;s strongest Group 1 contests, the Queen Anne Stakes, the King&apos;s Stand Stakes and the St James&apos;s Palace Stakes. The clash between Canford Cliffs and Goldikova, followed by the international prestige of the big sprint and the return of the unbeaten 2,000 Guineas winner, Frankel, helped raise the crowd on Tuesday by nearly 10% to 43,354 against an overall year-on-year increase of 3.6% across the meeting. However, despite celebrating a substantial rise on turnover at Royal Ascot this year, bookmakers feel that figure could be increased further and the exposure of the sport increased if the main races were moved to a later time on the programme. &quot;No other sport has its climax so early in the day,&quot; said Ladbrokes&apos; spokesman David Williams. &quot;The evidence of our figures suggests that, when a Festival meeting builds and builds to a climax, the turnover increases substantially. The longer you can build up a narrative, the more people want to talk about it, think about it and bet on it.&quot; Simon Clare, director of racing at Coral, \u2013 who, unlike many of their rivals, still pay Levy to British racing on profits from all bets struck on the sport \u2013 agreed that racing, as well as bookmakers, would benefit from a re-examination of the running order. &quot;Betting shop punters who go in to watch Royal Ascot will walk out after they have seen the St James&apos;s Palace Stakes because they will look at the Coventry Stakes and the two big-field handicaps after it and think &apos;they look too hard&apos;,&quot; he said. &quot;Our biggest turnover race of the week was the Gold Cup and we took three times as much as on some of the two-year-old races. &quot;As a bookmaker my idea of the perfect programme is to have the biggest race with the biggest names as the fifth race and a handicap afterwards as those races are bet to higher margins, but this isn&apos;t just about what&apos;s right for bookmakers, it&apos;s about what&apos;s the best for all of racing. &quot;Having the big race towards the end of the meeting is considered the best way by every other racing nation in the world. Look at the Kentucky Derby, the Dubai World Cup, the Breeders&apos; Cup, the Melbourne Cup, the Arc de Triomphe \u2013 they build up the anticipation and, where allowed, the turnover too. &quot;There is a natural build-up to the main event. You wouldn&apos;t go to a big pop concert and have the biggest band on first. At Royal Ascot we had one of the biggest races of the week \u2013 the clash between Canford Cliffs and Goldikova \u2013 taking place just minutes after the Queen had got out of her coach. It just doesn&apos;t make any sense to me.&quot; In response Barnett said that commercial considerations for the track had to take precedence. &quot;We only get terrestrial television coverage on the first five races, so that is a relevant factor, and we only have BBC1 for the first two, and that is a relevant factor,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to look at which times work best for international coverage, especially in the King&apos;s Stand Stakes, and there is also the issue of giving the best possible ground to the runners in those races. &quot;I don&apos;t disagree with the general argument \u2013 indeed we are working towards building up to a climax at British Champions Day in September \u2013 but I haven&apos;t heard a compelling argument for making changes. That said, we look at it every year and we&apos;ll continue to make sure we&apos;re happy with things as they are.&quot;", "title": "Charles Barnett will resist calls to change Royal Ascot schedule", "sentences": ["Look at the Kentucky Derby, the Dubai World Cup, the Breeders&apos; Cup, the Melbourne Cup, the Arc de Triomphe \u2013 they build up the anticipation and, where allowed, the turnover too."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-19T19:40:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/20/rory-mcilroy-us-open-victory", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "Sport", "Golf", "US Open Golf 2011", "US Open"], "article": "The greater the triumph, the greater the fortune that follows. That is an immutable rule of modern sporting culture and it guarantees Rory McIlroy, who won golf&apos;s US Open championship by a staggering eight shots, will become one of the richest athletes in the world. The 22-year-old from Holywood, Northern Ireland who dedicated his victory to his father, already has more money than he can ever spend thanks to the many sponsorship deals signed when he turned professional in 2007, but victory at Congressional Country club in the suburbs of Washington DC transports him into a different stratosphere of fame and fortune, placing him alongside global superstars such as his friend Rafael Nadal and the man whom he idolised growing up, Tiger Woods. Woods reportedly became the first billionaire athlete \u2013 the financial reward for an unprecedented run of success on the golf course until his reputation was sullied by a personal scandal. Ironically, Woods&apos;s problems, and the vacuum they have created, will help McIlroy and his high-profile agent, Andrew Chandler, capitalise on newly-acquired status as a major champion, especially in the US. His fellow professionals believe McIlroy can go on to achieve unparalleled success in the game. &quot;What is he, 22 years old. If you are going to talk about someone challenging Jack&apos;s record there&apos;s your man,&quot; Padraig Harrington said, referring to Jack Nicklaus&apos;s record of 18 major titles. &quot;Winning majors at 22 with his talent \u2013 he would have 20 more years, so probably 100 more majors in him where he could be competitive. It would give him a great chance.&quot; Last year&apos;s US Open champion Graeme McDowell concurred. &quot;He may be hands down, the best player I&apos;ve ever seen hit a golf ball,&quot; he said. &quot;He&apos;s a phenomenon. Obviously we were disappointed for him at Augusta. But what he&apos;s been doing this week has been an accident waiting to happen, he&apos;s been threatening to do this for many, many years and it&apos;s great to see him out there fulfilling his potential.&quot; Marketing experts say the way that McIlroy has rebounded from his travails at the Masters this year, when he suffered a devastating final round collapse having led throughout the tournament, has been just as important in building his appeal in the US. He became the youngest winner of the tournament since 1923 and, in doing so, set a tournament record total of 16 under. He also eclipsed the previous best aggregate of 12-under set by Woods at the 2000 US Open. &quot;It&apos;s absolute massive. It&apos;s the uniqueness of the achievement and the fact he&apos;s so young,&quot; said Nigel Currie, director of sports sponsorship agency BrandRapport. &quot;He has made America sit up and really take notice. His age and the prodigious talent is unbelievable. And he is in one of the four or five sports that can make you one of the highest earning sportsmen around.&quot; McIlroy is currently sponsored by Titleist, Oakley, the luxury watch brand Audemars Piguet and the Dubai-based property group Jumeirah. Some of those deals will pay bonuses linked to major championship wins. But the real windfall will come when his current deals run out. Chandler is already believed to have dozens of offers on his desk, and that was before this week&apos;s events. The agent can expect to received dozens more offers. Chandler oversaw a similar transformation in Andrew Flintoff&apos;s profile in the wake of England&apos;s Ashes victory in 2005 \u2013 albeit on a domestic rather than global scale. McIlroy&apos;s enthusiasm for Twitter and his matter-of-fact relationship with fans and the media is seen as a positive for him. &quot;There&apos;s a series of stepping stones and winning a major is one of those. If you can then establish yourself as a regular winner over five years, the potential is limitless,&quot; said Currie. &quot;Look at Woods or Federer. The trick is to establish yourself as the number one in the world in an individual sport over a four or five year spell. If you do that you can get yourself to earnings of half a billion over that period.&quot; According to US magazine Forbes, Woods remained the top-earning sportsman last year on $75m, despite his very public fall from grace. Basketball players Kobe Bryant and Lebron James, with whom McIlroy shares a luxury watch sponsor and has forged a friendship via text messages, were second and third in the 2011 Forbes list. The potential for McIlroy in the US, Asia and the growing market in the Middle East, where he already has strong links through his recently renewed deal with Jumeirah, could also play a part in his future decisions about where he plays, whether it be mainly on the lucrative US or the increasingly prosperous European Tour.", "title": "Rory McIlroy has the world at his feet after US Open victory", "sentences": ["And he is in one of the four or five sports that can make you one of the highest earning sportsmen around.&quot; McIlroy is currently sponsored by Titleist, Oakley, the luxury watch brand Audemars Piguet and the Dubai-based property group Jumeirah."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-20T00:14:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/22/osama-bin-laden-wife-leave-pakistan-yemen", "tags": ["Osama bin Laden", "Yemen", "Pakistan", "US news", "World news", "Al-Qaida", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "Osama bin Laden&apos;s youngest wife is expected to leave Pakistan for her homeland, Yemen, within days. Amal Ahmed al-Sadah, 29, has been held by security services since US special forces killed Bin Laden, whom she married in 1999. Sadah was wounded in the operation and detained by Pakistani authorities in the compound in the northern garrison town of Abbottabad where her husband was hiding. She is believed to have been questioned by US intelligence services. Reports in newspapers in the Yemen and Saudi Arabia, confirmed by officials in Riyadh, indicate that arrangements have been finalised between Yemeni and Pakistani diplomats for the return of Sadah and her 12-year-old daughter, Safiya, who was also injured in the raid. Bin Laden&apos;s third and fourth wives were also found at the compound by Pakistani authorities after the US operation. Both were born in Bin Laden&apos;s home town of Jeddah, on the southern Red Sea coast, and are Saudi citizens. The oldest, Khairiah Sabar, married the former Taliban leader in 1985. The third wife held by the Pakistanis, Siham Sabar, was married in 1987. Both women are college graduates. Officials in Riyadh told the Guardian that, at least theoretically, there was no objection to their return to Saudi Arabia. Their husband, who was 57 when he died, was stripped of his Saudi Arabian citizenship in 1994 after he turned against the rulers of the kingdom, which he eventually fled, after the first Gulf war. Hamza, a 22-year-old son of Bin Laden was killed in the raid. The bodies of both men were buried at sea. The women and about 10 of Bin Laden&apos;s children and grandchildren were handcuffed by special forces who then left. Sadah&apos;s brother, Zakria al-Sadah, told the Yemen Times this week that Yemeni diplomats in Pakistan had told him his sister would &quot;arrive in the coming days&quot; after the completion of legal formalities. Negotiations over the exact arrangements for the journey had been long and complicated, the newspaper said. Sadah&apos;s family has repeatedly called for her repatriation. Shortly after Bin Laden&apos;s death they spoke to a reporter from the Associated Press news agency in their home in Ibb, an agricultural town in the mountains about 100 miles south of the Yemeni capital, Sana&apos;a. They said they had seen Sadah only once since her wedding in 2000, when she was 17. Since then, communication was largely limited to messages delivered by couriers. Sadah fled from Afghanistan with her daughter in the months after the 11 September attacks and is believed to have told investigators she had spent five years in the compound in Pakistan without leaving the gates. Their location in the intervening period is unknown. Bin Laden&apos;s two other wives \u2013 two earlier marriages ended in divorce \u2013 fled the al-Qaida leader&apos;s base near Kandahar in late 2001 and were driven by a trusted associate into Pakistan, according to interrogation files from the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention centre recently released by WikiLeaks and published by the Guardian. Sadah, whose father is a minor civil servant, told her friends and family she wanted to &quot;go down in history&quot;, according to her cousin, Waleed Hashem Abdel-Fatah al-Sadah. Weeks after the proposal, a dowry of $5,000 (\u00a33,000) was wired by Bin Laden and, accompanied by an intermediary, Sadah travelled through Dubai and Pakistan to Afghanistan to meet her bridegroom for the first time. When the family learned through a courier that she had given birth to a daughter, a group of relatives travelled to Afghanistan, where they spent a month. On the final day of the visit, a cousin recalled Bin Laden telling the young mother she could stay with him in Afghanistan or return home with her family. &quot;I want to be martyred with you and I won&apos;t leave as long as you&apos;re alive,&quot; he recalled her saying. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 June 2011.

But for the sake of argument assume a reliable technology and a sufficiency of DNA to work with. Of course, the first difficulty from the strictly utilitarian point of view is that we don&apos;t know what the consequences would be. Neanderthal brains were physically different from ours and we have no idea how that impacted their consciousness. We assume they had speech, but this is obviously something that does not fossilise. So it&apos;s hard to judge the consequences inflicted on a sentient being when we have no clear idea of what kind of sentience is involved. So a straightforward calculation of the likely consequences can&apos;t be done in the way that it can at least be attempted in bioethical questions as they affect homo sapiens. That doesn&apos;t mean that religion can provide answers, either. I haven&apos;t asked a Roman Catholic but assume that they would apply the same kind of precautionary principle as is applied in the case of abortion: that something which might be a human being should always be given the benefit of the doubt. But other religions, and other forms of Christianity, are not opposed to human cloning. They might not be opposed to cloning Neanderthals. So let&apos;s not set it up as a science v religion argument. There will be ethical disagreement, but this will lie between believers as much as between unbelievers. Does it make a difference that this would be an experiment? It&apos;s science, which means that we discover things by trial and error. These trials are carefully constructed to ensure that the errors are as instructive as possible, but the outcome can&apos;t be known in advance. It&apos;s not easy to see how one could be certain of having a complete and viable sequence of Neanderthal DNA when there is nothing to compare it with and only the broad assumption that if the specimen from which it was extracted made it to adulthood it was reasonably healthy. OK: let&apos;s try from another angle. Surely the final ethical test of this is that the cloned Neanderthal would be happy to have been born. Looked at from this angle, it is immediately obvious that it would be wrong to clone a Neanderthal. No one would want to be the only member of their species. The minimum ethical thing to do would be to clone 20 or 30. We would not be bringing back an individual, but a species, for which we would then become responsible. What religion would these creatures have? We know that Neanderthals had rituals, and presumably beliefs, around death. These are lost forever. Should they be replaced? If Neanderthals are enough like us to bury their dead, they will make mythologies with or without our help. What should those be? If two separate countries or cultures cloned two different Neanderthal cultures, would each regard the other as heretics? All this presupposes that they can be taught contemporary languages. Again, the choice here is obviously arbitrary but not terribly important, though I admit to a sneaking desire to have them all taught Latin or ancient Greek. But at the same time it is reasonably certain that they would develop and bend the language they were given to map onto their rather different cognitive faculties. Whatever happened, it would be entirely fascinating to observe. There would be other advantages. The revival of a species from 25,000 years ago would be a wonderful window onto our own nature; it would provide a stunning and \u2013 if evidence had anything to do with it \u2013 irrefutable argument against creationists. It would enrich our understanding of consciousness, of biodiversity, and it should also be wonderful for the Neanderthals. Who would not rather be alive and healthy than dead? Nonetheless, there are two reasons why it should never be attempted. The first is feminist. Cloning does not stop in a petri dish. There must be surrogate mothers, and they would be just as much the subjects of these experiments as the Neanderthal embryos. Given the enormously complex interplay between a mother&apos;s immune system and a human foetus, it&apos;s hard to imagine things would go better when another species was involved. The second is also concerned with the differences that evolution brings about: a Neanderthal of 25,000 years ago would have essentially no immunity to any of the diseases that have evolved since then. All of us now alive are descended from the survivors of centuries of epidemics. They flourished, in turn, because of human settlement patterns. We have no right to bring anyone else into the mess we have made. \u2022 This article was amended at 12.30pm, 23 June 2011. The original article referred to Neanderthals of 50,000 years ago.

You have to go all the way back to a (very dark) time when John Major was prime minister, Wet Wet Wet were No1 and Aidan O&apos;Brien had held his training licence for barely 12 months. I blame the bloodstock industry and the increasing importance it places on speed, which means winners of the Epsom Derby are these days more likely to be aimed at the Eclipse than the Irish race, in an attempt to prove they can cut it over 10 furlongs as well as 12. It is certainly not impossible for overseas runners to win the race; three French trainers have won it, one of them twice, since 1995. But the emergence of O&apos;Brien&apos;s Ballydoyle yard as a force in top-class races has made it difficult for others to get a look in. O&apos;Brien has won eight Irish Derbys, including the past five. He has 17 other Irish Classic successes to his name. It is hard, now, to remember a time when British runners would turn up for those races with positive expectations. But such a time did exist. The 1994 Irish Derby was the eighth to be won by a Britain-based horse in nine years. Barry Hills, Michael Stoute, Henry Cecil, Luca Cumani, John Dunlop and Paul Cole all got their names on the roll of honour in that time. Just to remind ourselves that it can be done, here are the past five horses trained here that went over there and came back with the trophy. 1) Balanchine 1994 It was the first year of Godolphin and Balanchine was the firm&apos;s first runner in Ireland when she turned up for the Derby. Trained by Hilal Ibrahim, she had been beaten a short-head in the 1,000 Guineas by Las Meninas and been an impressive Oaks winner, beating Wind In Her Hair by two and a half lengths under a 23-year-old Frankie Dettori, who had never won a British Classic before. It was not a good year for Irish-trained talent. The sole runner trained on home soil was John Oxx&apos;s 40-1 shot Cajarian, who would finish seventh of nine. Godolphin may have been Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s baby but he did not, at this stage, funnel all his best horses into it. King&apos;s Theatre, who was runner-up to Erhaab in the Epsom Derby, was trained by Cecil and carried the Sheikh&apos;s maroon and white colours. He started the even-money favourite, with Balanchine at 5-1. Balanchine must have been some horse that day because she never seemed to settle and had pulled her way to the front half a mile from home. King&apos;s Theatre had the entire length of the straight to shoot at her but never even looked like pulling level and was four and a half lengths down at the line. It seemed a major victory for the new idea of having horses spend the winter in Dubai. Balanchine, bought from Robert Sangster for Godolphin the previous year, was among the first horses to have been flown to the Middle East in the autumn, returning to England in the spring. King&apos;s Theatre had endured the full blast of an English winter in Newmarket. These days we are used to the idea that Godolphin horses generally make a slow start to the English season after returning from Dubai but that would have seemed a surprising future in 1994, when it really looked as though Sheikh Mohammed might have revolutionised the game. Incidentally, Balanchine carried the colours of Sheikh Maktoum al Maktoum at the Curragh. The royal blue silks of Godolphin, so famous now, had no such status at the time and were not invariably carried by their runners. This great moment for Ibrahim and his filly was to prove a last hurrah for both. The trainer was replaced by Saeed bin Suroor the following year, while Balanchine suffered a serious bout of colic and never won again. 2) Commander In Chief 1993 The Irish Derby is at its best when serving as a decider between the winners of the English and French equivalents, not something that has happened since Sinndar and Holding Court in 2000. But it happened in 1993, when Commander In Chief met Hernando, supplemented the week before at a cost of \u00a375,000. There were nine other runners but they were all 10-1 or bigger. Hernando had another 14 races ahead of him but his Group One wins were all behind him. He had his chance as Cash Asmussen sent him after Commander In Chief (Pat Eddery) in the final furlong, but he was still three parts of a length short when they reached the line. &quot;I was cruising two furlongs out but he met a better horse on the day, he took on a tiger,&quot; Asmussen said. It seemed at the time as though the Curragh crowd may have seen a race of exceptional quality but Commander In Chief was third in the King George the next month and never ran again, while Hernando became frustrating at the highest level. 3) Generous 1991 Two years before Commander In Chief and Hernando, there was another clash of the English and French Derby winners and there was no doubting the quality of either. Generous, a bonny chestnut, had pulled five lengths clear of his Epsom rivals, while Suave Dancer had beaten Subotica by four lengths at Chantilly. Given that Subotica would win the 1992 Arc de Triomphe, the French form was stronger, in hindsight. But Generous was a remorseless galloper at the peak of his powers. Leading for the final mile, he kept on dourly when Suave Dancer closed on him two furlongs out and the other horse was fading close home, trailing by three lengths at the line. Still, that looked like a brave effort from the runner-up when Generous hacked up by seven lengths in the King George a few weeks later. Paul Cole&apos;s horse was hailed as the horse of a generation. Alas, he was stuffed in the Arc that year, his first race for more than two months, trailing home nine lengths behind the winner ... Suave Dancer. The Racing Post ran a caption competition of Cole and a couple of others standing around Generous, laying hands on him and looking concerned. The pleasingly surreal winning entry had the trainer saying: &quot;If we stick his head back on this way, I&apos;m sure no one will notice.&quot; 4) Salsabil 1990 Salsabil was the first filly to win the Irish Derby since Gallinaria 90 years before and she beat a proper field. Against her were the first and second from Epsom \u2013 Quest For Fame and Blue Stag \u2013 as well as Belmez, who had beaten Quest For Fame in the Chester Vase. But punters had plenty of faith in Salsabil following her wins in the 1,000 Guineas and the Oaks, and sent her off at 11-4, making her second-favourite, even after a late drift. Her supporters would have had few worries through the race, in which she was the last to come off the bridle. Quest For Fame and Belmez were being pushed along off the home turn, though it took Salsabil a fair time to work her way past Deploy, who may have set a steady pace. The form worked out. Belmez won the King George, a neck in front of Old Vic, of whom more in a moment. Quest For Fame won a Grade One in America and was twice third in the Breeders&apos; Cup Turf. Salsabil won another Group One, the Vermeille, but fared no better than Generous when it came to the Arc. 5) Old Vic 1989 In an ordinary year, Old Vic would have been an obvious contender for the Epsom Derby, having been an easy winner of the Sandown Classic Trial and the Chester Vase. But he was owned by Sheikh Mohammed, whose brother, Sheikh Hamdan, had the brilliant Nashwan, for whom the Derby was marked. So Old Vic went over to Chantilly and made almost all to win by seven lengths in the French equivalent, three days before Nashwan hosed up at Epsom. Then, since Nashwan was being aimed at the Eclipse and then the King George, Old Vic was free to plunder the Irish Derby. This really wasn&apos;t much of a contest, even though Old Vic had an abscess on his back, right under the saddle area, that his trainer, Cecil, described as twice the size of a golf ball. &quot;I had to use foam pads with a hole cut out to enable him to take part,&quot; the trainer recalled recently, after the horse had died of colic at the age of 25. The abscess didn&apos;t stop him pulling four lengths clear of Observation Post and Ile De Nisky, giving British raiders a 1-2-3. More significantly, this race made his jockey, Steve Cauthen, the first to have ridden the winners of the world&apos;s four major Derbys, in England, Ireland, France and Kentucky.", "title": "Claims Five: The Brits who won the Irish Derby | Chris Cook", "sentences": ["It seemed a major victory for the new idea of having horses spend the winter in Dubai.", "These days we are used to the idea that Godolphin horses generally make a slow start to the English season after returning from Dubai but that would have seemed a surprising future in 1994, when it really looked as though Sheikh Mohammed might have revolutionised the game."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-24T10:16:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jun/24/snake-safari-arunachal-pradesh-india", "tags": ["India holidays", "Safaris", "Asia", "Wildlife holidays", "Travel", "Adventure travel", "Snakes"], "article": "The first thing that happened was that an old man wearing a cap crowned with a peacock&apos;s claw, a hornbill&apos;s beak, a bearskin and a pair of knitting needles strolled up to the veranda of the government resthouse. &quot;You want snakes?&quot; he asked in broken Hindi, &quot;Come with me now.&quot; It was late afternoon.

And of these, Arunachal Pradesh is one of the most remote and inaccessible. It covers those jungled mountains that extend 350 miles eastwards from the Bhutanese border all the way to Burma. Claimed by China and largely ignored by Delhi, its steep-sided hills and rampaging rivers have barely been touched by the modern world. Our hosts, the Nyishi tribe, are a people whose knowledge of the lands beyond their jungles was, until half a century ago, largely based on slaving forays among the lowland Assamese. I had arrived as part of a scientific expedition, one that amateur naturalists can accompany, with the aim of collecting snake venom for anti-venom serum. This is not a frivolous or obscure project, as expedition leader Gerry Martin pointed out. &quot;There are about one million snake bites in India every year \u2013 50,000 of them fatal. Thousands of other people are incapacitated.&quot;     A member of the Nyishi tribe in traditional headgear    The problem is that Indian snakes are not well studied. Scientists are just beginning to realise that venom is often location-specific and also that certain species may in fact be several distinct species. Our other expert, Rom Whitaker, American-born but brought up in India, is one of the greatest authorities on Indian snakes; he was quick to point out the limitations of current knowledge. &quot;Take some of the snakes we are looking for here: Medo&apos;s pit viper \u2013 we know almost nothing. It&apos;s probably a group of species. And Kaulback&apos;s pit viper \u2013 discovered in 1940 in south-west China and here in India only three years ago. It&apos;s a six-foot-long, highly venomous pit viper \u2013 that&apos;s about all we know.&quot; Rom&apos;s particular object of study is king cobras. &quot;They&apos;ll be here for sure.&quot; I&apos;m no snake expert. In Africa once I was chased by a black mamba and the experience frightened the life out of me. I have very mixed feelings about this trip. But I am not going to have time to dwell on that. No sooner has the old man in the curious tribal hat mentioned his knowledge than we are on the march, heading out past the rice fields, following him down towards the river at the bottom of the valley. We cross the torrent on logs laid across boulders, then climb up to a large flat rock in a bracken-covered clearing. &quot;They live under there,&quot; says our informant. Immediately Gerry and his assistant Soham Mukherjee are on their knees shining torches into the cracks. &quot;Cobras,&quot; whispers Gerry, &quot;Big ones.&quot; A crowd of excited villagers is gathering. For them it is clearly a thrilling novelty that someone might want to catch a snake and not kill it. Rom is showing them identification photographs and they all pick out the monocled cobra as the species we are tackling. They are more interested, however, in another picture: Kaulback&apos;s pit viper. &quot;Oh, very bad!&quot; says one young man in English \u2013 a language as rare as anti-venom in these parts. &quot;We call him barta [meaning the deadliest of all snakes] and he is very bad. If you see one, you must kill it immediately or it will follow you home and kill someone in your longhouse.&quot; &quot;Where do you find them?&quot; asks Rom. &quot;In the jungle \u2013 mountain tops.&quot; Rom looks doubtful. &quot;People always think snakes are far away, but in my experience they are close, like this one.&quot; Gerry is calling him over to the boulder. He&apos;s placed a coat over one side of the crack, creating a dark, inviting escape hole. Now he&apos;s gently poking with a stick and waving the torch. &quot;He&apos;s coming. You ready, Rom?&quot; Rom jumps up next to the boulder, a long, hooked snake stick in hand. Some of the local children start running away, a few adults too. The snake, smooth, powerful and grey, shoots out of the hole over Rom&apos;s waiting snake hook. Rom grabs it by the tail and lifts it up with the hook. The cobra, furious, whips its body around hissing, but Rom skilfully controls it. Gerry has a canvas bag ready and the six-foot reptile is dropped inside. It immediately settles down, comforted by the darkness. &quot;They go into a kind of torpor,&quot; says Gerry. &quot;We&apos;ll keep him a week, then take venom before we release him.&quot;     Snake expert Rom Whitaker crosses a bamboo bridge    Walking back to the resthouse, it&apos;s getting dark and I&apos;m close behind Rom at a tricky climb over a bamboo fence. Suddenly he stoops down and seizes a snake in the undergrowth and bags it. &quot;Himalayan keelback,&quot; he grins. The manouevre is completed so quickly I haven&apos;t even seen the creature. Later, this incident prompts me to ask if an untutored outsider can actually help much on an expedition like this. &quot;Honestly?&quot; he asks. &quot;Well, the money from paying guests helps a lot. This kind of expedition would not go ahead without it. And extra pairs of eyes and hands are genuinely useful.&quot; There is another benefit that I start to appreciate over the following days. Simply by showing an interest in wildlife, the visitor can help transform local attitudes. In Nyishi territory, the birds, for example, are hunted along with other creatures: the deer, the squirrels, the clouded leopard and bear. Tigers and elephants have all but disappeared, though a few old men tell us that they still exist in the most remote areas. Our interest triggers a response. Climbing up a steep hillside cleared for rice, one farmer is keen to show me a nest in his rain shelter, then points out the brilliant colours of a golden-throated barbet on a nearby tree and a pair of woodpeckers. The Nyishi here are hunters and they have an intimate and detailed knowledge of every living creature around them. It just never occurred to them that these might have any use other than food. That evening more people stop by the resthouse \u2013 as we are apparently the first Europeans ever to visit Leporiang, we are treated to a constant stream of curious visitors. They leaf through our books, stare at Gerry&apos;s laptop, ask questions: &quot;Why do you white people all look the same?&quot; One youth grins at our female expedition members, Janike and Hema, and announces, &quot;In my grandfather&apos;s time we would keep your women and thrash the men.&quot; We all laugh. I&apos;m pretty sure that &quot;thrash&quot; is a euphemism for &quot;kill&quot;. Almost every middle-aged man carries a sword, and some have bows and poison-tipped arrows in bearskin quivers. The youths scorn such things, preferring hair gel and sneakers. Women are less adorned and appear to do all the work: hoeing the impossibly steep hillsides, carrying vast loads of firewood and cooking our meals in the government resthouse \u2013 Leporiang&apos;s only accommodation for visitors. On Sunday they head for the church on the hill and throw themselves, babies on their backs, into frenetic bouts of mass hysteria and swooning. This is a culture that&apos;s diving headlong into its own unfathomable future. Among our visitors is one old man who saunters up the veranda and from a basket produces a dead snake \u2013 a gorgeous black, yellow and blue creature about five foot long. The effect on our experts is electric. Janike does a scale count \u2013 a diagnostic test in snakes \u2013 and declares the creature to be a Kaulback&apos;s. The old-timer has different ideas. &quot;It&apos;s not barta,&quot; he says, using the local name. &quot;It&apos;s taji. They are different.&quot; This is inexplicable, but our scientists do not discount it: knowledge of these snakes is so scarce that every morsel of local information is noted down. The next day we trek for miles, deep into the jungled mountains, to find where this snake lived. The trees are shaggy with orchids and ferns \u2013 entire ecosystems in themselves. The rivers are heaving with fish and tadpoles the size of my thumb. And the vegetation is laden with leeches \u2013 harmless, if unpleasant. We flick them away with increasing regularity. Inside a narrow valley, we locate the precise spot where the Kaulback&apos;s pit viper was killed, then we fan out and start searching. Three hours later we have not found any snakes and decide to return. Almost immediately, Soham spots movement in the undergrowth and pounces, triumphantly lifting up a small lizard. It&apos;s a long-legged creature with a gorgeous green and orange throat. &quot;Almost certainly a new species,&quot; declares Gerry. &quot;We found one last year in the next valley and no one has yet identified it.&quot; It seems a pretty good consolation for not finding the viper, but our guides are not satisfied. That night another old man in a Nyishi cap arrives to look at us. News of the strange foreigners who are interested in snakes has reached his longhouse some miles away. &quot;Search the river at night,&quot; he tells us. &quot;The overhanging trees are full of snakes.&quot; Naturally, a torch-lit search for venomous reptiles while waist-deep in a fast-flowing Himalayan river is a snake-hunter&apos;s idea of a good night out. After dinner we head off, myself rather reluctantly at the rear. We clamber down to the river below the village, Gerry and Rom leading the way. Not everyone, it has to be said, would enjoy such abnormal behaviour, but I am about to experience one of the highs that such determination can bring. The river is fast-flowing and 30 metres across. Soon the group is spread out, torches flaring off the trees and water. I find myself wading after Soham \u2013 he found the lizard, I reason, so maybe good luck is with him. We get separated from the others and come across two local men hunting fish with their hands. It&apos;s one of them who shouts the warning. &quot;Look up!&quot; On a branch 10 feet above the raging torrent is a coiled emerald-green serpent, its head the shape of a blunt arrowhead. We inch closer. The boulders are desperately slippery and I go down once, grateful I&apos;ve packed my camera in a dry bag. The fisherman, eager to help, grabs the branch and shakes. The viper falls in the river among us. Soham coolly dives forward and grabs its tail, then gets it on his snake stick. We all shuffle and stumble towards a sandbank to get a closer look at this phenomenally beautiful creature, so perfect in every precisely defined scale and feature. Back at base camp we get further treats: Leporiang has only recently got electricity and there are a few bulbs in town, some of them on our veranda. The light has brought visitors: a huge pale moth, pressed to the door like a fallen moon, then another, as broad as my outstretched hand, with huge brown eyes on its furry wings.     Gerry Martin, left, and Rom Whitaker with a cobra    The days roll by and the end of the week arrives. It&apos;s time to inspect all our snakes \u2013 nine of them \u2013 to identify and photograph them. Unfortunately, I am going to miss the venom extraction as the necessary ice has not arrived from Assam, but we go through the identification. First is a green rat snake \u2013 non-venomous, so I have a go at handling it. Then come keelbacks \u2013 Himalayan and St John&apos;s \u2013 and two Medo&apos;s pit vipers, one a baby with its umbilical cord mark still visible (most vipers give birth rather than laying eggs). Next is a false cobra and a strange burrowing snake, more like a worm, really. Finally we come to the two cobras. Gerry prepares carefully. This is a big, fast animal and extremely venomous. As it drops out of the bag it&apos;s clearly angry, hissing loudly. Held by the tail, however, the snake rears up and spreads its hood. &quot;Monocled cobra,&quot; someone shouts confidently. But Rom is frowning. &quot;I&apos;m not so sure. Let&apos;s do the scale counts.&quot; They place the snake&apos;s head in a clear plastic tube to prevent any mishaps and start the counts. Janike immediately announces that nothing fits the expected figures for a monocled cobra \u2013 a well-known Indian species. &quot;Check the tail-to-body ratio,&quot; she says. When the result is shouted out, Rom shakes his head. &quot;That&apos;s incredible. I mean, what is this thing?&quot; Further results only increase his consternation. The snake, meanwhile, is getting tired. They pop it back in the bag to rest. It feels like no one dares say it, so I do. &quot;New species of cobra?&quot; Gerry and Rom share a glance. &quot;Could be.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s a long process,&quot; explains Gerry. &quot;And the truth is we are probably looking at a local variation within the monocled species.&quot; That night, my last in Leporiang, I\u00a0wander out among the paddy fields, treading carefully on the narrow earthen bunds that separate the fields. Thousands of frogs are celebrating the arrival of the monsoons, and no doubt, so too are the vipers, the cobras and the keelbacks. On either side of me, I\u00a0can sense, rather than see, the jungle:\u00a0a dark shadow that rises up. I\u00a0had never expected that such a place could exist in modern India, a place so unknown and untouched. In this province the local government is planning dozens of new hydroelectric dams, and yet the contents of that astonishingly diverse jungle remain largely unknown and undiscovered. If paying guests can help scientific expeditions like ours to take place,\u00a0then the tourist dollar, I\u00a0reckon, will be well spent.

As the 5-2 favourite, and the strongest chance that the Queen is ever likely to have to win Flat racing&apos;s most important Classic, he was a win-only proposition. He did not have much luck in running, and was beaten barely a length to finish third, but after all the build-up, the sense of disappointment was significant. While the dream of a Derby winner in the Queen&apos;s colours was extinguished, the result also showed that Carlton House is one of the most talented racehorses of his generation. Every other possibility for his three-year-old season is still alive, and will remain so if he can win the Irish Derby at the Curragh on Sunday, for which he seems sure to start favourite. His owner, at least, has maintained a positive outlook since Carlton House&apos;s defeat at Epsom. &quot;Of course, she must have been disappointed,&quot; John Warren, the Queen&apos;s racing manager, said on Friday, &quot;though I can&apos;t say exactly what she felt, only she could do that. But being as stoical as she is, I got the impression that she was also thrilled to have a horse that is actually of this calibre, and with his future in front of him after Epsom since the margins were as close as they were. &quot;Sunday&apos;s race is very exciting and everyone is looking forward to it. The second [Treasure Beach], third, fourth [Memphis Tennessee] and fifth [Native Khan] from Epsom are all coming together again, and they were all very close at the business end of the race. &quot;These are all young horses that are improving all the time, and some might have come out of Epsom better than others, and some might have improved more significantly than others. It&apos;s going to be a fascinating race.&quot; Carlton House&apos;s preparation for the Derby was briefly interrupted by a minor setback less than a week before the Classic. That has not been advanced as an excuse for his defeat by Pour Moi and Treasure Beach, but his trouble-free run towards the Curragh is reflected in his odds, which strongly suggest he will find the three-quarters of a length that separated him from Treasure Beach at Epsom. Treasure Beach enjoyed a much smoother passage in the Derby, always close to the lead under Colm O&apos;Donoghue and then able to strike for home at a time of his rider&apos;s choosing. Carlton House was slightly hampered by fading outsiders, and then sent towards the lead from further back, and perhaps a little earlier, than his jockey, Ryan Moore, would have preferred. &quot;The one thing we do know is that he has come out of the Derby extremely well,&quot; Warren said. &quot;Sir Michael [Stoute] seems really pleased with the horse, as are all of his team at home who live with him day in and day out. &quot;There seems to be quiet confidence about the way he is going to perform, but with the margins so small, you can&apos;t gaze into a crystal ball and that&apos;s what makes it such fun. It&apos;s not a case of one runaway winner taking on the rest again. &quot;What we will learn about is all the little issues that went against Carlton House before he ran [at Epsom] and during the race, that may or may not make a difference.&quot; Victory for Carlton House on Sunday in one of the three major European Derbys would also guarantee his future career as a stallion. As a product of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s Darley Stud breeding operation, his pedigree is impeccable, as he is by the Dubai World Cup winner Street Cry \u2013 also the sire of the brilliant Zenyatta and the 2007 Kentucky Derby winner, Street Sense \u2013 out of the mare Talented, who won the Sun Chariot Stakes with Willie Carson in the saddle back in 1993. Once his racing career is over, Carlton House could well retire to the Queen&apos;s own stud on the Sandringham estate, where Motivator, the 2005 Derby winner, would be one of his neighbours. The National Stud in Newmarket, where Bahamian Bounty is currently the star stallion at \u00a310,000, is another possibility. For the moment, though, all connected with Carlton House have fixed their attention on his racing career, which extends to four races so far and could still lead him all over the racing world during the second half of the Flat season and beyond. &quot;There are so many options, and he really could race anywhere,&quot; Warren said. &quot;He could go to Dubai [for the World Cup meeting in March] potentially, but that&apos;s all guesswork at this point and we are just dealing with what we have in hand. It&apos;s fantastic fun to know that the Queen has a really lovely horse to go to war with.&quot;", "title": "Queen's racing manager is upbeat as Carlton House goes for Irish Derby", "sentences": ["As a product of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s Darley Stud breeding operation, his pedigree is impeccable, as he is by the Dubai World Cup winner Street Cry \u2013 also the sire of the brilliant Zenyatta and the 2007 Kentucky Derby winner, Street Sense \u2013 out of the mare Talented, who won the Sun Chariot Stakes with Willie Carson in the saddle back in 1993.", "&quot;He could go to Dubai [for the World Cup meeting in March] potentially, but that&apos;s all guesswork at this point and we are just dealing with what we have in hand."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-24T23:55:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/jun/25/talking-horses", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Tominator is long-odds victor at Newcastle Veteran trainer Reg Hollinshead shocked the Newcastle crowd as his Tominator claimed victory in the track&apos;s most famous race, the John Smith&apos;s Northumberland Plate.  The four-year-old had been running well enough in defeat in recent starts, but with the the most lucrative of his three previous successes coming in a Wolverhampton handicap, this clearly represented a huge step forward. However, tackling two miles for the first time in the Pitmen&apos;s Derby obviously did the trick for the 25-1 chance \u2013 and the joy of his claiming rider Paul Pickard was there for all to see as he passed the post.  Pickard elected to bide his time, no doubt anticipating the strong gallop set by last year&apos;s winner and regular front-runner, Overturn. For a long way it appeared the top-weight would repeat his heroics of 12 months ago, but Donald McCain&apos;s gelding was a spent force soon after the turn for home.  One-time Derby hope Montaff ran a huge race for Mick Channon, as did Tim Easterby&apos;s Deauville Flyer, but Tominator swept past them as though they were standing still with a furlong to run.  The result was in no doubt thereafter, and Pickard punched his mount out to the line to score by a length and three-quarters. Montaff beat Deauville Flyer to the runner-up spot, while Overturn was a creditable sixth under his welter burden, but favourite Harlestone Times was a disappointing 15th.  Hollinshead&apos;s son and assistant, Andrew, said: &quot;The reason we first bought him was because he had a staying pedigree and he&apos;s shown he has plenty of stamina today. I wouldn&apos;t say he was backward as he actually won a nursery at Catterick over seven furlongs as a two-year-old. &quot;We lost our way at three as he ran at Haydock and Darryll Holland told us he didn&apos;t stay a mile and a half. That threw us off track for a while. &quot;We took him to France last winter and he was unlucky not to win out there. I have to give a mention to Tony Culhane, who was unable to ride today. He said all the horse wanted was holding up off a good pace and he was right.&quot; PA  Today&apos;s TV races Few of the Flat season&apos;s big handicap prizes are still to elude John Dunlop, fast approaching 50 years with a training licence, but Harlestone Times (3.05) should go close to righting that wrong\u00a0in Saturday&apos;s Northumberland Plate at Newcastle. Although untried over anything like this trip, the selection is related to a host of high-quality stayers. Indeed his dam&apos;s full-sister Harlestone Grey was one of the favourites for this race in 2002 before being pulled out at the eleventh hour over ground fears. Even if the surface comes up very soft, there ought to be no worries about the going with Harlestone Times having won in testing conditions last season, and the evidence of his two runs this year suggests that he is a much-improved performer. Following his Epsom reappearance run, Harlestone Times&apos;s success over Nave at Goodwood looks hot after third-placed Beachfire scored at Royal Ascot. Newcastle 2.00 Genki did not get the best of runs at Royal Ascot and has shown in the past that he can handle two outings in quick succession, but with the ground in his favour, Regal Parade may have too much class. Newmarket 2.15 Despite never being asked to come out of second gear, My Propeller clocked a time faster than the three-year-old handicap on the same card at Pontefract on Sunday. The quick turnaround is a slight concern, but it is not as if she had any sort of a race. Newcastle 2.30 Low draws are expected to be favoured and Klynch makes some appeal from stall two. He has gone up the weights after a recent purple patch but remains better treated than when at his peak for former trainer Brian Meehan. Newmarket 2.45 Neil Callan is an interesting booking for Jukebox Jury, who narrowly falls short of making the grade in the very best company, but whose toughness and class will always make him an opponent to be feared at this level. Newmarket 3.20 A competitive line-up, in which a case can be made for many, but there looks to be plenty of pace in the line-up and Redford may find that the contest is run to suit. Smaller fields have hindered the effectiveness of his usual come-from-behind tactics this season. Newcastle 3.40 With precious few proven in the mud, a shock could be on the cards courtesy of the inconsistent Osteopathic Remedy, who boasts fine previous form at this course in similar conditions. Horse sense John Gosden throws his darts far and wide today in search of maintaining a hot recent run of form that has seen the stable register six victories in the last seven days. Investissement (3.05) goes north to Newcastle for the Northumberland Plate and has been kept back for this race since making a winning debut for the stable at Goodwood in April. His recent homework on the Watered Gallop has been smart and Nicky Mackay knows him well as a result. Soft ground and a good test of stamina are expected to play to his strengths. Gosden&apos;s stable jockey William Buick stays closer to home at Headquarters where Questioning (3.55) goes for a big pot in the \u00a3150,000 Tattersalls Millions Cup. He was badly in need of the run when third to Auld Burns on his reappearance and his subsequent fifth to Derby winner Pour Moi was certainly no disgrace. He worked well on the Round Gallop on Tuesday and appears to have toughened up a bit. Hawfinch (2.15) is also fancied by Gosden in the Listed Empress Stakes. She may have looked flattered when the race fell into her lap first time out at Kempton, but she has always shown a smart turn of foot at home and appears to have come on considerably for the run. Those looking to play at longer odds in the same race might do worse than consider maiden Hidden Passion. She has gone well with Queen Mary runner-up Shumoos at home. Seen and heard Fame And Glory&apos;s Gold Cup win last week appears to have led to a change of heart, at least temporarily, for influential owners Dr Jim and Fitri Hay. The Dubai-based couple, who bought into the Aidan O&apos;Brien-trained Fame And Glory at the start of the year, were rumoured to be considering moving a number of their other horses to join a new trainer in Newmarket. But the Ascot success, before which they were also invited to take part in the royal procession before racing, appears to have delayed that decision. That said, three wins for Doc Hay since being sold out of Paul Cole&apos;s yard to join rookie handler Keith Dalgleish will not exactly have impressed the Hays, who have past form for moving their team around. Lesley Graham&apos;s bid to sell her Newmarket house stepped up a gear with an appearance in the property section of Wednesday&apos;s London Evening Standard. News of the Channel 4 Racing presenter&apos;s decision to sell her nine-bedroom, Grade II-Listed former rectory emerged some time ago, following her separation from husband Neil. The house is on the market for \u00a31.4m and Graham told the paper: &quot;We moved here because it had great schools and fantastic access to all the racecourses \u2013 Fakenham, Newmarket and Huntingdon.&quot;", "title": "Talking Horses | Will Hayler", "sentences": ["The Dubai-based couple, who bought into the Aidan O&apos;Brien-trained Fame And Glory at the start of the year, were rumoured to be considering moving a number of their other horses to join a new trainer in Newmarket."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-25T09:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jun/26/footballers-wags-make-up-holiday-photos", "tags": ["Football", "Celebrity", "Premier League", "Culture", "Sport", "John Terry", "Ashley Cole", "Wayne Bridge", "Wayne Rooney", "Cristiano Ronaldo", "Photography"], "article": "Football ought to be synonymous with churned mud, not baked sand; with woolly socks and cleated boots, not Speedos. So how come John Terry, his colleagues and their attendant Wags are spending so much time on the beach? In Terry&apos;s case \u2013 as the snaps from his break in Abu Dhabi with his wife, Toni, earlier this month testify \u2013 a holiday is PR, an exercise in exposure. Terry and his kind are celebrities, which means that their private lives belong to their gossiping fans just as their professional activity is owned by the barracking supporters in the stadium. The is beach where footballers go to act out the little marital dramas that keep them visible in between matches or after the season ends, and their antics while sunning themselves are today&apos;s equivalent to the binges of randy Olympia gods in classical myth, re-enacted so opulently in the Renaissance when Titian painted Bacchus ravishing Ariadne or Botticelli showed an unsated Venus impatiently waiting for Mars to wake up from his post-coital snooze. Last year, Toni learned that Terry had allegedly been cheating on her with Vanessa Perroncel, a French lingerie model. Cosily enough, Vanessa happened to be Toni&apos;s friend, as well as the former girlfriend of Terry&apos;s England team-mate Wayne Bridge. Ah, how short a distance it is from the matey scrum of the dressing room to a wife-swapping party in the suburbs! Toni \u2013 describing herself as &quot;gutted&quot;, her glottal stops vouching for her choked grief \u2013 did what any humiliated wife would do when her husband has erred: she scooped up her twins and flew (or &quot;jetted&quot;) to Dubai. Those with broken hearts or shady pasts used to flee to the desert, like Marlene Dietrich in The Garden of Allah and Morocco, so the sun could dry their tears or cauterise their wounds. Dubai, however, is an Arab Vegas, where the desert has been replanted as a golf course or paved over by swanky hotels and shopping malls, and Toni&apos;s therapy consisted of spending Terry&apos;s money and burnishing her tan to a brighter shade of orange. Her chastened husband soon followed her to Dubai, and they staged a show of reconciliation in the grounds of Le Royal M\u00e9ridien resort, which does its best to keep its guests ignorant of where they are by serving them Mexican and Italian food, or pampering them in a spa named after the Caracalla baths in imperial Rome. Who knows whether Terry and Toni enjoyed the M\u00e9ridien&apos;s fusion cuisine, or submitted to the spa&apos;s tri-enzyme resurfacing facials? They spent little time indoors, preferring to canoodle beside the pool or take their kids for bumpy camel rides on the beach, all the while \u2013 according to onlookers who hurriedly transmitted a report to the Mirror \u2013 &quot;exchanging kisses, gazing into each other&apos;s eyes and giggling like children&quot;. The public display of affection began beside a swimming pool when Terry shucked his T-shirt. The rest of him \u2013 notably the &quot;endowment&quot; that so impressed another of his &quot;gobsmacked&quot; (or gob-challenged) girlfriends, &quot;36DD glamour girl&quot; Jayne Connery, with whom Toni reportedly caught him cheating before their marriage \u2013 remained modestly under wraps in baggy trunks. Terry&apos;s body is branded by the products he endorses, so his removal of the T-shirt signified that, for the moment, he was not the logoed personification of Umbro and Samsung, Nationwide and King of Shaves, but simply a contrite husband who craved forgiveness. Toni, costumed for the rite in a turquoise-sequined bikini, anointed him by smearing suncream on his back. Her touch, apparently, was &quot;tender&quot;. They semaphored renewal by gazing at each other&apos;s wedding rings, like characters emoting in a silent movie. In other photographs, Terry begged for Toni&apos;s sympathy by pointing to the grazes on his knees and legs \u2013 the stigmata of the footballer, playground scratches and scrapes that entitle him to pretend that his sport is as existential as bullfighting or skydiving. Earlier this month, Terry and Toni were back in the Gulf, this time in Abu Dhabi, where \u2013 despite the official primness of the Emirates, which has criminal penalties for French kissing and outlaws the flagrant display of flesh \u2013 they worked through a series of clinches that might have been used to illustrate the Kama Sutra. As the cameras clicked, they embraced by one of those waterfalls that in more euphemistic days served as a shorthand for a sexual climax in Hollywood films. Every so often they retired to change their clothes. Terry tried out some pink trunks, and Toni alternated between bikinis that would have caused her to be lashed or decapitated had she been outside the precincts of the resort, as well as a garment that the Daily Mail \u2013 briefed about her briefs by whichever designer tied the skimpy threads together \u2013 described as &quot;a one-piece consisting of a split-front tie halter top and string thong&quot;. This she accessorised with a vault&apos;s worth of bling, including chunks of precious rock to catch the sun and a snakey bronze bracelet. In one bit of strenuous choreography, Toni gripped Terry&apos;s waist with her knees and dug her heels into his buttocks to anchor herself. People might copulate this way in movies, but I fear for Terry&apos;s lumbar region and I worry about the thong&apos;s abrasion of Toni&apos;s privates. Perhaps because the fans at home were preoccupied by the gallivanting of Ryan Giggs, online commentary was unkind to this display of slippery acrobatics. &quot;Yuck!!&quot; said Victoria from Kent, while Eileen from Ireland spluttered &quot;Pass me the puke bucket!!&quot; Do these contrived tableaux look familiar? They ought to, because this is a path well trodden by footballing philanderers. Last October, Peter Crouch stayed at Le Royal M\u00e9ridien, Dubai, with Abbey Clancy, the model (yes, of lingerie) who was then pregnant with his child. The purpose was expiation, because just after the 2010 World Cup, Crouch had allegedly hired an Algerian prostitute called Monica Mint, in Madrid. Abbey, &quot;devastated&quot; of course, cantered off to an &quot;upmarket equestrian centre&quot;, and was papped as Terry&apos;s Toni, another horse fancier, consoled her in the stables: polo may be the sport of princes, but dressage is the pastime of Wags. Abbey&apos;s fanbase goaded her to dump the love rat, but there were other considerations. Though we think of trophy wives as male possessions, the wives and girlfriends also accumulate trophies, and in their glitzy economy there is probably a fixed price \u2013 like indulgences that the Catholic church used to sell \u2013 for the remission of sins committed with hookers. Abbey forgave Crouch, who took her to Dubai to advertise the fact for the cameras. When they paraded their togetherness on the compulsory beach walk, the striker&apos;s attenuated physique introduced some variants to the Terry-and-Toni formula. On a building site behind them, in the humid murk, skyscrapers with growth hormones mixed into their concrete seemed to vainly attempt to outgrow Crouch; while the Terry brood rode on camels, Crouch and Clancy merely photographed other trippers doing so, since if a camel carrying Crouch had got up from its knees his feet would still be trailing through the sand. The Rooneys were also in Dubai last October, at the Burj Al Arab, a resort whose seven stars reduce Le Royal M\u00e9ridien to a B&amp;B. Rooney wasn&apos;t making amends to Coleen for his reported romps with whores during her pregnancy; his purpose was to hold Manchester United to ransom during contract negotiations. Nevertheless, when they posed in the pool for some supposedly candid photographs, their postures summed up the balance of connubial power. Hydrating herself with some pink fizz at noon (&quot;one glass of wine is \u00a340&quot;, reported The Mirror), Coleen lolls on the poolside above him, perhaps punishing Rooney with a foot that is invisible under the water, while he bobs about like a suppliant castaway who pleads to be allowed on board. Things look more tense between the Coles, holidaying on the Costa del Sol in 2008. The tabloids had documented Ashley&apos;s alleged adulterous forays with seven women, and followers who were dismayed by Cheryl&apos;s clemency (or her venality) nicknamed him Cashley Cole, pointing out that he&apos;d bought a pardon from his wife with a trip to Spain, a bargain-basement destination. This undercut the market in penitence, since the usual requirement is a long-haul flight. All the same, the photograph makes Ashley look like a whipped cur, and Cheryl, advertising her supremacy with a straw cowboy hat, mimes shoving his head below water-level with her hand while her foot gets ready to kick him in the kidneys. In this company of shameless or shoddily remorseful adulterers there is a single exception: the unwed Cristiano Ronaldo. He, too, uses Algarve beaches or swimming pools in Los Angeles and Las Vegas to indulge in what the journalist Mark Simpson calls &quot;sporno&quot;, which is sport redefined as soft porn. Like a mahogany odalisque, Ronaldo arranges himself on a recliner and allows the sun to lap him all over, except for the narrow band covered by his ever more abbreviated shorts; unlike Terry, pinioned by Toni&apos;s tenacious legs, he can do without a female accomplice. Of course Ronaldo needed a member of the opposite sex to help him reproduce a smaller version of himself, but \u2013 like the Holy Spirit renting a virgin womb \u2013 he assigned the biological chore to a surrogate mother, an American waitress whom he recruited with a chat-up line a bit cruder than that used by the angel who announced Mary&apos;s good fortune: &quot;Me, you, let&apos;s fuck,&quot; he is alleged to have said. When his son was born last summer, Ronaldo handed the child over to his own mother, buying the waitress&apos;s agreement to his &quot;exclusive guardianship&quot;. His current girlfriend, the Russian model Irina Shayk \u2013 who, like Vanessa Perroncel and Abbey Clancy, is paid to clamber in and out of underwear \u2013 knew better than to interfere with this experiment in cloning. No dramas of irate betrayal and smoochy forgiveness will ever vex Ronaldo. When he&apos;s on holiday, perched beside a pool and boyishly dangling his legs in the water, an adoring fan may at best be allowed to approach so she can photograph a fantasy.

The business-to-business publisher, which owns titles including Retail Week and events such as Cannes Lions, reported pre-tax profits of \u00a327m for the 12 months to 31 December, according to accounts made available on Friday. The accounts show that in the nine month period to the end of 2009 ,the company made almost an identical amount, \u00a325m, indicating a significant fall in 2010 which included an extra quarter&apos;s trading. The company said that pre-tax profits had been hit by exceptional items totalling \u00a322m, the most notable being a \u00a317m loss for accounting purposes on the sale of Professional Beauty magazine and show. Operating profit came in at \u00a361m for the year, a significant improvement given that in the nine-month period to the end of 2009 the company reported \u00a326m. The accounts do show a direct 12-month comparison of earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, with a fall of almost 10% year-on-year to \u00a385m. Total revenue remained almost flat year-on-year at \u00a3244m thanks to a decline in income in the publishing and conferences divisions being mostly offset by revenue growth in Emap&apos;s Middle East operation, data, and events and exhibitions businesses. Emap Inform, the division home to magazines including Retail Week and Drapers, saw revenues fall by almost 12% year-on-year to \u00a353m. The company said the decline was &quot;wholly attributable&quot; to the impact of government spending cuts on titles in the health and local government sector. Emap added that the raising of paywalls around a number of its magazine websites has led to 20% year-on-year growth in new subscription business, although no further information is given on total numbers. Emap Connect, the exhibition arm which includes events such as Cannes Lions, increased revenues slightly to \u00a378m. The Cannes Lions event \u2014 and associated media awards events such as Dubai Lynx and Spikes in Asia \u2014 are thought to account for more than 20% of the division&apos;s revenues. Conference division Emap Networks was also hit by the spending cuts as delegate numbers dropped with revenues falling from \u00a317m to \u00a314m. Emap data and insight, which includes the retail trend-analysis firm WGSN, increased revenues slightly to \u00a380m. The company had debt of \u00a3564m and cash of about \u00a350m as at 31 December. During the year shareholders bought back and waived \u00a3154.6m of mezzanine debt. &quot;The group operated within its covenant limits at all times during the year under review,&quot; the company said. &quot;The directors continue to forecast that the group will continue to operate within those limits for the forseeable future.&quot; Emap is jointly-owned by Guardian Media Group, publisher of MediaGuardian.co.uk, and private equity company Apax. &quot;Emap&apos;s investment in digital successfully supported top-line revenues in 2010 and is already paying off in terms of profit this year,&quot; said Martyn Hindley, chief financial officer and acting chief executive of Emap.", "title": "Emap pre-tax profit fell in 2010", "sentences": ["The Cannes Lions event \u2014 and associated media awards events such as Dubai Lynx and Spikes in Asia \u2014 are thought to account for more than 20% of the division&apos;s revenues."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-27T08:38:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2011/jun/27/religion-islam", "tags": ["Religion", "Islam"], "article": "The great thing about being in Dubai last week (where I was for a British Council conference on religion and modernity) was being a foreigner once more. It&apos;s how I spent much of my childhood, how I grew up, and how I feel most at home; but it brings professional rewards as well as personal pleasures. I was for the first time in my conscious life in an environment where the most important thing about Muslims was not that they were Muslims. It gave me a moment of sudden awareness, like waking in a log cabin without electricity when all the background hum and tension of electric motors that you never normally hear is suddenly audible by its absence.  The people I was hanging out, and sometimes drinking, with were Muslim intellectuals whom I know and like in England. They&apos;re not in any way discriminated against in this country, as far as I can tell: their lives are not impeded by the kind of people who think that Muslims are a problem to be solved. The kind of crude and open prejudice that flourishes online \u2013 and go and look at comments on the Telegraph website, or the videos of Pat Condell, if you want to know what I mean \u2013 is very rare in liberal circles, and when we catch ourselves at it, we feel guilty.  But there is a more subtle and general sort of prejudice which holds that Condell is not an extremist outcast. Richard Dawkins, for example, has praised Condell, and used to sell his videos on his website, which reminds of the way that Oswald Mosley remained a member in good standing of the English upper classes until the outbreak of the second world war, despite his views on Jews. What I realised in Dubai was that in England today Muslims can&apos;t escape being Muslims, any more than Jews in England in the 20s or 30s could escape being Jewish. They can&apos;t just be unremarkable, as Jews in England can be now.  In Dubai, or neighbouring Sharjah, being a Muslim did not matter in the same way. Obviously, people made a huge amount of fuss about Islam. But when you&apos;re in a room full of Muslim academics and students arguing about culture, or censorship, or why there is so little science in the Arab world, the arguments themselves make one thing wholly plain. Neither side is more Muslim than the other. None of the flaws of the Islamic world are essential or intrinsic to it. They may be widespread, and in some cases quite horrible. But they&apos;re all cultural and not just religious.  I don&apos;t mean by this that all the bad bits are cultural and all the good bits religious. That&apos;s both false and simplistic. Cultures can be both good and bad and both are still authentically Islamic. But the whole idea of an &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;true&quot; way of being Muslim makes little sense when looked at historically, no matter how important, indeed indispensable, that style of argument is between Muslims. The same is of course true about &quot;real&quot; Christianity, or, for that matter, &quot;real&quot; atheism. We don&apos;t have any real difficulty accepting this about Christians in this country. Except for a few noisy bigots, it&apos;s accepted that nice, good Christians are just as Christian as nasty and vile ones: that Jesus would be just as much at home among the Quakers as in Ian Paisley&apos;s congregation; in fact most Guardian readers believe that he would like the Quakers more. Certainly this is true about Jews. No one really believes that Lionel Blue is less Jewish than the chief rabbi (unless the chief rabbi does).  But with Muslims, in Britain today, there is a feeling that the civilised, funny, clever ones aren&apos;t really proper Muslims at all. And don&apos;t think that these civilised, funny, clever people people don&apos;t notice it.  This is subtle and pervasive \u2013 more of a smell than a substance \u2013 and I&apos;m not sure whether it&apos;s a very diluted version of the stench that comes off Condell or Robert Spencer or something essentially different. Either way, it is a smell of which I spend most of my life unaware, and Muslims notice much more often.

Betting on the Eclipse also began in earnest as Coral, the race sponsor, took a bet of \u00a340,000 on So You Think shortly after pricing him up as their 5-4 favourite and immediately cut his odds to even money. Workforce, who won both the Derby and the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe last year, was nudged out to 13-8 (from 6-4), while Snow Fairy, whose four Group One wins last season included the Oaks and Irish Oaks, is 13-2 (from 6-1) to win the Eclipse on her belated seasonal debut. Snow Fairy has not lined up for a race since winning the Hong Kong Cup at Sha Tin in December.

The move came as scores of opposition members met in Damascus, apparently with the government&apos;s sanction, for the first such summit in Syria for decades. Around 150 intellectuals and opposition figures gathered at the Semiramis hotel. Proceedings opened with the national anthem and an homage to those who have died in the three-month uprising across the country in an effort to end more than 40 years of rule by the Assad family. TV channels close to the government aired footage of pro-Assad rallies, waving flags and pictures of the president, outside the hotel. But many opponents, particularly those based abroad, criticised the gathering for going ahead while the government attacks its opponents, at least 1,500 of whom have been killed, according to activists. They also expressed concerns that the conference lent legitimancy to the government. Many young protesters in Syria, who make up the local co-ordination committees, refused to attend. &quot;It is people out of touch jostling for position,&quot; said one female intellectual who stayed away. &quot;We need to come up with solid alternatives.&quot; Those in attendance did not accept the criticism. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter how the government portrays it. We have to get together to talk,&quot; said activist Maan Abdul Salam beforehand. The call for a national dialogue came after President Bashar al-Assad met two visiting westerners, British Conservative MP Brooks Newmark and US congressman Dennis Kucinich, the first such meetings since the uprising began. It was unclear what Newmark&apos;s motivation was. The MP for Braintree in Essex was elected to parliament in 2005, and is a senior government whip, having been foreign affairs whip in 2009-10. The Foreign Office released a statement that he had travelled to Syria without government backing, but added that he had reiterated Britain&apos;s stance on Syria. Asked by CNN, Kucinich declined to discuss what was said at his three-hour meeting on Sunday. The state-run Syrian Arab News agency reported Kucinich and Newmark &quot;expressed keenness on Syria&apos;s security and stability as an essential pillar in the region&quot;. Reaction to the visits and the opposition summit was cautious, with observers suggesting neither was a breakthrough while security forces continued a sustained crackdown. The 10 July summit has also been widely dismissed by the nascent opposition, who refuse to talk until the army is back in barracks. In a speech last Monday, Assad said some 100 people would be chosen, but the body charged with the dialogue, under vice-president Farouk Sharaa, suggested all figures were invited to attend. &quot;What sort of dialogue is it, when the government chooses those it will talk to?&quot; said Fawaz Tello, a signatory of the Damascus Declaration; the declaration signed by 250 oppositionists in 2005 which called the regime &quot;authoritarian&quot;, with the result that 12 were given 2\u00bd-year jail terms in 2008. Meanwhile, Rami Makhlouf, the tycoon cousin of Assad who said he was devoting his businesses to charity, is rumoured to have fled to Dubai last week, where he is believed to own property; this could not be verified. &quot;Makhlouf is the easiest person to seem to be sacrificing, and this could be done simply by telling him to move abroad,&quot; said an analyst in the capital. Meanwhile activists from the local committees said more than 300 students of Aleppo University had been referred for disciplinary action following campus protests, and that gunmen opened fire on protesters in Homs. While the regime enjoys some support, its propaganda has eroded its credibility. During a visit by Sky News, one of few news outlets permitted to enter, under severe restrictions, to a town close to Damascus, a man pushed through Assad supporters to say: &quot;This is just a play put on for you.&quot; Activists say he was later detained.

Thanks to the rain, there was plenty of time to admire the silver and gold trophy for the race and to debate what chance Workforce can possibly have, in light of his stable&apos;s poor run of form. Sir Michael Stoute, his trainer, has saddled 28 runners since his most recent winner and endured a blank Royal Ascot for the first time in 16 years. Many of his horses have run creditably in defeat but it is hardly good news that he has had 10 beaten favourites in the past fortnight. There is no suggestion of a virus in the yard or that Stoute has somehow forgotten how to do the job, so the issue may be more of a puzzle than a cause for concern. That, at any rate, is the view taken by Teddy Grimthorpe, who represents Workforce&apos;s owner, Khalid Abdullah. &quot;Michael is one of the great trainers and he&apos;s not going to send his horses out for Group Ones unless he&apos;s really happy with them,&quot; Grimthorpe said. &quot;We have every confidence in him. This horse has won his only start and that&apos;s quite good form. &quot;We&apos;re very positive. He has trained very nicely, he looks great. All the signs are very decent at this stage. I think he&apos;d like a little bit more rain if we could get it but, other than that, everyone&apos;s very happy with him.&quot; Grimthorpe readily concedes that Workforce will have to step up on the form of his first run this season, when beating Poet in the Brigadier Gerard over the Eclipse course and distance in May. On Saturday, he will face So You Think, whose reputation appears to have survived a defeat at Ascot, as he is now odds-on with all major firms, having been available at evens on Tuesday morning. Asked for his view on So You Think, Grimthorpe said: &quot;I&apos;m with Bart Cummings. He should have stayed in Australia.&quot; Cummings is the Australian trainer who has made no attempt to hide his bitterness since So You Think was sold out of his yard and into that of Aidan O&apos;Brien. But Grimthorpe&apos;s problems do not end with So You Think, as Snow Fairy is now a likely runner in the Eclipse, having been a late withdrawal at the Curragh on Saturday when the going turned soft. Ed Dunlop, her trainer, must satisfy himself that the wasted journey to Ireland has not taken too much out of the filly but the signs are so far upbeat. &quot;She got back on Saturday night,&quot; he says. &quot;We rode her Sunday morning, we cantered her yesterday and today and she seems very well.&quot; Snow Fairy has not been seen in public since winning \u00a3900,000 in the Hong Kong Cup in December, a minor leg injury having prevented her from running in Dubai in March, and Dunlop is anxious to get her season started. If Snow Fairy lines up, this Eclipse may be the first since the famous renewal of 1903, when Ard Patrick beat Sceptre, to feature the winners of the previous year&apos;s Derby and Oaks. Certainly, the track&apos;s researchers have been unable to advise their boss, David McKinnon, of a more recent example. McKinnon reported that ticket sales are 20% ahead of the same stage last year and adds that the track expects to welcome more hospitality guests for Friday&apos;s card than on any day in the past two and a half years. During a long break in play here, his clerk of the course, Andrew Cooper, learned that the circuit a few miles to the south-west had taken 5mm of rainfall, which saved him the trouble of the artificial watering he had planned.

I wouldn&apos;t claim that tennis was my forte but this match is one I&apos;ve been looking forward to \u2013 any chance to watch Fed is one to look forward to. He had to crank up the gears in his last match against Mikhail Youzhny but I had few doubts that he would make his 29th slam quarter-final in succession. They&apos;ve met five times before but not on grass with Federer winning four of them but Tsonga&apos;s form at Queen&apos;s shows how dangerous a booming serve can be on this most unforgiving surface. Just waiting for the Daily Politics to end before I can give you a Royal Box update.  Mac watch: I can&apos;t get his cameo from Curb Your Enthusiasm out of my head this morning, reading the Freak Book in the back of Larry David&apos;s limo. He reckons the biggest chance of an upset today is in this match. Interesting. Jack Nicklaus and Greg Norman are watching on. Roger&apos;s got his tank top on for the net photo op and the knock-up. Sue Barker says Fed trains in Dubai in 110C heat by playing two players simultaneously. Masochism leads to perfection. Remarkable John Inverdale interview with Tsonga in the build-up \u2013 &quot;you frighten a chicken by running up to it and it runs away. You do the same to a lion he eats you. You attack me, I attack you.&quot;  First set: Federer* 1-0 Tsonga Federer chose to serve after winning the toss. Do they still do the toss with a racket, probably not but they did when I went there 20 odd years ago. A jammy net cord gets Tsonga the first point off an underhit return but Federer levels then takes the lead with a beautiful forehand from the baseline to Tsonga&apos;s right and wins the next point on his second serve as Tsonga misjudges the pace. Federer ties up the set comfortably and looks in good nick.  First set: Federer 2-0 Tsonga* Tsonga&apos;s nerves are jangling, approaching the net to volley, nailing the first of a rally then slicing the second into the net. Federer has two break points after Tsonga again hits a routine forehand from the back right of the court into the net then does the same from the left with the first break point. Poor start from Tsonga.  First set: Federer* 3-0 Tsonga Tsonga again finds the net. He&apos;s not even aiming wide and overpowering his shots, simply underhitting everything as if caution has got the better of him. Federe wins to love, the final point won with a lovely sliced forehand. Mike Cassidy writes: &quot;Interesting chicken and lion quote from Tsonga. He may already be regretting appointing Eric Cantona as his media adviser.&quot; Seagulls and trawlers were the first thing that came to my mind, too.  First set: Federer 3-1 Tsonga* Goodness. Nerves always play a part but Tsonga is more Bert Lahr than king of the jungle out there. He moves to 30-0 with a little luck but then can&apos;t get his feet moving when Federert pings one deep to his right and he tamely hits it into the net. He wraps up the final point with more aggression, though, to take the game.  First set: Federer* 4-1 Tsonga Better response from Tsonga but to this layman he seems to momentarily be sacrificing power just to make sure that he gets the ball over the net and makes Federer commit a couple of unforced errors. After losing a referral, he moves to 30-40 when Federer loosely gives him the opportunity but Federer gets back to deuce. Tsonga earns another break point by pushing Federer wide then getting close to the net to volley past him. Federer wakes up and wins the game with a pair of powerful serves that force Tsonga to overhit.  First set: Federer 4-2 Tsonga* Good first point from Tsonga, forcing Federer very wide with his serve then wrongfooting him off the return. Then vintage Federer to win with a sublime lob after a long rally where Federer manoeuvred Tsonga into position with a sadist&apos;s precision. But Tsonga recovers to take the next two points before Federer brings it deuce with a gorgeous volley. Tsonga&apos;s first ace gives him the advantage and Federer pushes it wide of the line on the right to lose the game.  First set: Federer* 5-2 Tsonga Another beautiful stop-volley for Federer&apos;s showreel puts him 15-love up and he gets up to beat Tsonga&apos;s attempt at a lob to backhand smash and go 30-15 ahead, winning the game when Tsonga&apos;s backhand isn&apos;t up to the test.  First set: Federer* 5-3 Tsonga Sorry to sound repetitive and I know it&apos;s early in the game but Federer has this ability to play wonderful shots off his forehand that Tsonga is unable to cope with. Mac thinks Tsonga is lumbering around and there&apos;s truth to that. He looks peculiarly leaden-footed but this isn&apos;t over and he wins points when he comes to the net and wins the game with a lovely return with the ball at foot-level.  First set: Federer* 6-3 Tsonga Tales of the toss from Alec Cochrane: &quot;A few years ago whilst captaining a 9th XI football team, having won the toss and chosen to shoot with the wind behind our backs the ref informed me that they&apos;d changed the rules on the toss and now the winner kicked off, whilst the loser chose ends, apparently in an attempt to simplify the rules. The opposition captain then of course chose to shoot in the direction I wanted to in the first half and sure enough by the time the second half came around the wind had changed direction. I bet they don&apos;t do that in tennis.&quot; Federer wins the game to love off his serve and takes the first set. Cakewalk time unless Tsonga can string together better shots off the baseline with his strong suit near the net.  Second set: Federer 6-3, 0-1 Tsonga* Oh dear. Tsonga begins with a double fault, hitting the net with his first at 137mph. He&apos;s obviously going for it now and does level at 15 all with a booming second serve that caught Federer off guard. One step forward, one step, maybe two back, as Tsonga fails to challenge a call that was in by the baseline and levelled it at 30-30. He then moves in front with his best shot of the match and wins the game.  Second set: Federer* 6-3, 1-1 Tsonga Federer snuffs out Tsonga&apos;s attempts at passing shots when the Frenchman is deep in the court because Tsonga rather telegraphs his intentions, and levels it at 15-all with a beauty of a volley from wide on the left of the court. Simon Watson writes: &quot;Are you sure Federer is playing today? Apparently he was on court on Sunday trying to settle a score\u2026&quot; Murray&apos;s beard suggests the sponsors haven&apos;t been too heavy-handed with him. Federer takes the game.  Second set: Federer 6-3, 1-2 Tsonga* Tsonga is fighting back, trying to take the initiative and succeeding with a biffed double-hand backhand and volley at the net when Federer digs it out. Another double fault brings the game to 40-30, though, as if belief deserts him at the moment he&apos;s proved himself but he rallies to win the game when Federer goes wide.  Second set: Federer* 6-3, 2-2 Tsonga Tom Morgan&apos;s been on: &quot;I&apos;m sure I won&apos;t be the only one to contact you, but Mr Cochrane appears to have had the wool pulled over his eyes. As an amateur ref I can assure him that teams that win the toss still choose ends according to the FA laws. Perhaps the other team was going to buy the referee a pint or two after his game?&quot; A ref hanging around after for beers? Brave soul. Oh I say. Tsonga is pushing Federer more but Fed wins the best point of the match with another crafty volley that clips the net. A last unforced error from Tsonga seals it for Federer.  Second set: Federer 6-3, 2-3 Tsonga* The problem with listening to McEnroe is that any personal judgment seems redundant by comparison. He says Tsonga&apos;s penchant for going big from the back of the court is undoing his better work near the net and he&apos;s right. If he lets Federer move him from side to side he hasn&apos;t got a prayer. What gives him a chance, though, is that serve and he wins the game with a whacking great ace.  Second set: Federer* 6-3, 3-3 Tsonga Special first point of the game and Tsonga, though he loses it when Federer passes him on his backhand side, he went to the net and forced Federer to try a superlative shot. Again, though, he overhits from the baseline and though Tsonga challenges the ball was out by an inch.  Second set: Federer 6-3, 3-4 Tsonga* I think we can say Tsonga has been hopping from foot to foot by the door but he&apos;s come to the party now, winning his service game to love with a beautiful shot from the back right of the court, the type of shot that had been his undoing previously. He&apos;s taking the attack to Federer now. Can he sustain this momentum?  Second set: Federer* 6-3, 4-4 Tsonga Yes, the wallflower no more. Tsonga hits a brilliant backhand winner from the baseline as Federer uses more slice to try and trick the Frenchman into overhitting. More from Alec Cochrane on the kick-off conundrum: &quot;Our club charter said that we had the buy the ref a beer after the game whatever he did. Sounds like the opposition captain pulled the wool over the eyes of both me and the ref with a bribe. I was sure you could choose to kick off or choose ends if you won the toss. What are the rules in tennis, incidentally? I&apos;ve played quite a bit and end choosing is still quite important, especially in March in the park when there are puddles on the concrete.&quot; Aaagh. Then Tsonga, instead of smashing the ball into Federer&apos;s face at the net when he had the opportunity, floats it over his head and out to lose the game.  Second set: Federer 6-3, 4-5 Tsonga* Brilliant crosscourt return from Federe at 30-love down is the best he&apos;s hit all match and then Tsonga volleys off his second serve straight into the net. Federer saw him coming and hit it very low to complicate the shot for Tsonga. Approaching the net, though, in general has worked for Tsonga. Trevor McDonald&apos;s in the crowd. Bong. I used to see him at the Oval almost every year. Tsonga holds his serve.  Second set: Federer* 6-3, 5-5 Tsonga This is Tsonga&apos;s best chance, though difficult, as I think Federer has the edge in a tie-break. Thrilling second point and long rally pust Federe 30-love up when, with Tsonga on the floor after getting his volley in when Federer went down the line, the No3 seed put it into the other half of the court to win. Great tennis. Federer then closes out the game.  Second set: Federer 6-3, 5-6 Tsonga* Tsonga&apos;s big serves are beginning to take their toll on Federer in this set and he moves 40-love ahead but a rotten shot gives Federer a point before Tsonga wins the game when Federer&apos;s volley at full stretch went into the net.  Second set: Federer* 6-3, 6-6 Tsonga Federer aces the first point at the widest possible angle, then the third as well to go 40-love up and serve-volleys to win the game. That game was over in about 55 seconds. Clinical stuff.  Second set: Federer 6-3, 7-6 Tsonga The tie-break begins badly for Tsonga with poor judgment and execution with his volley when more than half the court was open. Federer wins his first two service points to move to 3-love then breaks again with a punishing low backhand shot that Tsonga can&apos;t get back. Tsonga has the initiative on the fifth point and it&apos;s there for him but he slices his cross-court volley into the net. At last Tsonga wins a point with a belter of a top-spun forehand. Then Federer aces to have five set points. Tsonga takes the next two, the last of which is a lovely cross-court drop but it came too late and Federer pushes Tsonga wide with his serve then pounces on the wide-dolly of a return.  Third set: Federer* 6-3, 7-6, 1-0 Tsonga Slight delay while Tsonga was treated for a wasp sting. I took a &quot;comfort break&quot; and Federer won his service to love in quick-fire style.  Third set: Federer 6-3, 7-6, 1-1 Tsonga* Federer creams a one-handed backhand overhead to come back from 30-love down but Tsonga is not cowed and hits a lovely backhand volley winner to move two points ahead once more and then squares the set.  Third set: Federer* 6-3, 7-6, 1-2 Tsonga Tsonga hits a supreme single-handed backhand winner, pure instinct and then moves to 30-love but Federer steps up and wins the next point by shoving Tsonga from side to side and hitting a fine drop. But Federer then misjudges a smash and hits it with the top of his racket. Tsonga has two break points, challenging a serve that was in by a foot after he lost the first one. Federer levels with a fine serve but Tsonga gets the A by his name with a great backhand pass to Federer&apos;s left and breaks with a massive forehand winner that just clips the chalk.  Third set: Federer 6-3, 7-6, 1-3 Tsonga* Is it game on time from now? Tsonga creams the first two points then becomes too casual with the third. he&apos;s played very well since losing his serve in the first set but at crucial points, last game notwithstanding, he has a tendency to execute the shot poorly. When it&apos;s instinctive, though, pushed wide or drawn to the net, he has been devastating.  Third set: Federer* 6-3, 7-6, 2-3 Tsonga Federer moves to 40-love with ease then belts an attempted pass about six feet out before coming back to win. &quot;How many wasp stings have occurred on centre court?&quot; asks Daniel McGrath. I don&apos;t know, but there&apos;s a few bee-stung lips in the Royal Box.  Third set: Federer 6-3, 7-6, 2-4 Tsonga* Graceful little spinning volley from Tsonga after anticipating Federer&apos;s cross-court pass attempt puts the Frenchman 30-love up. Nice delicate touch there again to go 40-15 when Federer&apos;s back-hand slice return is nudged down the line with a deft flick. He wins the game by forcing Federer wide with his serve and the Swiss knocks his return into the net.  Third set: Federer* 6-3, 7-6, 3-4 Tsonga Federer rattles through these service games at a fair old lick, winning that one to love by hitting only six shots.  Third set: Federer 6-3, 7-6, 3-5 Tsonga* Colin Walker is in fine punning form: &quot;I think the wasp got the sport wrong at Wimbledon, he was probably looking for Sting-Pong \u2026 I&apos;ll get my coat.&quot; Out goes Mac to play with Bud Collins on Court One. Enter &quot;Bonking Boris Boom! Boom! Becker&quot; as the British tabloids once called him. Ooh. Double fault from Tsonga to start the game and then a glorious Federer attack, approaching the net to blast a forehand winner. Tsonga pumps his fist when he hits a forehand winner down the line and then levels at 30-all with an ace. He wins the game when Federer clips his return into the net.  Third set: Federer* 6-3, 7-6, 4-5 Tsonga Federer aces with pinpoint placement at only 99mph, the opens up a chance on his forehand to move 30-love up when his serve spits and kicks higher than Tsonga anticipated. Federer ties up the game to love.  Third set: Federer 6-3, 7-6, 4-6 Tsonga* Tsonga serving for the set and he fouls up the first point and the second off his second serve when Federer invites him to hit down the line and get some power on a sliced return and he misses by feet. He was down 30-love in his last service game and won the next point, as he does here with a bit of fortune with a crosscourt shot that clips the net and both players try to lob each other, Federer failing. He then aces, though it&apos;s called out, but his correct challenge levels it at 30-all. Set point comes and goes with an overhit backhand so it&apos;s deuce but he takes advantage with a 133mph serve straight down the centre-line but Federe pings him back with a scorching backhand winner to Tsonga&apos;s right. Advantage France again when Federer hits the net when Tsonga refuses to open up a passing chance. But Federer is fighting like crazy, here, reading and blocking the serve then forcing an error. Ace from Tsonga. An interlude while Thomas Watson brings us this gem: &quot;No! Surely the sport the wasp was looking for was sting-tsong!&quot; And Tsonga wins the set.  Fourth set: Federer* 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 1-0 Tsonga Strong opening service game from Federer won to love after testing Tsonga&apos;s backhand three times in a rally on the last point and Tsonga not thinking he&apos;d do it a fourth but Federer did and passed him.  Fourth set: Federer 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 1-1 Tsonga* Few nuances in that game as Tsonga won to love, too. Pining for my dinner, I&apos;m flagging now. I&apos;ll up my game in the next \u2026 er \u2026 game.  Fourth set: Federer* 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 1-2 Tsonga Sparkling single-handed backhand winner down the line takes Tsonga to 30-love and he wins the next point, too, by manipulating Federer into the right of the court and then spanking a forehand winner past his backhand. Three break points, Federer wins the first, Tsonga loses the second, or rather Federer forces him to with a peach of a serve. Tsonga wins the last break point though after a lengthy rally and opens up a chance of a forehand pass with some massively powerful shots forcing Federer to forego anything other than simply getting it back over the net.  Fourth set: Federer 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 1-3 Tsonga* Is Tsonga&apos;s sheer power starting to take its toll on Federer? It looks that way, with Tsonga bullying the great man in this service game which he wins to love. But Federer always finds a way. DOesn&apos;t he?  Fourth set: Federer* 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 2-3 Tsonga A different approach from Federer \u2013 he was trying to take the pace off the ball with slices so that Tsonga had to force his shots. It worked when the Frenchman&apos;s radar was off but it&apos;s not working now. Then there was an attempt at outmuscling but in this game, though Tsonga plays well, he&apos;s moving Tsonga about to try to exhaust him.  Fourth set: Federer 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 2-4 Tsonga* The BBC informs us that Federer has never lost a five-set match from 2-0 up. Wow. More power from Tsonga, from the serve and in an overhead smash with hang time that takes him to 30-love. A double-handed backhand winner down the line puts the Frenchman 40-15 up but a double fault gives Federer a sniff which he rubs out with an ace.  Fourth set: Federer* 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 3-4 Tsonga Unreturned serves Nos 39, 40 and 41 win that game for Federer quickly.  Fourth set: Federer 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 3-5 Tsonga* BB reckons Tsonga needs to stick to his plan of the last half-hour, using that forehand to push Federer around. Keep being imaginative, is the advice. Thanks to Nanda Kishore in Mooresville North Carolina for this piece of research: &quot;I think BBC might have got it wrong there. I think Fed lost a Davis cup match to Hewitt after being two sets to love up. It&apos;s true that he never lost a grandslam match after being 2-0 up in sets.&quot; And afternoon, Gary Naylor, the alpha and the omega of the MBM, GBG, OBO: &quot;So the man they call Ali has an opponent who floats like a butterfly and has been stung like a bee. But, in terms of the match, I suggest Tsonga is more Leon Spinks to Federer&apos;s Muhammad Ali, as I expect the younger man to outlastthe elder statesman if it goes the distance.&quot; Tsonga&apos;s hitting forehands with such force that he&apos;s almost knocking himself off his feet. Federer makes another couple of unforced errors and then fails to get a return over the net to give Tsonga the game.  Fourth set: Federer* 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 4-5 Tsonga Better from Federer after being stung by Tsonga&apos;s vicious return on the first point. and moving to 40-15 with a sublime backhand volley. His 15th ace wins that game.  Fourth set: Federer 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 4-6 Tsonga* Tsonga serving for the set. Federer challenges the first-point serve but it was in. Then bang, bang, bang, he wins the set with huge serves.  Fifth set: Federer* 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 4-6, 0-1 Tsonga Pippa Middleton is getting some more camera love from the BBC. Tsonga is having a snack. Federer has gone for a &quot;breather&quot;. Here we go with the decider and Tsonga wins the first point with a whipped forehand cross and the second with another scorching groundshot. The upset is on even though he fluffs his diving volley into the net. Two break points come when Federer&apos;s sliced backhand can&apos;t climb over the net and then Tsonga breaks on Federer&apos;s second serve when his crosscourt shot from the baseline doesn&apos;t get over the obstacle.  Fifth set: Federer 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 4-6, 0-2 Tsonga* &quot;To be fair to the BBC,&quot; writes Ian Copestake, &quot;they did say that Federer has never lost a five-set match from 2-0 up \u2026 on grass \u2026 and on a Wednesday.&quot; Thanks for clarifying that, Ian. Tsonga remains on the front foot, chancing his arm and it&apos;s paying off. Federer nabs a point back when Tsonga slams a volley into the net then levels at 30-30 when Tsonga goes long to the right. Tsonga aces, Federer challenges, and it stands but then succesfully challenges the next first-serve that was called in and denies the ace. But Tsonga wins the game with a delightful backhand drop volley.  Fifth set: Federer* 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 4-6, 1-2 Tsonga &quot;Loath though I am to challenge the Naylor,&quot; writes Greg Phillips, another North Catrolina correspondent, &quot;Ali was 36 and out of condition when he fought Spinks the first time. Hardly applies to Federer. I suspect he&apos;ll yank the, erm, Tsongs out of the fire.&quot; Do you ever get the feeling you&apos;re being used as a conduit for fireplace-utensil wordplay? Federer wins that service game without being put under pressure.  Fifth set: Federer 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 4-6, 1-3 Tsonga* Roderick Stewart has a word on the catalyst for Tsonga&apos;s fightback: &quot;Am I right that Tsonga upped his game straight after the wasp sting? Will we now see players antagonising the Wimbledon wasps during warm up?&quot; You are right, Roderick. Should Andy Murray smear his arms in marmalade just to be on the safe side? Huge winner off his forehand from Tsonga to make it 15-15 and then comes his 16th ace. I don&apos;t think Federer has got the time left to turn this around.  Fifth set: Federer* 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 4-6, 2-3 Tsonga Federer starts well, going 40-love up, spoons his attempt at a backhand pass to give away a point then wins the game with a biffer of a smash. Oh dear, what have we started? &quot;Jo-Wilf will be hoping Federer doesn&apos;t pull the Tsongs out of the fire \u2013 that could really scuttle his chances, &quot; writes John sanger.  Fifth set: Federer 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 4-6, 2-4 Tsonga* Tsonga&apos;s 22nd unforced error gives Federer the opening point as he laxly booms his backhand out. An ace equals matters and then he goes ahead before netting with another casually hit backhand to let Federer level. Ace. Nice pattern developing here: Error, ace, error, ace. Federer&apos;s wide pass loses the game.  Fifth set: Federer* 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 4-6, 3-4 Tsonga That last point in the last game should have been challenged by Federer as it was in and he would have been deuce on Tsonga&apos;s serve. I wouldn&apos;t say he&apos;s given up but there was a strange diffidence about him in the last game. Not in this one, though, as he rapidly wins to take a drink and plot the next vital game.  Fifth set: Federer 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 4-6, 3-5 Tsonga* Federer needs to up the ante, say BB and Andrew Castle. But how? Tsonga&apos;s power and athleticism are difficult to pin back and he shows his commitment to winning by getting off the floor straight away when he goes down to make Federer try to pass him out to the right and the Swiss hits it wide. Ian Copestake, take a bow: &quot;I don&apos;t think Tsonga will believe this, but then that&apos;s normal for someone whose name spelt backwards is &apos;agnost&apos;.&quot; Tsonga moves to 40-15 when Federer makes yet another uncharacteristic error, in guaging the angle, then hits his return into the net to hand Tsonga the game.  Fifth set: Federer* 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 4-6, 4-5 Tsonga Do you believe, Jo-Wilfried? Federer moves quickly to 30-love and wins the next point by pushing Tsonga deep behind his baseline on the right. &quot;Federer gives me the impression that he would have his &apos;man&apos; to use tsongs to remove things (possibly marshmellows, but more probably peacock hearts) from the fire, for fear of sullying his perfect monogrammed whites,&quot; writes Justin Spencer. I was Roger Federer&apos;s valet. Federer wins that game but now he&apos;s faced with someone serving for the match. More on the sting from Tom Gardiner: &quot;Surely there must be a suspicion of a Peter Parker type scenario here? Tsonga is going out, gets stung by a wasp and suddenly becomes amazing, with special powers. Who&apos;s Federer in this tale then?&quot; Jerry Seinfeld would know. More a Rentaghost chap myself.  Fifth set: Federer*6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 4-6, 4-6 Tsonga* This is it. Is J-W destiny&apos;s child today. He flipping is you know, showing never-say-die running to win the first point, forces Federer to limply arch his backhand into the net at 30-love then booms his forehand past him. He&apos;s jigging around after winning the first of three set points. Tennis has its bouncy-bouncy-bouncy-bouncy-fun-fun-fun-fun-fun man. Great effort. What a fight back from two sets down. His power forced Federer to look rather passive but so did his attacking instincts and execution. John McEnroe said he though this was the major chance of an upset and the sage was right. Thanks for all your emails. The lion found his courage.

And we women who were in the forest thought people were bringing dinner for them. It was not that.  &quot;They were calling to signal that it was time to rape women in the forest,&quot; says Honorata, a survivor of kidnap, rape and poverty in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where current estimates from The World Bank put the incidence of rape at nearly one per minute or over 400,000 per year.  Extreme poverty forced Honorata to sell salt, soap and other items in the isolated and unstable mining area of Shabunda, South Kivu in eastern Congo, where she was kidnapped by Rwandan rebel forces who illegally control many of the region&apos;s mines. She spent a year in the forest with the Hutu rebels who regularly raped and beat her and the other women they had kidnapped. She eventually managed to escape by walking 300km over a period of a month to the relative safety of Bukavu, a bustling town on the shores of Lake Kivu, bordered by Rwanda. When Honorata arrived, she was rejected by the community as people coming from the forest were known to be rape victims. Rape is stigmatised in the Congo with survivors often rejected by their husbands and cast out by their communities.  A local pastor took her to Panzi hospital where she was introduced to Women for Women International who run training programmes which teach women about their rights, educate them in hygiene and teach them business skills such as tailoring or cooking.  Honorata says this changed her life.  &quot;From the training, we learnt about how a woman can fight for her rights, we were happy to know that we women, even though we were raped, we still have rights. We are useful to society and our households.&quot; Honorata now works as a trainer for Women for Women International and is able to support herself and three of her children.  Her story is not unusual in eastern DRC, which has been destablised as a result of a decade of war sparked off by the 1994 Rwandan genocide which led to an influx of Rwandan Hutu rebels to the region. The rebels or &quot;interahamwe&quot; continue to wreak terror on remote rural mining villages in particular where physical and sexual brutalities go largely unpunished. Professor Jean-Baptiste Ntagoma, dean of the economic faculty at the Catholic University of Bukavu, says the shift from agriculture to mining and the fact that men have been killed or fled due to war, has placed a burden on the women of DRC.  &quot;These women are now chiefs of their households. Being responsible for their households, they have to work for the family survival.&quot; Some are forced into prostitution to make a living as they have few other skills. He says: &quot;If women are so much exploited it is because economically they depend on men. If they could be economically empowered, they could free themselves from this male subjugation.&quot;  Eve Ensler, author of The Vagina Monologues, is the founder of V-Day which - in partnership with the Panzi Hospital Foundation - has built a City of Joy for survivors of sexual violence, many of whom are too poor to move away from the areas where rape is prevalent.  Christine Schuler Deschryver, director of V-Day in the Congo, says: &quot;You have to help to empower the women. When women are not financially independent, then they have to stay. They have nowhere to go.&quot; The City of Joy opened earlier this year and women stay there for six months where they are taught about HIV, family planning, their rights, self-defence and will also receive dance, art and music therapies to help them recover. The centre was built by the Congolese women themselves. Schuler Deschryver says: &quot;I believe and I trust the Congolese women so much. I cannot even pick up the loads they carried to build it. See how strong they are. We will transform all this pain they have into power. &quot;Today I know women who go to Dubai to buy clothes and shoes but they started with fish here in Congo.&quot; But she says there is limited scope for real change unless men too are on board. The City of Joy has a programme called V-Man which will engage Congolese men to join the fight to empower the women of Congo.  WFWI also runs a Men&apos;s Leadership programme and Colonel Flammand Baliwa Ngoy, commander of the police in the district of Uvira, has seen the direct impact of this on his own life after receiving this training. He says: &quot;My wife is a doctor. I said she shouldn&apos;t go to work and that she should stay at home and take care of the children. But after this training, I let my wife work as a doctor again. &quot;There is no man without a woman; the woman is the basis of society.&quot; He has trained 10 men himself and says that 280 policemen in Uvira have now taken part in the programme. A commander in the Congolese army, Major Gaby Musangi, says the training gave him a new found respect for women. &quot;Before the training, we didn&apos;t have any consideration of women. They were considered like pigs, like objects. In our society a women is given less consideration, less regard than men. &quot;Beforehand to pay tuition fees for my children, the priority was given to my sons. But today I pay fees for both my girls and boys equally.&quot; One woman who sees the direct correlation between empowering women and lifting them out of poverty is 43-year-old Marie, who was selected to attend a female entrepreneurship course in DRC&apos;s capital Kinshasa, sponsored by Goldman Sachs.  After the course, Marie started a small business and saved up enough to buy a plot of land for her and her family. Smiling broadly, she says: &quot;Our children have good clothing, they eat well, my capital was improved and I&apos;ve also bought a plot of land where we are going to build a house.  &quot;My husband is also very proud to have a wife who can buy a plot of land for him that he could not afford.  &quot;In the past I was poor but today I am self-reliant.

The main speaker was Prince Turki al-Faisal, one of Saudi Arabia&apos;s best-known and best-connected royals. The audience was composed of senior American and British military officials. The location was RAF Molesworth, one of three bases used by American forces in the UK since the second world war. Now a Nato intelligence centre focused on the Mediterranean and the Middle East, the sprawling compound amid green fields was an ideal venue for the sensitive topics that Turki, former head of Saudi Arabian intelligence, wanted to raise. After an anecdote about how Franklin D Roosevelt was told by a naked Winston Churchill that nothing between them or their countries should be hidden, Turki warmed to his theme: &quot;A Saudi national security doctrine for the next decade.&quot; For the next half an hour, the veteran diplomat, a former ambassador to Washington and tipped to be the next foreign minister in Riyadh, entertained his audience to a sweeping survey of his country&apos;s concerns in a region seized by momentous changes. Like Churchill, Turki said, the kingdom &quot;had nothing to hide&quot;. Even if they wanted to, the leaders of the desert kingdom would have difficulty concealing their concern at the stunning developments across the Arab world. Few \u2013 excepting the vast revenues pouring in from oil selling at around $100 a barrel for much of the year \u2013 have brought much relief to Riyadh. Chief among the challenges, from the perspective of the Saudi royal rulers, are the difficulties of preserving stability in the region when local autocracies that have lasted for decades are falling one after another; of preserving security when the resultant chaos provides opportunities to all kinds of groups deemed enemies; of maintaining good relations with the west; and, perhaps most importantly of all, of ensuring that Iran, the bigger but poorer historic regional and religious rival just across the Gulf from Saudi Arabia&apos;s eastern provinces, does not emerge as the winner as the upheavals of the Arab spring continue into the summer. &quot;The [Saudi king], crown prince and government cannot ignore the Arab situations, we live the Arab situation and hope stability returns,&quot; the al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper quoted Prince Nayef, the second in line to the throne and minister of the interior, as saying in Riyadh last week. The prince, known as a conservative, went on to add that the possibility &quot;of interference to prolong the chaos and killing between the sons of the Arab people \u2026 could not be discounted&quot;. Iran, a majority Shia state committed to a rigorous and highly politicised Islamist ideology, remains at the heart of such fears in Saudi Arabia, a predominantly Sunni state ruled by the al-Saud family since its foundation in 1932. Recent moves such as the Saudi-inspired invitation to Morocco and Jordan, both Sunni monarchies, to join the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a group of Sunni autocratic states, are seen by analysts as part of Riyadh&apos;s effort to bolster defences against Tehran. So too is the deployment of Saudi troops under the umbrella of the GCC to Bahrain, where largely Shia demonstrators took to the streets to demand greater democratic rights from the Sunni rulers. One fear in Riyadh is that the 15% or so of Saudi citizens who are Shia \u2013 and who largely live in the oil-rich eastern province \u2013 might mobilise in response to an Iranian call to arms. &quot;It is a kind of ideological struggle,&quot; said a Ministry of Interior official. Describing Iran as a &quot;paper tiger&quot; because of its &quot;dysfunctional government \u2026 whose hold on power is only possible if it is able, as it barely is now, to maintain a level of economic prosperity that is just enough to pacify its people&quot;, Turki, according to a copy of his speech at RAF Molesworth obtained by the Guardian, said the rival state nonetheless had &quot;steel claws&quot;, which were &quot;effective tools \u2026 to interfere in other countries&quot;. This Tehran did with &quot;destructive&quot; consequences in countries with very large Shia communities such as Iraq, which Turki said was taking a &quot;sectarian, Iranian-influenced direction&quot;, as well as states with smaller ones such as Kuwait and Lebanon. Until Iraq changed course, the former intelligence chief warned, Riyadh would not write off Baghdad&apos;s $20bn (\u00a312.5bn) debts or send an ambassador. More worryingly for western diplomats was Turki&apos;s implicit threat that if Iran looked close to obtaining nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia would follow suit, threatening a nuclear war between the two powers. &quot;Iran [developing] a nuclear weapon would compel Saudi Arabia \u2026 to pursue policies which could lead to untold and possibly dramatic consequences,&quot; Turki said. A senior adviser told the Guardian that it was &quot;inconceivable that there would be a day when Iran had a nuclear weapon and Saudi Arabia did not&quot;. &quot;If they successfully pursue a military programme, we will have to follow suit,&quot; he said. For the moment, however, the prince told his audience, &quot;sanctions [against Iran] are working&quot; and military strikes would be &quot;counterproductive&quot;. One alternative, Turki told his audience, would be to &quot;squeeze&quot; Iran by undermining its profits from oil, explaining that this was something the Saudis, with new spare pumping capacity and deep pockets, were ideally positioned to do. Money has long been a key foreign policy tool for Saudi Arabia. Turki&apos;s speech reveals the extent to which the kingdom is relying on its wealth to buy goodwill and support allies. In Lebanon, to counter Syrian influence and the Shia Hezbollah movement, the kingdom has spent $2.5bn (\u00a31.6bn) since 2006. Several billion more will reach the Palestinians, either directly or via the Palestinian Authority, Turki said. Then there is the $4bn (\u00a32.5bn) in unconditional &quot;grants, loans and deposits to Egypt&apos;s emerging government&quot;, which &quot;stand in stark comparison to the conditional loans that the US and Europe have promised&quot;. This was an indication of the &quot;contrast in values between the kingdom and its western allies&quot;, the prince said. The aim of such expenditure \u2013 only a fraction of the state&apos;s $550bn (\u00a3343bn) reserves \u2013 is to minimise any potential ill-will towards Saudi Arabia among populations who have deposed rulers backed previously by Riyadh. King Abdullah, who has ruled Saudi Arabia since 2005, initially backed long-term ally Hosni Mubarak, reportedly personally interceding on his behalf with President Barack Obama. &quot;The calculation in Riyadh is very simple: you cannot stop the Arab spring so the question is how to accommodate the new reality on the ground. So far there is no hostility to the Saudis in Tunisia, Egypt or elsewhere, popular or political,&quot; said Dr Mustafa Alani, from the Gulf Research Centre, Dubai. One difficult issue is that of the &quot;unwanted house guests&quot;. Saudi Arabia has a long tradition of offering a comfortable retirement home to ex-dictators, and two of the deposed leaders \u2013 Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia and Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen \u2013 are now in the kingdom. Ben Ali is reported to have been housed in a villa on the Red Sea coast. Saleh is in a luxury hospital receiving treatment for wounds caused by the bomb that forced his flight from the country he ruled for 21 years as president, and is now under pressure from his hosts to retire permanently. Other regional rulers are being gently pressured to ease crackdowns, in part in response to western outcry over human-rights abuses, one official said. Yemen, however, remains a major security concern to the Saudis, who worry about the presence of Islamic militants and Shia rebels who, again, they view as proxies of Iran. &quot;It is very important to make sure Yemen is stable and secure and without any internal struggle,&quot; said one Interior Ministry official. In his speech in the UK, Turki worried that Yemen&apos;s more remote areas had become a safe haven for terrorism comparable to Pakistan&apos;s tribal areas. Along with money, religion too has been used as a weapon of Saudi foreign policy. Since 1986, Saudi kings have used the title of custodian of the two holy mosques \u2013 Mecca and Medina \u2013 and &quot;as such [the kingdom] feels itself the eminent leader of the wider Muslim world&quot;, said Turki. Iran challenges this claim. One key western concern has long been the export of rigorous and sometimes intolerant strands of Islam. Between the 1979 Iranian revolution and the 9/11 attacks, this was seen as a key part of Saudi foreign policy. It also served to placate clerical establishment internally. In the last decade, a major effort has been made to cut back funding for extremism abroad. The results, government spokesmen admit, are sometimes mixed. Senior Saudi charity officials told the Guardian that their work was not only &quot;non-political&quot; but also avoided any attempt to spread Wahhabism, as the puritanical Saudi strands of Islamic practice are often known, too. &quot;We follow the wishes of local communities and never get involved in politics. We are a purely humanitarian organisation, said Dr Saleh al-Wohaibi, the secretary-general of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth (Wamy), a Riyadh-based NGO engaged in relief work and development assistance across the Islamic world, which has been accused of funding extremism. However, al-Wohaibi confirmed Wamy had built thousands of religious schools in countries such as Pakistan. Since 9/11, he said, donations from within Saudi Arabia had reduced considerably. At mosques in Riyadh last week, religious students said they hoped to travel overseas as soon as possible. &quot;It is our duty to help other countries all over the world to improve their practice of Islam and [to improve] the image of Saudi Arabia,&quot; said Abdalillah al&apos;Ajmi, 18, after evening prayers at the al-Rajhi mosque in Riyadh. In his speech at Molesworth, Turki simply referred to Islam playing &quot;a central \u2026 role&quot; in ensuring Saudi security in the years to come. &quot;Saudi Arabia is \u2026 the birthplace of Islam \u2026. Iran portrays itself as the leader of not just the Shia world but of all Muslim revolutionaries interested in standing up to the west,&quot; he said. A Saudi bomb? Julian Borger Diplomatic editor Prince Turki al-Faisal&apos;s remarks reflect alarm at the progress of Iran&apos;s nuclear programme and eroding confidence in the protective umbrella of Saudi Arabia&apos;s longstanding ally, America. In 2003, as its forces got bogged down in Iraq and the US began to look vulnerable, the Saudi government laid out three alternatives for itself: build its own bomb, shelter under someone else&apos;s, or agree a Middle East nuclear-free zone. Tentative talks on a zone are underway with a view to a UN-chaired conference next year, but few observers believe Israel would surrender its nuclear arsenal or that Iran would halt its programme. As for its own weapon, Saudi Arabia has declared it will spend $300bn on 16 nuclear reactors, for which it is about to open bids. But they would be turnkey projects with safeguards making it almost impossible to use the fuel to make weapons. Building a Saudi bomb would require starting a uranium enrichment programme from scratch. Even with unlimited resources that would take years. In the short term, Saudi Arabia could look to other states. Since the Arab spring, the monarchy has become disillusioned with Washington&apos;s capacity to defend it. Instead, it may see its best option for a rapid response (to an Iran nuclear test, for example) as Pakistan. Saudi Arabia is reported to have an &quot;option&quot; on Pakistan&apos;s nuclear capability, in return for financing Pakistan for decades. And the US would find it hard to stop such destabilising nuclear co-operation. Its influence with both the Pakistanis and the Saudis has frayed considerably.", "title": "Saudi Arabia worries about stability, security and Iran", "sentences": ["So far there is no hostility to the Saudis in Tunisia, Egypt or elsewhere, popular or political,&quot; said Dr Mustafa Alani, from the Gulf Research Centre, Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-29T18:06:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/29/sister-exiled-thailand-female-pm", "tags": ["Thailand", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "World news", "Dubai", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Songwan Khomwang has never voted before, but it did not take the 19-year-old long to pick a candidate for next Sunday&apos;s general election. &quot;I would like a woman to lead the country,&quot; she declared, as her choice roused a cheering crowd of thousands in a dusty field in the north-eastern district of Sikhoraphum. &quot;I&apos;ve seen too many men in power.&quot; Yingluck Shinawatra, 44, could become Thailand&apos;s first female prime minister. But that is not her sole attraction, conceded her admirer: &quot;I hope if she gets in she will bring back Thaksin.&quot; When the Puea Thai party unveiled the youngest sister of the exiled former Thai leader as its candidate, most people thought it would play into hands of the incumbent Democrats. Now the decision looks like a masterstroke, because Yingluck is putting a fresh, attractive, feminised face on her brother&apos;s brand. &quot;Thaksin thinks, Puea Thai acts,&quot; is one party slogan, while the billionaire Thaksin described his sister as &quot;not my nominee but my clone&quot;. He later said he meant they shared the same ideas and attitudes. She is surrounded by his aides and advisers. But even living 3,000 miles away in Dubai, Thaksin \u2013 who won two landslide election victories but was ousted in a 2006 coup \u2013 remains a bitterly divisive figure in Thailand. His supporters paint him as a champion of the rural underclass, who was toppled for challenging the elite establishment; his opponents say he was corrupt and authoritarian. He was convicted on corruption charges in absentia after he fled the country. &quot;I feel Yingluck basically follows in the footsteps of Thaksin, maybe because of her team,&quot; said rice farmer Thaitun Piwon. &quot;[But] I think because she is a woman she will listen to all sides.&quot; The political newcomer has zoomed ahead in the polls, while the Democrats have stalled. Sidestepping demands for a debate with the incumbent, Abhisit Vejjajiva \u2013 where her inexperience might have become more evident \u2013 Yingluck has sprinted through her tightly managed campaign with a permanent, dazzling smile on her lips, a relentlessly positive message and a string of ambitious spending pledges to improve rural life. On Tuesday she zipped through eight speeches in three provinces in the north-east, a party stronghold. Crowds, tens of thousands strong, thrust red roses towards the stage and cheered as she ran through a string of popular themes, such as soaring food prices \u2013 and her brother. Her inexperience is being touted as an asset: &quot;I believe at this time people don&apos;t want me to be acting as a politician. I can use my experience from management,&quot; she said. She insisted that Thaksin would not pull the strings if she became prime minister: &quot;Of course I have leadership and management and will make decisions. [But] why do we have to reject good ideas from him? It doesn&apos;t mean we have to rely on him ... the role he will play will be supporter.&quot; Thaksin&apos;s critics say he is running the party from exile and plotting his return; he has said he would like to return for his daughter&apos;s wedding this year. Yingluck refused to rule out an amnesty, repeatedly touted by Puea Thai colleagues. &quot;Our priorities are, first, to solve the economic problems and, second, reconciliation to make Thailand united as one,&quot; she said. &quot;Reconciliation means we need to discuss it with every party involved ... If a committee decides to do that, my brother would be just one [person involved], the same as everyone else. We don&apos;t have any policy specially for my brother.&quot; Even if Puea Thai tops the poll, it may not become the government; without an outright majority, it will have to scramble to form a coalition with minor parties. Opponents have already floated perjury claims against Yingluck \u2013 which she denies \u2013 in relation to the seizure of Thaksin&apos;s assets. Others believe the military may step in again; Thailand has seen more than a dozen coups in eight decades. Earlier this month, the army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha urged voters to back &quot;good people&quot; who &quot;know what is right and wrong&quot;, warning: &quot;If you allow the election [outcome] to be the same as before, you will not get anything new.&quot; Puea Thai is thought to have approached the military to discuss a possible deal. &quot;I don&apos;t think we will have this kind of problem [a coup] occur,&quot; Yingluck said. Analysts fear the election is more likely to lead to fresh conflict than the reconciliation Yingluck promises.", "title": "Exiled Thai leader's sister poised to become country's first female PM", "sentences": ["But even living 3,000 miles away in Dubai, Thaksin \u2013 who won two landslide election victories but was ousted in a 2006 coup \u2013 remains a bitterly divisive figure in Thailand."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-29T19:03:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/jun/30/christine-lagarde-women-progress-politics", "tags": ["Christine Lagarde", "Women in politics", "Gender", "Women", "Politics", "World news", "Thailand", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Economics", "Global economy", "Business", "Dilma Rousseff", "Michelle Bachelet", "Margaret Thatcher", "Mary Wollstonecraft", "Marine Le Pen", "Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Good news or bad that Yingluck Shinawatra may be elected the next prime minister of Thailand? She would be the first woman to hold the post in Bangkok, though not the first member of her family. Brother Thaksin is in exile in Dubai. You may not be a student of Thai politics, a dozen military coups in eight decades and huge unrest since the ousting of Thaksin, who presented himself, so Tania Branigan points out, as a champion of the rural underclass, not the corrupt authoritarian plutocrat seen by his enemies. But Sunday&apos;s election in Thailand does have wider resonance in gender politics. The Guardian&apos;s Zoe Williams frets in her column today about Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister getting Dominique Strauss-Kahn&apos;s job at the IMF. She suspects Lagarde is &quot;the Beyonc\u00e9 of international finance&quot; \u2013 by which I think Zoe means she&apos;s a Tory \u2013 though she comes to the sensible conclusion that women have as much right to be as varied, idiotic and selfish in their politics as blokes can be and that the presence of women in politics can (and do) achieve a lot of low profile cross-party good for women&apos;s issues. I&apos;m sure that&apos;s right. All the same it&apos;s fascinating to watch. Thais hope/fear that sister Yingluck will pardon brother Thaksin and bring him home where his entourage is already providing much of her advice within the Pheu Thai party. Yep, that sounds likely. She is &quot;not my nominee but my clone&quot;, says Thaksin. Cast you mind back to the splendidly-named Laura Chinchilla&apos;s victory, a landslide in February, to become first elected woman president of tiny Costa Rica, Panama&apos;s neighbour and long the most decent of the central American micro-republics. As Rory Carroll noted at the time: &quot;She followed Argentina&apos;s Cristina Kirchner, elected in 2007, Chile&apos;s Michelle Bachelet, elected in 2006, Panama&apos;s Mireya Moscoso, elected in 1999, and Nicaragua&apos;s Violeta Chamorro, elected in 1990.&quot; And, of course, the biggest of them all, Dilma Rousseff, got elected president of Brazil in January, an ex-leftwing guerilla from a wealthy background. She is protege of the trade union president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva just as Chinchilla was promoted by \u00d3scar Arias, the ex-president whose receipt of the Nobel peace prize (for helping reconcile Nicaragua and El Salvador) was announced the very day I flew into his capital, San Juan. A lot of cars horns were being blown. Every case is different. Chamorro&apos;s husband was a prominent anti-Sandinista newspaper owner, murdered in 1978, when she stepped into the breach. Argentina&apos;s Kirchner is a former first lady whose husband, Nestor \u2013 he died last year \u2013 was routinely accused of pulling the strings. At least in Argentina that card can be played both ways since Evita Per\u00f3n \u2013 of musical fame \u2014 used to be regarded as the brains behind her husband, Juan. So everywhere \u2013 from Iceland to conservative Switzerland, where they have had two elected women presidents despite only getting the vote in 1971 \u2013 the case is different; some women running on their husbands/brother&apos;s reputation, a barely disguised surrogate, others doing it by talent, judgment and good luck: dynasty v meritocracy, as usual. This is surely most striking in south and east Asia where \u2013 in highly conservative Muslim countries like Pakistan, less so Bangladesh or Indonesia \u2013 women have been prime minister. India, Sri Lanka \u2013 now perhaps Thailand \u2013 and of course Cory Aquino  (another political martyr&apos;s widow) won the disputed battle against Ferdinand Marcos, old and corrupt, in 1986. I was there for that one too. But Asia&apos;s gender politics tend to be dynastic. Women leaders are usually related to male politicians, they are part of the family. When I recently discussed women in Chinese politics with a chum in Beijing I was told they have not cracked the bamboo ceiling \u2013 do we count Madame Mao or Madame Chiang Kai Shek? \u2013 though some Chinese women have done VERY well in business. Why? Because business often equals family and people are used to women running family businesses in China and the wider diaspora. But remember, Mike, a lot of Chinese baby girls still get aborted and it&apos;s OK to advertise for pretty women of 25 (and even specify bra cup size) in the jobs market. Still a long way to go then. I can&apos;t see much of a downside in Lagarde&apos;s promotion. Apart from the obvious fact that she&apos;s unlikely to harass chambermaids (alleged) she&apos;s clearly smart and an Anglophone who is well travelled and thus a broader\u2013minded representative of the French than many. OK, so she&apos;s a Tory, but also a meritocrat. Strauss-Kahn&apos;s lifestyle was, I suspect, rather grander and less democratic. She will misbehave in her own way. Watch out, Greeks! Yet the odd thing is that in the mature democracies of the west you can spot dynasticism mingling with the meritocracy, more than one would have predicted when universal suffrage emerged a century ago. Such as? Well, there&apos;s Marine Le Pen, daughter of Jean Marie, running for president of France next year and \u2013 a bit more reluctantly \u2013 Martine Aubry, whose dad, Jacques Delors, used to frighten British Tories as the only charismatic European politician they&apos;d heard of. Anywhere else? Well, the Mussolinis seem to have gone quiet in Italy, though Silvio Berlusconi&apos;s sense of sexual rectitude is so great that it&apos;s safe for one of his daughters to be around to advise him. There&apos;s Hillary Clinton, of course \u2013 her husband would have pulled strong too, they claimed, though I doubt he&apos;d have got too far. Even here, didn&apos;t Jim Callaghan&apos;s daughter, Margaret (Lady Jay) end up in the Blair cabinet? She did. There have been plenty of wives and daughters in the Commons in my time \u2013 though also sons: think four generations of Benns. And perhaps that&apos;s the point. Dynasticism in the Republic of Ireland is so pronounced that at the March elections this year the newspapers published family trees to show how seats were handed down from generation to generation just like the rotten boroughs of old England. How can that happen under the saintly single transferable vote (STV), I hear you ask. Don&apos;t get me started. I happen to have been reading Claire Tomalin&apos;s tremendous 1974 biography of Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797) whose life is an extraordinary saga of courage, disappointment (inevitably she fell badly for a cad) and determination. Would the author of the Vindication of the Rights of Women been impressed with the progress she would have found today? You bet she would, though she would probably have wanted to dash off to Paris \u2013 as she so boldly did in the dangerous year of 1793 \u2013 to give Lagarde a general hangbagging over cuts and how they affect women&apos;s lives. But Mary \u2013 as I now think of her \u2013 would not have left Margaret Thatcher, Tory or no, off an official government list of high-achieving British women, as Harriet Harman did in office. Naughty Hattie. But as Zoe Williams says women behaving badly is their right as it is the blokes&apos;. There&apos;s a TV sit-com in that. Well, er, perhaps we&apos;re not ready for it yet.", "title": "Christine Lagarde \u2013 Would Mary Wollestonecraft be impressed? | Michael White", "sentences": ["Brother Thaksin is in exile in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-30T10:47:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/30/saudi-arabia-not-egypt-reform", "tags": ["Saudi Arabia", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "The Bridges bookshop and cafe, on Arafat Street in an upmarket residential area of the southern Saudi port city of Jeddah, is quiet this weekend afternoon. Three young women sit on the floor working on a 13,000-piece jigsaw. Among the well-thumbed books for browsing on the artfully slanted shelves, next to works on Islamic calligraphy and architecture, are biographies of Mahatma Gandhi, Che Guevara and Nelson Mandela. Yet Asma, Amna and Dina, all 23, are no revolutionaries. As educated, English-speaking, iPod and iPad-carrying young Arabs, they are very much in the same demographic as those who organised the mass demonstrationprotests that ended the rule of President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt this year, but the three women are separated from their counterparts in Cairo by more than the Red Sea. Images of the Arab spring streaming into Saudi Arabia on the ubiquitous satellite TV channels may have meant that &quot;people are realising the importance of being politically aware&quot;, Amna, a human resources management student, says. But, in the kingdom, &quot;we don&apos;t actually do anything&quot;. Such feelings explain, at least in part, why, while the rest of the Arab world is in ferment, Saudis, of whom 70% are under 30 and 35% are under 16, have remained largely quiet. Despite overseas attention focused on a few incidents of protest, scores of interviews over two weeks in deeply conservative areas, the capital, Riyadh, and relatively liberal Jeddah have revealed a country in which a growing desire for reform is a very long way from anything approaching mass dissent. &quot;Saudi Arabia is simply a very different society from Egypt, Tunisia or Syria,&quot; says Dr Mustafa Alani, an analyst at the Gulf Research Centre, Dubai. Defiance of custom There is activism. The women working on the jigsaw are all involved in campaign groups, arguing for the right for women to vote in forthcoming municipal elections. Dina, who recently returned to Saudi Arabia after four years at a US college, says &quot;nobody was doing much campaigning&quot; when she left but now &quot;lots is going on&quot;. Last month, several dozen women openly drove cars in defiance of custom, if not law. &quot;We cannot be a global leader and a medieval backwater at the same time,&quot; declared one headline in the reformist Arab News newspaper. There is also an increasingly vocal community of human rights activists, bloggers and tweeters. &quot;Something is happening every week. Activism was not really in the social fabric here but, compared to five years ago, things are really picking up,&quot; says Mohammed al&apos;Qahtani, a prominent human rights campaigner. Long-term observers of the kingdom \u2013 diplomats and analysts \u2014 agree. Yet anyone hoping for major upheaval soon is likely to be disappointed. The word that recurs in Saudi Arabia is &quot;gradual&quot;. The increase in activism is relative and demands remain modest. &quot;We are asking to be allowed to drive,&quot; says Eman al-Nafjan, a female PhD student and blogger in Riyadh. Any activism remains within very tightly constrained bounds in this still fiercely conservative country. The present ruler, King Abdullah, is known as more moderate on many issues than many predecessors and many other senior royals. He has tacitly encouraged campaigns for women&apos;s rights. His own decision to moderate the strict policy of gender segregation at the huge new research university he has had built on the outskirts of Riyadh enraged local conservatives. In much of the kingdom, women remain heavily veiled even inside a private home if there is an unrelated man present, and single men are banned from shopping malls. There are very clear rules about what criticisms can be voiced within the kingdom. These are so widely understood they do not have to be enforced. Social issues such as bureaucratic incompetence, poverty and corruption can be denounced but only as long as the authority and integrity of the house of Al Saud are not questioned. Widespread anger at graft is thus rarely voiced, even if, as the jigsaw solvers put it, &quot;the ceiling on what can be said has risen a lot&quot;. So an academic who posted an article imagining Saudi Arabia without the royal family on his Facebook page was jailed for three months. So too, in February and March, were hundreds of Shia demonstrators from the kingdom&apos;s eastern oil-rich areas within whose community there is deep resentment at continuing discrimination. The unpredictability of the far from monolithic authorities also acts as a deterrent. In May, several female drivers were detained, one for 10 days, yet no action was taken against about 40 women who drove two weeks ago. Officials &quot;decided it was better to let their families deal with them&quot;, according to General Mansour al-Turki, a spokesman for the interior ministry. But this week, religious police arrested five. The greatest severity is reserved not for &quot;liberals&quot; \u2013 though harassment is continual \u2013 but for Shia activists accused of links to Iran, and political Islamists whose organisation, ideology and criticism of the religious legitimacy of Saudi rulers are seen as extremely dangerous. &quot;The basic watchword is that reforms are to be granted by the king, not won through agitation, organisation and direct action,&quot; says one Riyadh-based analyst. &quot;You can make your views known \u2013 there is a traditional right of audience and petition which is upheld \u2013 but that&apos;s it.&quot; Many Saudis do not merely accept this, but welcome it. &quot;It has to be remembered that the royal family are sitting on top of the most conservative society in the region, if not the world, and democracy is a foreign word, whatever is happening elsewhere [in the region],&quot; says a second western Riyadh-based observer. The 87-year-old king remains popular, seen as a grandfatherly patriarch, despite the frequent complaints about his thousands of relatives. Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent reformist journalist, stresses how the rule of the house of Al Saud is seen as maintaining the cohesion of a relatively new country containing many different communities. &quot;Egypt has sometimes been smaller or bigger but has not been divided for thousands of years. The Egyptians have their identity,&quot; says Khashoggi. &quot;Saudis did not take to the streets demonstrating for change [because] they knew they could never agree. We all want a better country. Some want a more liberal country, some a more conservative country. But we all want a united country.&quot; Others point to the lack of tradition of public protest \u2013 political gatherings or parties are illegal \u2013 to explain why there has been no &quot;Saudi summer&quot; after the Arab spring. There is also the clergy&apos;s support for the royals by the clergy in this deeply religious country. In March, senior clerics dutifully issued a fatwa, religious opinion, stating that it was un-Islamic to demonstrate. &quot;Here, there is no pretence. We know we do not choose the king. There are no fake promises of democracy,&quot; says Khashoggi. Shared wealth Finally, there is the simple fact that most Saudis are much better off than they were only a few decades ago. The heady rush of the fabulous wealth of the 1970s may be gone, but oil revenue, inflated by recent high prices, still provides vast funds. There are big problems with housing in Saudi Arabia, and youth unemployment is estimated at 30%, but there are also subsidised utilities, a vast range of benefits and huge numbers of easy government jobs with generous pensions. Universities are free, with students paid a monthly stipend. Taxes are minimal. In March the king announced $130bn (\u00a381bn) worth of new homes and public sector pay rises. Poverty exists. Turki Faisal al-Rasheed, a businessman and campaigner in Riyadh, calculates that, though 80,000 individuals are worth more than $250m, 3 million are very poor. Starting salaries for teachers are below $6,000, barely a living wage. There are even occasional beggars. But most Saudis, if not the 9\u00a0million foreign labourers who do much of the menial work, are at the very least comfortable. This may eventually change. &quot;At the moment, the macro-economic picture is just fine, but in the long term something has to give,&quot; warns John Sfakianakis, chief economist at the Banque Saudi Fransi in Riyadh. By 2020, the Saudi population will be 35 million, with huge energy demands of its own. Even Saudi oil revenues will not be enough to sustain the current lifestyle of most. Its leaders are aware of the need for economic reforms, particularly to create jobs for Saudis rather than foreigners, in the private sector. One recent measure was a royal decree to allow women to work in shops serving other women. &quot;We have to create jobs and to shift the economy into a higher level of productivity, more technology and knowledge-driven and less dependent on oil,&quot; Dr Abdul Wahed al-Humaid, the vice-minister of labour, says. One effort involves scholarships worth \u00a320,000 per year for more than 100,000 young Saudis studying overseas, often in the US. A huge new university for women \u2013 the biggest in the world \u2013 has just opened. One aim is to stimulate creative, independent thinking, which, Humaid admits, may make young Saudis question authority, particularly if there are economic problems, question authority. &quot;With the internet and satellite television, the social change has already taken place,&quot; the minister says. For the moment, however, any real challenge to the house of Al Saud or indeed to the country&apos;s strict conservatism appears a distant prospect, whatever is happening in the rest of the region. &quot;Change will come \u2013 it&apos;s got to come \u2014 but it will be at a pace which suits our society,&quot; says Miteb, 23, recently returned from college in California. The women drivers have been careful to be veiled and accompanied by a family member, as customs demand. Amna stresses how the Bridges bookstore is somewhere to debate and meet but not to challenge social values. Though sexes mix there in a way that would shock some, she and her friends still wear the long black abaya gown. &quot;People are always trying to categorise liberals and conservatives. It&apos;s more complicated. You can be both at the same time but in different ways,&quot; she says. &quot;But we definitely want more for our kids than we have.&quot; In numbers Population 27.1m Riyadh 4.725m Jeddah 3.234m Mecca 1.484m Medina 1.104m Ad Dammam 902,000 Life expectancy 74.11 Male 72.15 Female 76.16 GDP per capita $24,200 GDP growth rate 3.7% Oil production 9.764m barrels a day (2009 est.)

The failure of the TMX deal - the latest collapsed merger between global exchanges - is another embarrassment for LSE bosses, including chief executive Xavier Rolet. And it may prompt the likes of Nasdaq OMX, the Hong Kong, Singapore or Australian exchanges, to make an approach. Analysts at UBS said:  We believe that there is a good chance of a Nasdaq approach. Hostile deals have a high failure rate in exchanges. We believe there is sufficient scope for cost synergies for Nasdaq to offer up to 1150p, a 22% premium on current share price while maintaining sufficient earnings accretion for their shareholders to support the deal.  Two of the LSE&apos;s shareholders would be key to any deal. Borse Dubai holds nearly 21% of the LSE, while the Qatar Investment Authority has 15.1%, although both are sitting on hefty losses on their stakes which could make them reluctant to back any bid they perceive as too low. LSE shares ended 105p higher at \u00a310.61. Overall leading shares moved sharply higher for the fifth day running, the market&apos;s best run since the end of May, as the Greek parliament successfully passed a second vote on the government&apos;s crucial austerity measures. With a better than expected Chicago purchasing managers&apos; survey lifting Wall Street, the FTSE 100 finished 89.76 points higher at 5945.71. The leading index has added almost 250 points since Monday. Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist, City Index commented:  This week has seen a return of risk appetite amongst investors, with confidence gained by the positive steps made by Greece&apos;s lawmakers to cut debt, and the unity seen in the eurozone, particularly that of French and German banks to help the troubled country. [But tomorrow] there is a chance that investors could use the final session of the week as an excuse to cash in some gains ahead of the weekend.   Banks were boosted by the Greek news, and by the strategy update from Lloyds Banking Group, up 4.345p to 49p, which included confirmation of 15,000 job cuts. Royal Bank of Scotland rose 1.7p to 38.46p amid talk of an Australian disposal. Insulation specialist SIG added 3.5p to 136.5p on talk of a possible bid from French cement and aggregates business Lafarge. Vedanta Resources rose 62p to \u00a320.94 after it appeared the Indian government had finally approved its acquisition of a majority stake in Cairn Energy&apos;s business in the country. Cairn climbed 8.5p to 414.8p. Elsewhere Glencore closed 4.45p higher at 491p after Credit Suisse said the company planned to move from quarterly to half yearly reporting. Traders said this would avoid problems with reporting the figures of its associate Xstrata before the mining group issued the figures itself, as effectively happened recently. Credit Suisse also said, after a meeting with Glencore, that acquisitions were likely using the commodity trader&apos;s shares following its recent float. It said;  The company is always assessing a number of options and will continue to avoid competitive sales processes. On Xstrata management believe there are value benefits (mainly through marketing synergies) to putting the two companies together but it would not comment on potential likelihood or timing of a combination.  In our view potential targets include privately held agriculture player Louis Dreyfus and ENRC. Both companies would fit Glencore&apos;s strategy to expand in the agriculture sector and increase its industrial asset base.  An IPO of the Kazzinc precious metals assets remains a potential plan for 2012.   Among a number of companies reporting results, textiles services group Berendsen added 39.5p to 545p after it said first half profits would be higher than the same time last year. But Greene King fell 30.6p to 487.4p as investors took profits. The pub and restaurant group&apos;s results were in line with expectations but it warned of a tough outlook, given the current UK consumer climate. Halfords lost 6.3p to 371.2p as Barclays Capital began coverage of the retailer with an underweight rating and 340p target price. Game Group added 3p to 36.25p after Credit Suisse increased its stake from 5.6% to 8.2%. Traders suggested this stake-building could be the forerunner of a possible bid.

It was a very sporting decision by Khalid Abdullah, his owner, and it will be a pity if he does not profit by it. The signs are not all that promising. Workforce was favourite when the bookies opened their markets but they have been deluged with cash for So You Think, the ex-Aussie with the huge reputation. The race distance is probably a bit short for Workforce, whose stable hasn&apos;t had a winner in more than a fortnight. Well, there will hopefully be other races if things don&apos;t work out at Sandown, but those of us who made such a fuss when Sea The Stars was retired should hope Workforce can do something this year to enhance his reputation. If he proves unable to win another top-class race, the owners of future Derby winners will be even less likely to follow this example, will instead do the commercially sensible thing and send their horses to stud after their three-year-old years. Below, I&apos;ve listed the last five Derby winners who stayed in training at four and it has to be admitted that, with one exception, they achieved little of note. Of course, these would not have been the absolute best Epsom heroes of the last 20 years. Had Sea The Stars, Lammtarra or Sinndar kept going, they may have done wonderful things. But they didn&apos;t and so our hopes lie with Workforce. Bravery should not have to be its own reward. I&apos;ve got my fingers crossed that he can batter the opposition in a couple of proper Group Ones this year and show those who have hastened good horses into premature retirement what they may have missed. 1) Sir Percy Held up off a steady pace, Sir Percy did not get the Derby run to suit him and had to scramble home in a four-way photo. He seemed a deserving winner, whose only defeat from six starts at that point had been when second to the brilliant George Washington in the Guineas. Marcus Tregoning found he was jarred up after both races and decided to give him a break over a summer when the ground was mostly firm. It turned into a long break: reportedly, the horse only came back into full training in September, then missed the Arc with a pulled shoulder. When he finally made it back to the track for the Champion Stakes, he was really disappointing, fading to be seventh of eight behind Pride. &quot;Maybe he wasn&apos;t ready and went into the race a bit undercooked after his break,&quot; Tregoning said. Even before the Champion, the plan had been for Sir Percy to return as a four-year-old, with the Arc as his target. But the plan unravelled quickly as it became clear that he was now going to struggle in the best races. He picked up an extremely healthy \u00a3125,000 for running fourth in the Sheema Classic in Dubai in 2007 but was then sixth of seven in the Coronation Cup and last of six in the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes. Excuses could be made. The ground was said to be gluey at Epsom and he set the pace for the first time at Ascot. But Sir Percy looks a lot like a precocious horse who did not train on after the early summer of his three-year-old year. 2) North Light Like Sir Percy, North Light&apos;s career could be split in two, with the Derby proving to be his final success. To win at Epsom, he only had to repeat what he had done in his trial race, the Dante at York, Rule Of Law and Let The Lion Roar being the placed horses in both races. The form wasn&apos;t strong and North Light was beaten by Grey Swallow when he tried to follow up in the Irish Derby. He was still made favourite for the Arc, his next start, but front-running tactics did not pan out well. His lead was contested and he had nothing left to give when four rivals went past in the straight, led by Bago. The first of Sir Michael Stoute&apos;s Derby winners to be kept in training at four (following Shergar, Shahrastani and Kris Kin), North Light could have proved his worth in the right conditions but his career was cut short. He looked anything but a seasoned pro on his first race as a four-year-old in the 2005 Brigadier Gerard, holding his head high when asked to close, changing his legs, losing his action and flicking his tail. It was just too late when he finally ran on and the 12-1 shot New Morning held him off by half a length. The next month, he was found to have suffered a stress fracture of his pelvis and was hustled off to stud. 3) High Chaparral Here he is, the only Derby winner since I&apos;ve been following the game who improved his standing the following year. High Chaparral might have been designed as the sort of horse you should keep in training for as long as possible: top class and highly consistent, he won 10 of his 13 races. On a bad day, he was third in the Arc (which happened twice). He may not have been the easiest to train, since he didn&apos;t reappear at four until August, but two of his three wins in 2003 count as excellent bits of form. When he won the Irish Champion, over a distance that should have been on the sharp side for a Derby winner, the next three home were all multiple Group One winners: Falbrav, Islington and Alamshar. He finished his career with a second win at the Breeders&apos; Cup, dead-heating with Johar for the Turf, with Falbrav third. Oh for a few more Derby winners as talented and versatile as High Chaparral. There would be little need, then, to persuade connections to keep them going for another 12 months. 4) High-Rise How do you spot a Derby winner who will continue to hold his own at the highest level? He might look like High-Rise, unbeaten in four runs after winning at Epsom, where he beat 14 rivals. On his next start, he came up short by just a length behind Swain in the 1998 King George, with Royal Anthem and Daylami behind, a top-class effort in anyone&apos;s book. So what on earth happened? High-Rise ran eight times more over the next two years and his only success came against a handful of rivals in a Listed race in Dubai. He did manage a couple of substantial paydays, bagging \u00a3268,000 for running third in the Japan Cup and \u00a3121,000 for a similar effort in the Sheema Classic. But Godolphin, who plucked him from Luca Cumani&apos;s yard after his three-year-old season, were clearly hoping for better. By the time of his final outing, he was being trained in America by Kiaran McLaughlin, for whom he was eighth of nine in the Manhattan Handicap in June 2000. 5) Quest For Fame 1990 was Roger Charlton&apos;s annus mirabilis, when, in the space of four days, he won the French Derby with Sanglamore and the English with Quest For Fame. But the Epsom race may not have taken an enormous amount of winning as the runner-up, Blue Stag, never won afterwards. Quest For Fame eventually found his way back to the winner&apos;s enclosure but made hard work of it. A well-beaten fifth in Salsabil&apos;s Irish Derby, he didn&apos;t run again for 11 months and the wait can hardly have seemed worth it when he got turned over by Young Buster in the September Stakes. But he managed third in the Breeders&apos; Cup Turf, which presumably prompted the idea that he should perhaps be campaigned in America. The following year, he won decent handicaps at Santa Anita and Hollywood, becoming that rare thing: a Derby winner who scores again at the age of five. Now trained by Bobby Frankel, he was third in the Breeders&apos; Cup Turf for a second time before a final flop in the Japan Cup. He wouldn&apos;t be in the first rank of Derby heroes from the last quarter-century but he proved tough enough to enjoy an extended and productive career. Next to none of the others could claim anything similar.", "title": "Claims Five: Derby winners who came back for more | Chris Cook", "sentences": ["He picked up an extremely healthy \u00a3125,000 for running fourth in the Sheema Classic in Dubai in 2007 but was then sixth of seven in the Coronation Cup and last of six in the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes.", "High-Rise ran eight times more over the next two years and his only success came against a handful of rivals in a Listed race in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-01T10:02:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/03/thaksin-shinawatra-thailand", "tags": ["Thaksin Shinawatra", "Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Suk Somboon village turned red in the early hours of Thursday morning, when its 200 residents gathered and chanting monks made offerings. They tied scarlet thread around neighbours&apos; wrists, put up flags along the roadside and erected a metal sign declaring their new status. &quot;It&apos;s a red district anyway. The point is the symbolism,&quot; said Kwanchai Praipana, a prominent redshirt leader from Thailand&apos;s Udon Thani province. &quot;The aim is to show we want justice, democracy and Thaksin [Shinawatra] to return.&quot; Hundreds of north-eastern settlements have proclaimed themselves &quot;red democracy villages&quot; since today&apos;s general election was announced, in the latest evolution of the anti-government redshirt movement. It highlights a bitter division that claimed more than 90 lives last year and is focused on one man: the former prime minister, whose beaming face adorns Suk Somboon&apos;s new sign. Thaksin Shinawatra \u2013 who was the owner of Manchester City FC for 15 months from June 2007 \u2013 defines Thai politics even from 3,000 miles away in Dubai, where he lives to avoid a jail sentence for abuse of power. The redshirt-associated party Puea Thai \u2013 led by his sister Yingluck, but Thaksin&apos;s in all but name \u2013 is on course to beat the incumbent Democrats. Jon Ungpakhorn, an activist and former senator, warned last week: &quot;There is a clear danger of violence on a scale closer to civil war if either side is provoked by extreme measures \u2013 for example, if a Puea Thai election victory were to be derailed by a legal judgment or military coup, or if a Puea Thai government were to swiftly facilitate the return of a defiant Thaksin Shinawatra by means of amnesty and pardon.&quot; Prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, arriving for his party&apos;s final, rain-drenched rally on Friday, said: &quot;The core issue is whether the Thai people want to move the country forward beyond the conflict created by and surrounding one man.&quot; But Professor Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University, suggested that the underlying issue was the awakening of a marginalised grassroots electorate that is challenging the political status quo. Thaksin, a former telecoms tycoon who recently told Der Spiegel he had &quot;barely a billion&quot; left, might not seem an\u00a0obvious figurehead for such a movement. But Thitinan described him as &quot;an agent and catalyst for this newly emergent Thailand&quot;, adding: &quot;He does not see it that way \u2013 he sees it as all about him. On\u00a0the one hand, it&apos;s Thaksin manipulating and exploiting the forces he unleashed. On the other hand, his adversaries deny these voices because they don&apos;t want to confront them. They say these people are not educated, or are misguided, or that Thaksin has paid them. But these are the people who will ultimately determine Thailand&apos;s political direction.&quot; The Democrats draw support mainly from the south and from the urban middle class, while the pro-Thaksin movement relies on lower-income workers in the north and north east. Analysts suggest social changes, such as increased migration and improved communications, have raised expectations and access to information and reduced deference. &quot;Five years ago politics was only discussed by the middle and upper classes. Now poor and rural people have become interested and involved,&quot; said redshirt trade unionist Jittra Cotchadet. Puea Thai&apos;s promises are expensive and at times clearly rhetorical; they include the eradication of poverty within four years. But, in Suk Somboon, villagers say Thaksin delivered on the affordable healthcare and cheap credit pledges that won two electoral landslides. &quot;Thaksin said he would give villagers money, and he did,&quot; said 63-year-old Naichu Kamala. &quot;I don&apos;t care if he is corrupt. All politicians in Thailand are, but Thaksin gives money to the poor.&quot; Though the Democrats are now seeking to woo the same voters, Thitinan argued that they miss the point even when aping popular Thaksin policies; they still see politics as a top-down process. &quot;They pitched it as welfare. People don&apos;t want welfare; they want opportunities and that&apos;s how they see it with Thaksin - it&apos;s about hopes and dreams,&quot; he said. But the billionaire was toppled in a military coup in 2006 amid growing concern about corruption and increasing authoritarianism. Supporters like Kwanchai say blame his ousting and conviction on jealous elites. Others say there was real cause for alarm. &quot;Thaksin as prime minister showed contempt for the due process of law, human rights and checks and balances,&quot; said Sunai Phasuk of Human Rights Watch, citing mass extrajudicial killings in a &quot;war on drugs&quot; and the use of excessive force in restive Southern province. &quot;The problem with human rights in Thailand started well before the coup, but the coup made it worse.&quot; Thaksin&apos;s Thai Rak Thai party was disbanded, as was its next incarnation; Abhisit came to power in a parliamentary deal. After Thaksin&apos;s supporters regrouped as the redshirts and moved onto the streets, occupying a central area of Bangkok last year, a military crackdown led to dozens of deaths. Observers say both sides have failed to acknowledge their responsibility for violence. But while redshirt leaders were jailed for their involvement, there has been no official admission that the army killed or injured demonstrators - fuelling popular anger. Finance minister Korn Chatikavanij suggested on Friday that the election was in itself a sign of progress. &quot;A year ago we were on the verge of civil war,&quot; he said. &quot;Tonight there are two major rallies in two corners of Bangkok by the two major parties. We have every reason to be optimistic.&quot; Others expect further turmoil this year if, as predicted, Puea Thai win most seats tonight but not an outright majority. &quot;The rise of the PAD [the conservative pro-royalists whose protests helped to topple Thaksin, and prompted the creation of the redshirts] gave birth to violent mob rule in Thailand - the belief that might is right and that if you have grievances anything is permissible,&quot; said Sunai of Human Rights Watch. Redshirt leaders are already threatening protests if it does not form the next government, though political manoeuvring could take months to play out. &quot;I don&apos;t believe any other government will help our people,&quot; said 28-year-old Pradit Pimdee in Suk Somboon. &quot;If Yingluck does not become prime minister, people will be very angry...If the village head tells us to go to Bangkok, I will definitely go.&quot;", "title": "Thailand's redshirts prepare for another poll victory", "sentences": ["Thaksin Shinawatra \u2013 who was the owner of Manchester City FC for 15 months from June 2007 \u2013 defines Thai politics even from 3,000 miles away in Dubai, where he lives to avoid a jail sentence for abuse of power."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-02T23:04:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jul/03/rewind-tv-sirens-teenage-kicks-review", "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture", "Comedy", "Jerry Seinfeld", "Comedy"], "article": "Sirens (C4) | 4oD Teenage Kicks: The Search for Sophistication (BBC4) | iPlayer Perfume (BBC4) | iPlayer I don&apos;t suppose we really have much choice about the character of our paramedics, when the day comes.

Non-judgmental, because they&apos;ve got grimly addled lives themselves; not box-ticky, because they couldn&apos;t see a box while possessed of a pen without having to draw a hairy willy in it; not clueless, because they know what they&apos;re doing. This series, flawed a little though it is so far, is based on a real book based on a real blog by a functioning paramedic, and thus gives me hope: because there was great bright humanity and brains behind these three toerags. In the opener, Stuart (Rhys Thomas) actually performed open-heart massage within something like eight seconds of the opening credits, Christ there had hardly been time to get my swallow of liver and onions down, there should be warnings about stuff like this. Against most odds, hand on the hot, pointed nut of the heart as he yelped at his memory over what to do, he got it going again. The story, of course, was about what happened next \u2013 the adrenalined bravado which coursed through the three paramedics \u2013 cheeky nihilist Stuart, Asian sex-bomb Rachid, smart confused gay Ashley \u2013 over the next 24 hours, and their relative responses to the damned counselling over PTSD. This was a sort-of-interesting storyline \u2013 the so-called &quot;up, horny, down&quot; reaction to stressful events (grin, shag, weep) \u2013 but what wasn&apos;t quite explored was how different it might have been if they hadn&apos;t had counselling. Answer: no different at all. This promises much, but dear me it must feature more women, or at least feature them in less cliched roles. The sassy counsellor with sassy legs who will probably best the boys in the end but, still, has a made-up non-job. The allegedly sexless but in fact utterly hot cop Maxine (Amy Beth Hayes), who has several tremendous lines but has to play them in two dimensions, to allow more burgeoning space for the lads&apos; knob-gags. I do hope this series works, but I also hope it starts to like its women more. And I&apos;d also, as I said, be happy for the three guys to attend on my final day \u2013 it&apos;ll of course be something involving shingle and a metronome \u2013 but I&apos;d like them, too, to care about the outcome. Stuart didn&apos;t have PTSD. He just had a flatulent ego. He hadn&apos;t thought to check on the fate of the woman he&apos;d &quot;saved&quot;. She had died. Luxury, for her, would have been living. Smelling one flower; kissing one turded paving-stone. The relativistic nature of &quot;luxury&quot; \u2013 Billy B might like a yacht, Katie K might like not to be in a wheelchair \u2013 was left quite exuberantly unexplored by BBC4 this week, in their alleged &quot;Luxury Season&quot;, as if they had sponsored each other&apos;s production teams to run up a Hill of Stupidity, no losers. You can just imagine the meetings. Define &quot;luxury&quot;. Someone says a word, perhaps &quot;class&quot;, someone says &quot;money&quot;, someone nods and ticks, everything goes ahead, no one knows what&apos;s going on.

As far as any definition or examination of &quot;luxury&quot; went, I&apos;m sure if you tracked down the producer you&apos;d find you could make a better man out of a banana. This was possibly the laziest ever piece of rehashed news-footage \u2013 cigarette ads, Cinzano ads, teenagers are funny and then grow up, yes yes, what are you saying? There was also an attempted historical Greek thing about luxury, presented by a Dr Michael Scott, who was terribly full of himself and whose faux-theorising about luxury actually confused rather than elucidated, surely not the intention? Better by far, and I&apos;ll watch the next two episodes \u2013 the producer must have missed the Stupid meeting \u2013 was Perfume, which told the stories of Jean-Paul Guerlain&apos;s and Tommy Hilfiger&apos;s attempts to create new brands. A difficult task, given that Veronique Gabai-Pinsky, Est\u00e9e Lauder&apos;s absolute go-to woman-who-knows, pronounced &quot;the great challenge\u2026 is that nobody needs another fragrance.&quot; There were 150 annual perfume launches 10 years ago; there are 1,200 annually now, with worse names and smells. The Hilfiger bunch set sail on marketing, for months. Bottle, cardboard, typography \u2013 months. Only at the end did they begin work on the &quot;juice&quot;. In the interests of thorough research, the day after watching this I ventured, rather shamefacedly, into the local Superdrug. I had thought my days of being embarrassed buying stuff in a chemist had ended at about age 22: I&apos;m still not quite one of those chaps who shout their condom-order (&quot;a proud gross of Super-Bongo, modom!&quot;) with a strut from the entrance-door, but I no longer blush like a gurl. But blush like a gurl I did, ordering Hilfiger&apos;s Loud, and then asking, because it was only a tenner, what it had been discounted from. Two Superdrug ladies looked up the price, exchanging glances. I grew a little wary. Do they have panic-buttons on perfume desks, in case of men becoming excited by getting a discount on Hilfiger scents? Turned out it&apos;s already been cut down from \u00a319.50. I realised why after my third shower; the ning sticks to you like napalm. (PS editors: can I please claim that tenner back on expenses? I am honestly never going to use the stuff again in my life, unless I suddenly need to mask, or at least confuse, the urgent reek of removing a corn-plaster. From the severed foot of a 10-week corpse. Ta.) Guerlain&apos;s relaunched Shalamar scent worked better, or would have had not Jean-Paul made some allegedly racist remarks a few months before that launch. In terms of understanding luxury, or even &quot;luxury&quot;, I am left bereft by the failure of the BBC to even have a meeting to define it. Ten thousand people or some such you have, boys. I could for free have sat down and told you \u2013 luxury is a fun something you don&apos;t need. All classes buy it, but from very different shops. &quot;Tom, it&apos;s regretful that I haven&apos;t seen much from you,&quot; said Alan Sugar, during the semi-finals of The Apprentice.

Conservationists were disappointed that it replaced the listed Baltic Exchange, damaged by the IRA in 1992. But the new building, commissioned by a reinsurance company, won the Stirling prize in 2004, for the greatest contribution to British architecture. Unanimously approving judges said it was &quot;already a popular icon&quot;. When wrangles occur over dramatic changes to the capital&apos;s skyline, the Gherkin is invariably invoked as proof that, when in doubt, shiny architectural outrageousness should trump the case for heritage and the popular aversion for more tall buildings. Only someone as idiotic as Prince Charles, you gather, would dispute that the Gherkin and its far taller successors are spectacularly appropriate emblems for a dynamic, forward-looking nation in no more need of planning regulations than it is of Viagra. It appears, however, that Prince Charles may have found a new ally. Ken Shuttleworth has just declared that &quot;the age of bling is over&quot;. Si monumentum requiris, don&apos;t look at Ken&apos;s Gherkin. He wants architects to abandon &quot;crazy shapes, silly profiles and double curves&quot;. If he were designing it again, he says, the Gherkin would look &quot;different&quot;, with less glass. Interviewed by Emily Wright for Building magazine, Shuttleworth said the market should focus instead on &quot;beautiful, simple, rectangular forms&quot;, eg not forms like gonads \u2013 the current mayor of London&apos;s term for Shuttleworth&apos;s sloping, all-glass City Hall. The architect has discovered the modest, the plain, the energy-saving corrective to showy, all-glass buildings. &quot;Companies no longer want to be seen spending that type of money on their HQ building as it doesn&apos;t look good,&quot; he said. &quot;Buildings need to reflect the time they are in.&quot; This is the world of architecture, of course; a layperson cannot be sure Shuttleworth was not just saying it to cause one of his trademark controversies or, indeed, to prepare the way for his new, lower-rise, solid-walled development at Broadgate, an HQ for the investment bank UBS that is attractively described as &quot;an engine of finance&quot;. But still, for Shuttleworth, that acknowledged master of architectural bling, to cancel the legacy of his own past is surely, when you try to conceive of an equivalent style reversal, up there with Katie Price denouncing pink. Except that a multitude of disappointed little girls leaves less impression on the landscape than the capital&apos;s still-advancing army of giant dicks, the emissaries, as Shuttleworth reminds us, of a time they are no longer in. Just last week work resumed on the ludicrous Pinnacle (or &quot;Helter-Skelter&quot;), approved in 2005 and still a &quot;unique product&quot;, according to its rescuers, a consortium of investors intent on bringing us the tallest skyscraper in the city. Meanwhile, in another case of retro, early 21st-century exhibitionism, the growing Shard, designed to be the highest building in Europe, persists in its incredible deformation of the London skyline. Asked for his opinion of Renzo Piano&apos;s spiked tower/obelisk, his fellow icon-maker, Shuttleworth said: &quot;I just don&apos;t get it. I don&apos;t understand it.&quot; A principal objection appears to be its costly glassiness. &quot;I was there the other day,&quot; Shuttleworth said, &quot;and I can&apos;t see how they are going to make it work environmentally.&quot; But that is missing the point. The point of the Shard is showing off, not sustainability. Timed, inevitably, for Olympics readiness, this tall object is due to light up, and have rings or something coming off it, to show the world how mighty we are once we&apos;ve called in an Italian architect and Middle Eastern finance. Once construction had begun, thanks to John Prescott, in his then role of taste-arbiter for the nation, Boris Johnson hailed the building as follows: &quot;If you want a symbol of how London is powering its way out of the global recession, the Shard is it, rising confidently up to the heavens.&quot; Does anyone, with the possible exception of bankers, want a symbol of how London is &quot;powering its way out of the global recession&quot;? As is now customary, with the mayor in charge of London&apos;s aesthetics, I don&apos;t believe we were ever asked. But if, as Londoners, we&apos;d said oh yes please, would we have chosen this import from the Dubai school of economic symbolism, erected in a place where it overturned, at a stroke of Prescott&apos;s pen, planning principles that protected the inner London skyline from speculators for half a century? Already, viewed from what was supposed to be, even when Prescott destroyed it, a protected \u2013 even iconic \u2013 view from Hampstead Heath in north London, the Shard, &quot;rising confidently up to the heavens&quot;, has, as predicted by all its opponents, reduced Christopher Wren&apos;s elderly competitor to an earthbound, fussy-looking nuisance. The Shard, for God&apos;s sake. Like professional entertainers \u2013 give it up for the Gherkin! The Cheesegrater! The Helter-Skelter! The latest piece of speculative crap funded by the well-loved Qatari royal family! \u2013 new towers now arrive with ready-made nicknames, possibly to preclude the invention of ruder ones, probably to advertise, in advance, their guaranteed iconic status. Anyway. In the happy time when the fate of this particular building was still uncertain, with English Heritage describing it as a &quot;spike through the heart of historic London&quot;, and most of the public saying they were against very tall buildings, its supporters deftly aligned critics with the Prince Charles school of Toytown philistinism. Concerns about views were dismissed as ignorant nimbyism. &quot;Only if you live in Hampstead Garden Suburb, darling,&quot; mocked one passionate Shardist, as if the thing were a shrine to low-cost housing, not greed. Whatever architects may say about Charles&apos;s interference, his fondness for pastiche has surely been a boon for skyline trashers everywhere, allowing their critics to be stigmatised, instantly, as thick Poundburyites whose very objections to new architecture only confirmed the geriatric worthlessness of their opinions. Conversely, the transformation of the capital into a developers&apos; playground could be portrayed by someone such as Ken Livingstone as clever and modern. That he pledged, in the absence of any skyscraping mandate, &quot;to promote the development of tall buildings&quot; is worth remembering, now he&apos;s up for re-election. Even now, critics of Piano&apos;s spike are apt to dilute their heresy with some judiciously expressed devotion, to the effect that his wonderful Shard would be simply marvellous if only it were somewhere else. Unless, that is, the heretic happens also to be an architect, such as Ken Shuttleworth. You can&apos;t say carbuncle: you can say silly, crazy and bling.

The incumbent Democrats admitted defeat as preliminary results suggested another tide of support for Thaksin, a billionaire now living as a fugitive in Dubai. Although his younger sister formally leads the Puea Thai party, she is regarded as his proxy. Yingluck, a 44-year-old businesswoman who entered politics just six weeks ago, said: &quot;I don&apos;t want to say that Puea Thai wins today. It&apos;s a victory of the people.&quot; The election commission&apos;s preliminary results suggest Puea Thai will take 261 seats in the 500-seat parliament, with the Democrats winning just 162. Hundreds of red-shirted supporters flocked to the party&apos;s Bangkok headquarters, chanting, cheering and applauding as results came in. Many waved pictures of Yingluck and Thaksin and some let off firecrackers to celebrate. Moments before Yingluck spoke, the defeated prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, congratulated the opposition and said he wanted to see unity and reconciliation. Somjai Phagaphasvivat, a political scientist at Thammasat University, told Reuters: &quot;It is now a foregone conclusion that Puea Thai will lead the next government even by itself, but I expect it to bring in small coalition partners, which will not only inflate its already sizeable majority but also further weaken the opposition.&quot; Yingluck said she had already spoken to the Chart Thai Pattana party. Analysts have warned that the election could lead to further turmoil in Thailand after years of intense political conflict. More than 90 people died last year in clashes as the military cracked down on Thaksin-supporting redshirt protesters in the centre of the capital. Exit polls had predicted an even larger margin of victory for Puea Thai, but Dr Andrew Walker, an expert on south-east Asian politics at the Australian National University, said any absolute majority would be remarkable. &quot;If they get [one], they will be only the second government in Thailand&apos;s history to do so, the first being Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s [in 2005]. It shows this is still a very strong electoral brand,&quot; he said. Professor Thitinan Pongsudhirak, of Chulalongkorn University, said: &quot;If they win at all, it&apos;s a big statement. [It means] the ideas and policies that made [Thaksin&apos;s] original Thai Rak Thai party so electable are unstoppable and indestructible \u2026 This is a party that has been dissolved twice; its leading politicians have been banned twice; it&apos;s being led by a deposed exile and former prime minister a six-hour flight away.&quot; Abhisit came to power in a parliamentary deal after a previous Thaksin-backed party was dissolved. Redshirt leaders warned during the election they would take to the streets if opponents used legal manoeuvrings or a coup to prevent Yingluck from becoming prime minister. Analyst Chris Baker said it was likely that opponents of Thaksin had a Plan B: &quot;There have been several things said in the last week that suggest the Democrats and their supporters will accept this result \u2013 but not what it means. &quot;We are in a changing political society and there&apos;s big resistance from the old institutions: the bureaucracy, monarchy, military and a lot of the middle class.&quot; Thaksin called the preliminary outcome &quot;a step forward&quot; in an interview with the Thai PBS television station. He spoke by telephone from Dubai, where he lives in order to avoid a two-year prison sentence for abuse of power, which he says was politically motivated. &quot;People are tired of a standstill,&quot; he said. &quot;They want to see change in a peaceful manner.&quot; The billionaire draws his support largely from poorer residents in north and north-east Thailand, who see him as a champion, while the Democrats are dependent on the urban upper and middle classes in central Thailand and the south. They regard the former prime minister as corrupt and autocratic. &quot;I have been waiting five years [since the coup] for this moment,&quot; said Sompoon Tamakaew, from Ubon Ratchasani province, as he waited at the Puea Thai headquarters. &quot;Bangkok is full of the elites and upper classes, so they don&apos;t really understand how much of an impact Thaksin had.&quot; Sompoon, a 50-year-old gardener, said: &quot;I don&apos;t think [another coup] will happen, but if it does I will keep fighting.&quot; Police said more than 170,000 officers were on duty throughout the country to monitor voting by 47 million eligible Thais. Britain was among the countries warning its nationals of potential violence, urging visitors to avoid demonstrations. Victory could mark a return for exiled ex-leader The name and picture on the posters was of Yingluck Shinawatra, but it is her brother Thaksin who has defined this race \u2013 for both his passionate supporters and his bitter opponents. In a country where prime ministers have been lucky to last a full term, Thaksin won two massive election victories by wooing new money and, above all, the rural poor. But he fell foul of the Thai establishment \u2013 alarmed by his accumulation of power and warning of crony capitalism \u2013 and was toppled by the army. His opponents&apos; efforts to keep him out of power appear to have only increased his appeal. To his supporters, he has become not just the man who has raised their living standards, but the living expression of their collective will: the test of whether their voices will be respected. Puea Thai, the latest incarnation of his party, campaigned in a large part on a possible amnesty allowing him to return to Thailand \u2013 a hugely popular policy for his tens of millions of supporters. Yet Yingluck repeatedly said it was not a priority and that an amnesty would not be about one person. Thaksin told the Thai PBS television station on Sunday that he hoped to return: &quot;I have wanted to come back since yesterday, but I do not want to create problems.&quot; Chris Baker, who co-authored the biography Thaksin, said the party had to be &quot;two-faced&quot; because of his polarising effect. &quot;One thing they are going to have to manage very carefully is any possible rehabilitation of him into a political role. They are not stupid and realise it would galvanise a significant body of opposition,&quot; he added. Somjai Phagaphasvivat, a political scientist at Thammasat University, told Reuters: &quot;What we should watch is on whether Puea Thai might exploit the overwhelming poll numbers, interpreting it as a public mandate for the party to bring Thaksin home quickly \u2026 The Thaksin amnesty issue will determine where Thai politics is heading.

Thaksin&apos;s younger sister Yingluck, who fronts the Puea Thai party, announced she had agreed a coalition deal with four minor parties that would give the new government 299 seats. Puea Thai won an absolute majority with 264 seats in the 500-seat parliament, according to preliminary election commission results that could still shift somewhat. But by moving fast to cement its triumph with outside support has made it harder for opponents to intervene. It paves the way for Yingluck to become the country&apos;s first female prime minister. Thaksin was toppled by a military coup in 2006 and now lives in Dubai as a fugitive due to an abuse of power conviction that he says was politically motivated. His Thai Rak Thai party and its successor were also disbanded and many of their leaders banned from politics \u2013 yet he continued to command massive popular support, as the electoral landslide showed. Puea Thai campaigned on the promise: Thaksin thinks \u2013 Puea Thai does. Yingluck said her first task was the &quot;roadmap to reconciliation&quot; after years of unrest. She also cited the need to tackle high prices, improve international relations and curb corruption. Meanwhile, outgoing Democrat prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said he had decided to step down as party leader, although his right-hand man, Surichoke Sopha, also a Democrat MP, said he believed the party still wanted Abhisit. Surichoke added: &quot;I don&apos;t think this [Puea Thai] government will last long ... They will have to compromise with the ruling class and at the same time satisfy the grassroots.&quot; The country has become polarised between Thaksin supporters, particularly the rural poor and new money \u2013 and the old elites that sought to keep him from power with the support of the urban middle classes. The split became even more entrenched when more than 90 people died as the military cracked down on Thaksin-supporting protesters in the centre of Bangkok last year. While redshirt leaders were jailed over the demonstrations, the government refused to acknowledge that the army had caused any deaths. General Prawit Wongsuwan, a former army chief close to leaders involved in the ousting of Thaksin, said the military would not intervene or stop Yingluck forming a government. &quot;I can assure you that the military has no desire to stray out of its assigned roles,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;The army accepts the election results.&quot; Political analyst Chris Baker cautioned: &quot;They always say they have nothing to do with politics and then they keep interfering.&quot; But he added: &quot;They are obviously feeling quite sensitive after the last five years. They know they made a mess of it. &quot;They are going to be very reluctant to make a move that puts them in the public eye in politics. They are going to pull the strings of the [anti-Thaksin, conservative and monarchist] yellowshirts and that sort of thing. I think we are more likely to see a formula of street demonstrations and judicial action [than coups].&quot; Activist and former senator Jon Ungpakorn believed the scale of the Puea Thai win should offer protection against a coup even in the long term. &quot;I&apos;m not so concerned about the army now and more that the [anti-Thaksin] People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy and ultra-nationalist and monarchist sections of society may cause trouble.&quot; He predicted attempts to disband the party, perhaps because of the involvement of Thaksin, who is banned from political activity in Thailand. Democrats have made it clear they will challenge Puea Thai wins in particular constituencies on legal grounds, but the sheer number of seats Puea Thai won means that may not have much impact on the overall outcome. Ungpakorn added: &quot;At the same time we need a lively criticism of the new government and not allow Puea Thai to behave like the old Thaksin government trying to stifle political opposition and criticism.&quot; Experts say much will also depend on how carefully Puea Thai plays its hand. They campaigned in part on an amnesty for Thaksin, but know that bringing him back too quickly could galvanise opposition.

Menus are British, change monthly with the seasons, and do sound truly delicious (a 4oz grilled steak with bloody mary mix, chateau potatoes and mushroom and cream of corn mixture sounds pretty good, for example). But they&apos;re only catering for two flights a day \u2013 that&apos;s 64 people. Try multiplying that by 10,000. &quot;I&apos;ve only scratched the surface,&quot; concedes Keogh. &quot;Obviously rolling it out across club class worldwide is a different picture, but it&apos;s all achievable.&quot; It&apos;s all very well to talk about club class worldwide, but what about the rest of us in steerage? As well as the two immovable obstacles of passenger volume and reheating, there are other annoyances: the fact that you have to eat with your elbows tucked in, like some awkward T-rex in a high chair; the fact that your food is in a plastic tray; the fact that the kid behind you is kicking the seat; the bizarre notion that feeding you a croissant at midnight will help you acclimatise because it&apos;s breakfast where you&apos;re going. Perhaps we should just give up waiting for someone to come up with a formula for high-grade airline food and accept it in all its compromised glory. After all, there&apos;s something fun about the break in monotony that the airline meal provides \u2013 the odd waft as you peel the lid from your dinner (how does it always manage to smell the same?), the hot, moist flannel, the orange juice with its foil lid, the diddy cutlery \u2026 these quirks make the experience somehow special and unique.

The Puea Thai party, fronted by Yingluck and backed by the exiled former prime minister, won an absolute majority with 264 seats in the 500-seat parliament, according to preliminary results. But cementing its position will make it harder for opponents to intervene before Yingluck forms a government when the final results are announced in a few weeks. She said the agreement with four minor parties would give a coalition 299 seats. The outgoing Democrat prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, said he would step down as party leader. Yingluck, who would be Thailand&apos;s first female prime minister, said her first task was the &quot;roadmap to reconciliation&quot; after years of unrest. She also cited the need to tackle high prices, improve international relations and curb corruption. But both sides warned of fresh conflict in a country beset by turmoil since a coup toppled Thaksin in 2006. Last year more than 90 people died when the military cracked down on Thaksin supporters. The defence minister said the army would accept a government led by the 44-year-old businesswoman. &quot;I&apos;ve said this several times,&quot; General Prawit Wongsuwon told Thai newspapers. &quot;We are not going to intervene.&quot; Puea Thai are understood to have held talks with the army before the election. Political analyst Chris Baker cautioned: &quot;[The military] always say they have nothing to do with politics and then keep interfering. But they are obviously feeling quite sensitive after the last five years. They are going to be reluctant to make a move that puts them in the public eye in politics. They are going to pull the strings of the [anti-Thaksin, conservative and monarchist] yellowshirts and that sort of thing. &quot;I think we are more likely to see a formula of street demonstrations and judicial action [than coups].&quot; Sean Boonpracong, formerly a redshirt spokesman and close to Puea Thai, predicted the coalition &quot;should buy six months&apos; peace&quot; at best. Democrat MP Surichoke Sopha said a Puea Thai government would not last long. &quot;They will have to compromise with the ruling class and at the same time satisfy the grassroots. [Yingluck] has many problems including the case against her in the courts and other things which could come up and really destroy her credibility.&quot; Supporters say allegations of perjury, which relate to the confiscation of Thaksin&apos;s assets, are a smear. Opponents have filed a complaint calling for the dissolution of Puea Thai because it is a proxy for Thaksin, who is banned from Thai politics. The billionaire has a passionate support base drawn largely from rural workers and new money \u2013 but has earned the enmity of the old elites and the urban middle class, alarmed by his rapidly expanding power and warnings of crony capitalism. He has already seen two parties disbanded and lives in Dubai as a fugitive due to a conviction for abuse of power that he says was politically motivated. Yet each apparent setback has boosted his support. &quot;The vote is about having a voice that is heard,&quot; Kevin Hewison, professor of Asian studies at the University of North Carolina, told Associated Press. Dr Andrew Walker, a political analyst at the Australian National University, suggested that Thaksin was now in a stronger position than if the coup had never happened. Experts say much will depend on how Puea Thai plays its hand. It campaigned in part on an amnesty allowing Thaksin to return, but knows introducing one quickly could galvanise opposition. Asked if he would return to politics, Thaksin said: &quot;I may be too old \u2026 I really want to retire.&quot; Activist and former senator Jon Ungpakorn, who voted Puea Thai largely due to his opposition to the crackdown on demonstrators, warned that people should &quot;not allow Puea Thai to behave like the old Thaksin government, trying to stifle political opposition and criticism&quot;.", "title": "Thai government plans coalition to consolidate election win", "sentences": ["He has already seen two parties disbanded and lives in Dubai as a fugitive due to a conviction for abuse of power that he says was politically motivated."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-04T17:31:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/04/pass-notes-yingluck-shinawatra", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Women", "Life and style", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Age: 44.

She was managing director of her own communications business. They all say that. What&apos;s she done lately? She has just been elected Thailand&apos;s first female prime minister. Not bad. They usually end up on Channel 5. She&apos;s not actually off the Apprentice. She&apos;s the head of the Puea Thai party, which won a huge majority in recent elections. Can you give me a precis of her political career to date? I pretty much already have. She entered politics only six weeks ago. What are her qualifications for office? She&apos;s the sister of former PM Thaksin Shinawatra. I see how it works. I very much doubt that. Thaksin, though ousted in a military coup in 2006, is still very popular in Thailand. So why didn&apos;t he just run himself? Because he&apos;s living in self-imposed exile in Dubai, having been convicted in absentia of abuses of power in 2008. I&apos;ve never been interested in Thai politics, yet the man&apos;s name is strangely familiar to me. Am I smarter than I think I am? You probably know him better as the owner \u2013 albeit briefly \u2013 of Manchester City. He bought the club\u00a0in 2007 and sold it in 2008, for a\u00a0reported \u00a3200m. How does the sister manage to distance herself from her controversial brother? She doesn&apos;t. The Puea Thai party, set up by Thaksin, campaigned with the slogan &quot;Thaksin thinks \u2013 Puea Thai does&quot;. I&apos;m confused. Are the Shinawatras the good guys or the bad guys? Hard to say. Thaksin is popular with the poor rural majority, who believe he acted in their interests, but his government was dogged by accusations of corruption, nepotism and human rights violations. For the time being, the opposition and the army are minded to accept the election result. Do say: &quot;The people of Thailand have spoken, and they have overwhelmingly chosen an exiled billionaire&apos;s sister.&quot; Don&apos;t say: &quot;You&apos;re fired.&quot;", "title": "Pass notes No 3,003: Yingluck Shinawatra", "sentences": ["Because he&apos;s living in self-imposed exile in Dubai, having been convicted in absentia of abuses of power in 2008."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-04T18:59:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/04/thailand-elections-military-crackdown-editorial", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "It is a strange election where the party that wins an overwhelming majority in parliament seeks the next day to bolster that advantage by forming a coalition with four others. Puea Thai, the party loyal to the exiled billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra, won 31 more seats in Thailand&apos;s general election on Sunday than its disbanded predecessor, the People&apos;s Power party, won in 2007, and this in a race whose rules had been changed to favour the losing side. The result was a major rejection of the military crackdown last year and all the establishment had done since the military coup in 2006. The incumbent prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva resigned on Monday as head of the Democrat party and army generals all dutifully said they would not interfere. So on the face of it, there was no reason for Puea Thai to have increased its majority from 264 to 299 seats, forming a coalition to secure two thirds of the parliament. But this is Thailand, and anyone who thinks the losing side of generals, royalists, and the senior elders of Thai society are going to play a constructive role in opposition has another thing coming. They will bide their time. Barely\u00a0had the preliminary results been announced than the election commission said it was investigating claims of fraud, which could disqualify candidates and reduce the size of the Puea Thai\u00a0victory. Clearly a truce of sorts has been reached between the two camps, which only a year ago reduced the commercial centre of Bangkok to a battle zone and brought the country to the verge of civil war. The military will respect the results of the election which will allow Mr Thaksin&apos;s youngest sister, Yingluck, to form the next government, just as long as the man himself, who lives in exile in Dubai, is not allowed to slip back into the country. Members of Puea Thai initially talked of a political amnesty, which could allow Mr Thaksin, who has been found guilty of corruption by a Thai court, to return. But they have backed away from it since, and Mr Thaksin said he had no immediate plans to return. For those who have grave doubts about Mr Thaksin (both in terms of corruption and the brutal war on drugs he launched when prime minister) but who also abhor what the old elite have done since the coup, the Puea Thai victory represents an opportunity. It is time to recognise the demands of the rural and urban poor. The Democrat party started to do this earlier this year in a nine-point plan that included expanding social security and low-interest loans to taxi and motorcycle drivers. But it was too late for them.

I can take or leave some of the big-field handicaps but the declarations are out for Thursday (the first day, now the meeting has been shifted back by 24 hours) and there&apos;s plenty to look forward to. Burwaaz, who I have been itching to back ever since his unlucky fourth at Royal Ascot, ducks a clash with Windsor Castle Stakes winner Frederick Engels and Coventry Stakes runner-up Roman Soldier in the July Stakes, instead taking on less exalted opposition in a six-furlong conditions race later on the card. Also in action is Fury, a late non-runner in the Jersey Stakes, who has Britannia runner-up Cai Shen to beat over a mile. The Princess of Wales&apos;s Stakes has attracted its usual competitive field of horses that don&apos;t quite make the grade at the top level. Hardwicke fourth Laaheb will be a player, as will Barry Hills&apos; Redwood, whose second to Rewilding in the Dubai Sheema Classic looks considerably better after that horse&apos;s victory over So You Think at Royal Ascot. Mark Johnston took the race with a three-year-old when Soapy Danger won in 2006 and the trainer saddles Dordogne, off the course since winning the Lingfield Derby Trial. Also on the card is the Bahrain Trophy, reduced in trip to a mile and a five furlongs a couple of years ago, and the target of St Leger possibles Solar Sky and Masked Marvel. The decision to move the July Cup to Saturday will lead to a clash this weekend between major meetings at Newmarket, York (John Smith&apos;s Cup) and Ascot (Group Two Summer Mile) and that could open up some interesting opportunities for jockeys who often have to stand aside. Already, looking at Ascot, Pat Dobbs has been booked to ride Dick Turpin in the big race. He hasn&apos;t been aboard the horse in public since it won a conditions event as a two-year-old. Today&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook What sort of name is &apos;My Kingdom&apos; for a horse? It may prove an amazingly apt one at about 4.35pm today when the five-year-old runs in the King Richard III Handicap at Pontefract. If he wins, punters may tell themselves: &quot;Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of King&apos;s Best&quot;. This race used to be named after St Giles, a gentle hermit whose only companion was a red deer, before the track apparently decided they were sick of invoking such a goody-two-shoes and switched to the snarling, tyrannous hunchback who had the princes murdered in the Tower. Or, at least, I thought that&apos;s what Richard III was like. In fact, according to an editorial in yesterday&apos;s Guardian, he was a thoughtful, caring ruler whose innovations make him seem a bit of a lefty by the standards of his time. This, I feel fairly certain, is not how he is being portrayed by Kevin Spacey at the Old Vic. Why Pontefract should clasp Richard III to their bosom is another question. It might be because the town gets a mention in the Shakespeare play, under its medieval name of Pomfret, as the place where Richard II was &quot;hacked to death&quot;. Coincidence aside, I can&apos;t really fancy My Kingdom, so I&apos;m hoping to hack the bookies to death (figuratively) with Irish Boy (3.30), trying for his fourth win of the year in the sprint handicap. He ran on pleasingly at Musselburgh last time to beat a horse who had won his previous two and has won again since. Raced only on all-weather tracks as a juvenile last year, Irish Boy is proving progressive and well handicapped on turf this summer. He is only 4lb higher today and the way he races suggests that this stiffer track may help him. The highlight of today&apos;s card at Pomfret is the Listed Pipalong Stakes, in which you can get 5-1 about the improving Law Of The Range (4.00). Marco Botti&apos;s filly has won good-value handicaps at Sandown and Ascot on her last two starts, appearing to relish those stiff finishes, and has a similar chance to Dark Promise at three times the price. I like Efistorm (2.15) at 9-4 for the opener at Wolves, a six-furlong claimer. That might have been a bit too far for a younger Efistorm but it seems to suit him fine these days, as he won a seller over six at Windsor last time. On his most recent visit here, he made all to win another claimer over five under Kirsty Milczarek, back in the saddle today. With Jeremy Gask going well, I&apos;m taking the 6-1 about his El Libertador (5.45) in the last, a seven-furlong handicap. He was also a winner on his last visit to Wolves but is only 2lb higher this time, thanks to subsequent flops on Fibresand and Chepstow&apos;s turf. Jamie Spencer, who rides, has a 26% strike-rate round here from 379 rides in five seasons, way ahead of any of his rivals today. Tipping competition, day two Shears39, sangfroid and waltersobchak made a flying start yesterday, picking Estates Recovery (12-1) at Newton Abbot and Fire King (7-2). The day&apos;s third winner, Titus Gent (9-2) at Windsor was a popular choice. Today, we&apos;d like your tips, please, for these races: 4.00 Pontefract, 5.45 Wolverhampton, 6.20 Uttoxeter.

An impact assessment report by the Home Office says the new policy will deter bogus students and improve compliance, but the expected 230,000 reduction in the numbers of applicants for the Tier 4 student visa from outside the EU over the next four years will have wider costs. The report estimates that income from fees will be cut by $270m over four years, while up to $3.2bn will be lost because students enrolled at private colleges have lost their right to work part-time and contribute to the economy. Private English language training providers, which had 21,000 Tier 4 visa applicants in 2010, are likely to see applicants drop by 13,000 in 2014, with a net loss $4.8m. The report estimates that the decision to raise the minimum level of English proficiency for students from non-English-speaking countries who want to study on degree courses will cut applicants by 11,000 per year. Meanwhile, lobbying by the British Council and the English UK trade association to have the Accreditation UK inspection scheme for private English language programmes accepted by the Home Office for Tier 4 visa applications has failed. Accreditation UK was not included on a final list of recognised accrediting bodies published by the UK Border Agency last month. Institutions currently approved by Accreditation UK that want to continue to enrol Tier 4 students will need to gain approved accreditation by the end of 2012. US fails to close Hispanic and white reading gap The achievement gap between Hispanic and white students in US schools has not closed significantly since the 1990s, according to data released by the US department of education. Figures published in the National Assessment of Educational Progress last month show the gap narrowed by three points in fourth- and eighth-grade reading between 1992 and 2009, but the overall difference remains more than 20 points, equivalent to two grade levels. Hispanic students from second- or third-generation families, identified as not English language learners, performed better, with the gap at fourth-grade reduced from 24 points in 1998 to 15 points in 2009. However Hispanic children who were classified as English language learners were 44 points behind their white counterparts in 2009. Singapore test puts strain on foreign domestic staff  Singapore is conducting a full review of its test of English proficiency required by foreign domestic workers following reports that a 26-year-old Indonesian woman attempted suicide after failing the test three times. Migrants seeking work as maids are required to pass the test within three days of arrival in Singapore. Those who fail are repatriated but are allowed to return to retake the test a further two times. Fear of failure and the additional expense of retaking the test are putting workers under stress. Dubai teachers offer Indian colleagues help by phone Up to 60 teachers based in Dubai have volunteered to help English language teachers in rural India improve their command of the language without leaving their Gulf state. Under the initiative, organised by the Mumbai-based education charity Pratham, the teachers will be issued with pre-paid SIM cards that they can use to offer speaking practice by phone to teachers in remote villages and slum areas. max.delotbiniere@theguardian.com", "title": "UK could lose $3.8bn from tougher student visa rules", "sentences": ["Dubai teachers offer Indian colleagues help by phone Up to 60 teachers based in Dubai have volunteered to help English language teachers in rural India improve their command of the language without leaving their Gulf state."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-05T13:10:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/05/jamie-spencer-cape-blanco-new-york", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Royal Ascot"], "article": "Jamie Spencer said on Tuesday he is hoping for an improved performance from Cape Blanco when last year&apos;s Irish Derby winner contests the Grade One Man O&apos;War Stakes at Belmont Park in New York on Saturday.

It was rocket-fuelled. Just over six weeks ago, the businesswoman agreed to stand for office for the first time. Today she is on the verge of becoming Thailand&apos;s first female prime minister \u2013 all the more impressive given the country&apos;s generally macho political culture. Yet she may be the exception that proves a rule. Already, the wider region has seen a string of dynastic female leaders: behind almost every successful woman\u00a0lies a powerful man. &quot;This is the magic formula for Asia,&quot; says Bangkok-based political analyst Chris Baker. &quot;You take the political capital from a male who has come before; you take the sheer novelty of a\u00a0woman in a male-biased political culture. You add &apos;good, feminine&apos;, caring virtues and so on \u2013 and it seems to be a powerful combination. What is striking is that most of them have lasted some time and done quite well. [The dynastic factor] is not only very powerful in terms of coming to power\u00a0but, by and large, it seems, in\u00a0staying there.&quot; In Yingluck&apos;s case, the man is, of course, her elder brother Thaksin: the former prime minister who has polarised Thai political culture and now lives in exile. But the phenomenon began in 1960 with Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, the world&apos;s first female prime minister, who took power following her husband&apos;s assassination. Her daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, later became president. It applies to Pakistan&apos;s Benazir Bhutto, India&apos;s Indira Gandhi and Indonesia&apos;s Megawati Sukarnoputri, all\u00a0of whom followed in their fathers&apos; footsteps. The Philippines has seen both Corazon Aquino and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo take charge \u2013 following their father and husband respectively \u2013 while Sheikh Hasina Wajed, daughter of Bangladesh&apos;s first president, has been prime minister twice; in between, the post was held by Khaleda Zia, a\u00a0presidential widow. In Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi, who is leading resistance to the military junta, is the daughter of independence hero Aung San. Wan Azizah Wan Ismail led Malaysia&apos;s opposition when her husband Anwar Ibrahim was ousted and jailed; though she resigned her parliamentary seat on his return, she remains president of the People&apos;s Justice Party. Farida Jalalzai, a political scientist at\u00a0the University of Missouri-St Louis, says that although numerically more men have capitalised on family connections, the proportion of women leaders with family ties is far higher. The phenomenon is also much more pronounced in south and south-east Asia and Latin America than other parts of the world, where female leaders tend to have\u00a0emerged under their own steam. While it is hard to generalise about these countries, where women have vastly differing experiences, they have one thing in common: they are countries without a history of female political leadership. In particular, they have no self-made equivalent of Angela Merkel, Margaret Thatcher or Julia Gillard. These dynastic leaders emerge when the men have already left the stage: often murdered by opponents, or otherwise incapacitated. Frequently, there is no male alternative \u2013 perhaps because sons are too young; perhaps because others are not up to the task. &quot;Sometimes a brother simply is not skilful enough \u2013 he doesn&apos;t have the acumen or the character,&quot; says Claudia Derichs of the Philipp University of Marburg, who has researched female dynastic leaders. But she adds that women could be particularly attractive to those casting about for a successor: &quot;They somehow have an image of being more morally endowed.&quot; Yingluck is unusual in following her brother, but Derichs thinks she fits the mould of dynastic leaders perfectly. Yingluck has described Thaksin as a second father \u2013 he is 17 years her senior \u2013 and although he is still alive, he was removed from Thailand&apos;s political stage by a military coup. He now lives in Dubai, as a fugitive from corruption charges that he says were politically motivated. And like many of the other women leaders, 44-year-old Yingluck has run explicitly under her relative&apos;s mantle. The party she fronts used the slogan &quot;Thaksin thinks \u2013 Puea Thai does&quot; and her brother has described her as his &quot;clone&quot; \u2013 later caveating that he meant she shares his way of thinking.     Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi shakes hands with Pakistan's president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, with his daughter Benazir Bhutto beside him, 1972. Photograph: Agence France Presse/AFP/Getty Images    &quot;I think people choose some women because they think they are more likely to be benchwarmers per se and that they can &apos;take on&apos; the identities of their male relatives better than a man who perhaps has his own independent political agenda,&quot; says Jalalzai. &quot;Sometimes these women actually campaign that they will represent their male relative&apos;s agenda and will utilise traditional conceptions of women&apos;s role in the family in doing so. This often resonates with the public, who would not normally elect a woman to the position.&quot; That is certainly true for Yingluck, who repeatedly asked voters on the campaign trail: &quot;If you love my brother,\u00a0will you give his younger sister a chance?&quot; Her path may have been somewhat easier than that of other female leaders in Asia. While Thai women have struggled in the political realm \u2013 only an eighth of MPs are female and at the grassroots, village heads are overwhelmingly male \u2013 they have been highly successful in other spheres. Earlier this year a report by accountants Grant Thornton said Thailand boasted the highest proportion (45%) of women in\u00a0senior roles in business; 30% of companies had female CEOs. Many in Thailand are proud to have elected a female leader and even senior Democrats, bitterly opposed to Puea Thai, suggest the voters&apos; willingness to\u00a0back a woman speaks well for the country. A survey by the Matichon newspaper, asking what people thought of having a female prime minister, found that 70% saw it as a move in the right direction and an indication of equality. &quot;I&apos;m sick of men in politics. They are\u00a0good at being corrupt. They are not as responsible as women,&quot; declared Bangkok noodle seller Somiat Kiatsommart, one of the voters who swept Puea Thai to victory. But he acknowledged that Yingluck \u2013 the youngest of nine children \u2013 had not been an obvious choice. &quot;All of Thaksin&apos;s brothers are stupid. If they were actually clever, he would have asked one of them.&quot; In fact, Thaksin was succeeded by his ally Samak Sundaravej and his brother-in-law Somchai Wongsawat \u2013 both disqualified from office \u2013 before he asked his youngest sister to stand. &quot;It is the skilful use of family ties rather than family ties alone that positions one as a successful candidate,&quot; says Jalalzai, adding that in most cases women with such connections were very politically experienced before taking office. At the start of the campaign, many saw Yingluck as little more than a puppet and questioned her nomination. &quot;Actually it turned out to be a\u00a0brilliant choice,&quot; says Kevin Hewison, an expert on Thailand at the University of North Carolina. &quot;She electrified the\u00a0campaign.&quot; Although an electoral neophyte, she learned quickly. True, she has been surrounded by experienced political figures, has spoken to her brother two or three times a week, and has stuck tightly to the script. She dodged a debate with Democratic prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva that would probably have exposed her weaknesses. But many contenders \u2013 male as well as female - have been unable to stick to a\u00a0political message and observe the discipline of a campaign; and many struggle to deliver fluent presentations or engage with ordinary voters. Yingluck wowed the vast rallies as she sped along the campaign trail. &quot;I might be new to being a politician, but I have had experience of politics from a young age . . . I understand it very well and especially on 19 September [2006, the day Thaksin was toppled] I learned the nature of politics,&quot; she told the Guardian last week. Her father was an MP; her sister a mayor; and, of course, she has seen her brother&apos;s rise. She also became involved with Puea Thai after Thaksin fled to Dubai. In a 2009 cable obtained by WikiLeaks, the then US ambassador to Bangkok noted: &quot;Yingluck appeared far more poised during this meeting than she has been in the past. She spoke with confidence about party operations, strategy and goals . . . While it was obvious that politics does not come as naturally to Yingluck as it does to her brother, one suspects she may well have a bright future with the party.&quot; The depiction of female leaders as innocents reflects enduring stereotypes about women in politics, but it can also be exploited by them. They can embody the promise of change and represent moral purity in comparison to their opponents. &quot;I think this time people don&apos;t want me to be acting as a politician, but knowing how to solve problems and I\u00a0can use my experience in management,&quot; Yingluck says, pointing to her experience heading one of the Shinawatra family&apos;s companies. Democrats say they also found it harder to counter Puea Thai because they did not want to be seen as bullying a woman \u2013 a factor Derichs believes is\u00a0common. Surichoke Sopha, a Democrat MP, argues that Yingluck&apos;s femininity put his party on the defensive. &quot;It was her strong point, and it is all about turning strong points into weak points . . . But our campaign people decided not to touch it,&quot; he says. That may have been wise: the Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos attempted to dismiss Aquino as\u00a0&quot;just a housewife&quot; \u2013 a tag she embraced and turned to her advantage. But once Yingluck is in charge, experts say, she will be subject to all the same mud-slinging that a man would be in what promises to be an enduring and bitter political conflict. Her brother has divided Thai politics: while many see him as a champion of the rural poor, the urban middle and upper classes regard him as authoritarian and corrupt. In comparison, she explicitly drew on her gender to position herself as a reconciliation candidate in the campaign. &quot;I will utilise my femininity to work fully for our country,&quot; she promised. &quot;She is more gentle, more understanding and more serene&quot; says Prapat Chongsanguan of the Puea Thai economic working group. &quot;It will be better for the atmosphere right now: People won&apos;t feel so threatened.&quot; But Chalidaporn Songsamphan, a well-known feminist and a professor at\u00a0Thammasat University, warns that hopes are dangerously high. &quot;It&apos;s not that easy to reconcile these groups. People are expecting too much from her just because she&apos;s a woman,&quot; she says. &quot;People are expecting her to be amother to Thai society.&quot; Chalidaporn also notes that dynastic women often struggle to establish themselves. While Thaksin&apos;s parties have included some powerful and competent women, &quot;It&apos;s difficult to see\u00a0[Yingluck] from a different perspective than as a proxy for her brother,&quot; she says. Though Yingluck insists she will lead in her own right, taking advice from Thaksin but making the key decisions, observers are highly sceptical \u2013 particularly given his centrality to the campaign, and Puea Thai&apos;s keenness to introduce an amnesty allowing him to return. But Jalalzai says that, in other cases, female leaders have proved far less malleable than men have assumed. &quot;The reality is that most of the time these women have their own political agendas and are usually not easily controlled by men.&quot; Family disputes are not uncommon. Many of the women who voted for Yingluck hope that she will develop her own set of priorities, tackling issues that disproportionately affect them. &quot;She might bring in more women&apos;s rights,&quot; says soft drinks vendor Sukhpatra Chockmo. &quot;A lot of\u00a0women suffer domestic abuse and rape; I hope she can improve the\u00a0situation.&quot; But Virada Somswadi, founder of Chiang Mai University&apos;s women&apos;s studies programme, told the Bangkok Post that Yingluck entered politics &quot;because of other political factors. She cannot be a representative of women&apos;s groups, because she has never expressed her vision and stance regarding the protection of women&apos;s interests.&quot; Female leaders do not always promote female-focused policies, nor promote other women. Nor do they necessarily make it easier for other women to follow in their footsteps \u2013 even women with similarly powerful family connections.

To allay fears among conservative elements, they are regulating more tightly what is deemed acceptable behaviour for men and women. The direct targets of this backlash are those who visibly challenge gender norms \u2013 in particular, boyat (an Arabisation of the English word &quot;boy&quot;, generally referring to women with a masculine appearance) together with transgender men and women. In the past few years, dozens of articles and talkshows in the mainstream media have decried the spread of boyat and &quot;the third sex&quot; \u2013 a term used disparagingly to describe effeminate men and transgender women. This media frenzy has propelled a moral panic that manifests itself in discriminatory legislation across the region, in police crackdowns and in campaigns to &quot;set them straight&quot;. In 2007, Kuwait criminalised &quot;imitating members of the opposite sex&quot;, leading to the arbitrary arrest and detention of hundreds of transgender women. In research in Kuwait this year, Human Rights Watch found that most of those targeted by the police had suffered abuse, torture, sexual assault and harassment at their hands. In 2009, Dubai began a public awareness campaign, &quot;Excuse Me, I am a Girl&quot;, warning Emirati women of the dangers of masculinisation and attempting to set them on the path to &quot;femininity&quot;. The National daily newspaper reported recently that police and the community development authority would collaborate to combat the spread of boyat. Plainclothes policewomen have been deployed in shopping malls and popular hangouts to catch women violating arbitrary codes of female dress and behaviour, although it remains to be seen what this campaign actually entails and whether any boyat have been arrested. The anxiety over the perceived erosion of cultural norms may be seen as a reaction to the emirate&apos;s rapid opening up and swift demographic changes. The regulation of public morality has always been a means for the state to reinforce its sovereignty, particularly in rapidly changing societies. There are many ways to understand this panic beyond facile explanations of &quot;transphobia&quot; and &quot;homophobia&quot;. In several of the more liberal Gulf states such as Kuwait and the UAE, there is a relative margin of state tolerance for both male and female homosexuality among their citizenry as long as it is discreet and doesn&apos;t visibly challenge norms of acceptable male and female behaviour and dress. In fact, most arrests have been for &quot;gay weddings&quot; and boisterous parties. Other arrests took place when behaviour became too public, such as the case of the Saudi man who appeared in a YouTube video behaving suggestively and gender-inappropriately in 2010. This indicates that the greater fear is the perceived challenge to orthodox practices and gender roles, family structures and &quot;cultural values&quot; rather than homosexual behaviour per se. The visibility of both boyat and transgender women as identifiable markers of gender transgression has led to a disturbing public vilification of both. In various media reports, the homosexual component, while present, is not necessarily the most important aspect of their behaviour; rather, attraction to women is seen as a natural outcome of masculinity and vice versa. The crossing of gender norms is far more salient in public discourse about boyat and other gender-transgressive individuals. For example, an Emirati psychologist publicly advocated treatment for female masculinity early on, so that it does not lead to homosexuality. Psychologists, social scientists and social commentators treat what they understand as a rejection of women&apos;s natural place as a pathology that needs to be contained. This is a symptom of a deeper anxiety about the erosion of traditional gender norms and roles. In Kuwait, for example, the parliament has been a battlefield over the role and behaviour of women in the public sphere since 1996, with liberals making gains such as securing women&apos;s right to vote and run for public office while conservatives succeeded in maintaining the sex-segregation law in universities. The backlash is far from over, however, as more conservative MPs try to ban &quot;revealing&quot; women&apos;s swimwear and &quot;regulate&quot; plastic surgery by banning any form of sex reassignment surgery and gender correction. In Dubai, where only about 12.5% of the residents are Emirati while the rest are western, Asian and Arab expatriates and migrant workers, tensions over a perceived loss of the city to foreigners and the subsequent erosion of morals has led to a similar backlash. In 2008, two Britons were arrested and deported for allegedly having sex on a beach. Newspaper commentators were quick to decry the invasion of &quot;foreign values&quot; and the local press subsequently reported that the government had detained dozens of tourists for a variety of &quot;indecent acts&quot;. In times of social strain, gender and sexuality often become the focal point of broader anxieties, a phenomenon evident in media frenzies, new proposed legislation, and the brutality of the police and the impunity with which they act against an already vulnerable population. These actions violate the most basic human rights of these individuals: the right to be free from violence and torture, to adequate healthcare (which precludes &quot;reparative therapy&quot;) and the right to self-expression and privacy. Within this logic, the bodily autonomy of women and those who transgress gender norms will unfortunately continue to be eroded and subject to politically sanctioned containment and violence.", "title": "The Gulf's gender anxiety | Rasha Moumneh", "sentences": ["In 2009, Dubai began a public awareness campaign, &quot;Excuse Me, I am a Girl&quot;, warning Emirati women of the dangers of masculinisation and attempting to set them on the path to &quot;femininity&quot;.", "In Dubai, where only about 12.5% of the residents are Emirati while the rest are western, Asian and Arab expatriates and migrant workers, tensions over a perceived loss of the city to foreigners and the subsequent erosion of morals has led to a similar backlash."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-06T10:18:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/06/ioc-pyeongchang-2018-winter-olympics", "tags": ["International Olympic Committee", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "The South Korean city of PyeongChang will host the 2018 Winter Olympics, becoming the first Asian city outside Japan to stage the event, following a landslide victory over Munich and Annecy. It was a case of third time lucky for PyeongChang, which is 110\u00a0miles from the capital, Seoul. It narrowly missed out to Vancouver and the Russian city of Sochi for the 2010 and 2014 Winter Games. The majority decision of the International Olympic Committee at its Durban session saw the contest end after one round, with 63 votes for PyeongChang, 25 for Munich and seven for Annecy. Victory for PyeongChang, which follows Japan&apos;s Sapporo (1972) and Nagano (1998) to become the third Asian city to host the event, reflects the tendency to push global sporting events into new markets. The IOC will hope that by taking the Winter Games to Sochi in 2014 and PyeongChang in 2018 it can help bring winter sport to new audiences and rekindle the enthusiasm of sponsors and broadcasters. Amy Williams, who won skeleton gold for Britain in Vancouver, said: &quot;It&apos;s great to take winter sports out of their traditional haunts of Europe and America and give Asia a fantastic opportunity to further encourage participation. I know the passion the area has for winter sports and I&apos;m sure PyeongChang will stage a fantastic Games.&quot; In its presentation, PyeongChang highlighted the fact that 19 of the previous 21 Winter Olympics had been concentrated in the west with a map of the world under the motto &quot;new horizons&quot;. The tactic has secured another triumph for the public relations strategist Mike Lee, who also worked on the successful bids for the Rio 2016 Olympics and the 2022 Qatar World Cup bid. &quot;There is a lesson in the achievements of PyeongChang in that patience and perseverance were rewarded. I am sure we will have great success with them,&quot; said Jacques Rogge, the IOC president who is due to stand down in 2013. The PyeongChang bid leader, Cho Yang-ho, said: &quot;Over the course of 10 years of bidding we have been listening and learning from the Olympic family. Today, our effort and commitment to hosting the Winter Games has been rewarded.&quot; There had been some disquiet before the vote concerning the extent to which the South Korean electronics giant Samsung had bankrolled the bid and signed sponsorship deals with international sporting federations. The leader of the Annecy team, Charles Beigbeder, said before the vote: &quot;We are here to put on an authentic Games. We are not there to get a trophy for a company or a country.&quot; As ever with IOC voting processes, there were a number of political factors at play beyond the relative strengths of the three bids. By selecting a non-European winner, the IOC members made it more likely that another European city could join the fray for the 2020 summer Games. So far, only Rome, Tokyo and Istanbul have shown their hand. Dubai and Qatar are considering bids, while there is speculation over whether Madrid and Paris will try again. Hundreds of South Koreans gathered at a giant ski-jump in PyeongChang to celebrate the decision. It means that in the space of 30 years, the country will have hosted the summer and winter Olympics, as well as the World Cup. &quot;I am definitely not pessimistic about the future of the Winter Games,&quot; Rogge said. &quot;There are already bids being prepared in Europe and the US. New regions can also apply in the future. I think of mid-Asia, Kazakhstan, as an example where they are thinking of bidding for the Games.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 7 July 2011.

Bought by new Qatari owners in the days before Royal Ascot, the David Brown-trained colt returned an immediate dividend when taking the Windsor Castle Stakes. That five-furlong Listed contest does not always produce winners worth following but this year&apos;s renewal looked considerably more competitive than usual, 17 of the 24 runners having won before. A new question is asked here, as Frederick Engels moves up in grade and in trip. But he looked to be crying out for the extra distance last time, as it was only in the last 100 yards that he really hit top gear, and the time strongly suggested that he is ready to tackle these tougher rivals. Roman Soldier is a good-looking horse who made Power work all the way to get on top in the Coventry Stakes. He holds North Star Boy on that form and looks the obvious danger to the selection.

He was a little unlucky not to be awarded that race in the stewards&apos; room, having been clearly impeded by the winner in the closing stages, but compensation awaits in the Bahrain Trophy and victory should lead to a tilt at the St Leger. Mijhaar (2.25) has been treated with leniency by the handicapper in being edged up just 2lb for finishing fourth in the King Edward VII Stakes on his latest start.

Chris Cook: The teenage superjock has driven Murura (12-1) to victory in the five-furlong handicap that closes today&apos;s card at Newmarket, taking his British record to 11 from 45 (24%). I&apos;m beginning to think he may have a future in the game. Whozthecat (12-1) and Lujeanie (13-2) were the placed horses. The winner is trained in Ireland by James Hartnett. 4.05pm Barzalona scores Chris Cook: Godolphin have got a winner at the July Meeting, landing the Portland Place Conditions Stakes with Bridgefield (9-1), ridden by the teenage superjock Mickael Barzalona, deputising for the suspended Frankie Dettori.  Stuffed in the Britannia at Royal Ascot, Bridgefield settled nicely at the back of this five-runner field and moved smoothly up to lead when asked. Cai Shen cut out the running for Hannon / Moore and stuck on fairly well but was passed for second close home by Hannon&apos;s other runner, Casual Glimpse (Paul Hanagan), who won on this card last year. Fury, who missed the Jersey at Royal Ascot with a poisoned foot, pulled too hard through the first half of this race and faded to be last. Barzalona has won 10 of his 44 rides in Britain so far, a strike-rate of 23%. Thanks to his Derby success, he has amassed \u00a3930,000 in prize money. Has any rider ever made such a brilliant start in this country? 3.45pm Will Hayler tackles a Newmarket knight Sir Michael Stoute was in a jolly mood after the victory of Crystal Capella, a mare who has clearly tested his patience in the last couple of seasons.However he wasn&apos;t in a jolly enough mood to reveal any running plans for Workforce, who remains just a &quot;possible&quot; for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot later this month. &quot;We left him in at the last entry stage,&quot; he, err, revealed. &quot;We&apos;ll make a decision when we have a clearer idea as to what conditions will be like.&quot; 3.35pm Hannon and Moore are a winning team again Chris Cook: For the second year running, Richard Hannon and Ryan Moore have won the Earl of Euston Conditions Stakes, this time with Harbour Watch, who pulled nicely clear of the favourite, Burwaaz (11-8), in the closing stages. Harbour Watch, who won his maiden at Salisbury, holds a couple of entries at York&apos;s Ebor meeting next month, in the immensely valuable sales race that Wootton Basset won last year and also, of course, the Gimcrack. Moore is now the leading jockey at the July Meeting on a princely two wins. Casual Glimpse, who won that race for Hannon and Moore last year, runs in the next. He has struggled since this day last year, finishing eighth of 11 in the Gimcrack on his next start. On his most recent run, he was last of six in a Listed race on Oaks day. 3.09pm Crystal Capella (4-1) hacks up in Princess of Wales&apos;s Stakes Chris Cook: The mare came well clear of the opposition under Ryan Moore to give a welcome boost to Sir Michael Stoute, a trainer who has been rather short of winners over the last month. Redwood (2-1) and Buthelezi (12-1) were second and third at respectful intervals. Buthelezi cut out the early running and tacked over to the far rail on entering the straight. Although no one else went right over, the rest of the field edged across to race centre-to-far-side up the straight. The winner continues a remarkable sequence for Stoute, as outlined in this morning&apos;s Racing Post. In odd-numbered years (2005, 07, 09 and now 11) he wins the Princess of Wales with a horse that does not start favourite. In even-numbered years (2006, 08, 10), he has fielded the beaten favourite.  I doubt whether he&apos;s a superstitious sort of chap but, if he were, he might conclude that there was no point in turning up for next year&apos;s race. Crystal Capella is the first female to win this race since Height Of Fashion in 1982. She is Stoute&apos;s eighth Princess of Wales winner. It&apos;s a couple of years since Crystal Capella beat Dar Re Mi in the Middleton Stakes, which would surely count as top-class form. This is only her sixth run since then, so there have clearly been problems and she is said to have a tendency to throw splints. Today, she has finished eight lengths clear of Redwood, who won \u00a3641,000 on his most recent start, when second in the Dubai Sheema Classic behind Rewilding in March. For finishing second today, Redwood gets \u00a317,200. Doubtless, Khalid Abdullah will bear this news with what fortitude he can muster. 2.30pm Fulgur (7-1) beats the gambled-on Mijhaar Chris Cook: The first handicap of the July Meeting has been won by Luca Cumani and Kieren Fallon, the team responsible for Fulgur, who ran on strongly to beat Mijhaar (13-8). The latter was the subject of a major gamble for this 19-runner race and it almost came off. Fulgur trailed Mijhaar by four and a half lengths when the pair were fourth and fifth behind Nathaniel in the King Edward VII at Royal Ascot, but had a 7lb pull this time. Labarinto (11-1) was third and Malthouse (16-1) fourth. 2.25pm Bath&apos;s bend to be probed Chris Cook: Bath&apos;s card next Thursday will now be an all-sprint affair, with no race over more than five furlongs and 161 yards, following the incident last night when Aviso slipped up and fell on entering the bend out of the far side. Katie Stephens, the clerk of the course, has said today: &quot;Due to the issue that arose at Bath yesterday, when the ground around the bottom bend was found to be unsafe, it became clear that an immediate review of the bend would be required and this is already underway with the BHA Inspectorate.&quot; 2.17pm John Gosden on Masked Marvel, winner of the first race &quot;He ran a nice race [in a Listed event at Goodwood] and Mr [Bjorn] Nielsen was keen to run in the Derby but he simply did not handle the track at Epsom, which not many of them do.  &quot;Jimmy [Fortune] said that in the final furlong the horse was looking at the stands and the tents and was pulling himself up.  &quot;I liked the way he went about it and he was staying on at the end, so it will be straight to the Leger now. There&apos;s no point carrying a penalty in the Gordon Stakes, and you can have a hard race in the Voltigeur [at York]. He has done plenty this season so we will keep him fresh and go straight to Doncaster.&quot;  Masked Marvel is a 14-1 chance for the Leger with Hills, alongside Census, today&apos;s runner-up.  Gosden also trains Nathaniel, who is currently favourite for the Leger, although connections have suggested he may instead be kept to a mile and a half this year. 2pm Star filly hit by car in Newmarket Chris Cook: A filly named Jessica Ennis, after the athlete, was injured in Newmarket this morning after being hit by a car. The unraced two-year-old, trained by Michael Bell for a Highclere syndicate, is said to have panicked during routine schooling in starting stalls and managed to drop Hayley Turner before careering onto a nearby road. Fortunately, both Turner and the driver were uninjured. Harry Herbert, Highclere&apos;s managing director, said of Jessica Ennis: &quot;The good news is that she&apos;s not broken any limbs. She&apos;s under the knife to get her lacerations stitched up. The frustrating thing is that she&apos;s good.&quot; 1.54pm Engels wins again Chris Cook: Frederick Engels (7-4) won the July Stakes, battling to victory over Roman Soldier (6-4) and Bannock. The latter set what seemed a solid pace and ran on well, improving on his sixth place in the Norfolk Stakes. Frederick Engels tracked him, looking like the best horse for most of the race, and hit the front with a furlong to go. He was driven out to beat Roman Soldier by about a length. Roman Soldier was beaten a neck by Power in the Coventry when last seen and that would normally be the best two-year-old race at Royal Ascot, but Frederick Engels won an excellent renewal of the Windsor Castle, as Will noted in today&apos;s paper. It will be interesting to see the next runs by the placed horses from that race, Stonefield Flyer and Caspar Netscher. The first three pulled three lengths clear of the rest. 1.50pm Will Hayler on the Bahrain Trophy It was an interesting decision from the jockeys riding in the opener to go up the middle of the course \u2013 seemingly supporting suggestions from those who have walked the course that the fastest part of the track is on neither rail. Although Masked Marvel started to hang towards the far side as he tired, he had already done enough to put the result beyond doubt and John Gosden confirmed afterwards that he sees the horse as a contender for the Ladbrokes St Leger, for which he is a best-priced 16-1 chance with the sponsors. &quot;I he&apos;ll probably go straight there now as I&apos;d like him to be as fresh as possible. Jimmy said that he was just looking around him at the tents and stands towards the finish and pulling himself up,&quot; he said. Interestingly, Gosden was asked which side of the track he expected to see Buthelezi make his challenge in the Princess of Wales&apos;s Stakes, and replied: &quot;Nicky (Mackay) likes to go from side to side on the way down and try out the track, so we&apos;ll have to see what he decides.&quot; 1.23pm Masked Marvel (2-1) wins the Bahrain Trophy Chris Cook: . . . having made much of the running, but Census backers can count themselves unlucky. The Highclere horse, settled behind the pace, was held in by Crimson Knight when Ryan Moore seemed to want to pull around Masked Marvel a couple of furlongs out and Census had his head on one side for much of the race thereafter. He got a clear run almost immediately, took time to wind himself up and produced a powerful finish, just failing to reel in Masked Marvel. Zain Al Boldan ran on into third as the others dropped away to be well beaten. William Buick has missed a winner there, as he has ridden Masked Marvel on every start so far but is suspended today. Jimmy Fortune got the ride. Masked Marvel was last seen running eighth in the Derby, just ahead of Pisco Sour (a Royal Ascot winner) and Seville (second in the Irish Derby). Previously, he beat Namibian in the Cocked Hat at Goodwood, which used to be called the Predominate. Namibian then won the Queen&apos;s Vase at Ascot, beating Solar Sky, who was stuffed in today&apos;s race. Census&apos;s good effort can be seen as a boost to the form of Brown Panther, who beat him six lengths (though carrying 3lb less) in a handicap at Ascot. Census was only raised 3lb for that effort and I can&apos;t help thinking there must have been a handicap for him somewhere, possibly quite a valuable one. Instead, he will be raised again for finishing second in this Group Three, though at least he&apos;s picked up \u00a310,000. 1.15pm Going now good at Newmarket Chris Cook: The track took 5mm in about half an hour this morning and is now officially good all over, having been mostly good to firm. The clerk of the course, Michael Prosser, says he&apos;ll talk to the jockeys after the first race and may revise his view then. Today&apos;s best bets, by Will Hayler If the first race sets the tone for the rest of the action, then I&apos;m not entirely sure what Newmarket&apos;s Bahrain Trophy says about this year&apos;s July Meeting (sponsored by Piper &amp; Heidsieck \u2013 that&apos;s got to be worth a complimentary crate for the Talking Horses Christmas party). As Classic trials go, it&apos;s got a roll of honour which is more &apos;who?&apos; than &apos;wow&apos;. Who can, err, forget the victory of the Paul Howling-trained Anousa in 2004, or the success of Donegal, still without a win from 11 starts over jumps in Ireland, in 2008. But Youmzain scored under Tony Culhane in 2006 and Persian Punch was also successful in the race in 1996, so there has been the odd good winner and it wouldn&apos;t be a big surprise if this year&apos;s winner proved half-decent too. With Nathaniel&apos;s owner preferring to keep that colt over a mile and a half this season, Masked Marvel has emerged as John Gosden&apos;s leading St Leger hope and he must have a decent shout, while Census&apos;s second to Brown Panther at Royal Ascot shouldn&apos;t be devalued simply by one below-par performance from the winner in Germany at the weekend. However, it&apos;s Solar Sky (1.20) who gets my vote, not least because, out of the big three in the betting, it was he who I thought would have gained the most from the experience of his latest run when edged out by Namibian in the Queen&apos;s Vase. He was effectively outmuscled there, having hit the front, but that was just the third start of his career and the first time he had really been asked a proper question on the racecourse. Sir Henry Cecil rates him highly and he might not look a bad bet for the Leger at 16-1 or higher on Betfair if he can deliver the big run I expect today. I&apos;ve raved about Burwaaz (3.35) enough already and his hugely promising run at Royal Ascot to make it obvious that I think he&apos;ll take plenty of beating today. Kieren Fallon still isn&apos;t out of the jockeys&apos; championship reckoning if he can get a run going, but it will require no more trips to court for driving offences and injunction hearings, not to mention late arrivals at the track caused by heavy traffic. It&apos;s interesting that Fallon is prepared to hit the A1 after riding at Newmarket today in a bid to get up to Doncaster for one booked ride aboard Submission (8.10) this evening. I strongly suspect we haven&apos;t seen the best of this filly yet this season, as, although she only scrambled home by a short-head last time, things didn&apos;t really go her way \u2014 she was too keen for her own good in the early stages. At two, Luca Cumani pitched this filly into Group-race company in the Rockfel and, although she failed to get involved at the finish, it speaks plenty about the esteem in which she was held at the time. Cumani is simply not the sort of trainer to tilt at windmills. Maybe she hasn&apos;t quite lived up to expectations. After all, this is only an ordinary handicap. But there&apos;s still time on Submission&apos;s side and I strongly fancy her to take this on the way to better things. To be frank, I was expecting her to be odds-on and 5-4 looks a perfectly fair price. Tipping competition, day four Chris1623 moved up into fourth place with a double yesterday, picking Rosewin (9-2) and Dreams Of Glory (5-1), while tiznow is close behind, having found Dreams Of Glory and Red Courtier (5-2).

For Republic of South Sudan, there was a further urgent priority \u2013 a football team. As part of the independence celebrations, a friendly against a Kenyan premier league team, Tusker, was scheduled on Sunday. But who would play for the new national side? First, a call went out to the four or five southerners who regular represented the old, united Sudan, as it was before succession on Saturday. However, most players are contracted to clubs in Khartoum and could not get permission to leave. But James Joseph could. The tall, veteran striker for the national team was playing for a club in Goa, India, when he received the urgent call to go home. He did not think twice, paying his own way to Juba, via Dubai and Nairobi. &quot;I felt so lucky to be able to play for my own country at last,&quot; said Joseph, who is originally from the southern town of Nimule, but grew up in Khartoum during the 21-year civil war. His teammates that joined him at the 10-day training camp were all locally based. Among them was Joseph&apos;s strike partner, Khamis Leiluno, a barrel-chested 23-year-old from Wau, who was also the team captain. He spoke no English \u2013 the official working language of the new republic \u2013 but was apparently prolific in front of goal. &quot;We are ready to tell the world that South Sudan is around,&quot; he said. Translating for him was midfielder Justin Wani, who casually mentioned that his father was killed during the war with the north. The last line of defence was goalkeeper Yahaya Abas. He plays for a club in Juba, though not for money. &quot;Here we play for the love of the game,&quot; he said. But this game \u2013 the country&apos;s first \u2013 was about more than love. It was about forging unity, said the coach, Malis Soro. For all its togetherness in rejecting the oppression from the north, South Sudan is made up dozens of ethnicities and still lacks a real national identity. &quot;Football is a medium to bring people together,&quot; Soro said, sitting under a tree at the White Nile Lodge, a dozen footballs and stacked orange cones at his feet. So, a squad, a coach, a team hotel and a team bus \u2013 or rather two battered minibuses that normally served as collective taxis. But what of a uniform? Soro pointed to two sets of jersey hanging from one of the player&apos;s doors: one red, the other white and green. They had been bought from shops in Dubai and Uganda, he said. The words &quot;South Sudan&quot; had been ironed on the back, and small flag on the front. Some had already peeled off. A sponsor? He laughed. But the team&apos;s home field did have sponsors, including Chinese and Malaysian petroleum firms working in South Sudan&apos;s rich oilfields. They had paid Chinese contractors to renovate Juba&apos;s main stadium, built on the Nile&apos;s banks in 1962. The pitch had been relaid, and was now a lush emerald green. Floodlights had been erected \u2013 a standout feature in a city without streetlights \u2013 and new chairs installed. The seating capacity was around 1,600, said Daniel Abas, treasurer of Juba&apos;s football association. Hundreds more people could stand, he said. Asked about tickets, he replied that entrance would be free. &quot;When we decide that the number inside is enough we will close the doors and say &apos;Enough&apos;. The police will do their work.&quot; Despite their captain&apos;s confidence, the players acknowledged that their first game together would be tough. Their height \u2013 many southerners are extraordinarily tall \u2013 may be an asset in basketball, but not necessarily in football. Indeed, coach Soro said their playing style would be less like Barcelona, his favourite team, than a physical English side. Was he nervous? &quot;Yes. I&apos;m a coach \u2013 I am supposed to win.&quot; Early in the game on Sunday night, in front of an enthusiastic crowd, it looked as if he might. But after taking the lead, his team scored an own goal, then the Kenyan team doubled their tally. A second own goal made it 3\u20131. Still, the crowd was not too perturbed.

Ali adds: &quot;Rather than dreary shopping malls, souks are colourful, noisy, fascinating, inspired places to be. There&apos;s a unique, authentic, raw quality to souks. It&apos;s such an exciting idea for Bradford.&quot; QED has put in an outline bid to the Government&apos;s regional growth fund for a 60,000 sq ft space, with room for small businesses to design, make, demonstrate and alter products \u2013 another characteristic of Arab souks.

It&apos;s a chance to really celebrate the diverse culture the city offers and to put Bradford firmly on the map in a positive, thriving way.&quot; He&apos;s signed up chartered accountants Clough and Co, commercial property agency Andrew Idle Associates, construction consultants Rex Proctor and Partners and Watson Batty Architects.

The Plumstead-raised artist \u2013 otherwise known as Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu Jr \u2013 has won a tonne of praise for uniting the disparate music scenes of grime, underground rave and radio-friendly pop without selling any of them out. He&apos;s had two No 1 singles, a No 1 album and two Brit awards. One of the fringe benefits of fame is that you get to discover new experiences in eating. Born in London to Nigerian parents, Tinie has always appreciated his food. He reminisces about an &quot;amazing&quot; roast chicken with garlic\u00a0and thyme jus that he had at the Salon Millesime in the Carlton Hotel, New York. &quot;They warned me it would take 45 minutes. After about 35 minutes, they brought out an almost-cooked chicken and told me it was coming along nicely, and 10 minutes later I\u00a0ate the best chicken I&apos;ve ever\u00a0had.&quot; Whenever he visits a new country,\u00a0Tinie heads off the beaten\u00a0track to try some traditional food \u2013 the old town in Dubai or backstreet places in Australia. &quot;Didn&apos;t\u00a0enjoy kangaroo,&quot; he says. &quot;It\u00a0was like a cross between beef and chicken, smoky and really chewy.&quot; He&apos;s kept a picture of the receipt on his phone: stubbie, stubbie, stubbie, kangaroo \u2026 and chips. Nigerian food is a fundamental part of his life. It&apos;s what he grew up\u00a0with and it builds up the palate because it&apos;s packed with flavour. &quot;Nigerian food is lots of flavour, lots of tomato pur\u00e9e, rice, yam, beans\u2026 it&apos;s a whole load of stuff, really good.&quot; His favourite would be pounded yam with egusi soup, a\u00a0savoury soup with meat and spinach which exists in countless variants across West Africa. He has a couple of favourite Nigerian restaurants, both on the Old Kent Road in south-east London: the classy 805 and the more home-style Presidential Suya\u00a0Grill. They&apos;re both family-run businesses, friendly and personal. Presidential, in particular, is one of\u00a0those places where you feel like you&apos;re in Nigeria, he says. &quot;There is\u00a0a real nice atmosphere. When I\u00a0come back from travelling the world, I do like to go there and chill.\u00a0It&apos;s humbling.&quot; He&apos;s a recent convert to seafood. Tinie used to be apprehensive about\u00a0shellfish and squid. Then he saw that his Maltese mate, who ate it all the time, was light on his feet and full of energy, whereas a steak would wipe Tinie out. Then he tried\u00a0a seafood linguine, &quot;and all my\u00a0prayers were answered. It just felt right \u2013 it was light but it filled me\u00a0up. I could still run around and\u00a0do my thing.&quot; The recipe: Seafood linguine Serves four as a starter. 325g linguineSea salt and freshly ground black pepperA knob of butter75ml olive oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped200g raw prawns, peeled and deveined4 large scallops, shelled, cleaned and halved4 langoustines, cleaned The tail of 1 small lobster, cooked, peeled and sliced4 ripe plum tomatoes, peeled,  deseeded and diced8 basil leaves, finely chopped100g clams, cleanedLemon juice, to taste (about \u00bd\u00a0lemon)A pinch of dried chilli flakesLemon wedges, to serve Three-quarters fill a large saucepan with water and bring to a boil.

Add the butter and all but a dash of the oil, and gently fry the garlic and onion until soft. Add the prawns, scallops, langoustines and lobster tail slices, and fry quickly for about two minutes. As soon as the pasta is cooked, drain, toss with a dash of olive oil and add to the frying pan, along with the tomatoes, basil, salt, pepper and\u00a0clams.

Johnny Borrell loves salmon     Razorlight's Johnnie Borrell: Cooking's creative \u2013 it's the same impulse as writing or painting. If you've got that interest, it will transfer to cooking Photograph: Patrice de Villiers    Johnny Borrell was a latecomer to the kitchen. &quot;But cooking&apos;s creative \u2013 it&apos;s the same impulse as writing or painting. If you&apos;ve got that interest, it will transfer to cooking. There&apos;s the macho gamesmanship aspect, too. I&apos;ve got at least three friends who reckon they&apos;re the best cooks in the world \u2013 as all blokes do.&quot; He likes to cook dishes that take plenty of time: &quot;Something with the quality of a grand project. Get a few cod fillets and leave them salting in your airing cupboard for a week, to get that deep flavour. Something epic.&quot; Borrell grew up on fish fingers, chips and pizza, and discovered food by travelling the world with his band, Razorlight. (They chose to sign with Universal in part because the label took them out for a better meal than rival bidders.) Most bands don&apos;t take enough advantage of the places they visit, he says, but Razorlight consult the Zagat guide and try to go local. At home he loves the Bell in Oxfordshire. &quot;I&apos;ll turn up starving and without fail they&apos;ve got an incredible hot, crusty roll with coarse Ardennes p\u00e2t\u00e9.&quot; And the Food Lab in Islington does a brilliant Italian-English breakfast. Then there&apos;s the temple of nose-to-tail eating, St John in Smithfield. &quot;It&apos;s not for the squeamish \u2013 it&apos;s brains and hearts and tails \u2013 but I&apos;m not squeamish. There&apos;s nothing I\u00a0wouldn&apos;t eat off their menu.&quot; But the best thing he&apos;s ever eaten was a little less exalted. When Borrell was first trying to become a musician, he lived on the dole with a friend who wanted to be a writer. One week their benefits didn&apos;t come through and they applied for \u2013 &quot;This sounds very dramatic&quot; \u2013 a hardship loan. They queued for three hours, filled in the forms and waited. &quot;We&apos;d spent all our money on alcohol and cigarettes, and hadn&apos;t eaten in two days.&quot; When the \u00a335 loan came through, they ran straight to Safeway on Holloway Road, bought lamb chops and ran home. &quot;The feeling of just getting these chops home was sheer delight. We chucked them in the pan \u2013 I think we seared them for only a minute on each side \u2013 and just devoured them. It&apos;s got to be the most satisfying thing I&apos;ve ever eaten. That&apos;s my Proustian lamb chop, the one I&apos;ll always remember. It&apos;ll never get better than that.&quot; The recipe: Smoked salt and chilli crispy-skin salmon Serves four. Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon1 tbsp smoked sea salt flakes\u00bd tbsp chopped fresh parsley\u00bd tsp dried chilli flakes4 salmon fillets, about 150g each, descaledOil, for brushing and frying4 tbsp soy sauce In a small bowl, mix together the\u00a0lemon zest, smoked sea salt, parsley and chilli flakes. Put to one\u00a0side. Check over the salmon for pin bones, removing any you come across. Lay the fillets skin-side up on\u00a0a board and score the skin with a\u00a0sharp knife. Brush with some oil and rub in most of the salt mixture. Heat a large frying pan over a high heat and add a little oil. Lay the salmon skin-side down in\u00a0the pan, fry for three minutes, then turn over and sprinkle with half of the lemon juice. Cook for another minute or two, until the fish is cooked through. Transfer to warm plates, drizzle with the soy sauce and finish with the remaining salt mixture and a\u00a0squeeze of lemon.

Melt 50g of the butter in a frying pan over medium heat and sweat the onion until soft. Set aside to cool. Mix the flours and baking powder in a bowl, then rub in the rest of the butter until it resembles breadcrumbs. Make a well in the centre. In another bowl, whisk the remaining ingredients, pour into the flour, add\u00a0the onion and mix to combine (add a\u00a0little more milk if it&apos;s too dry). Turn out on to a floured surface and gently roll to about 3cm thick. Using a scone cutter, cut out eight rounds and place on a floured baking\u00a0sheet. Score the tops and brush with milk.

When he was younger and worked on building sites, his standard brew was\u00a0two bags, one cup. &quot;I liked it really strong,&quot; he says. &quot;Then, one day, I saw how brown and\u00a0manky the inside of the\u00a0cup was and I\u00a0thought, &apos;That&apos;s what\u00a0my insides look like \u2013 better get off it.&apos;&quot; Like a true tea drinker, Gallagher has rules that\u00a0must not be broken. Milk goes in last. Put your sugar in first, with the teabag, then fill it up\u00a0to about an inch from the top and leave it for a\u00a0good while. And what colour should the tea be?\u00a0&quot;You know the Quality Street toffees in the yellow wrapper?&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s got to be the exact\u00a0same colour as them or it&apos;s going down the\u00a0sink.&quot; When in London, he makes his own cuppa because &quot;there&apos;s a lack of good tea-making\u00a0down here. Paul Weller&apos;s tea-making leaves a lot to be desired. It&apos;s pretty watery and the colour&apos;s not right.&quot; And, like a true connoisseur, Gallagher wonders about the mysteries of tea. How old should you be before you start drinking it? Why can&apos;t you get a decent cup of tea in America? &quot;Because the whole country runs on coffee, caffeine and people talking a load of shit.&quot; And why, as Nicky Wire of the Manic Street Preachers has pointed out, do\u00a0people in London never use teapots? &quot;Tells you a\u00a0lot about London, that,&quot; says Gallagher. He admits he is not a great cook, although insists his missus is. &quot;She&apos;s\u00a0truly excellent \u2013 she\u00a0could have made a profession out of it.&quot; He\u00a0retains a taste for the things he loved as a kid, like fish and chips. With his mum raising three sons on\u00a0her own, the Gallaghers were &quot;on\u00a0the breadline. We were just eating to survive.&quot; He didn&apos;t go to a Chinese restaurant until he was about 21, and\u00a0still rates his first ever\u00a0Chinese \u2013\u00a0at\u00a0the famously brusque Wong Kei\u00a0on Wardour Street, London, with Inspiral Carpets, for whom he used to roadie \u2013 as probably\u00a0his favourite meal ever. &quot;It was like a\u00a0whole new world,&quot; he says. &quot;I\u00a0used\u00a0to live in\u00a0that place in the\u00a090s. Best hangover cure ever\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that and a can of Coke.&quot; Mick Hucknall loves lobster thermidor     Mick Hucknall: 'I loathe Michelin-starred food. To me, it loses touch with what food should be. I like really good quality, fresh, well-bred food, cooked simply.' Photograph: Patrice de Villiers    Reputations once earned tend to stick, and Mick Hucknall will always have a name as a lover of both food and women. The latter is a bit out of date \u2013 he is now happily married with a daughter \u2013 but the former passion remains intact. He&apos;s been a vintner since the late 90s, producing wines under the name Il Cantante (&quot;the singer&quot;) from grapes grown in the volcanic Sicilian soils of Mount Etna, but Hucknall tries to let his own offerings speak for themselves. &quot;It&apos;s all well and good being a pop star, but what does that have to do with wine?&quot; he asks. &quot;I&apos;ve tried to avoid the celebrity angle.&quot; Hucknall has owned restaurants in the past, too. There was a minor stake in a bar in his native Manchester, and a Parisian restaurant, Man Ray, co-owned with Johnny Depp, Sean Penn and John Malkovich, an experience he recalls with a shiver. &quot;It becomes a chain round your neck. I&apos;d advise any aspiring pop star or actor to never ever invest in clubs or restaurants. You&apos;ll get screwed. Stick with what you&apos;re good at.&quot; A genuinely disadvantaged youth has made Hucknell appreciate the fruits of his success all the more. His mother left when he was three years old and his father, a barber, brought him up &quot;just above the poverty line&quot;. It was mostly northern dishes on the table at home in Denton: &quot;Lancashire hotpot, steak and cow-heel pie\u2026 it sounds like Desperate Dan food, doesn&apos;t it? But when they&apos;re made well, these dishes can stand up to anything in the world.&quot; After Hucknall left home and moved into a bedsit in Moss Side in the early 80s, he learned to cook by default, picking up a talent for Indian food from shopkeepers in Rusholme. When Simply Red took off, he discovered a love of Italian, then French and German food. &quot;German food&apos;s very underrated,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s so beautifully simple. Roast goose, or Schweinshaxe \u2013 a roast knuckle of pork with crispy skin\u2026 it&apos;s so good..&quot; The best meal he ever had, he says, was as a guest of one of the founders of Gambero Rosso, the Italian equivalent to Michelin, who took the band to a restaurant in the back streets of Rome. &quot;We ate until about four in the morning, a beautiful array prepared with such skill and care that it was astonishing. The whole band were fainting because of its brilliance.&quot; He feels he&apos;s come full circle with high-end cuisine. &quot;Having lived in Paris for a number of years, I now loathe Michelin-starred food. To me, it loses touch with what food should be. I like really good quality, fresh, well-bred food, cooked simply. The Michelin thing underwhelms me. You&apos;re supposed to be grateful for a three-inch piece of fish on a huge plate for 50 quid. It bores me.&quot; Though he loves lobster, as seen in the photograph, he&apos;s just as happy with a tricolore salad. &quot;Italian food is just genius,&quot; he says. &quot;Tomato, mozzarella and basil. Or garlic, oil and red pepper on pasta \u2013 those things are timeless.&quot; Does Hucknall&apos;s track record prove the old saying that a lad will never be short of a girlfriend if he can cook? &quot;It definitely helps,&quot; he smiles. &quot;I mean, if you can&apos;t take her to a restaurant, you&apos;re either going to her place or yours, aren&apos;t you?&apos; The recipe: Lobster thermidor with roasted vegetables Serves four. 2 large lobsters, cooked40g parmesan, freshly grated  For the sauce60g butter2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped570ml fish stock2 tbsp medium dry white wine110ml double cream\u00bd tsp English mustard1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley1 tbsp chopped fresh chives1 tbsp chopped fresh dillJuice of 1 lemonPinch of cayenne pepperSea salt and freshly ground black pepperLemon wedges, to serve For the roasted vegetables 8 tbsp olive oil2 large red onions, peeled and quartered10 asparagus spears, trimmed and cut into long diagonal slices2 courgettes, trimmed, halved and cut into thick diagonal slices1 fennel bulb, trimmed, halved lengthways and cut into 1cm thick slices8 garlic cloves, peeled 1 tbsp fennel seeds, crushedPinch of sea salt (ideally Fleur de Sel de Camargue)4 trusses baby plum tomatoes on the vineGood-quality balsamic vinegar1 tbsp chopped fresh basil1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley Lay the cooked lobsters belly down on a board, hold firmly and cut lengthways in half. Remove all the meat from the claws, tail and head, saving any coral. Cut the meat up into small pieces and place back in the shell, along with the coral. For the sauce, melt the butter in a large saucepan, add the shallots and cook until softened. Add the stock, wine and cream and bring to the boil. Let bubble until reduced by half, then add the mustard, chopped herbs, lemon juice and cayenne. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Preheat the grill to high. Spoon the sauce over the lobster meat, sprinkle with the parmesan, and grill for three to four minutes until golden brown. Serve with lemon wedges. For the roasted veg, heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Pour half the olive oil into a large ovenproof dish and place in the oven to heat up. Meanwhile, put the red onions, asparagus, courgettes, fennel, garlic, fennel seeds, salt and remaining oil into a large bowl and toss. Carefully tip it all into the heated dish. Cook in the oven for 15 minutes, checking after 10 minutes and turning down the heat if the vegetables are browning too quickly. Add the tomatoes on their vines and roast for a further five minutes, or until the vegetables are caramelised.Serve immediately, drizzled with balsamic vinegar and sprinkled with the chopped herbs. Sir Cliff Richard loves curry     Sir Cliff Richard: 'Curry will always be my favourite food because it reminds me of my childhood. It's the most highly flavoured, the most vibrantly scented food there is.' Photograph: Patrice de Villiers    Harry Rodger Webb was born in Lucknow, India, in 1940 and grew up on curries. His father, Rodger, managed a catering company for the\u00a0sprawling Indian railways, and\u00a0though the Webbs were experiencing the final days of the Raj, they lived modestly, in Lucknow and later in Howrah. &quot;Curry will always be my favourite\u00a0food because it reminds me of my childhood,&quot; Sir Cliff Richard says, relaxing in his converted farmhouse in the Algarve, Portgual, bought with the\u00a0proceeds of six decades of hits and 260m record sales, and the\u00a0place where he likes to spend much of the\u00a0summer. &quot;It&apos;s the\u00a0most\u00a0highly flavoured, the most\u00a0vibrantly scented food there is.\u00a0After\u00a0we moved back to England in\u00a01948, my\u00a0mother used to hold back on the chilli, but we always used to ask her for more.&quot; He pauses. &quot;Well, I say we came back to\u00a0England, but I&apos;d never been before. Neither had my parents. But\u00a0we still talked about &apos;coming back to Blighty&apos;.&quot; In India his father had been relatively wealthy, but in England &quot;we had absolutely zero. We went through real poverty.&quot; One of the standard meals of the day would be\u00a0toast dipped in tea with sugar on\u00a0it. &quot;It was that bad.&quot; But a love of\u00a0curry stayed with him over the years \u2013 not so much the\u00a0heat as the spice. &quot;Spice is what\u00a0gives curry all its dimensions,&quot; he says. &quot;The cardamom seeds, the coriander, the cloves\u2026 Most Brits don&apos;t like the heat. I do, but I\u00a0like to\u00a0taste the food, too.&quot; In\u00a0particular, Richard loves chicken tikka masala, that peculiar, unbeatable, ever-changing but always dependable dish whose origins are lost in the past. (Is it Punjabi street food, or was it synthesised in the Indian kitchens of Soho and Glasgow? No one knows.) When he&apos;s back in England, Richard&apos;s favourite curry places are\u00a0School Of Spice in Shepperton or, a new favourite, the Tiger&apos;s Pad\u00a0in Sunningdale. He doesn&apos;t like\u00a0his Indian food too westernised, though. &quot;The\u00a0Bombay Brasserie had\u00a0the most fantastic starters,&quot; he\u00a0says, &quot;but I always thought the\u00a0main courses were too posh. I\u00a0like my curries to have a nice, thick sauce, I\u00a0like a good mound of lentils and rice. I like it traditional-style, lots of\u00a0everything.&quot; The recipe: Chicken tikka masala Serves four. 4 skinless chicken breasts, cut into 3cm cubesFor the chicken tikka marinade250ml plain yoghurt2 tbsp lemon juice2 tbsp ground cumin2 tbsp paprika2 tbsp freshly ground black pepper1 tsp ground cinnamon2.5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and gratedSea salt  For the tikka masala sauce15g butter2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 green chilli, deseeded and very finely chopped or grated2 tbsp ground coriander1 tsp ground cumin1 tsp paprika1 tsp garam masala\u00bd tsp sea salt400g tin chopped tomatoes250ml single cream4 tbsp coriander leaves, chopped  For the marinade, mix together the\u00a0yoghurt, lemon juice, cumin, paprika, black pepper, cinnamon, ginger and some salt in a large bowl.\u00a0Stir well and leave for 15\u201330 minutes. Add the chicken and turn\u00a0to make sure it is well coated. Cover and leave to marinate in the fridge for at\u00a0least two hours. Preheat the grill to medium. Thread the chicken pieces on to skewers and grill, turning regularly, for about 15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through \u2013 when pierced with a knife, the juices should run clear. Place on a plate to\u00a0rest while you make the sauce. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the garlic and chilli, cook for a\u00a0minute, then stir in the spices and\u00a0salt. Tip in the tomatoes and simmer gently for 30 minutes. Stir\u00a0in\u00a0the cream to enrich the sauce,\u00a0and cook gently for about five\u00a0minutes. Pull the chicken off the skewers, add to the sauce and place over a\u00a0low heat for five minutes, gently and\u00a0thoroughly to heat it through. Garnish with coriander and serve\u00a0immediately. Ellie Goulding loves sushi     Ellie Goulding: 'I hated sushi when I first tried it, but curiosity kept getting the better of me and I kept trying it, until it became my favourite thing.' Photograph: Patrice de Villkiers    &quot;I never used to eat fish a lot when I was young, but now it&apos;s like my body craves it. If I&apos;m out, I\u00a0try to order fish for every meal, and sea bass is the best in my opinion. If you\u00a0don&apos;t have fish often, you&apos;re more inclined to choose cod or tuna,\u00a0but sea bass is light and delicious. Grilled sea bass with Thai\u00a0vegetables is perfect. I hated sushi when I first tried it, and was quite\u00a0intimidated by it. But curiosity kept getting the better of me and I kept trying it, until it became my favourite thing.&quot; The recipe: Miso-glazed suzuki (sea bass) Serves four. 2 tbsp sake2 tbsp mirin1 tbsp light yellow miso paste1 tbsp brown sugar1 tbsp light soy sauce4 sea bass fillets, about 150g each, skinned1 tbsp chopped spring onions1 tbsp chopped fresh basil In a shallow dish, mix together the sake, mirin, miso paste, sugar and soy sauce. Place the fish fillets in the\u00a0marinade, turning them to make\u00a0sure they are entirely coated. Cover the dish with\u00a0clingfilm and refrigerate for six hours. Heat the grill to medium. Remove\u00a0the bass from\u00a0the marinade and place on a baking tray. Grill, close to the heat, without turning, until the\u00a0fillets are just about opaque in the centre \u2013 about six minutes. Transfer to warm plates, sprinkle over the spring onions and\u00a0basil, and serve with sticky rice or soba noodles. Brett Anderson loves blueberries     Brett Anderson: 'It was pearls before swine,' he says of the band's diet in Suede's 90s heyday. 'We'd be in Hollywood or Japan, and we just wanted chips.' Photograph: Patrice de Villiers    &quot;Music, food and sex are the three most important things in life,&quot; says Brett Anderson, singer with reunited glam-punk Britpop Suede. &quot;You can&apos;t do without any of them.&quot; He pauses and considers. &quot;Well, you can\u00a0do without a couple of them. But\u00a0you shouldn&apos;t. &quot;In the 90s, I had a phase of only eating brown rice for two months at a time,&quot; Anderson says. &quot;I was very unhealthy and I had this idea that brown rice would somehow be very good for me. Basically, all I\u00a0was putting in my body was brown\u00a0rice and cocaine, and that&apos;s not healthy.&quot; He kicked the drugs before Suede split up in 2003, and in 2007 he went\u00a0to see a naturopath: &quot;And that\u00a0changed my life.&quot; (His wife also\u00a0studies naturopathic medicine.) A diet tailored to his individual metabolism (no mushrooms, corn, milk or wheat) has &quot;really, really worked, to a startling degree\u2026 I\u00a0feel a lot better and I&apos;m very conscious of my diet now.&quot; Hence the love of antioxidant blueberries. Anderson makes his own muesli with oats, flax and crushed pumpkin and sunflower seeds, and the blueberries\u00a0go on top: &quot;I\u00a0try to have them every day.&quot; In Suede, eating well wasn&apos;t at the top of their priorities. &quot;It was pearls before swine. We&apos;d be in Hollywood or Japan, and we just wanted chips!&quot; The recipe: Blueberry fool Serves four. 450g blueberriesJuice of 1 lime425ml double cream400g mascarponeJuice of 2 lemons6 tsp honey4 fresh mint sprigsIcing sugar, for dusting Blend the blueberries and lime juice until smooth. Whisk the cream to peaks. In a bowl, gently combine the mascarpone, lemon juice, honey and three-quarters of the berry mix, then fold in the cream. Spoon or pipe into serving dishes and drizzle over the rest of the pur\u00e9e. Top with a mint sprig and a dusting of icing sugar.            (A behind-the-scenes video of Brett Anderson&apos;s shoot for Love Music Love Food) Juliette Lewis loves coconut and papaya     Juliette Lewis: 'Papaya and coconut are like instant vacations in your mouth.' Photograph: Patrice de Villiers    Music is a matter of dark and light, heaven and hell, good and evil, and all that sort of stuff. Thus the star of movies and rock and roll Juliette Lewis \u2013 who knows a little about such things, having starred in Cape Fear, Natural Born Killers and From Dusk Til Dawn \u2013 has both sinful and redemptive modes. &quot;It&apos;s yin and yang,&quot; she says. &quot;I love the healthy stuff and I love chocolate and ice cream, too. You have to balance it.&quot; She loves papaya \u2013 &quot;It goes with anything, it has natural digestive enzymes and the taste is wonderful&quot; \u2013 but it&apos;s clear that coconut is her real passion. Oh, the flavour, the scent, the texture\u2026 she uses coconut hair and skin lotions and, when at home in Los Angeles, has a regular coconut smoothie from her favourite juice place at home. &quot;It&apos;s decadent and sensual and natural all at the same time,&quot; she says. &quot;On a purely nutritional level, coconut water is pretty much the most hydrating thing you can drink, and much better than man-made sports drinks. If you&apos;re an energetic, physical person like me, it&apos;s hard to imagine anything better for you. Papaya and coconut are like instant vacations in your mouth.&quot; Lewis is rare in the ranks of actors turned musicians because, unlike certain movie stars&apos; vanity bands, her music actually stands up on its own \u2013 a raw but poppy garage-punk noise with the magnetic Lewis as its focal point. But how does one move from the comfortable world of movie-making to the grind of the touring rock band? When you play rock festivals, you&apos;re always &quot;pathetically grateful&quot; if the catering is good, she says. You always remember who feeds you well, such as the German festivals, Leeds, Reading and the Isle of Wight. &quot;If you&apos;re tired and haven&apos;t had a shower in days, you are so glad of any home comforts.&quot; But she does love the touring life, only occasionally missing favourite restaurants in LA, such as Little Dom&apos;s in Los Feliz or La Loggia in Studio City. Movie versus rock and roll \u2013 who&apos;s got the best food? &quot;Oh, please, do you even need to ask?&quot; she says, and laughs. &quot;There&apos;s so much more money in the movie world for food. I make a nice living from my touring, but half the time we live off bread and lunch meat.&quot; The recipe: Virgin detox cocktail Serves two. 50g papaya3 fresh mint leaves, shreddedJuice of 1 limeJuice of 1 fresh coconut, chilled4 cherries Put two martini glasses in the freezer to chill for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, peel and deseed the papaya, then cut into small cubes. Spoon the papaya into the chilled glasses, add the shredded mint and squeeze over the lime juice. Pour in\u00a0the coconut juice and garnish each with a couple of fresh cherries. Rolf Harris loves curry     Rolf Harris: 'One of the many great things about curry is that you can find your own personal optimum level of heat.' Photograph: Patrice de Villiers    &quot;Curry&apos;s my absolute favourite food,&quot; says Rolf Harris \u2013 painter and art educator, musician, creator of the wobble board, late-flowering patron saint of Glastonbury and international treasure in both hemispheres. &quot;My wife and I\u00a0have withdrawal symptoms if we don&apos;t have one every few days.&quot; Indian food has become central to the lives of Rolf and his wife, Arwen, whom he married in 1958. They started going to London&apos;s new wave of Indian restaurants in the late 1950s, when curry was far from widespread, and they&apos;ve stuck with it ever since. He has now developed a connoisseur&apos;s knowledge of curry houses in the Buckinghamshire-Berkshire area. They don&apos;t like it fiercely hot, they&apos;re in it for the endlessly fascinating mix of spices. &quot;One of the many great things about curry is that you can find your own personal optimum level of heat,&quot; he says. When touring, he has made it a tradition to take the band out for a curry after every date. &quot;We get the promoters to scout ahead, and we&apos;re rarely disappointed, because England is the world curry capital.&quot; He admits he&apos;s no great shakes in the kitchen \u2013 &quot;Scrambled egg is about as good as it gets&quot; \u2013 but why bother when every street in the land offers the finest dishes on earth? His love of bright, assertive flavours surely comes from his childhood in Perth, Australia, where his diet did not exactly sparkle. Rolf grew up on the &quot;very traditional&quot; English food of the years before the Australian culinary explosion. His mum&apos;s approach in the kitchen was &quot;to cook anything \u2013 meat, vegetables, whatever \u2013 until it was almost incinerated\u2026 Australian food is world-famous now, and rightly so, but when I was a kid it was overcooked British food, tomato ketchup with everything, very, very boring and every day your dinner was exactly the same. No wonder I love curry now.&quot; The recipe: Poori Serves four. 200g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting50g chapatti flour1 tsp curry powder1 tsp ground turmeric\u00bd tsp sea saltWarm water, to mixVegetable oil, for frying Put the flours, curry powder, turmeric and salt into a large bowl and mix well. Slowly mix in enough warm water to make a dough. Turn out on to a floured surface and work with your hands until smooth and elastic. Place back in the bowl, cover and leave to rest for 30 minutes. Knead the dough on a floured surface until light and springy. Divide into about 12 equal-sized pieces and roll into balls. Keep covered with a damp cloth. Take one ball of dough and roll it out into a 10\u201312cm round. Repeat with the rest. Pour a layer of oil into a heavy-based frying pan so it comes a quarter of the way up the sides, and place over a high heat. When very hot, carefully lower a dough round into the oil. Use a fish slice to baste and turn it, so that the poori swells up. It will be cooked in a few minutes. When golden brown, remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Keep warm while you cook the rest of the poori. \u2022 This is an edited extract from Love Music, Love Food \u2013 The Rock Star Cookbook, published by Quadrille at \u00a330 in support of Teenage Cancer Trust.

Age: 3+ Julia Donaldson, the newly appointed children&apos;s laureate, may be best known for The Gruffalo, but her huge output contains a great many other gems besides. Although The Rhyming Rabbit lacks the brilliant simplicity of The Gruffalo, the tale of a rabbit who can&apos;t stop making up verses \u2013 much to the irritation of everyone, until she finds a sheep with an equally poetic turn of mind \u2013 has a delightful dottiness which is just as captivating. The addition of glitter-encrusted illustrations by Lydia Monks makes it pretty, too. A Place to Call Home, by Alexis Deacon, illustrated by Viviane Schwarz (Walker, \u00a311.99). Age: 4+ There&apos;s an epic adventure at the heart of this witty picture book, as seven furry creatures burst out of the small, dark hole in which they were born and set out anxiously to find a new home. Inadequately armed and with no knowledge of the world beyond their hole, they bravely face up to the unknown, make several false starts, enter alien territory and see off opposition before finding a wonderful new world. Young readers will love knowing what the little animals don&apos;t as they follow the pictures and recognise the realities that lie behind this freshlyobserved adventure. Traction Man and the Beach Odyssey, by Mini Grey (Cape, \u00a310.99). Age: 5+ Mini Grey&apos;s irresistible Traction Man, a small toy with a large personality, is back for a new adventure of dramatic rescues and daring deeds. It&apos;s holiday time, and Traction Man packs everything, including mint cake and flexible flippers, that he might need for any eventuality at the seaside. Along with his friend Scrubbing Brush, Traction Man explores the wonders of the beach and, when his friend is swept out to sea by a giant wave, Traction Man sets out to save him. Soon, however, the two are off on a new adventure that is full of surprises \u2013 and even young ladies. As ever, the richly imagined world of Traction Man is packed full of the wonderful jokes that have made his adventures such a delight. Painting Out the Stars, by Mal Peet and Elspeth Graham, illustrated by Michael Foreman (Walker, \u00a35.99). Age: 4+ The magic of folk tales from long ago and far away is woven into these freshly written stories. Simply but lyrically told, they show how difficulties can be transformed by wonder in some way. In the first story, an ageing desert guide finds a baby girl guarded by a camel after a violent sandstorm; there&apos;s only a scrap of ribbon to give any clue to her birth. He takes both home and, as he ages and his sight fails, she becomes his eyes. When strangers arrive and ask for help, it is she who takes up his guiding skills, saves their lives and unravels the story of her past. Earwig and the Witch, by Diana Wynne Jones, illustrated by Marion Lindsay (HarperCollins, \u00a36.99). Age: 7+ There&apos;s a nice helping of magic and some brisk upbeat sentiment in this crisply written story. Earwig remembers nothing before her life at St Morwald&apos;s Home for Children. She is quite happy about that and never, ever wants to leave. But one day she is fostered \u2013 not by any ordinary couple but by Bella Yaga, a wicked witch, and her devilish companion, Mandrake. How the feisty Earwig outwits the pair with her own special skills and the help of Bella Yaga&apos;s cat Thomas is deliciously entertaining. Olivia&apos;s First Term, by Lyn Gardner (Nosy Crow, \u00a35.99). Age: 8+ Newly arrived at her grandmother&apos;s stage school, Olivia hates every moment of it as she struggles to fit in with the other pupils&apos; love of acting, dancing and music. It&apos;s not that Olivia doesn&apos;t have talent; she&apos;s been trained for the circus and especially the high wire by her father, who was once the best in the business. Olivia makes use of the incredible skill she practises in secret to solve a mystery and so bring down the school bully. This is a gripping story with a sharp eye for the power struggles within the classroom. The Picture History of Great Buildings, by Gillian Clements (Frances Lincoln, \u00a38.99). Age: 9+ From the world&apos;s earliest houses to the latest high-rises in Dubai, this is an information-packed guide to the cathedrals, temples, opera houses, parliament buildings, bridges and latterly banks that stand as the important monuments of their time. Illustrated in detail, each is briefly described and set on a timeline that gives a sense of the evolution of building in different places as well as some general background history. The illustrations make browsing fun, while a useful glossary makes this a good reference book too. The Island of Thieves, by Josh Lacey (Andersen, \u00a35.99). Age: 9+ Tom&apos;s holiday in London with his Uncle Harvey takes an unexpected turn when a man arrives, armed with a knife, and demands $100,000 within 24 hours. While Tom quakes, Uncle Harvey remains cool \u2013 once he&apos;s booked a flight to Peru.

The family and advisers of a fine young amateur golfer, the Englishman Tom Lewis in this instance, and the Mr 10%-ers auditioning for the right to represent his interests in the professional world. Five of the most powerful agents in European golf traipsed in for their 20-minute shot at the prize, and five traipsed out. But it appears there was a clear winner \u2013 with Lewis himself indicating he will sign with the International Management Group when he turns professional. As part of the agreement with IMG, there will be an advisory role for Daniel Field, the local club professional who has been looking after Lewis during his amateur career, according to reports. IMG looks after interests of some of the leading European players, including Matteo Manassero, who joined the paid ranks last year. The 18-year-old Italian has made his mark as a professional, already winning twice on the European Tour and vaulting to a place inside the world&apos;s top 30. Lewis, whose amateur record does not quite stand comparison with Manassero, cannot be expected to make the transition with such a aplomb. Nor can he be expected to live up to his own expectations of matching the six major championship victories of Nick Faldo, who learned to play golf at the same club in Welwyn Garden City. But he should do well, both on and off the course. Lewis has already said he will turn pro later this year after playing in the Walker Cup, the amateur equivalent of the Ryder Cup, as did Rory McIlroy in 2007, and like the Northern Irishman he will have three months \u2013 and half a dozen European Tour events \u2013 to win his coveted playing card for 2012. McIlroy earned his card with a top-five finish in the Dunhill Links at St Andrews, one of the most lucrative events in European golf. The 20-year-old Lewis will hope to do the same. If he does, the financial rewards will be great. As an amateur he is not allowed to enter into commercial agreements, or indeed formally sign with an agent, but there will be no shortage of corporate suitors. At Royal St George&apos;s this week he has been playing with Ping golf clubs, and wearing clothing by the German company, Hugo Boss. Both are expected to sponsor him once he turns pro and given his high profile this past week there will be other companies seeking to attach their name to his. Suffice to say, Lewis will be wealthy before he hits a ball in the pro world, though just how much he stands to make can only be guessed at. &quot;A comfortable six-figures \u2013 more if he makes his European Tour card straight away,&apos;&apos; said one of the game&apos;s leading deal-makers. &quot;If he doesn&apos;t, he will have to go to tour school or try his luck on the Challenge tour, where life is a bit tougher.&quot;", "title": "The Open 2011: Suitors flock to Tom Lewis as professional life beckons", "sentences": ["The dance is a familiar one and it took place six months ago in the clubhouse at the Emirates golf club in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-16T19:56:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/16/tattenham-corner-horse-racing", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Sister Sarah joins in Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s 18-year-old son Joseph enjoyed Classic success earlier this year aboard Roderic O&apos;Connor in the Irish 2,000 Guineas and another family member takes to the saddle for the first time in public on Sunday afternoon.

Indeed, if Blue Bunting manages to win Sunday&apos;s Irish Oaks and Rewilding follows up in the King George at Ascot on Saturday, there would be few years to compare with it. But those who work for Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s outfit have learned caution and there is not so much as a breath of premature excitement in the camp. Frankie Dettori, in his 18th year as Godolphin&apos;s principal jockey, was happy and relaxed at Newbury on Saturday but, asked how 2011 was going for his team, would only say: &quot;A week on Monday, you ask me.&quot; Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s spokesman, offers a variation on the theme. &quot;It takes more than one swallow to make a summer,&quot; he says when asked to reflect on the successes so far. Self-deprecation is a likeable trait but &quot;one swallow&quot; is surely underplaying it. The famous royal blue silks have led home their rivals in the Dubai Sheema Classic, the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes and the 1,000 Guineas, the first time since 2002 that Godolphin have managed to win a British Classic other than the unfashionable St Leger. The first two of those wins were achieved by Rewilding, trained by Mahmood al-Zarooni and described by Crisford as &quot;the No1 horse in our team at the\u00a0moment. We&apos;ve got to see him win [the King George] before we start comparing him to some of the best horses we&apos;ve had, like Fantastic Light and Daylami. He has the potential to be right there with them but this is a key race for\u00a0him.&quot; The King George, arguably the most prestigious Flat race run in this country, would be key for anyone but has particular meaning for Godolphin, whose power in the late 90s was underlined by three consecutive victories. Since those heady times, it has been more of a benefit for their Irish rivals, Coolmore. Godolphin have notched a single winner in the past 11 years. &quot;It&apos;s a great race,&quot; says Dettori. &quot;As a young chap [growing up in Italy], the only three races they showed on TV, from abroad, was the Derby, the King George and the Arc. They&apos;re the famous three and they&apos;ve always carried some importance for me. &quot;If they all turn up [on Saturday], it&apos;s going to be a great race, with Workforce and St Nicholas Abbey. But we hope for the best.&quot; The biggest payday of Rewilding&apos;s career came in the Sheema Classic in March, when his easy three-length win netted him \u00a31.9m (and never mind that his owners were basically winning back their own money). But there was more significance to his victory in the Prince Of Wales&apos;s Stakes, over a distance of a mile and a quarter that ought to have been too short for him. &quot;Obviously, we were worried they might run him off his legs,&quot; Dettori reflects, &quot;but he surprised a lot of people and what he showed is the tremendous will to win that he&apos;s got. So You Think wasn&apos;t stopping and he had to go after him and get past him.&quot; The jockey did not think he could win until the last 100 yards. &quot;We found out that we had to space his races so we don&apos;t have to train him so hard any more. And I guess the flop [in last year&apos;s St Leger] was a combination of the race coming too early and perhaps the ground was a bit too soft. But he&apos;s a straightforward horse and, when he runs, he always gives his best.&quot; The King George will fall five weeks and three days after Rewilding had what seemed a hard race at Royal Ascot. Even though the runner-up has since won the Eclipse, there is bound to be a concern that Rewilding will not be able to bounce back fast enough to show his best form on Saturday. Crisford puts a brave face on this subject. &quot;If it was longer, it would be better but six weeks is a decent gap for any horse. Sometimes the calendar dictates when you have to run. &quot;It&apos;s not at the back of our minds. We&apos;ve seen nothing to suggest that it might have left a mark on him.&quot; Blue Bunting was only fourth when favourite for the Epsom Oaks last month but Dettori puts that down to &quot;a bit of a mess-up&quot;. Dancing Rain and Wonder Of Wonders finished first and second after being allowed an easy lead and the Godolphin filly would have been third if the jockey had not eased her close home, for which he has since served a suspension. This time, Rumh will be used to set the race up for her from the front. &quot;They&apos;re never easy to win, the Classics,&quot; Dettori says, &quot;but I think we&apos;re going to bridge the gap from Epsom.&quot;", "title": "Frankie Dettori in tense wait for Rewilding's run in King George", "sentences": ["The famous royal blue silks have led home their rivals in the Dubai Sheema Classic, the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes and the 1,000 Guineas, the first time since 2002 that Godolphin have managed to win a British Classic other than the unfashionable St Leger."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-16T21:56:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/17/viv-groskop-property-prices", "tags": ["House prices", "Property", "UK news"], "article": "This can&apos;t be an easy time for homeowners struggling with a sluggish property market. So let&apos;s spare a thought for their pain. Real people are suffering. Now we&apos;ve done that, go find a wall \u2013 or an estate agent or a financial adviser \u2013 to punch as you take in the details of one house currently unable to find a buyer. This \u00a370m mansion provides the backdrop to the greatest tale of our times. It was once the UK&apos;s most expensive house, bought by a British-born property mogul for \u00a320m in 2001. Last week came reports that the Irish government is on the verge of seizing it. One visitor describes it as &quot;an abandoned Dubai hotel crossed with a cruise ship&quot;. Forget the house that Jack built. This is the house that Midas built. He was wearing the emperor&apos;s new clothes at the time. And a big gold crown that made his brain stop working. One analysis says it all: &quot;A luxury home designed by British architects, using Italian builders, financed by overstretched Irish bankers \u2013 all in the vain hope of snaring Arab, Russian and Far East buyers.&quot; Vain indeed. It&apos;s been on the market for seven years. Seven years! It couldn&apos;t even sell itself at the height of the property madness when a Russian would spend millions on a shoebox in Knightsbridge. What hope for it in these globally reduced circumstances? The scale of folly here is as mind-blowing as the proportions of the house are unimaginable. It&apos;s like Southfork in Dallas by way of Mr Creosote. It can barely be contained by a wide-angle aerial view. It&apos;s a comedy vision of a comedy rich person&apos;s home. At ground level, you will find 250 tons of Italian marble and 58 acres of landscaped gardens. In the basement, you will find a panic room with its own air-conditioning system. The panic room is at least useful. After seven years on the market, the owner must hang out in it quite a lot, if not literally then metaphorically. (He said last week: &quot;With the benefit of hindsight, I would have run a million miles.&quot;) There&apos;s an underground squash court and two indoor swimming pools. There&apos;s a quarter of a mile of under-driveway heating. Under-driveway! There are 103 rooms, including \u2013 best of all \u2013 27 bathrooms. I love the 27 bathrooms. They make me feel very clean. Surely no one is so dirty that they need 27 bathrooms? Of course, I can&apos;t answer that question as I&apos;ve never met anyone from the Chipping Norton set. But maybe there is some kind of bathroom-related mathematical differential only wealthy people know about. Like, the bigger the risk you take on your mortgage, the more &quot;wet rooms&quot; you have to build in order to appease your conscience. We haven&apos;t even got to the best thing about this house. It&apos;s called Updown Court. Priceless. First it went up. Now the owner&apos;s a bit down. As such, it stands for everything that went wrong in the last 20 years: a big, fat, vulgar dream of ambition and delusion, built on promises, false hope and loans from the Irish Nationwide Building Society. Poor old Updown, a metaphor for unbridled greed. A lesson. Or is it? As Updown experiences its comeuppance, let&apos;s look at what&apos;s happening elsewhere. A sober stock-take of property values, an analysis of the ethics of the banking system and a debate about the redistribution of wealth, perhaps? No, that would be silly. Instead, the NHS is being dismantled, the public sector is being squeezed and in many areas house prices are still going up, up, up. Hurrah! Updown is no longer even one of the most expensive houses in the land. Oh, no. You have to top \u00a3100m to get into that bracket now. A flat recently sold in London for \u00a3135.4m. In &quot;Recession Britain&quot;, there are 5,922 streets around the country where the average house costs \u00a31m. (&quot;House&quot;? &quot;Average&quot;? I am hanging out with the wrong crowd.) The comedown of Updown is a parable for our times. But on millionaire&apos;s row(s), they&apos;re still singing the same old song. Altogether now for the Updown theme tune. It&apos;s specially commissioned and comes complete with vocal cord heating system. Just cover your ears and sing along: &quot;La la la la la la.&quot; The opposite of denial is going on in Eric Fischer&apos;s geo-location maps of Twitter and Flickr activity around the world. In fact, perhaps they are the ultimate definition of &quot;too much information&quot;. But who cares, they&apos;re fascinating. Fischer, a self-confessed &quot;geek of maps&quot;, has found a way to generate visual representations of who is tweeting and taking photographs anywhere in the world. Tweeting shows up most in Britain, North America, the Netherlands and Japan. The places where people are most likely to take pictures and post them on Flickr? Iceland, Scotland, New Zealand and game reserves in Africa. The maps don&apos;t tell us anything we couldn&apos;t have guessed.

This year, however, was different, as their business plans to gain &quot;partnership status&quot; were scrutinised \u2013 and without exception there were flaws. A good business plan should cover many areas; prior to entering this process the candidates would have done well to visit Business Links. They might have avoided some of the raised eyebrows and acerbic comments.  Susan&apos;s elevator pitch must have occurred in Dubai&apos;s Burj Khalifa as it seemed to go on forever. A good elevator speech is one of the first things you prepare: it is a 15-second summary of your business, leaving the recipient wanting to hear more. Her idea, already tested, was an organic skin care range. But her business plan lacked credibility, predicting a year-one turnover of \u00a34.5m with a \u00a31.3m profit. To realise these figures in a hugely competitive and established industry would require a marketing budget significantly more than the \u00a3250,000 on offer. That sum would barely cover the cost of a single page in each of the Sunday newspapers, which hardly constitutes a campaign. I am sure, given a more modest outlook and a mature business mind behind her, this idea could have legs \u2013 after all she has shown success on a small scale already. Objection handling is regularly part of an interview, and Tom was criticised by a couple of the panel for flitting from one product to another, failing to see things through. I would have turned this around and said this is what great inventors do: create the product for Lord Sugar to market, and move on \u2013 not a negative, more of a positive. His idea, a chair for back pain combined with a consultative service, needs tweaking, but it could work in smaller businesses where one person could represent 20% of the team, and replacing them due to back issues could be an expensive problem. Also, there is scope outside of the workplace with a significant marketplace for chairs preventing/reducing back pain. With Tom you are taking on the inventor and not one idea. Helen&apos;s concept didn&apos;t surprise me, but did disappoint: a virtual PA for personal life aimed at the mass market fits in perfectly with her skills as an organiser. This is not a new concept but an established market, and I doubt that a large corporation offering this is required. Also, mass market to me means low- to middle-income adults \u2013 not people with money to spend on personal assistants. Developing last week&apos;s winning idea MyPy, however, could have been a success. Helen is undoubtedly highly employable and would have probably won the old style Apprentice. Jim&apos;s idea of e-learning for youngsters sounded promising, and I admired the fact he had taken the trouble to fit it in with the AMS brand, creating the catchy name AMsmart. I didn&apos;t see this as a negative and would have fought harder to show this, saying I had been aware for three months that I was putting forward a proposal to work with Lord Sugar, so why on earth wouldn&apos;t I consider his business in relation to my idea? However, Jim had been &quot;salesy&quot; throughout the process, and if someone sees you 24/7 as a salesperson they will find it difficult to distinguish when you are being genuine. He also failed to get opinion from key figures in the education sector about the concept, for which he was rapped on the knuckles. However, he had done some work within schools and on employability skills in his spare time and should have emphasised this, selling the results positively. What better testimony could there be? He was rightly criticised for implying &quot;not for profit&quot; given the programme&apos;s focus \u2013 however, who says that schools have to pay? Perhaps the commercial organisations that end up benefitting could partly fund the idea. The business plans all had flaws, so it came down to which candidate would be the best fit, and I totally agree with the decision to take on Tom. Lord Sugar&apos;s connections and strengths in business compliment Tom&apos;s skill base. He is an inventor who will pluck ideas from nowhere and has already shown he can get the attention of Wal-Mart and Boots, and it&apos;s refreshing to see he seems a nice guy to boot. I believe he could be a potential goldmine for Lord Sugar, although he needs reining in. Perhaps his first task should be to employ Helen as his PA on a huge salary.

In withdrawing, Strauss forced Flower&apos;s hand in appointing Alastair Cook to run the one-day international side, and with no credential for him to play in the shorter format, Stuart Broad for the Twenty20. In an ideal scenario, Flower would have liked up to a year in order to collect his thoughts fully on the succession. Strauss&apos;s reasoning contained both a team and personal element. He thought that the side as a whole would not benefit if he merely played for the sake of it without the prospect of a World Cup to drive his enthusiasm. On a personal level, he found the one-day captaincy consuming, and possibly having an impact on his Test performances. So to give himself the greatest chance of prolonging his Test career he opted for red-ball cricket alone. Thus, grand overseer as he may be of the infant captaincy careers of both Cook and Broad, his massive influence within the England structure has inevitably been diluted. In terms of the future of the England team in general, the advancement of Cook at this stage will surely enhance it in the end. But regarding his personal career, he is, as he confesses freely and knows only too well, travelling into the unknown and taking a mighty risk. It could go pear-shaped. The baton was effectively handed over at the end of the drawn Test match at the Rose Bowl a month ago although it seems considerably longer than that. Since then, Broad had a difficult induction in Bristol, and Cook an altogether more successful one in the five matches against Sri Lanka in which he profited individually, and the team triumphed. Meanwhile, because of the vagaries of the county scheduling, Strauss was left with no cricket to play until last week&apos;s match against India, in which he participated only because of the accommodation of Somerset. It would be wrong to assume that he has had no or little contact with the England side in the interim, because he is in constant touch with Flower, will have communicated regularly with Cook, and has made a point of practising with the team as well. But these create difficult circumstances. No one should underestimate either Strauss&apos;s influence, or the willingness of Cook\u00a0to consult and learn. There is another side to this, however, because no captain at whatever level would feel anything but uncomfortable with the emeritus in too close proximity. It becomes restrictive for the captain and awkward for the team. And it would be unnatural if, having handed over the captaincy, there was not an element within Strauss, out of no more than a sense of duty, that still wanted to contribute more than might be healthy. Michael Vaughan&apos;s unofficial presence around the team in Perth during the 2006\u201107 Ashes series, for example, when he had been absent from the team during the previous season because of a knee injury, was certainly viewed as unhelpful even by those who had played successfully under his leadership. Now Strauss is back in charge, perhaps not away long enough for the impact of Cook&apos;s tenure to be appreciated right now. That is more likely to be an issue in the new year when England are due to play their next Test series abroad, against Pakistan, probably in Dubai, after Cook has had the opportunity of leading the side through a five-match ODI tour of India. Certainly it will be different to how it was when Cook took a similar tour to Bangladesh when Strauss was rested. Touring parties become necessarily tighter-knit units than teams manage at home, even in the modern age of central contracts. From this rises the possibility of Strauss facing a similar situation to the one that confronted Nasser Hussain, when Vaughan was given charge of the one-day side in May 2003 , Hussain having stepped down after the World Cup in South Africa. Under Vaughan, England won a short series against Pakistan and a quadrangular series that followed. Hussain returned to captain the first Test against South Africa at Edgbaston, from which England scrambled a draw. What Hussain detected, though, was that things had moved on in his absence. Whereas he had dragged the side up from the depths with an iron fist, necessary at the time, he discovered that under Vaughan, the reins had been loosened. There was a different atmosphere, not less disciplined necessarily, but lighter. No longer did he feel he belonged in charge and, after an emotional press conference in Birmingham, he retreated to the ranks. He toured that winter but, by the following summer, with the emergence of Strauss, he was gone. This is the risk that Strauss now takes. He no longer has a complete empire on which to fall back. So now his international future will stand or fall on his Test record alone, on the success of the team and the runs he contributes personally. The young pretender is in place. Strauss believes, and he may be right, that concentration on one aspect will buy him time. Yet it may also place too high a demand on this drive to succeed. He has little margin for\u00a0error\u00a0now.", "title": "England captain Andrew Strauss knows his Test authority is on the line | Mike Selvey", "sentences": ["That is more likely to be an issue in the new year when England are due to play their next Test series abroad, against Pakistan, probably in Dubai, after Cook has had the opportunity of leading the side through a five-match ODI tour of India."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-19T21:58:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/urban-acupuncture-community-localised-renewal-projects", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Built Environment"], "article": "Around the world, mass migration from the countryside to cities surges. Cities from Los Angeles to Lagos will burst at the seams with citizens who seek new economic opportunities. Meanwhile municipal budgets will be constrained as energy prices increase, building materials become more expensive, and the fresh water supplies decline. Massive redevelopment projects that transformed Dubai, and $475m (\u00a3298m) open spaces like Millennium Park in Chicago are not an option for cash-strapped communities. Could urban design infused with Chinese medicinal theory offer a solution? Watch for the &quot;urban acupuncture&quot; movement to transform urban life in the coming decade. Traced to Finnish architect Marco Casagrande, this school of thought eschews massive urban renewal projects in favour a of more localised and community approach. &quot;Urban acupuncture is a surgical and selective intervention into the urban environment,&quot; said Los Angeles architect and professor John Southern in an interview, &quot;instead of large scale projects that involve not only thousands of acres, but investment and infrastructure that municipalities can no longer provide.&quot; Southern explained that the urban acupuncture approach treats cities like a living organism. Such micro-targeting, low-cost, democratic, and empowering tactics provide urban residents the much coveted green space that they desire without driving to a specific location. Although city politicians want to score points from the creation of enormous parks or even large building complexes that score a green certification, those projects often run over budget and even take away space that could benefit local communities in other ways. Furthermore, Southern noted that only a limited number of practitioners profit from large scale projects, while micro-targeted initiatives benefit more individual designers and architects. Technology has a role in urban acupuncture&apos;s success. When the urban architect and artist Gordon Matta-Clark  made waves in New York&apos;s 1970s art scene for culling beauty from decrepit street corners and crumbling buildings, it took him three years to find 15 sites. But now mapping software has accelerated the identification of urban spaces that beg for renewal and reveal head-turning statistics. In another interview, University of California professor Nicholas de Monchaux described how software from companies like JAS Digital and Autodesk can locate several thousand blighted or abandoned sites in a few minutes. Such software packages use geographic information systems (GIS) to map unused spaces throughout big cities. The results  are stunning, and present countless opportunities for both green space development and the construction of low-cost, sustainable, and energy efficient buildings. De Monchaux&apos;s project Local Code, with the help of GIS technology, located 600 sites in San Francisco that together are two-thirds the size of Golden Gate Park, San Francisco&apos;s largest park that works as the city&apos;s urban lungs. On America&apos;s eastern seaboard, empty lots in New York City cumulatively add up to space larger than Manhattan&apos;s Central Park and Brooklyn&apos;s Prospect Park combined. So while conventional wisdom dictates that urban redevelopment requires the overhaul of entire city blocks, Southern and de Monchaux insist that street medians, foreclosed homes, and vacant lots allow for more sustainable, democratic, and ecological development. Southern believes that instead of new parks that are destination spaces, residents can benefit from a series of &quot;micro-parks&quot; or &quot;urban lounges&quot; that are enjoyed while they walk to that favourite cafe or restaurant. So is urban acupuncture a mere trend or buzzword? The LA architect Southern offered a reminder that some cities have benefited from localised development all along. In Berlin, city officials could never track down the owners of many vacant lots in the years after World War II. Those spaces may have no title, but they are now full of playgrounds, pocket parks, urban forests, or benches on which locals can relax \u2013 and none of them is maintained by local government. In an era of constrained budgets and limited resources, this pinpointed approach could democratically and cheaply offer a respite to urban dwellers.

The club sold their Priestfield stadium for \u00a310m in May 2008 in a deal that was funded by a loan from the taxpayer-owned Bank of Scotland. Now, little more than three years later, an AGM has been called at which Paul Scally, Gillingham&apos;s owner, will authorise the sale of the ground back to the club for only \u00a31,050,000 \u2013 which works out at roughly a 10th of its previous value. The vendor is Priestfield Developments Ltd, a company linked to the Gills through Scally&apos;s ownership via GFC Holdings Limited, which has been the club&apos;s and the stadium company&apos;s parent since the 2008 deal was structured. The cash at the time was used to repay \u00a39m of the football entity&apos;s then \u00a312.6m bank loans. But the total indebtedness of Gillingham and Priestfield Developments had grown by May 2010 to \u00a315m. With the club now in League Two, that picture is likely to be worse. Even so, the Gills must find a little over \u00a31m to buy back the stadium. Perhaps Scally has provided his own security from offshore assets \u2013 he has been living in Dubai \u2013 but there has been no explanation. It is all very odd. Digger asked Scally on Thursday for the reason behind what is seemingly an extremely generous decision either by Scally or the bank to hand over the stadium for what seems such a relatively small sum. &quot;These questions are for the shareholders to ask,&quot; he said. &quot;I can&apos;t discuss it with you because I am bound by confidentiality agreements and it would be inappropriate to comment.&quot; There are no regulatory restrictions on Scally talking about the matter: Gillingham, a plc, is not in a takeover period. Still, shareholders had better get their questions in quickly at the 5\u00a0August AGM \u2013 its second resolution is to amend the company&apos;s articles of association &quot;so as to remove the requirement for the company to hold\u00a0AGMs&quot;. Rangers go online Rangers will make internet historyon Saturday when they become the first UK football club to stream a league fixture, against Hearts, to domestic fans on the web at the same time as Sky are showing the match. Rangers&apos; internet following may be limited because the game will be shown on a pay-per-view basis, but usually Sky&apos;s broadcast contracts would forbid such simulcasts since they could interfere with subscription numbers. Sky has stressed the event is a one\u2011off but there will be plenty of English clubs looking at this innovative setup with a view to providing more match coverage once the 2010-13 rights deal expires. The Premier League has historically been concerned about the impact blanket coverage would have on ticket sales, and currently only 138 of the Premier League&apos;s 380 games are broadcast by Sky and ESPN. Yet a leading sports-broadcast executive said on Thursday that clubs may consider the potential returns to exceed those at the gate, pushing for more domestic games to be opened up to satellite or internet screening. What effect that would have on crowds and atmospheres remains to be seen. Fulham lose in court  Digger wrote a while back that Fulham were fighting the Premier League chairman, Sir Dave Richards, through the courts for allegedly having &quot;facilitated&quot; the transfer of Peter Crouch to Tottenham Hotspur instead of his moving to Craven Cottage. But three court of appeal judges have dismissed Fulham&apos;s challenge against a high court decision that the matter should go to arbitration. Fulham will now appeal to the supreme court, and whether or not that succeeds, their wish that Richards should &quot;cease to be chairman&quot; will come true sooner or later: Richards will have to retire from the post on or before he turns 70 in just over two years. Harvey has form The irony of Shaun Harvey&apos;s recent election to the Football League board has not been lost on many in the game as the League seeks help to combat the threat of offshore ownership of clubs. Harvey, the Leeds United chief executive, had the misfortune of being the 11th-hour replacement for Ken Bates, the chairman, to give evidence to the parliamentary select committee inquiry into football governance in March. He said executives did not know who owned the club. Seven weeks later, Bates announced he had bought Leeds from the discretionary offshore trusts no one had ever been able to penetrate. Harvey, who became the Championship representative on the League&apos;s board at its summer conference last month, will also eventually be among those adjudicating on events at Plymouth Argyle saga, where the former Leeds chief executive Peter Ridsdale hopes to\u00a0take over the club for \u00a31.

The decrepit Humvee, a hand-me-down from the US Army, juddered to a halt and smoke billowed from the air vents below the bulletproof windscreen. I was now stranded in a broken- down Afghan National Army (ANA) vehicle in the middle of a deadly stretch of highway where only two days earlier there had been a small firefight between the Taliban and the security forces. More to the point, I also had a broken leg. My right fibula had snapped at the ankle at around 8am that morning after I fell into a flooded irrigation canal near the town of Kandalay in the district of Zhari, the neighbourhood of Mullah Omar (in the days when the one-eyed cleric was gathering his forces for what would ultimately lead to the Taliban conquest of almost the entire country). I really needed to be in hospital. Instead I was crammed into the front seat of a baking-hot armoured vehicle watching a bunch of Afghan soldiers running back and forth to a nearby puddle, scooping up water into their helmets to cool the engine. Despite the quantum leap the ANA has made in recent years, they are still not the people to help you when you are in serious difficulties. And it had arguably been more than a little unwise to hitch a lift with the ANA to get back to the relative civilisation of Kandahar City, from where I hoped to get a flight to Dubai or Kabul. Or anywhere with a decent hospital prepared to treat a wounded civilian. A few days previously, sitting in the comfort of the ANA&apos;s 205th &quot;Hero&quot; Corps headquarters on the outskirts of\u00a0Kandahar, I had been adamant that I\u00a0wouldn&apos;t be driving anywhere in an\u00a0Afghan military vehicle. On all previous embeds with Nato forces in Kandahar I had never driven anywhere as the roads were considered too risky. Like the troops I flew everywhere by\u00a0helicopter. But the &quot;surge&quot; of US troops has changed all that. The roads are safer but there are far too many troops for everyone to move around by air. So I relented and the 30-minute ride out to the district of Zhari, west of Kandahar City, made me realise how small Kandahar is and how absurd it was to fly such short distances by helicopter. But even if the roads are safe, your life is still in the hands of the ANA, a force where 50% of casualties are due to enemy action and about the same amount is caused by road accidents. Ten minutes into that first ride, after we had just pulled out on to the main road, the driver of the rickety Humvee decided, in classic Afghan style, to overtake a couple of lorries and play chicken with the oncoming traffic. Unfortunately the vehicle in front of us did not flinch and\u00a0at the last minute the Humvee swerved, colliding with the side of another lorry and wrenching the heavily armoured door. &quot;It was not my fault! They should get out of the way for us!&quot; The driver shouted, as his companion in the front seat tried to work out how to keep the wrecked door shut for the rest of the journey. He eventually settled on using his seat belt, which he wasn&apos;t wearing anyway, to tie it closed. Happily, although embedded with the ANA, at the time of my accident a platoon of Americans were on hand to get me out of immediate danger. The good humoured infantry troops had produced a stretcher from nowhere, waded the length of the flooded irrigation ditch and hauled me over a couple of walls \u2013 all in an effort to avoid the improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that could be anywhere. IEDs were, in a roundabout sort of way, the cause of all my problems. Because these homemade bombs have become ever more sophisticated it is now almost impossible to detect them. The insurgents have learned to reduce the amount of metal in the bombs to\u00a0a minimum, making traditional mine-searching devices \u2013 essentially souped-up metal detectors \u2013 useless. The only way to avoid IEDs is to take bizarre routes through the lush farmland the Americans and their Afghan colleagues are trying to cleanse of Taliban. It means striking out across heavily ploughed fields, scrambling over the thick mud walls that in Kandahar are used as grape trellises and getting into the thick of lush farmland, with its extraordinary smells of saffron, grapes, tomatoes and marijuana all combined in the steamy morning heat. Often one can be wading waste deep in water just yards from a perfectly solid track being used by bemused looking locals. If confronted by one of the 8ft-high mud walls with which farmers demarcate their land, US soldiers will typically choose to climb over it, perhaps after smashing off a couple of feet from the top, rather than going through a far- easier-to-navigate hole or doorway \u2013 an obvious place for an IED by insurgents, who after years of observing their enemy are well aware of their tactics. &quot;We hate going through doorways,&quot; Captain Max Ferguson, one of the US officers leading the joint American-Afghan patrol, told me. &quot;Every time I\u00a0take a step through one of those I flinch. It&apos;s just a role of the dice whether you are going to step on anything.&quot; The favourite place for US soldiers to put their feet is under water, where even the most resourceful bomb-maker faces fundamental problems of physics and chemistry. And so on that 5am foot patrol we had already waded through a couple of dense, flooded pomegranate orchards that for a moment made me feel like I was in a Vietnam movie, and a couple of water-filled ditches. Although I&apos;ve done dozens of patrols all over Afghanistan it&apos;s been a long time since I last bothered to take a decent pair of boots. In the days when I\u00a0did wear the hulking boots I bought years ago from a US Army store I never encountered terrain that warranted the hassle of wearing such cumbersome, sweaty things. But Kandalay, the village around which we were patrolling, is a place of lush farmland entirely saturated with water from a network of irrigation canals. The terrain was unlike anything I had seen before. Twenty minutes before my fateful slip Ferguson had already raised an eyebrow at my North Face trainers. &quot;You&apos;re wearing sneakers! That&apos;s a fail!&quot; He said as I gingerly picked my way through a knee-high quagmire of mud, desperately trying to prevent my shoes being lost to the powerful suction effect below. The ditch, about 3ft wide and a couple deep, was nothing compared to some of the obstacles we had already tackled that morning. But after a gruelling three-hour patrol carrying body armour and dripping with sweat in the torrid heat, I was looking forward to getting back to the combat outpost and cooling off. I think the ANA were too, and we had picked up speed as we headed for home. At any rate, I was not\u00a0concentrating as I slipped on the muddy lip of the ditch. I&apos;m not sure exactly what happened, but my foot shot away beneath me, twisting violently inwards and downwards. I\u00a0heard the bone snap and was in no doubt I was now in serious trouble. The threat of IEDs have come to shape nearly everything in this war \u2013 from the new generation of hulking, super-armoured &quot;MRAP&quot; vehicles that in Iraq are now being toughened up even further to cope with ever more powerful roadside bombs, to the constant worry of soldiers who know their next step might mean death or a lifetime of dealing with terrible injuries. Mid-patrol one US soldier turned to me and asked whether I was carrying a tourniquet. Yes, I said, pointing, with pride at how organised I had been, to a pocket on my combat trousers where I&apos;d stuffed an army issue black nylon and Velcro strap, complete with sturdy plastic bar for twisting and applying pressure on any ruptured arteries. It is considered an essential bit of kit that, more than anything else, can save you from rapidly bleeding to death after a limb has been ripped off by an IED. &quot;You&apos;ve only got one?&quot; the soldier replied, unimpressed. It&apos;s said, although I&apos;ve never seen it, that some soldiers (particularly those whose job it is to drive around in Stryker vehicles that are far from invulnerable to IEDs despite their massive armour) sometimes wear the things already loosely tied around their arms and thighs in case the worst happens. Breaking a leg was a personal disaster, not least after my foot became infected and I was hospitalised in a windowless military ward in Kabul for two weeks. But my experience pales in comparison to the horrors of what bombs and IEDs do to soldiers almost every day. During my stay in hospital several of my wardmates were French soldiers whose bodies were covered in\u00a0shrapnel wounds after a suicide bomber walked up to them and detonated himself. Five soldiers were killed. On the first night the survivors arrived, the man in the next bed to me sobbed himself to sleep. After my stretcher ride with the Americans I was put in the back of an &quot;MRAP&quot;, a giant, almost bombproof, vehicle, that was providing overwatch to the foot patrol. There I had to wait for about 90 minutes for the patrol to finish. There was nothing to do but suck on painkillers and chat to the combat medic who told me about the last casualty he had dealt with a few weeks previously who stepped on an IED. He&apos;d lost both his legs and his genitals. The wounds were so terrible that the medic not only exhausted all his combat gauze \u2013 a remarkable material that staunches even the most aggressive pumping of blood \u2013 but also the gauze being carried by all the other soldiers in the platoon, as he stuffed the wounded man&apos;s wounds with it. &quot;Some of the people he was closest to are still a bit fucked up about it,&quot; he said. &quot;Nightmares and stuff.&quot; That the man is still alive is due to the quick reaction of the medic and the extraordinary resources of the US war machine that was able to scoop him up by Blackhawk helicopter nine minutes after the explosion. A few days before I had set out for Zhari I toured the ANA&apos;s highly impressive hospital that treats people from all over Kandahar and Helmand. The place was full of soldiers and police who had either been shot, blown up or involved in car accidents. One unfortunate soldier had come in two days previously having lost both his legs. In obvious discomfort he could not so much writhe in pain as wriggle slightly. A nurse had to turn him over to help him defecate and to re-dress his horrific wounds. Noor, my Afghan colleague who had come with me on my ANA embed, turned green at the sight of it and vowed there and then that he would not be going on any foot patrols with me.

The Midlands club were in talks with N&apos;Zogbia&apos;s representatives on Monday night as they sought to come to an agreement as to exactly when the player would board a flight back to England to undergo a medical and sign a five-year contract at Villa. Although it seems strange that N&apos;Zogbia has not jumped on the first available flight \u2013 he is at the centre of a significant transfer deal and less than three weeks before the start of the season is not traditionally a time when footballers get a chance to enjoy some sun \u2013 Villa insist that they are completely relaxed about the situation and have no reason to believe that the deal will not go through. They have made it clear that they would, ideally, like to sit down with N&apos;Zogbia at the earliest opportunity to complete the necessary paperwork but have also pointed out that it was Wigan&apos;s decision to grant the 25-year-old a break and that it would be nigh on impossible for the player to link up with his new team-mates this week in any case. Villa are in Hong Kong on a pre-season tour and N&apos;Zogbia does not have the required work visa, meaning he will not be integrated with the first-team squad until they return next week. It is anticipated, though, that N&apos;Zogbia will have shown up at Villa&apos;s Bodymoor Heath training ground before then to begin some light training with the young players who have not travelled. N&apos;Zogbia seemed pleased at the prospect of joining Villa when the possibility was put to him on Monday morning. &quot;If I have the opportunity to go there [Villa], I&apos;d be happy, of course,&quot; he said. &quot;I have always said that when first I wanted to join a club more upscale than Wigan. Aston Villa is of that calibre. The proposed challenge interests me.&quot; The Villa manager, Alex McLeish, will be particularly relieved when Villa finally secure the services of a player who eluded him last summer, when he was in charge of Birmingham City. Wigan and Birmingham agreed a fee for N&apos;Zogbia but the deal collapsed at the 11th hour following a disagreement over personal terms. N&apos;Zogbia, who scored nine Premier League goals last season and played an influential role in keeping Wigan in the Premier League, is seen by the Villa manager as a natural replacement for Stewart Downing. The England international joined Liverpool in a \u00a320m deal this month, leaving a void that N&apos;Zogbia is more than capable of filling with his pace, trickery and goalscoring ability \u2013 qualities that prompted Dave Whelan, the Wigan chairman, to claim that he would be an &quot;absolute snip&quot; at \u00a310m. Villa had initially offered \u00a39m, prompting a game of brinkmanship that eventually led to the two clubs compromising and agreeing to meet in the middle. While Whelan has suggested that Roberto Mart\u00ednez will get the full \u00a39.5m transfer fee to spend, Villa&apos;s outlay on N&apos;Zogbia is likely to be the last significant transfer fee this summer, having already signed Shay Given from Newcastle United for \u00a33.5m.", "title": "Aston Villa agree \u00a39.5m fee with Wigan for Charles N'Zogbia", "sentences": ["Aston Villa have agreed a \u00a39.5m fee with Wigan Athletic for Charles N&apos;Zogbia but are unlikely to sign the Frenchman until the end of the week because he remains on holiday in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-25T21:31:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jul/26/charles-nzogbia-aston-villa", "tags": ["Aston Villa", "Alex McLeish", "Wigan Athletic", "Transfer window", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Aston Villa expect to complete the \u00a39.5m signing of Charles N&apos;Zogbia from Wigan Athletic this week with the manager, Alex McLeish, now urging senior players who had become &quot;dormant&quot; such as Stephen Ireland and Stephen Warnock to make their mark in the first team. N&apos;Zogbia, 25, will undergo a medical at the club&apos;s Bodymoor Heath training ground on his return from a holiday in Dubai, with McLeish suggesting personal terms have effectively been agreed with a player whom he came close to signing for Birmingham City a year ago. The France international&apos;s arrival will go some way towards redressing the loss of Ashley Young and Stewart Downing, though McLeish expects other experienced players now to make a positive impact. &quot;With the signings of Shay [Given] and, hopefully, Charles, we will look for one or two players who have been a little bit &apos;gone&apos;, in whom Villa have made a massive investment but who maybe have been dormant, to offer a bit more as well as seeing if some of the younger ones can step up to the mark,&quot; said McLeish. &quot;We have a lot of young players in the squad who have potential, but can they make a big impact on a league as tough as the Premier League? That is where the experienced players come in. You need that strong spine through the team to allow the younger players, as well as Given and N&apos;Zogbia, to make an impact.&quot; Warnock, who fell out of favour under G\u00e9rard Houllier and had expected to leave Villa Park, and Ireland have impressed with their attitude in pre-season training to date to suggest they can be reintegrated smoothly into the set-up. The latter, an \u00a38m signing from Manchester City, saw his first campaign at the club severely restricted by injury and ended last season on loan at Newcastle United, though McLeish believes he can still have an exciting future at the club. &quot;A couple of years ago Stephen looked an amazing player,&quot; said the Villa manager. &quot;He was making runs from midfield, getting in the box, scoring goals, picking out the right passes. Every ball he touched turned to goals. Now, all of sudden, his game hasn&apos;t gone the way you&apos;d expect. But, since I came to Aston Villa, the player has excelled in training. He&apos;s looked, really, as if he&apos;s making those piercing runs in the practice matches, and I&apos;m looking forward to Stephen Ireland being fully fit and competing for a whole season. &quot;As a manager, you have to try and get the best you can out of every individual. That&apos;s what I&apos;ll do. Stephen Warnock, too, has to resurrect his career. He was playing for England a year ago \u2013 you know how good he must be to have done that \u2013 and he&apos;s pushing himself again now. His enthusiasm is there. If anything, the fitness guys have actually had to try and rein him in.&quot; Ireland will miss the game against Blackburn Rovers on Wednesday with a tight hamstring, but should be fit to feature on Sunday against either Kitchee or Chelsea at Hong Kong Stadium.

I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m surprised because it happens every year, but it does seem to creep up on me. So, to welcome a month of halitosis and binge eating: here is a Ramadan-flavoured Divine dispatches. Oh come on, you know it&apos;s true. \u2022 &quot;Your Ramadan makes no sense, no offence!&quot; Someone called Marco has written to OnIslam: &quot;I really can&apos;t understand your culture you Muslims. I do not want to sound offensive \u2026 but really \u2026 you always claim Islam is the religion of both the body and the soul and that you should take care and cherish both your body and soul. But, how come you starve yourselves for 30 days \u2026 stand all night in your praying \u2026 so you don&apos;t sleep, don&apos;t eat for a whole month, and then \u2026 all of a sudden, you celebrate this in a &apos;feast&apos;!&quot; Muslims do eat and drink during the 30-day period, just not between the sunrise and sunset. It&apos;s one of the five pillars of Islam and has been for hundreds of years. Really, what&apos;s not to get? \u2022 Thinking of a break in Dubai? Arabian Business reports that the Jumeirah Group is issuing an etiquette guide for non-fasting tourists. It will advise them against eating and drinking in public between sunrise and sunset. Dubai authorities have penalties for those breaking the rules, risking arrest and fine of AED2,000 (about \u00a3332). Brits in particular have frequent problems with UAE laws. In 2009 the Foreign Office reported that British nationals were more likely to be arrested in Thailand, the Emirates or the USA than anywhere else in the world. &quot;In the UAE, arrests are mainly drug, alcohol or financial offences. British Nationals can also find themselves facing charges due to a clash of cultures (for example bad language or rude gestures).&quot; Arabian Business says an expat was last week fined AED3,000 by the Dubai Court of Misdemeanours for &quot;insulting Ramadan in a status update on Facebook&quot;. \u2022 Wow and wow again. While stateside media get excited about the prospect of a reality show following the lives of American Muslims in Michigan, DD is way more stoked about two \u2013 count &apos;em \u2013 two new series tracking the lives of wealthy Persians on the west coast. One \u2013 from telly behemoth Ryan Seacrest \u2013 has the working title of Shahs of Sunset while the other is called The Persian Version. The two series threaten to do for Persians what Jersey Shore has done for Italians. \u2022 There are a bundle of apps coming on to the market in time for Ramadan. Research in Motion is launching 10, including an Arab Recipe app, which does what it says on the tin, and iftar reminders. If you have an Android you may find this post useful. I like this app though \u2013 a prayer counter that helps Muslims to count their prayers Raka&apos;at and Sajdat in case they get distracted and lose track. It could come in handy for Ramadan especially since, as Marco observes, Muslims stand all night praying for 30 days. \u2022 In case people don&apos;t realise you&apos;re fasting, you could always wear a T-shirt, although some seem to suggest you just don&apos;t like cutlery. \u2022 We&apos;ll stay on the subject of eating and drinking and making merry for a while. If you find yourself in the Kuwaiti branch of Ikea \u2013 and why wouldn&apos;t you \u2013 during Ramadan, you will be delighted to learn it has a special menu for the month with nary a hotdog in sight. This initiative cannot compete with golf clubs in the Emirates offering special deals so you can play, pray and buffet. OUT AND ABOUT  DD hasn&apos;t received any iftar invitations. None. Nada. Zilch. A fatwa on your houses. The US embassy has invited DD to an Eid party at Ambassador Susman&apos;s residence, Winfield House, so that is something to look forward to, but that&apos;s about it. READ OF THE MONTH (apart from the Qur&apos;an) Bestest. Ramadan. Ever. This is the actual title of the debut of Medeia Sharif and not an irritating distortion of the English language. Here&apos;s the product description from Amazon:   &quot;I vow that this will be my first successful fast. During Ramadan, we&apos;re not allowed to eat from sunrise to sunset, for a whole month. My family does this every year, even though I&apos;ve been to a mosque exactly twice in my fifteen years. My exercise-obsessed mum \u2013 whose hotness skipped a generation, sadly \u2013 says I could stand to lose a few. But is torture really an acceptable method? I think not. Things wouldn&apos;t be so bad if I had a boyfriend, but my oppressive parents forbid me to date. This is just cruel and wrong. Especially since Peter, a cute and crushable artist, might be my soul mate. Figures my bestest friend Lisa likes him, too. To top it off, there&apos;s a new Muslim girl in school who struts around in super-short skirts, commanding every boy&apos;s attention-including Peter&apos;s. How can I get him to notice me?

The &quot;snakes on a plane&quot; headlines have once again focused attention on Thailand as an international hub for the illegal trade in wildlife, a trade worth a staggering \u00a36bn a year. The arrest is the latest in a number of high-profile detentions at the Thai airport. However, local environmental organisations have expressed frustration that police enforcement remains inadequate to tackle a trade that is decimating local ecosystems, hastening the extinction of scores of endangered animals and plundering the resources of developing countries for profits abroad. In May, a passenger bound for Dubai was found to have a gibbon, an Asiatic black bear cub, a marmoset and four baby leopards in his carry-on baggage. Having got through the security checks he was reportedly only stopped after one of the leopards made a &quot;muffled cry&quot; at the departure gate. Other recent seizures also include a drugged tiger cub hidden among stuffed toy animals and three suitcases full of 200 live animals \u2013 containing everything from endangered tortoises to pythons, boa constrictors and a parrot. While superficially promising, these headline arrests actually reveal a deeper problem with law enforcement. The smugglers involved in these cases had not engaged in shadowy criminal networks to procure their animals, they had simply gone shopping in Bangkok&apos;s sprawling outdoor Chatuchak market. One local environmental organisation is so frustrated by this state of affairs that it has published an open letter questioning how &quot;wildlife can be openly sold every weekend&quot; just down the road from the offices of the Thai authorities who regulate the illegal trade. With rare native creatures, a large international airport and long land borders with its south-east Asian neighbours, Thailand is an attractive hub for both the import and export of rare animals. Live lizards, snakes and big mammals are increasingly in demand in the Middle East as exotic pets, while tiger bones and bear gall bladders are exported to China, Hong Kong and Singapore for use in Chinese medicine. Acres, which campaigns to stop the illegal wildlife trade, recently ran an undercover operation in Singapore which found tiger parts for sale at just under half of all jewellery and antiques shops visited. The organisation runs public awareness campaigns to challenge such cultural traditions \u2013 something that is essential in tackling the demand side of the trade. Thailand has also become a major importer in the illegal ivory trade, mostly from Africa. Ivory from domestic Thai elephants can be sold legally \u2013 so illegal ivory is taken to Thailand to be &quot;laundered&quot; into the legal domestic market. Thai customs have seized over 8.5 tons of ivory since 2009 \u2013 equating to more than 1,000 elephant tusks. Traffic, the global wildlife trade monitoring network, explains that Thailand now hosts the world&apos;s largest unregulated domestic ivory market, and argues that &quot;Thailand needs to close [this] domestic ivory loophole once and for all&quot;. Corruption and insufficient sentencing deterrents also create regulation difficulties. Freeland Foundation, an international conservation and human rights organisation based in Bangkok, has described official corruption as the biggest problem that it faces in tackling the trade. A recent example is the Dubai-bound passenger arrested with the four baby leopards. Immediately after his detention the police reported they had been politically pressured to not charge him. The smuggler&apos;s client was allegedly a Dubai prince with connections to influential Thai politicians. He was released on bail and promptly escaped the country. Freeland Foundation director Steven Galster remarked: &quot;Over the past six years we&apos;ve seen only one trafficker go to prison. And that was because the prosecutor [...] happened to be an animal lover.&quot; While police may make low-level arrests, those ultimately controlling the trade have repeatedly gone unpunished. A draft law to increase trafficking sentences was proposed eight years ago \u2013 but has still not passed. The Thai politician and human rights and environment activist Kraisak Choonhavan admits that previously, with &quot;so many urgent laws to consider, something like [a new] wildlife law just never saw the light of day&quot;. However, with the recent elections providing a large democratic mandate and signalling an end to the political instability of recent years, there is real potential for a new political emphasis on tackling the illegal trade in wildlife. Without this political will, Thailand and south-east Asia risk a massive and irreversible loss of biodiversity as natural resources continue to be plundered overseas.", "title": "Illegal wildlife trade is far more terrifying than just snakes on a plane | Andrew Chambers", "sentences": ["In May, a passenger bound for Dubai was found to have a gibbon, an Asiatic black bear cub, a marmoset and four baby leopards in his carry-on baggage.", "A recent example is the Dubai-bound passenger arrested with the four baby leopards.", "The smuggler&apos;s client was allegedly a Dubai prince with connections to influential Thai politicians."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-28T09:08:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/28/news-of-the-world-staff-offered-siberia-jobs", "tags": ["News UK", "Newspapers & magazines", "National newspapers", "Newspapers", "Media", "News of the World", "Phone hacking", "Rebekah Brooks", "News Corporation", "Press intrusion"], "article": "Former staff at the News of the World are understood to be underwhelmed by efforts by News International to find them work after they were handed a list of potential jobs which included posts in Russia and Dubai. Some former News of the World journalists said that former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks&apos; promise that as many staff as possible would be redeployed is proving an empty gesture as the vast majority of the alternative jobs being discussed are either non-editorial or entail a move abroad. A job list given to ex-NoW staff include exotic positions such as oil reporter or &quot;symbology analyst \u2013 Russian language&quot; for parent company News Corporation&apos;s Dow Jones wire service and &quot;materials manager&quot; for Fox in Siberia. &quot;The idea that you would go from the News of the World to becoming an oil reporter for Dow Jones, a high end financial wire service, is laughable,&quot; said one former employee. The list issued to staff in a series of one-to-one meetings and are largely at Dow Jones or are non-editorial jobs in IT, back office and commercial departments and involve other divisions including book publisher HarperCollins and Fox in the US. Of the 283 staff let go, some 150 are journalists. Only six of the jobs on the list are directly comparable to what journalists were doing at the Sunday tabloid \u2013 three of them on the Sun and three of them on the News of the World&apos;s Fabulous magazine, which is now being published with the Saturday edition of the Sun. A News International spokeswoman said the jobs were merely a list of global opportunities available across the group and the list was not the end of the matter. &quot;Everybody is being spoken to individually as part of a 90-day consultation and we are exploring every opportunity to find employment for those affected by the closure of the News of the World.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t think people hold out much hope of an offer of a like-for-like job,&quot; said one ex staff member. Another added: &quot;They clearly don&apos;t have jobs for everyone. And even if they did, they couldn&apos;t really parachute people into the Sun. It&apos;s a very competitive newsroom and it would create all sorts of resentment and conflict if suddenly ex News of the World staff were given preferential treatment.&quot; &quot;It was an empty promise. Rebekah said it twice \u2013 at a meeting to staff that was taped and again in front of the world at the select committee last Tuesday. She wasn&apos;t even working for the company at the time,&quot; another ex staffer said. Another protested it would have been better if Brooks, who angered staff by resisting calls for her to resign while staff lost their jobs, was still at News International. &quot;At least she would have looked after us. The best thing for us would have been if they kept the paper and she had resigned; we would still have jobs,&quot; the former staffer said. At the culture, media and sport select committee hearing earlier in July, Brooks told MPs the company would try and find everyone a new job. &quot;We have endeavoured to find them jobs \u2013 every single one of them will be offered a job,&quot; she said. MP Jim Sheridan responded: &quot;But it wasn&apos;t just journalists, was it? It was secretaries, engineers, drivers or whoever they may be. Are they all expected to find jobs as well? Brooks replied: &quot;Everybody. Not just in News International, but across News Corporation.&quot; Meanwhile, the law firm hoping to launch a class action against the News of the World has had more than 40 former senior executives and journalists contact it amid fears they have been &quot;stigmatised&quot; and will be unable to get new employment. Chris Sherliker, of City firm Silverman Sherliker, is hoping to use a case brought against former bank BCCI as precedent to prove reputational damage can be caused by working for an organisation even when an individual is not guilty of wrong-doing. &quot;Rupert Murdoch has admitted that things went very wrong at the News of the World. I think we have a very strong case,&quot; said Sherliker, a partner in the firm. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 July 2011 to remove some references to Siberia.", "title": "Former News of the World staff offered jobs in Siberia and Finland", "sentences": ["Former staff at the News of the World are understood to be underwhelmed by efforts by News International to find them work after they were handed a list of potential jobs which included posts in Russia and Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-28T15:45:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/28/pakistan-military-campaign-balochistan-hrw", "tags": ["Pakistan", "World news", "Asif Ali Zardari", "Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "Pakistan&apos;s military has escalated its brutal campaign of abduction and extra-judicial execution targeting nationalist rebels in Balochistan province, human rights groups have said. In a new report on &quot;enforced disappearances&quot; by military and intelligence officials, Human Rights Watch (HRW) criticised the failure of Pakistan&apos;s civilian leaders to halt what it termed a human rights &quot;free-for-all&quot;. &quot;The national government has done little to end the carnage,&quot; said HRW&apos;s Asia director, Brad Adams. &quot;President Asif Ali Zardari has to realise it cannot just be wished away.&quot; Covered in desert, mineral-rich and strategically located between Iran and Afghanistan, Balochistan is home to some of the most brutal state-led human rights abuses in Pakistan. Suspected nationalist rebels or sympathisers are routinely picked up in broad daylight, taken to centres where torture is rife and, in an increasing number of cases, later found dead on the roadside with a bullet wound in the head. Local groups have counted more than 180 bodies, mostly of men who reportedly disappeared at the hands of the Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) in co-operation with Frontier Corps paramilitaries. The military leadership is accused of orchestrating the violence as it seeks to crush a small rebel force it believes is being covertly boosted by arch-rival India \u2013 an accusation some western spies say is true. The nationalists are also guilty of gross human rights violations, in particularly the targeted killing of Punjabi &quot;settlers&quot;, teachers, politicians and anyone deemed to be co-operating with the military. A sense of lawlessness and impunity reigns in the province, which covers 43% of Pakistan&apos;s land mass but accounts for just 5% of the population. One former detainee said his captors told him: &quot;We can torture you, or kill you, or keep you for years at our will. It is only the army chief and the [intelligence] chief that we obey.&quot; Army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said the accusations were false. &quot;We&apos;ve responded to all this before. It&apos;s basically untrue,&quot; he said. Conflict in the western province receives relatively little attention because unlike the Taliban, Baloch rebels have secular politics and pose little serious threat to the army. Pakistani security officials estimate there are just 1,000 nationalist fighters, whose leaders are largely exiled in the UK, Switzerland and Dubai. But analysts say the barbarity underscores the fragility of Pakistani unity and could be a harbinger of unrest elsewhere. The rebels want independence from Pakistan, saying that after decades of neglect from the centre they would be better off on their own. The fighting is small-scale: rebels attack electricity pylons, rail tracks and military convoys; the military responds by detaining those thought to be responsible. HRW says that in military detention camps, prisoners are beaten, hung upside down and deprived of food and sleep for long periods. Over the past year the bodies of detainees have turned up on the roadside across the province, triggering protests in the provincial capital, Quetta. The exact number of those detained is unclear. In 2008 the interior minister, Rehman Malik, said at least 1,100 people were missing, but last January the Balochistan home minister put the figure at just 55 people. Targeted killings of &quot;settlers&quot; and other accused collaborators by rebels is carving up the province along worrisome ethnic lines \u2013 in Quetta, for instance, non-Baloch doctors refused to work in Baloch areas, fearing harm. The Zardari government has tried to appease nationalist sentiment through a generous aid package and greater funding, but the disappearances and deaths have fuelled nationalist sentiment. A supreme court judge said last year that disappearances from Balochistan posed &quot;the most burning issue in the country&quot;. But a judicial enquiry into the matter has been largely toothless due to a lack of military co-operation.", "title": "Pakistan's military accused of escalating draconian campaign in Balochistan", "sentences": ["Pakistani security officials estimate there are just 1,000 nationalist fighters, whose leaders are largely exiled in the UK, Switzerland and Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-28T18:47:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/29/1", "tags": ["Media"], "article": "Top stories on MediaGuardian.co.uk     The BBC will retain the rights to the Formula One British Grand Prix.

The latter presumably pass his test, most having long ago lost interest in cricket and, like everybody else, become obsessed with those unimpeachably English institutions (not), Manchester United and Chelsea. Black people are now hardly seen at English cricket grounds and the West Indies team, once the game&apos;s biggest draw and a source of pride and inspiration to African-Caribbean people, is regarded as poor box-office material, usually invited to play here before sparse crowds on rainswept days in May. It is not, however, just memories of Tebbit that give this series its political edge. India is currently the master of the game. On the field, it stands at the top of the world rankings, though England hope, in a few weeks, to have usurped that position. More importantly, India increasingly controls how the game is governed and organised. It generates 70% of world cricket revenues and doesn&apos;t hesitate to exercise the power and influence that brings. Though the Dubai-based International Cricket Council (ICC) is nominally in charge, it rarely defies Indian wishes, just as it didn&apos;t defy the wishes of the English, as expressed through the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), in the days when it was based at Lord&apos;s and called itself the Imperial Cricket Conference. It has declined, for example, to rule that ball-tracking technology should be used in all Test matches to review umpires&apos; decisions. The Indians, for obscure reasons, don&apos;t like it and that, as far as the ICC is concerned, is that. India&apos;s power is most evident through the Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 competition between city-based teams with names such as Delhi Daredevils and Royal Challengers Bangalore, which, for a few weeks annually, attracts nearly all the world&apos;s best players by offering previously unimaginable sums of money. Some players no longer bother with longer forms of the game such as Test matches, and concentrate entirely on lucrative IPL contracts. The titled gentlemen of Lord&apos;s \u2013 who invented Twenty20 to entice English proletarians into cricket grounds and thus rescue ailing county clubs \u2013 think this a desecration of cricket&apos;s true, Corinthian spirit. But the millions of Mumbai and Chennai, who now rarely turn up to watch Tests, have fallen in love with Twenty20 and, much as the purists may object, that and other short forms of cricket will probably dominate in future. So, the tables have turned. Just as the English once used cricket to assert the ideology of empire \u2013 to play the game honourably, said Lord Harris, governor general of Bombay and a former captain of Kent, &quot;is a moral lesson in itself&quot; \u2013 so Indians now use it to assert the brash, go-getting, commercial values of the new, upwardly mobile India. It is not, it must be admitted, a particularly pretty sight, but then nor was the period of English hegemony. When the Australians were getting uppity in the 1930s, cheekily putting tariffs on British cricket balls and other goods, the English establishment concocted bodyline bowling to teach them a lesson. The Australians responded with accusations of &quot;unsportsmanlike&quot; behaviour \u2013 a judgment which, in the MCC&apos;s view, it alone was qualified to make \u2013 and threats to leave the empire. Without admitting its own culpability, the MCC settled the matter by blaming it all on Harold Larwood, the Nottinghamshire miner who carried out the instruction to bowl fast at Australian bodies. He was driven from the game and ultimately into exile (in Australia, ironically). Even worse was the MCC&apos;s record not only of playing all-white South African teams \u2013 cricket being racially segregated even before the advent of official apartheid \u2013 but of contriving to omit anyone with a non-white skin from English touring teams there. As the recently released film Fire in Babylon recalls, West Indians once used cricket for black self-assertion. In a Britain that seemed to regard West Indians as nothing but &quot;a problem&quot;, recalled the black writer Caryl Phillips, &quot;the West Indies team \u2026 appeared as a resolute army, with power and creative genius in equal measure&quot;. For 15 years, the West Indies dominated world cricket. But those poor islands lacked the economic muscle to carry their dominance into cricket&apos;s corridors of power. India&apos;s success, on and off the field, is the most palpable evidence of its rising global status. Whatever the outcome of the present series, India, unlike the West Indies, will continue to matter. No wonder British Indians don&apos;t care about Tebbit&apos;s test.

Two huge cascades of water, each occupying the square footprint of one of towers, will start churning, ceaselessly, forever. Inscribed in a bronze strip surrounding the cascades will be the names of those killed in the 9/11 attacks, including those at the Pentagon and on United flight 93, which crashed in a field in Pennsylvania, as this is the national 9/11 memorial, not just New York&apos;s. The memorial will be ready, just, although it will be accessible only by advance booking for another two years. It could not miss this deadline. Despite billions of public dollars, thousands of ideas for memorials and rebuilding, a shared public desire to honour the event and speeches by governors and mayors about the urgent need to get things done, perhaps a third of all the reconstruction that will happen here has so far taken place. Work on 7 World Trade Centre, a relatively plain tower at the edge of the site, was completed in 2006. Otherwise, the grove and the fountains stand among pits, canyons, cranes and rising frames, a Bosch landscape of machines and mud, of digging down and piling up, as skyscrapers, a train station, a museum and 550,000 sq ft of retail space take shape. &quot;It is very New York,&quot; is what everyone connected with the project says, by which they mean that everyone has an opinion and an interest, which must face down the opinions and interests of others. Much of the past decade has been spent in arguing, in law courts, in the media, at public and private meetings. Relatives of victims had different views from one another, and from people living near the Ground Zero site, who did not want their neighbourhood to become a shrine to catastrophe. One of the residents&apos; leaders was told she would &quot;burn in hell&quot;. Construction became political: protestors against slow progress carried placards saying: &quot;Don&apos;t forget 9/11. Delay means defeat.&quot; There was rage and defiance, a desire to stick it back to the terrorists, which made it very likely that large towers would be put back on the site. In the years following 9/11, the event was honoured by a carnival of pretention and viciousness, as architects felt compelled \u2013 as there can be narcissism in healing \u2013 to put themselves at the centre of the stage cleared by the attacks. &quot;We&apos;re going to crush his nuts,&quot; said one of another, while others preened and posed and drivelled about the fusion &quot;of military and urban space&quot; or new towers that would &quot;kiss and touch and become one&quot;. They employed black propaganda, old boys&apos; networks, emotional posturing and shameless spinning. At stake was the greatest commission in the world, the chance to shape 16 acres of Manhattan property that were also the site of the most momentous event of the 21st century thus far. It was not just about the memorial but about the towers, station and museum that would go on the site as well.     The way they were: the World Trade Centre\u2019s twin towers dominate the New York skyline in the 1990s. Photograph: Peter J. Eckel/Time & Life Pictures/Getty    After a false start or two, several architects were asked to take part in an &quot;innovative design study&quot;, a process that was not supposed to have any winners. Then a winner was chosen, a group called Think, a decision overturned the next day by George Pataki, the governor of New York State, who chose Daniel Libeskind instead. Libeskind&apos;s design studies were then called a masterplan, even though there had not been the time or money to work them out as fully as a masterplan would normally be. They then acquired the status, at least for some politicians, of designs for individual buildings, which they were not either. What were essentially sketches were treated as blueprints for multibillion-dollar structures. Libeskind is the Polish-born son of Holocaust survivors, and designer of the Jewish Museum in Berlin, who, as a teenager, had arrived in New York, in the time-honoured way of immigrants, by boat. He was well placed to speak of freedom, hope, conflict and tragedy. His proposals, in which fractured geometric forms rose into a triumphant spiral said to echo the Statue of Liberty&apos;s torch, soaked the site in symbols. Its pinnacle would be the tallest building in the world \u2013 1,776ft high in honour of the date of the American Declaration of Independence \u2013 which Pataki would name the Freedom Tower. Nor was Libeskind afraid, though no Republican, to borrow the Bushite warping of language that followed 9/11: &quot;Freedom&quot; to mean &quot;America&quot;, &quot;heroes&quot; to mean &quot;victims&quot;. He called his project &quot;Memory Foundations&quot; and said it represented &quot;life victorious&quot;. Libeskind is intelligent \u2013 when he received news of his win he was reading God, Death, and Time by the talmudist Emmanuel Levinas \u2013 but he can sound remarkably simplistic when he wants to. There was a snag. &quot;That idiot,&quot; as one of his rivals puts it, uncharitably, &quot;he forgot that most American of things \u2013 the contract.&quot; There were in fact other architects engaged to work on the site, the giant, business-friendly practice Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. SOM had been hired by Larry Silverstein, the developer who bought a long lease on the towers in the summer of 2001, a few weeks before they fell, and they were still his architects. His lease required him to put back all 10\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0ft of the office space destroyed, so his views mattered. According to Janno Lieber of the Silverstein Corporation: &quot;Larry said to Libeskind, &apos;Congratulations, this is a phenomenal plan. You&apos;ve managed to accommodate everyone. But \u2013 no disrespect \u2013 I&apos;d like my architects to design the individual buildings.&apos;&quot; The main man at SOM was David Childs, now aged 70, prominent for decades in American architecture but never adulated like its more glamorous stars. His style is courteous but ruthless, that of one used to getting his own way. The project was also personal for him, as it was for many. A member of SOM&apos;s staff was killed in the attacks and Childs and his team had all too good a view from their Wall Street offices, a few blocks away. &quot;There was a young man with tears streaming down his face,&quot; recalls Childs. &quot;He said, &apos;Will they fall?&apos; I said, &apos;No.&apos;&quot; Pataki pushed Libeskind for a while but, according to Childs, Silverstein needed architects with experience of large buildings, such as SOM. Libeskind wanted to design the Freedom Tower, the most conspicuous element of his plan, but found himself put in a junior partnership with SOM (&quot;We&apos;re a team organisation but we needed 51% of the vote,&quot; is how Childs describes it). Then he became an increasingly marginal figure as Childs redesigned the tower as he wanted it. The outcome of the Childs/Libeskind showdown is now the most prominent object in the place that in the 1960s was named the World Trade Centre, became Ground Zero in 2001 and now \u2013 to lighten its load of significance \u2013 is called the World Trade Centre again. The rising tower, its slick skin chasing its steel-and-concrete frame up to the sky, is already taller than anything in Britain but still far from its final height. Libeskind wanted a dynamic, asymmetrical shape but the tower will now be a symmetrical obelisk, in emulation of the Washington Monument in Washington DC. Childs calls it &quot;iconic and simple&quot;. The Freedom Tower, now renamed 1 World Trade Centre, looks assertive and confident, like the towers of corporate America anywhere, but it has contradictions. It is unsure if it is a symbol or a piece of commercial real estate. Childs refers to the Washington Monument but also cites the importance of &quot;market realities&quot;, among other things, as a reason for discarding Libeskind. Yet its size is grandiose and its security measures elaborate, for obvious reasons, which make it expensive in a location that is not New York&apos;s hottest commercial spot. It does not obviously respect market realities. At least, it did not convince Silverstein, who refused to build it, meaning that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the public body that owns the freehold, decided to put its own funds into putting up the tower, with uncertain prospects of an early, sufficient return on its investment.     Freedom Tower nears completion. Photograph: Rowan Moore for the Observer    The tower is the pinnacle of Childs&apos;s career, as it would be of any architect&apos;s, yet he is openly contemptuous of what might seem an important design feature, its height. This, achieved with the help of a large steel stick, retains the magic number specified by Libeskind: &quot;1,776 feet, whatever that&apos;s worth,&quot; says Childs. &quot;Nobody&apos;s going to count the feet.&quot; The rebuilding of Ground Zero is an immense public building project, consuming billions of public dollars, pushed by mayors and governors, of a scale that would impress an old-fashioned socialist despot. Yet it is also a commercial development by the Silverstein Corporation. Its most important guiding document is Silverstein&apos;s lease agreement of summer 2001 and its requirement, blind to the imminent attacks and the emotional charge they would bring, that any destroyed accommodation should be put back. It meant that, whatever else happened, there would be very large office blocks on the site.None of the powerful people involved with the site since then has been able or willing to change this requirement. At the same time, it was impossible for anything built there not to be a symbol, given what had happened and given the geometric potency of the Twin Towers. Their architect, Minoru Yamasaki, dreamed, with hopelessly misplaced optimism, that they would become &quot;a representation of man&apos;s belief in humanity, his need for individual dignity, his beliefs in the co-operation of men, and through co-operation, his ability to find greatness&quot;. The fearful symmetries of their downfall, and the contrast between the perfection of their forms and the chaos of their collapse, ensured that architecture and construction were enmeshed in the event. Hence the contradictions. Is it a symbol? Is it an office block? It is both. What are most clearly symbols are the two square cascades of the memorial, which lie in front of the tower in an eight-acre plaza containing the grove of 415 trees. The memorial is by Michael Arad, the architect who won a design competition held in 2003-4, beating 5,200 entrants. He was 34 at the time, unknown and inexperienced, and has realised the work in partnership with the well-established landscape architect Peter Walker. Arad was living in Lower Manhattan at the time of the attacks and, like many, &quot;was very affected by what I saw and felt compelled to do something about it&quot;. He recalls the place as a &quot;ghost town&quot; after 9/11, but with people instinctively gathering at night in public places such as Washington Square. From this, he learned that &quot;public spaces are the glue that binds society together&quot;. Almost immediately, Arad started imagining a memorial, spending &quot;a lot of time and effort drawing and sketching and modelling&quot;. He came up with two squares set in the Hudson River, &quot;with the surface of water torn open, by voids that will never fill&quot;. Then the competition was announced and he adapted his idea to the location at Ground Zero. At the same time, inspired by his discovery of the power of public space, he wanted them set in a large, flat, open plaza. He called his plan &quot;Reflecting Absence&quot; and won. For Walker, the main problem was maintaining the flatness and openness of the plaza, which was essential to Arad&apos;s design, without making it bare and arid. The most important part of the answer is the trees, selected and nurtured, with great difficulty, so that they are all the same size. Both Walker and Arad had to fight the many pressures to put unwanted stuff in the empty space, such as skylights for the train station or 17 air vents 20ft high. &quot;How can you make something flat with 17 vents in it?&quot; says Walker, who needed Pataki&apos;s help to sort out that one. They had to find the right kind of seating: park benches seemed inappropriate but so did oblong slabs that &quot;looked as if they might have a dead person underneath&quot;; so the slabs had to be given dimensions that made them look less tomb-like. They had to make the cascades work, with the help of a mock-up in Toronto, and Walker still sounds a caution. &quot;We&apos;ve made them as well as we know how, but they&apos;re mechanical and usually mechanical things only last 30-40 years.&quot; Somehow, the money will have to be found to pump the water round for ever and ever. You get the impression Walker would not have gone for fountains if it had been up to him. Arad wanted the names of the victims to be inscribed near the bottom of the cascades, with visitors descending to them behind the screen of falling water. Cost and security issues made this prohibitive and the names will now be around the cascades&apos; upper rim, at the level of the plaza. Even this simpler presentation took years to resolve, not least because of the question of the order in which the names, which include the six people who died in the 1993 attack on the World Trade Centre, would be arranged. Should they be alphabetical? Should they be random? Eventually it was agreed that names should be arranged by groupings of place \u2013 who was in which tower, on the ground, in which plane or in the Pentagon. However, relatives were invited to make &quot;meaningful adjacency requests&quot;, of which 1,200 were received, whereby they could ask for particular names to be together. Arad&apos;s and Walker&apos;s other concern was, as it was for most who have touched this site since 2001, the balance of remembrance and renewal. &quot;A lot of people,&quot; says Arad, &quot;thought it had to be either a living park or a cemetery and a forever dismal place.&quot; The combination of the fountains and the canopy of trees is intended to house both death and life, both acts of pilgrimage and lunchtime sandwich eating by office workers. &quot;You walk through trees,&quot; says Walker, &quot;and suddenly these waterfalls open up underneath you. Then you turn around and you&apos;re in a forest, which is a symbol of life.&quot; Newspaper critics are being kept at a distance from the memorial for now, but it is possible to see from surrounding buildings that each fountain is vast. As each of each square&apos;s four sides is more than 200ft, and there are two squares, the total length of falling water is nearly a third of a mile. Each cascade drops 30ft, before dropping another 30ft down a smaller square hole in the centre, down to the level of the bedrock under the site. But they are not the end of the remembering. Beneath the plaza, a museum is being built, with 100,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft of exhibition space. Exhibits will include crushed cars and fire trucks, twisted metal from the old towers and photographs and remembrances of victims. Within the museum&apos;s vast spaces it will be possible to see the slurry wall, the rough concrete that kept out the waters of the Hudson river, allowing the Twin Towers to be built. Never intended to be seen, it was revealed after they fell.     The cross discovered upright in the ruins of Ground Zero will be included in the museum beneath the plaza.  Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP    Above the pavement of the plaza can be seen the entrance pavilion to the museum, a tilting shard by the Norwegian practice Sn\u00f8hetta. To one side is rising Tower Four, designed by the Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki. Work is also proceeding on Tower Three, by the British practice Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners. Next to it will be a transport interchange, linking the subways and trains, designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. Tower Two, by Foster and Partners and taller than the Empire State Building, is on hold for now. A proposed performing arts centre by Frank Gehry remains a distant prospect. On the other hand, Ground Zero&apos;s great unknown monument, 550,000 sq ft of retail, is on track. These buildings are the constructional response of New York to 9/11, primed with some of the $20bn of federal money that the New York senators Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer won from Congress in the wake of the attacks. Most are far from complete. Tower One, the former Freedom Tower, is due to be finished in 2014. Calatrava&apos;s station is scheduled for 2014, the museum for 2012. Most are prodigiously expensive: the Freedom Tower costs more than $3bn, and the museum and memorial combined $700m. The station, originally budgeted at $2.2bn, is reputed to be heading towards $4bn. All the buildings have what the Silverstein Corporation calls &quot;significant&quot; architects. It is an interesting adjective, as significance has always been the big issue at the World Trade Centre. Yamasaki wanted significance for his towers, that of world peace. Al-Qaida saw them differently. Since 9/11, all the argument and anguish has been about the ways in which construction can express and honour the significance of the event. Yet the way in which Foster or Calatrava are &quot;significant&quot; is different. Here, the word means &quot;well known, successful and highly regarded&quot;. Its meaning is hollowed out; its relation to the significance of the site is approximate. Libeskind&apos;s promise was significance. It can be debated how successfully his ideas would have achieved it but what is clear is that the Pritzker-winning architects \u2013 Norman Foster, Richard Rogers and Maki \u2013 hired by Silverstein for the other towers, have not been inclined to defer to Libeskind&apos;s vision. The towers will ascend in a vague, stiff, spiral, roughly in accordance with Libeskind&apos;s wishes, but each is a singular assertive object rather than a figure in a great unified gesture. Until such time as the Foster tower is completed, which could yet be a decade from now, it remains to be seen how plain is the resemblance of the group to Lady Liberty&apos;s torch or how many people will care if it is. Others of Libeskind&apos;s ideas have fallen away. He had wanted the memorial plaza to be sunk but Arad and Walker raised it back to street level. He envisaged a &quot;wedge of light&quot; where sunshine would fall, each 11 September, between the times when the first plane hit the North Tower and the second tower to fall \u2013 also the North Tower \u2013 collapsed. The extravagant roof of Calatrava&apos;s station compromises this idea, whose effectiveness had already been questioned. Calatrava, using the greeting card triteness that has infected many in this project, said his roof would be like a dove released from the hands of a child. In reality, like much of his work, it is mostly about Santiago Calatrava. He has designed similar-looking roofs elsewhere, without a dove pretext in sight. Libeskind is nothing if not optimistic and despite past rages at Childs is now serene. &quot;The fundamental ideas are exactly there,&quot; he says. He may sound almost like Saddam Hussein&apos;s PR man, Comical Ali, proclaiming victory as the US army could be seen entering Baghdad behind him, but he can at least list ideas of his that are still there, such as the 1,776ft of the tower, the open space containing the memorial, the exposure of the slurry wall and the idea that retail should be spread about the site rather than placed in a single underground zone. Libeskind says his experience at Ground Zero &quot;reaffirms [his] belief in democracy, which is as difficult as it can be worthwhile&quot;. The place is indeed a product of New York&apos;s version of democracy, in which no one has the ability to assume complete control, not even the mayor, Michael Bloomberg, the man widely credited for ensuring that the project has got as far as it has. The site becomes a jostle of competing interests, in which a combination of money, power and loud voices, tempered to a degree by public opinion, tends to win. The jostle of buildings reflects this jostle of power. They do not connect or cohere, except in a very general way. There is a reluctance to engage with the specific or the small-scale. The memorial is one thing, the museum another, the station and former Freedom Tower others again. At the same time, all are driven by a pervading fear that whatever is built to honour 9/11 will not be enough. So everything \u2013 waterfall, towers, museum, plaza, station \u2013 is huge. Was it really necessary to try to build the tallest building in the world, creating immense security issues in the process, especially now that New York has been thrust out of the tallest-building game by Dubai? Subtlety, intimacy and complexity are blunted and in a sense the development is untypical New York. In the past decade, the city has acquired a certain lightness and playfulness, represented by the High Line, the phenomenally successful conversion of a railway viaduct into a public park. Or by the never-ending ingenuity with which restaurant menus and cocktails are constructed; or by the glittering, joyful residential skyscraper that Frank Gehry has put up downtown. For better and worse, the city resembles a giant habitable iPad, a delectable grid where gratification can be had at a touch. The World Trade Centre feels ponderous, corporate and old-fashioned by comparison. For a Londoner, it feels like Canary Wharf. But it will be effective. The magnificent waterfalls and the exhibits in the museum will do their job of assuaging the event. The generalness and abundance will mean that most of the many, many parties who care about the site, from property developers to victims&apos; families and residents, will be satisfied. It will achieve closure but with a looseness that avoids the need to reconcile conflicts that may be irreconcilable. The train station will pump people into the skyscrapers, who will lunch under the trees and shop in the mall. It will have been a long time coming, and cost an extraordinary amount, but it will be there. And, possibly, given the ways New York does and does not work, no other route was possible but the one by which it got there.", "title": "9/11 Ground Zero: why has its rebirth turned sour?", "sentences": ["Was it really necessary to try to build the tallest building in the world, creating immense security issues in the process, especially now that New York has been thrust out of the tallest-building game by Dubai?"], "publicationDate": "2011-07-30T23:03:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jul/31/dubai-tourists-must-respect-ramadan", "tags": ["UK news", "Dubai", "Ramadan", "United Arab Emirates", "World news", "United Arab Emirates holidays", "Religion", "Islam"], "article": "The Foreign Office has warned Britons holidaying in Dubai this summer that eating, drinking or smoking in public during Ramadan could land them in prison.

The funding bodies instructed Hesa to begin collecting data on these students because they had become increasingly aware of the steady rise in their numbers over the previous 10 years. The 2009-10 figures were up almost 10,000 on the previous year. Branch campuses, collaborative provision, twinning and franchising Some &quot;wholly overseas&quot; graduates study at overseas branch campuses, like Nottingham University&apos;s outposts in Malaysia and China, or Middlesex University&apos;s sites in Dubai and Mauritius. The Observatory on Borderless Higher Education estimates that there are currently 164 branch campuses worldwide, although only 13 are British. Others study UK course material at local institutions on a twinned or franchised basis with partners back in the UK \u2013 this is often referred to as &quot;collaborative provision&quot;. There is a lot of nervousness around twinned or franchised courses, with many people suggesting the quality of the teaching is not as high as it is on the branch campuses, or that partner institutions can&apos;t recreate the ethos of the awarding university. Nottingham&apos;s vice-provost Stephen Doughty &quot;if students haven&apos;t got that real UK experience, then all they&apos;ve got is a bit of paper.&quot; In a recent live chat on this network Nick Booker from IndoGenius said: &quot;For students to be able to attend their university&apos;s own campus is the best way to ensure students get the same quality, a seamless curriculum and sufficient support. This is one of the main reasons why having an overseas campus is so important for universities&quot; Universities that enter into collaborative, twinning or franchising arrangements rather than opening branch campuses live with the risk of damage to reputation, should it transpire that those degrees are not being well taught. Richard Yelland from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warned of the potential damage to a UK university of &quot;perceived&quot; poor quality: &quot;The chief threat - as in any industry - is that a painstakingly built-up reputation can be grievously damaged by one high-profile incident&quot;. The University of Wales knows all about suffering as a result of a high profile incident, after a recent BBC Wales documentary uncovered the failings of its overseas partners. The owners of the Turning Point Business School disappeared not once, but twice, leaving students unsupported. One, Fazley Yaakob, was described as by the BBC as &quot;a pop star with two bogus degrees.&quot; The BBC reported that Education Minister Leighton Andrews saying the university had &quot;let the country down&quot;.  A subsequent Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) review found that the University of Wales had failed in its financial due diligence and had not adequately vetted its partners. The Times Higher reported that &quot;students at the Turning Point Business School had been left unsupported when the owners disappeared a year after acquiring the college in an unannounced sale.&quot;  The QAA report says:   In the light of the disappearance of the first owners, and the long list of unfulfilled demands made by moderators and the University&apos;s Validation Unit staff in March 2010, the University&apos;s decision to accept the assertions of the new owners at face value, and not to set in train a more thorough due diligence process \u2013 even if the moratorium had to be lifted first for practical reasons \u2013 seems culpably credulous.  The QAA is working with the University of Wales to address the serious shortcomings &quot;as a matter of urgency&quot;.  But other universities are willing to defend collaborative provision and insist that they provide a valuable service. Nottingham Trent University currently has 90 collaborative partners, with approximately 7,000 students studying overseas. Chris Slade, collaborative partnership manager at Nottingham Trent University said that their collaborative provision had received an &quot;excellent QAA audit report&quot; as &quot;a result of clearly articulated, robust and fit for purpose quality processes for approving and monitoring partners.&quot;  Slade attributed the secret of Nottingham Trent&apos;s success to the deployment of &quot;highly experienced staff overseeing all collaborative activity.&quot; He said regular visits where essential as this meant they would be immediately alerted to any concerns which allowed &quot;fast action to be taken to ensure that students are achieving the standards expected of UK HEIs&quot;. He warned that &quot;many universities see collaborative activity as the opportunity to earn third stream income&quot; but said that his university put &quot;financial contribution at the end of a list of more important priorities which include reference to enhancement of the university&apos;s reputation.&quot;", "title": "Explainer: What are 'wholly overseas students'?", "sentences": ["Branch campuses, collaborative provision, twinning and franchising Some &quot;wholly overseas&quot; graduates study at overseas branch campuses, like Nottingham University&apos;s outposts in Malaysia and China, or Middlesex University&apos;s sites in Dubai and Mauritius."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-01T15:07:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/03/radio-review-face-the-facts", "tags": ["Radio", "Television & radio", "Culture"], "article": "One of the strengths of Face the Facts (Radio 4) \u2013 in addition to its dogged investigative approach \u2013 is the flexibility of presenter John Waite&apos;s tone.

The interrogation policy \u2013 details of which are believed to be too sensitive to be publicly released at the government inquiry into the UK&apos;s role in torture and rendition \u2013 instructed senior intelligence officers to weigh the importance of the information being sought against the amount of pain they expected a prisoner to suffer. It was operated by the British government for almost a decade. A copy of the secret policy showed senior intelligence officers and ministers feared the British public could be at greater risk of a terrorist attack if Islamists became aware of its existence. One section states: &quot;If the possibility exists that information will be or has been obtained through the mistreatment of detainees, the negative consequences may include any potential adverse effects on national security if the fact of the agency seeking or accepting information in those circumstances were to be publicly revealed. &quot;For instance, it is possible that in some circumstances such a revelation could result in further radicalisation, leading to an increase in the threat from terrorism.&quot; The policy adds that such a disclosure &quot;could result in damage to the reputation of the agencies&quot;, and that this could undermine their effectiveness. The fact that the interrogation policy document and other similar papers may not be made public during the inquiry into British complicity in torture and rendition has led to human rights groups and lawyers refusing to give evidence or attend any meetings with the inquiry team because it does not have &quot;credibility or transparency&quot;. The decision by 10 groups \u2013 including Liberty, Reprieve and Amnesty International \u2013 follows the publication of the inquiry&apos;s protocols, which show the final decision on whether material uncovered by the inquiry, led by Sir Peter Gibson, can be made public will rest with the cabinet secretary. The inquiry will begin after a police investigation into torture allegations has been completed. Some have criticised the appointment of Gibson, a retired judge, to head the inquiry because he previously served as the intelligence services commissioner, overseeing government ministers&apos; use of a controversial power that permits them to &quot;disapply&quot; UK criminal and civil law in order to offer a degree of protection to British intelligence officers committing crimes overseas. The government denies there is a conflict of interest. The protocols also stated that former detainees and their lawyers will not be able to question intelligence officials and that all evidence from current or former members of the security and intelligence agencies, below the level of head, will be heard in private. The document seen by the Guardian shows how the secret interrogation policy operated until it was rewritten on the orders of the coalition government last July. It also: \u2022 Acknowledged that MI5 and MI6 officers could be in breach of both UK and international law by asking for information from prisoners held by overseas agencies known to use torture. \u2022 Explained the need to obtain political cover for any potentially criminal act by consulting ministers beforehand. The secret interrogation policy was first passed to MI5 and MI6 officers in Afghanistan in January 2002 to enable them to continue questioning prisoners whom they knew were being mistreated by members of the US military. It was amended slightly later that year before being rewritten and expanded in 2004 after it became apparent that a significant number of British Muslims, radicalised by the invasion of Iraq, were planning attacks against the UK. The policy was amended again in July 2006 during an investigation of a suspected plot to bring down airliners over the Atlantic. Entitled &quot;Agency policy on liaison with overseas security and intelligence services in relation to detainees who may be subject to mistreatment&quot;, it was given to intelligence officers handing over questions to be put to detainees. Separate policy documents were issued for related matters, including intelligence officers conducting face-to-face interrogations. The document set out the international and domestic law on torture, and explained that MI5 and MI6 do not &quot;participate in, encourage or condone&quot; either torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. Intelligence officers were instructed not to carry out any action &quot;which it is known&quot; would result in torture. However, they could proceed when they foresaw &quot;a real possibility their actions will result in an individual&apos;s mistreatment&quot; as long as they first sought assurances from the overseas agency. Even when such assurances were judged to be worthless, officers could be given permission to proceed despite the real possibility that they would committing a crime and that a prisoner or prisoners would be tortured. &quot;When, not withstanding any caveats or prior assurances, there is still considered to be a real possibility of mistreatment and therefore there is considered to be a risk that the agencies&apos; actions could be judged to be unlawful, the actions may not be taken without authority at a senior level. In some cases, ministers may need to be consulted,&quot; the document said. In deciding whether to give permission, senior MI5 and MI6 management &quot;will balance the risk of mistreatment and the risk that the officer&apos;s actions could be judged to be unlawful against the need for the proposed action&quot;. At this point, &quot;the operational imperative for the proposed action, such as if the action involves passing or obtaining life-saving intelligence&quot; would be weighed against &quot;the level of mistreatment anticipated and how likely those consequences are&quot;. Ministers may be consulted over &quot;particularly difficult cases&quot;, with the process of consulting being &quot;designed to ensure that appropriate visibility and consideration of the risk of unlawful actions takes place&quot;. All such operations must remain completely secret or they could put UK interests and British lives at risk. Disclosure of the contents of the document appears to help explain the high degree of sensitivity shown by ministers and former ministers after the Guardian became aware of its existence two years ago. Tony Blair evaded a series of questions over the role he played in authorising changes to the instructions in 2004, while the former home secretary David Blunkett maintained it was potentially libellous even to ask him questions about the matter. As foreign secretary, David Miliband told MPs the secret policy could never be made public as &quot;nothing we publish must give succour to our enemies&quot;. Blair, Blunkett and the former foreign secretary Jack Straw also declined to say whether or not they were aware that the instructions had led to a number of people being tortured. The head of MI5, Jonathan Evans, said that, in the post 9/11 world, his officers would be derelict in their duty if they did not work with intelligence agencies in countries with poor human rights records, while his opposite number at MI6, Sir John Sawers, spoke of the &quot;real, constant, operational dilemmas&quot; involved in such relationships. Others, however, are questioning whether \u2013 in the words of Ken Macdonald, a former director of public prosecutions, &quot;Tony Blair&apos;s government was guilty of developing something close to a criminal policy&quot;. The Intelligence and Security Committee, the group of parliamentarians appointed by the prime minister to assist with the oversight of the UK&apos;s intelligence agencies, is known to have examined the document while sitting in secret, but it is unclear what \u2013 if any \u2013 suggestions or complaints it made. Paul Murphy, the Labour MP and former minister who chaired the committee in 2006, declined to answer questions about the matter. A number of men, mostly British Muslims, have complained that they were questioned by MI5 and MI6 officers after being tortured by overseas intelligence officials in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Some are known to have been detained at the suggestion of British intelligence officers. Others say they were tortured in places such as Egypt, Dubai, Morocco and Syria, while being interrogated on the basis of information that could only have been supplied by the UK. A number were subsequently convicted of serious terrorism offences or subjected to control orders. Others returned to the UK and, after treatment, resumed their lives. One is a businessman in Yorkshire, another a software designer living in Berkshire, and a third is a doctor practising on the south coast of England. Some have brought civil proceedings against the British government, and a number have received compensation in out-of-court settlements, but others remain too scared to take legal action. Scotland Yard has examined the possibility that one officer from MI5 and a second from MI6 committed criminal offences while extracting information from detainees overseas, and detectives are now conducting what is described as a &quot;wider investigation into other potential criminal conduct&quot;. A new set of instructions was drafted after last year&apos;s election, published on the orders of David Cameron, on the grounds that the coalition was &quot;determined to resolve the problems of the past&quot; and wished to give &quot;greater clarity about what is and what is not acceptable in the future&quot;. Human rights groups pointed to what they said were serious loopholes that could permit MI5 and MI6 officers to remain involved in the torture of prisoners overseas. Last week, the high court heard a challenge to the legality of the new instructions, brought by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.

Doug Whyte, the most successful jockey in Hong Kong&apos;s history, is here to win. A South African, he is nicknamed the Durban Demon and has racked up an unprecedented 11 consecutive jockeys&apos; championships in Hong Kong, where he was the first to ride 1,000 winners. He has since added another 300 and will now bring his determination and focus to bear on Saturday&apos;s card at Ascot, where he will captain the Rest of the World team. He already knows his team-mates, Yutaka Take from Japan and Hugh Bowman from Australia, and hopes they can be persuaded to share his approach. &quot;I would certainly like to sit down with them before the races and go through our rides, at least,&quot; he said on Thursday at the Knightsbridge hotel which is his temporary base. &quot;See where we want to be in the race, what our strategy is and so forth and make it a team effort. &quot;If my horse can&apos;t win and I&apos;ve given it every chance to try and win, I&apos;m going to then help my team-mate out, so that we can hopefully win the series. So it&apos;s a different way of looking at it, from my point of view, which is what I&apos;m never able to even consider in Hong Kong or elsewhere: helping another jockey in a race. &quot;Let&apos;s say, for instance, I&apos;m in front and my horse is really dead and tired or whatever and my team-mate was behind me and blocked in. Well, I&apos;m going to move off and give him room. I want to win as a team as well as on my own. &quot;Likewise, if my team-mate&apos;s on my inside and I&apos;m on his outside and my horse is absolutely dead, I&apos;m not going to hold him there and prevent him from winning, I&apos;m going to give him a little bit of room and give him his chance of winning for the team.&quot; Team tactics are, of course, forbidden under the sport&apos;s rules, but Whyte has no intention of impeding runners representing the rival teams of Britain, Ireland and Europe. &quot;I&apos;m a sportsman, make no mistake,&quot; he said, &quot;but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s very sportsmanlike, to get in someone&apos;s way.&quot; This is his fourth appearance at the Shergar Cup, which is sponsored once more by Dubai Duty Free. &quot;It&apos;s great to ride at Ascot and be part of the whole scene,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a fantastic track, I love it and I must say I do enjoy the English racing. There&apos;s something that always gets to me and brings me back. &quot;I think it&apos;s the uniqueness, the tracks themselves, not one is alike. There are ups and downs and turns; you can go left and then all of a sudden go right. It&apos;s not necessarily like other tracks in Australia or South Africa, where you turn for home, you find a gap and go. Here, you actually have to work it out, how much horse you&apos;ve got underneath you, have you still got a hill to climb? It does become a little bit technical. &quot;I think what keeps me coming back is not just the tracks themselves but also the crowd, because here it&apos;s more of an emotional ... they become part of it. They picnic on the side, they&apos;re drinking wine, eating and having a day out. &quot;Whereas at Hong Kong, it&apos;s more like going to the casino and a lot of them do talk from their pocket \u2013 which you find all over the world \u2013 but here they go to the races, not necessarily to win huge amounts of money. &quot;They like to win, obviously, but it&apos;s not the be-all and end-all. They go to have a good day out, get some sunshine, have a few drinks, be entertained and make a day of it. Whereas Hong Kong, it&apos;s not making a day of it, it&apos;s trying to turn over figures and it&apos;s a business, really.&quot; Whyte is by no means ready to call time on his career in the far east but he has been frustrated that he has not been able to take part more often in major races elsewhere in the world. &quot;The problem with the Hong Kong season is that they&apos;ve extended it every year and, when I first started there, we used to start on the 11th of September and finish on the first of June. Now we start a week earlier and we finish the 15th of July. &quot;I used to come for Royal Ascot. I think I came three or four times, twice to ride and also to come and watch. Well, now we&apos;ve still got a month to go while Royal Ascot&apos;s on. &quot;It is exhausting, especially with the heat, but also it doesn&apos;t afford me opportunities to go to meetings like Royal Ascot, the Arc de Triomphe. Your contract says you can&apos;t leave to go and ride somewhere else unless it&apos;s a Group One and it doesn&apos;t interfere with a Hong Kong raceday.&quot; But Whyte has long harboured thoughts of coming to ride in Britain for an extended period and seems closer than ever to making it happen, following the decision to send his 11-year-old daughter, Sheikara, to Millfield School in Somerset from this autumn. &quot;It&apos;s probably going to shorten my career in Hong Kong by a few years and hopefully open up a few opportunities elsewhere,&quot; Whyte said. &quot;There are three children from my daughter&apos;s class that are going to Millfield but the deciding factor was that she can have a pony at school and it&apos;s just her dream. Her boarding room is three metres, not even, from the stables. &quot;She came for an interview about a month ago and fortunately enough she got in, because they are pretty full, but she&apos;s a smart little girl. It&apos;s going to cost me money but it&apos;s going to be exactly the same as her schooling was costing me in Hong Kong \u2013 it&apos;s not cheap there. &quot;I can foresee myself riding here for at least six months, not to set the world alight but to certainly ride winners and try and at least get a Listed or a couple of Group races under my belt.&quot;", "title": "Doug Whyte has his eye on the main prize in Shergar Cup at Ascot", "sentences": ["&quot;I&apos;m a sportsman, make no mistake,&quot; he said, &quot;but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s very sportsmanlike, to get in someone&apos;s way.&quot; This is his fourth appearance at the Shergar Cup, which is sponsored once more by Dubai Duty Free."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-04T16:48:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/aug/04/secret-interrogation-policy-public", "tags": ["Foreign policy", "MI5", "Torture", "MI6", "Counter-terrorism policy", "Tony Blair", "UK news", "World news", "Politics", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "Law"], "article": "Government ministers were extraordinarily sensitive about the contents of the secret MI5 and MI6 interrogation policy document when the Guardian became aware of its existence two years ago.

The issue of alleged torture in custody continues to haunt political, military and intelligence elites on both sides of the Atlantic. On Thursday a judge in America allowed a former military contractor who claims he was imprisoned and tortured by the US army in Iraq to sue the former defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld personally for damages. The man, an army veteran whose identity has been withheld, was working as a translator for the US marines in the volatile Anbar province when he was detained for nine months at Camp Cropper, a US military facility near Baghdad airport dedicated to holding &quot;high-value&quot; detainees. The US government says he was suspected of helping to pass classified information to the enemy and helping anti-coalition forces enter Iraq. But he was never charged with a crime, and he says he never broke the law. Lawyers for the man, who is in his 50s, claim he was preparing to return to the US on annual leave when he was detained without justification and that his family were told nothing about his whereabouts or whether he was still alive. Court papers filed on his behalf say he was repeatedly abused, then released without explanation in August 2006. Two years later, he filed a suit in Washington arguing that Rumsfeld personally approved torturous interrogation techniques on a case-by-case basis and controlled his detention without access to the courts, in violation of his constitutional rights. Alleged victims Binyam Mohamed, 33, returned to Britain in 2009 after his release from Guantan\u00e1mo Bay. An MI5 officer was alleged to have been involved in an interview with Mohamed in Pakistan and to have seen him three times while he was being held in Morocco. Faisal Mostafa, 47, a chemist from Stockport, was repatriated from Bangladesh last summer after being detained in Dhaka in 2009. He is said to have been hooded, strapped to a chair and questioned about the UK while a drill was driven into his shoulder and hip.

Or it least it has in the world of Lee Westwood, who spent Sunday of this week consulting with the American sports psychologist Bob Rotella and on Thursday began reaping the benefits. The Englishman, frustrated at what he suggested was almost two years of below average putting, sought out Rotella, who helped steer Darren Clarke to his Open victory last month. He also recruited Dave Stockton, the former US Ryder Cup captain and noted putting guru, who in recent months has been working with Rory McIlroy. The effects were immediate \u2013 as was the case with the two Northern Irishmen \u2013 even if the results were not quite so life-changing. At least not yet. But for the moment, Westwood was more than happy with taking only 27 putts in an opening round of 67, three under par, and a spot on the leaderboard on the first day of the Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone Country Club. &quot;Dave changed a few technical things, like grip pressure and reducing the amount of time I was standing over the putt. But mainly it is a change of attitude,&quot; he said, citing a well-known Rotella mantra &quot;putting unconscious&quot;. &quot;It is great to be able to the stand over a putt and freewheel.&quot; Freewheeling certainly beats free-falling, which would be a fair characterisation of Westwood&apos;s putting over the last 12 months. By his own estimation he has not had a good putting week since the 2009 Dubai World Championship. &quot;Even though I&apos;ve won a few times this year, had a top three at the US Open and got to the play-off in the PGA at Wentworth, I haven&apos;t had a good putting week all year,&quot; he said. &quot;You can&apos;t give that sort of advantage to the guys out here. I looked down my checklist and the psychology side was the area I&apos;d never really dealt with. I always thought I was mentally strong.&quot; That is frustrating in itself but what has made it doubly so is that the frailties on the greens have come at a time when his game from tee to green has never been better. There may be a handful of better ball-strikers but no one has been as consistent over an extended period. But, as the world No2 explained, poor putting can have a corrosive effect on other aspects of your game. &quot;When you are not holing enough putts, you feel you have to hit your approach shots closer and closer to the hole to give yourself a better chance. And that puts added pressure on your iron shots, which in turn puts pressure on your driving.&quot; The breaking point came at last month&apos;s Open, where the Englishman was fancied by many to win his first major championship but instead missed the cut. He is one of the few leading players in the game who has never used the services of a sports psychologist. &quot;I&apos;m a Taurus \u2013 stubborn,&quot; he said with a laugh, before expanding on his long-held aversion to seeking help with the mental side of the game. &quot;I always considered myself to be mentally strong. Plus I worried that if I started using one my game could go the opposite way.&quot; That particular concern can surely be dismissed, although we will know better by Sunday if Westwood has unlocked the secret. A victory would be the perfect outcome for the Englishman, and for Rotella&apos;s already stellar reputation, but if he can finally break his major championship duck at the PGA Championship in Atlanta next week he will be happy to let someone else win on Sunday. Needless to say, there will be no shortage of takers for the $1.4m (\u00a3860,000) winner&apos;s cheque. Once upon a time, this Firestone course was viewed as one of the most brutish on the PGA Tour. Now, soft greens and forgiving rough, as well as technological &quot;advances&quot;, have neutered the course, as the early scoring made clear. Westwood was delighted with his 67 but it still left him four shots behind the tournament leader, Jason Day, whose stunning 63 left him four shots ahead of a group of players including Thomas Bjorn and the former Open champion Stewart Cink. Phil Mickelson was tied alongside Westwood on three under par, while McIlroy was one shot back after an opening 68. It all added up to an impressive leaderboard but predictably the efforts of all concerned were overshadowed by those of one man. Tiger Woods&apos;s return to the sport after a three-month absence for injury has dominated the buildup to this event and his arrival on the 1st tee attracted by far the biggest galleries of the day. The former world No1 remains the biggest star in the sport, even if his game is a shadow of what it once was. He was odds-on with the bookies to hit the fairway with his opening tee shot. Alas for his loyal backers, he did not even give them a run for their money, finding the bunker instead of the short grass.", "title": "Lee Westwood sees his putting improve following Bob Rotella's input", "sentences": ["By his own estimation he has not had a good putting week since the 2009 Dubai World Championship."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-04T20:15:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/07/tim-adams-who-owns-britain", "tags": ["Rural affairs", "Environment", "Property", "Russia", "World news", "House prices", "UK news", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "On the ground it is hard to get a measure of the Crichel Estate in Dorset. It takes in almost 10,000 acres, in the glorious countryside to the north of Poole harbour, near Wimborne Minster. As someone currently contemplating whether the benefits of an extra 7ft of London garden and a 10x8ft bedroom might really be worth another \u00a3100,000 of mortgage, I&apos;m finding property on this scale quite tricky to assess. I try walking its perimeter, but I don&apos;t get far. In the end I find I can get a better indication of Crichel&apos;s extent from an aerial view on YouTube: in a short film advertising the hunting possibilities of its thousands of acres, a helicopter- mounted camera swoops for several minutes around the gentle hills and valleys of the property, before dwelling on the main house itself. Crichel is a great Palladian pile that provided the backdrop for the\u00a01996 film adaptation of Jane Austen&apos;s Emma, starring Gwyneth Paltrow. It was mostly built by John the Bastard, one of the noted Bastard brothers of Blandford Forum, in 1742. Its land includes three villages, a cricket club, a church and a school. All of this could, apparently, now be yours for around \u00a3100 million, making it the most expensive British property outside London ever sold. But as with all such sales, this one \u2013 if it happens \u2013 will be magnificently discreet. Nobody in the villages on the estate seems to know for certain if the great house or land on which they live is even being offered for sale at all, though rumours have been widely reported. Some suggest \u2013 hopefully \u2013 that the property has attracted the interest of Prince Charles (who owns neighbouring land) and who &quot;would perhaps like to purchase it for his son and his new bride&quot;; others believe it will go to this or that oligarch to fulfil their increasing desire for English dachas to go with their London mansions; and rock stars have owned some of the land around here in the recent past \u2013 Greg Lake of Emerson Lake and Palmer had the next-door property. But it is the members of the global financial elite who can most likely afford estates like this now. Over the past decade or so, prime land and property in Britain has increasingly shifted from ownership by those with inherited wealth to the beneficiaries of the long boom in the world&apos;s money markets that ended in 2008. In 1980 there was a 70% likelihood that the buyer of a property such as Crichel House \u2013 or Cliveden, former seat of the Astors in Buckinghamshire and now on the market for a cool \u00a335 million \u2013 would owe their fortune to inheritance. By 2007 that likelihood had dropped to about 11%. One consequence of globalisation has been that prime chunks of British property have been sold off from beneath our feet, as it were, to those whose wealth is offshored and whose property portfolio probably also includes a place in the Alps, the Caribbean and Dubai. Now 60% of London properties worth over \u00a32.5m are owned by foreign investors. And the trend has spread to the country. The steel magnate Vladimir Lisin paid \u00a36.8m for the 3,300-acre Aberuchill Castle estate in Perthshire. Boris Berezovsky bought 172-acre Hascombe Court, near Godalming in Surrey, for \u00a310m. Roman Abramovich paid \u00a312m for Fyning Hill, near Midhurst in West Sussex, which came complete with a personal playground of go-kart track, clay-pigeon shoot, trout lake and rifle range. When Leon Max, a Russian-born fashion retailer, bought the 600 acres of Easton Neston in Northamptonshire for \u00a315m in 2008 from the formula one boss Lord Hesketh, he commented that &quot;I like the idea of being a country gentleman\u2026 I am looking forward to shuffling to my atelier in my monogrammed slippers&quot;. He is rivalled by Stefan Persson, 61, owner of H&amp;M, who owns an 8,500-acre shooting estate in Wiltshire and the 1,500-acre Linkenholt estate near Andover in Hampshire. We sell costume drama to the world and increasingly the world \u2013 or at least that tiny percentage of it that counts its wealth in seven figures \u2013 buys a contemporary version of it back, mostly tax free and with a bit of deference and a state-of-the-art cinema room thrown in. Like Persson, Max has learned to shoot, has adopted corduroy Savile Row suits and entertains the local hunt. Places such as Crichel House and Cliveden were built to show off the taste and trappings of the home-grown elite of past centuries, men who owed much of their wealth to the exploitation of labour and resources in distant corners of the globe. In colonising English estates now, you could say the globe is returning the compliment. It is apparently becoming hard to put a price on the &quot;authentic experience&quot; of the British aristocracy. At hedge fund billionaire Arki Busson&apos;s charity ball last month one diner bid \u00a3250,000 for a weekend break at Blenheim Palace. The traditional aristocratic season of Ascot, Henley and Wimbledon, its rituals of dress and insouciance, is embraced by the global elite with similar mesmerising extravagance. One thing that this elite may not embrace as it buys up British land, however, is the traditional conscience-salving relationship that has existed between Britain&apos;s historic landowning families and their tenant farmers and tied cottagers. The villages of Witchampton and Moor Crichel may be sold with Crichel House. The people who live there now exhibit an understandable anxiety not only at the prospect of a new landlord, but also at the consequences of saying anything out of turn. That anxiety seems a historical relic \u2013 like something out of Thomas Hardy or Jane Austen or even Piers Plowman \u2013 but it is real enough. One man I ask, a resident of neighbouring Cranborne, speaks to me under condition of anonymity. He describes how &quot;this part of the world is still made up of country estates and has not changed much since Norman times and feudalism. Many of the landowners can be traced back to Norman ancestors, when Anglo-Saxon England was carved up by the invaders from Normandy. Some of the working families in Witchampton, likewise, are mentioned in documents dating from the time of Henry VIII. To live here is to experience what life was like 200 years ago.&quot; It is that experience, with added swimming pools and helicopter pads, that makes these places so attractive to buyers who have done their homework watching Gosford Park and Brideshead Revisited. The local man went on to express the hope that &quot;the next owner of Crichel will at least retain the current workforce (who live in &quot;tied&quot; accommodation \u2013 no job, no home) and maintain the area&apos;s unique charm\u2026&quot; Russians bearing guns, attracted to Crichel&apos;s renowned pheasant shooting, may not be particularly welcome, especially as they will tend to spend only a small part of their time at the house. Celebs would probably be worse. &quot;The last estate up for sale in Dorset was in the Purbecks,&quot; my informant tells me. &quot;This was bought by a financier after being viewed by Kylie. Cecil Beaton&apos;s home, just over the border in Wiltshire, was bought by Madonna. What benefit was there to the local economy in having Madonna here? Hardly any. She brought her own entourage with her, who sourced most of the workmen and domestic staff from elsewhere. To stop cameramen photographing her house from the air, she bought up the local airfield. Her staff would try and hire restaurants for the entire evening, to exclude locals and regulars, just for herself and her cronies. Luckily they put their loyal customers before financial greed \u2013 Dorset is not a &apos;Material World&apos;\u2026&quot; \u2013 or at least not entirely. One of the REASONS the British can no longer always compete to buy their own land, and why that land and property is such a safe bet for foreign investors, is coincidentally rooted in the history of Crichel House. In the &quot;Battle of Crichel Down&quot; of 1954, the Napier-Sturt-Marten family, who had owned the estate for 500 years, took on Churchill&apos;s postwar government to have returned to their ownership a piece of land that had been compulsorily purchased by the RAF for bombing practice during the war. The stand-off was seen as the last redoubt of the aristocracy against parliament, and the aristocracy won. The &quot;integrity&quot; of the Crichel estate was restored and the government minister who had fought that losing battle, Sir Thomas Dugdale, famously resigned. Thereafter any question of land reform, of the breaking up of ancient estates for the common good was shelved. The vast majority of land in Britain has a similar kind of &quot;integrity&quot;, rooted in the covenants of the Domesday Book. One of the effects of that 1,000-year status quo is to make British houses, on average, the most expensive and the smallest in Europe. Another is to ensure that, because of the scarcity of land available, estates will always be a stellar investment to those who can afford to maintain them. Kevin Cahill&apos;s book Who Owns Britain sets out the figures pretty starkly: the UK is 60m acres in extent, and two-thirds of it is owned by 0.36% of the population, or 158,000 families. A staggering 24m families live on the 3m acres of the nation&apos;s &quot;urban plot&quot; \u2013 and not surprisingly buy into the idea that Britain is a severely overcrowded country in which land is extremely scarce. It is not quite so scarce if you happen to be the descendant of the &quot;cousinhood&quot; of aristocracy who carved up the nation in feudal wars or at the gambling table \u2013 or through grace and favour, and profits from slavery \u2013 and whose offspring have until recently doggedly preserved their thousands of acres from almost every subsequent threat of disbursement (if only, in some cases, to sell them intact to Russian steel magnates or Swedish T-shirt sellers). Among the diehards are the current Duke of Buccleuch, with his 240,000 acres; the Duke of Northumberland, who owns 131,000 acres; and the Duke of Westminster, with 129,000 acres taking in much of Belgravia, as well as the centre of Liverpool. To them, you imagine, the country doesn&apos;t look very crowded at all. Carol Wilcox, secretary and treasurer of the Labour Land Campaign, has one antidote to this persistent sense of England as a playground for the super-rich. She recently drove from her home in Christchurch down to the Tolpuddle Martyrs&apos; Festival in Dorset. Her route took her along an ancient brick wall which seemed to go on for ever and, as she drove along the A31, she recalls, she was getting more and more furious about it. &quot;What&apos;s all this, built to keep the peasants out?&quot; she wondered. At Tolpuddle she discovered that the wall was, in fact, the longest continuous structure in England, incorporating two million bricks, and that behind it lived the MP for South Dorset, Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, who David Cameron likes to call Richard Drax. The estate is open to the public on two days a year, when the villagers make tea and cakes. &quot;It is just feudal, still, all this,&quot; Wilcox suggests. She got interested in land reform when she read Mervyn King&apos;s book on British tax. There seemed to be a glaring omission in it: land value tax. Rather than taxing income so heavily, or seeing aspiration to ownership taxed in the form of stamp duty, why not impose an annual tax on the productive value of land per acre (excluding occupied homes in the lower council tax bands), and thereby address the most glaring inequity in the country? This might allow tenants of all kinds to finally own a little patch, leading to the eventual disbursement, at fair price, of some of the millions of acres currently held in a few thousand hands. And it would mean the 40% of prime property currently being sold to often absent foreign investors would not look quite so attractive. &quot;I like to think about the effects of not taxing land,&quot; says Wilcox. &quot;House prices remain unaffordable; there is a vast amount of wasted land, derelict sites and empty property in the hands of an elite few; and nearly all private income that could be used for investment goes on servicing property debt, allowing the banks to make their massive gains. The only reason anyone should own land is to use it\u2026&quot; The idea goes back a long way, to Thomas Paine through Lloyd George. Andy Burnham, the Labour leadership candidate, had it as a plank of his manifesto, but Ed Miliband, according to Wilcox &quot;seems not to get it&quot;. Vince Cable put forward a version at last year&apos;s Lib Dem conference when he suggested that a progressive alternative to attempting to raise tax on global capital, routinely offshored, &quot;is to shift the tax base to property, and land, which cannot run away, [and] represents in Britain an extreme concentration of wealth&quot;. Traditionally whigs and Tories have clashed over land reform; you wonder if, as finances squeeze still further, that might be the fracture line again. Britain is, of course, full of complicated nostalgia for the world of stately homes and manicured lawns, and the opposition to such a change is deep rooted, even among those it might benefit. Wilcox is fed up of hearing how the great landowners are custodians for whose stewardship we should be eternally grateful. You can hear it in the anxieties of the tenants and villagers in Dorset, who place their hope in a benevolent landlord, rather than in a stake in the ground. As Britain&apos;s estates change hands, it is doubtful whether similar loyalties will be extended to foreign owners flying in for the grouse season. Behind their high walls, however, once they have purchased a piece of &quot;authentic&quot; heritage, the new owners of British acres probably won&apos;t worry too much about what the natives think. They will be too busy humming those famous old verses of No\u00ebl Coward: &quot;The stately homes of England/How beautiful they stand/to prove the hedge fund billionaires still have the upper hand/though the fact that they have to be rebuilt/is a small price to pay to wear a kilt/and much more fun than buying gilts\u2026 ( to fade)&quot;.", "title": "Who owns our green and pleasant land?", "sentences": ["One consequence of globalisation has been that prime chunks of British property have been sold off from beneath our feet, as it were, to those whose wealth is offshored and whose property portfolio probably also includes a place in the Alps, the Caribbean and Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-06T23:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/07/liam-fox-porton-capital", "tags": ["Private equity", "Business", "Liam Fox", "Defence policy", "Politics", "MRSA and superbugs", "Society", "Law", "US news", "World news", "Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Lobbying"], "article": "Liam Fox, the secretary of state for defence, has been forced into an embarrassing U-turn over a claim he was unaware of the details of a legal battle involving the Ministry of Defence&apos;s private equity partner and an American technology conglomerate. The case, which centres around the dealings of private equity firm Porton Capital with US Post-it note maker 3M, has mushroomed to include blackmail accusations around alleged threats to withdraw a knighthood awarded to 3M&apos;s British boss, Sir George Buckley. Fox has admitted that he was informed of a plan by Harvey Boulter, the chief executive of Porton Capital, to resolve a dispute alleging that 3M failed to &quot;diligently&quot; commercialise life-saving MRSA technology that had been developed by the MoD and sold to 3M in 2007. Hours after Fox and Boulter met at an upmarket hotel in Dubai, Boulter demanded 3M hand over $30m (\u00a318m) or risk the government interfering with Buckley&apos;s knighthood. The demand landed Porton and the British government with a multimillion-pound blackmail lawsuit. Fox had previously strenuously denied that the MRSA legal battle was discussed with him. However, when the Guardian approached Fox with statements from two witnesses who confirmed that they heard the MRSA case discussed at the five-star Shangri-La hotel on Dubai&apos;s waterfront, Fox&apos;s retracted his previous denial. His spokesman said: &quot;During their meeting Mr Boulter disclosed his involvement in a legal case as a matter of propriety. But Dr Fox did not enter into a discussion about this in any respect and at no point raised or discussed the issue of a knighthood.&quot; A witness to the meeting said that Boulter informed Fox of the progress of the 3M legal battle, to which the defence secretary is said to have replied: &quot;I&apos;m sure you&apos;re handling this [the case] in the best way possible.&quot; Fox&apos;s spokesman did not respond to requests to confirm or deny this statement. Just hours after that meeting in June, Boulter fired off an email to 3M&apos;s lawyers. It stated: &quot;As a result of my meeting [with Fox] you ought to know that David Cameron&apos;s cabinet might very shortly be discussing the rather embarrassing situation of George&apos;s [Buckley] knighthood.&quot; [See footnote.] Boulter suggested that a settlement &quot;at a headline of $30m+ you will allow MoD to internally save face&quot;. He went on to say that unless 3M paid out $30m, the British government would be left &quot;quietly seething, with ramifications for a while \u2013 they have memories like elephants&quot;. Boulter followed up the first email with another sent the following day to 3M&apos;s lawyers. &quot;I need to tell something to Dr Fox&apos;s office on Sunday night,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t really want to give a &apos;radio silence&apos; message as he is secretary of defence and will not expect that.&quot; Fox&apos;s spokesman refused to confirm or deny whether Fox was aware of the details of Boulter&apos;s email or whether the pair had a follow-up conversation after the meeting at a Shangri-La executive suite. Ploughshare Innovations, the MoD&apos;s civilian research arm, and Porton are suing 3M for up to \u00a341m in damages, claiming that the US group failed to &quot;diligently&quot; develop their BacLite testing technology, which they sold to the technology company in 2007. BacLite uses a type of fluorescent light to detect the presence of the hospital bug MRSA within hours, rather than the days using conventional methods. Lawyers for 3M, which is suing Boulter and Porton for blackmail, are likely to force Fox to give evidence in the trial in the US. The &quot;unprecedented&quot; legal action could make Fox the first serving British cabinet member to give evidence in a serious lawsuit in America. William Brewer, a partner at Bickel &amp; Brewer and 3M&apos;s lead counsel, said: &quot;If Mr Boulter and Dr Fox did, in fact, discuss this case during their meeting, we would like to know if Dr Fox was aware of the demands that Mr Boulter placed upon 3M \u2013 and whether Dr Fox was waiting for a response to those demands on Sunday, as Mr. Boulter suggested.&quot; Brewer said 3M was &quot;committed to uncovering&quot; exactly how much Fox knew about the alleged blackmail threat. In separate twists, the case has prompted two further libel claims: one from Boulter against 3M and Brewer, and the other by 3M, which is pursuing Boulter&apos;s attorney Lanny Davis, a former lawyer best known for representing Bill Clinton. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 August 2011 and 14 October 2011 to append the following clarification: In the story above, reporting the background to a legal dispute between an investment company, Porton Capital and US conglomerate, 3m, we quote an email from Harvey Boulter, Porton&apos;s chief executive, to William Brewer, a lawyer acting for 3m: &quot;As a result of my meeting [with Fox] you ought to know that David Cameron&apos;s cabinet might very shortly be discussing the rather embarrassing situation of George&apos;s [Buckley] knighthood.&quot; Boulter has contacted us and asked us to state that the meeting at which Buckley&apos;s knighthood was discussed was not the one with Fox but was at another meeting he had that day connected to the dispute.", "title": "Liam Fox forced into U-turn over legal spat with US multinational 3M", "sentences": ["Hours after Fox and Boulter met at an upmarket hotel in Dubai, Boulter demanded 3M hand over $30m (\u00a318m) or risk the government interfering with Buckley&apos;s knighthood.", "However, when the Guardian approached Fox with statements from two witnesses who confirmed that they heard the MRSA case discussed at the five-star Shangri-La hotel on Dubai&apos;s waterfront, Fox&apos;s retracted his previous denial."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-07T18:53:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/aug/09/london-riots-newspapers", "tags": ["Media", "UK riots 2011", "Newspapers", "World news", "Australia news", "Turkey", "Malta", "Spain", "US news", "India", "China", "Japan", "Israel", "Dubai", "Philippines", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "The London riots made front pages across the world - in Europe, the United States, Asia and Australasia.

Following the reshuffle of the meeting, with the Ebor Handicap moved to Saturday, the International now opens one of the most popular festival meetings north of Newmarket. This year marks the 30th renewal of a race which has produced the only defeat of Brigadier Gerard, along with famous victories for the likes of Troy, Giant&apos;s Causeway and Sea The Stars. But apart from Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s Hardwicke Stakes winner Await The Dawn, who trades at odds-on in Betfair&apos;s ante-post market on the contest, confirmed starters for this year&apos;s renewal are few and far between, with top horses such as Twice Over, Midday and Snow Fairy all no more than possible participants, along with the French hopes Planteur and Cirrus Des Aigles. No horse&apos;s absence will be felt more badly than that of the Khalid Abdullah-owned Frankel, with Derby now resigned to the fact that the colt will instead be kept back for Ascot&apos;s Champions&apos; Day in October. &quot;Given that Prince Khalid&apos;s stud is our biggest sponsor and that his racing manager will shortly become our racecourse chairman, I&apos;m certainly not taking it personally,&quot; said Derby. &quot;Sir Henry [Cecil] has made it clear that he could run Frankel in the race next year and it would be lovely to think that York might be on the horse&apos;s agenda, particularly as a Juddmonte-owned horse is still to win the race. &quot;But Await The Dawn has been talked off as a Breeders&apos; Cup horse and you just don&apos;t know how the race will work out. I remember when Electrocutionist won in 2005 people were saying &apos;Who is this horse?&apos; and then he went and won the Dubai World Cup only a few months later. &quot;The Nunthorpe Stakes is looking like it will be a very good race for a number of reasons and the Yorkshire Oaks is also looking very strong both in terms of quality and numbers.&quot; Derby said he had no regrets about the decision to shift the meeting back by 24 hours, with the Ebor Handicap becoming the feature event of the new Saturday card. &quot;There were a number of factors that led us to make the change, but one was that we didn&apos;t have any other Saturday fixtures between July and October and that we felt there was a space for a Saturday feature race, a competitive and popular betting event. &quot;Furthermore, Saturday is the best day for promoting racing and building exposure and for people to come racing and as a result of the course&apos;s continued success, we have been able to put a higher executive contribution into prize money than ever before this year.&quot; An ambassadorial visit to Ballydoyle earlier in the year does seem to have paid off for Derby, with Seville (Great Voltigeur) and Wonder Of Wonders (Yorkshire Oaks) both also intended York runners for the stable next week.

ARGENTINA Football fight causes referee to take flight There was a spot of bother back in Diego&apos;s homeland last week when a fifth division match between Union San Guillermo and Atl\u00e9tico Tostado descended almost literally into farce when the players turned on the referee. With the players unhappy after a decision, the man in the middle received a chest-first sumo slam and as words were exchanged fists also started flying and one aggrieved player launched a midriff-high kung-fu kick to his lower back. The assistant referees joined in, only for the coaches to do the same. At which point these flair ups usually dissipate into ineffectual flailing of the handbag variety. But one of the linesmen had further inflamed things and was pursued off the pitch, out of the gate and down the road, Keystone Kops-style by angry players. Heading off into the middle distance he made good his escape (now also pursued by angry fans) by climbing a huge chain-link fence. USA Star Wars and the San Francisco Giants Something for Premier League clubs to ponder in terms of added value for fans as the San Francisco Giants baseball team offer a special Star Wars-themed day for their match against the Arizona Diamondbacks on 4 September. Not only featuring a seat in the special Star Wars section and access to the pre-game costume party, tickets also include two special treats. The first is the Brian Wilson in carbonite statue. Wilson is the bearded and eccentric pitcher for the Giants and the statue is three sided. One side features the iconic Han Solo in carbonite pose and the second with Wilson, in his trademark post-save celebration pose \u2013 crossed arms, left hand in his glove and right hand underneath pointing with the index finger while looking at the sky \u2013 which is also frozen in carbonite like the unfortunate Captain Solo. The third has graphics celebrating the Giants and Star Wars. All of which beats an overpriced shirt hands down, but better still, after the game the Giants will be screening The Empire Strikes Back, the best of the original three (good) Star Wars movies and from which all that freezing in carbonite took place. The Giants made no comment about whether Wilson, like Solo, either shot Greedo first or was to be delivered to Jabba the Hutt&apos;s palace at the fringe of the Western Dune Sea on Tatooine. USA Patriots&apos; Ochocinco seeks room, internet, Xbox The equally eccentric Chad Ochocinco, the wide receiver who signed with NFL side the New England Patriots last month, has been settling into his new home of Boston in his own inimitable fashion. The player, who was born Chad Javon Johnson, and changed his name to Ochocinco in 2008 \u2013 &quot;eight five&quot; his jersey number in Spanish and in honour of Hispanic heritage month \u2013 is also a keen twitterer, has appeared on Dancing with the Stars, reality TV shows, has his own app and has participated in Major League Soccer and even bull riding. But he told ESPN that moving to a new city requires new tactics. &quot;I&apos;m going to do something different, I&apos;m actually going to stay with a fan for the first two, three weeks of the season,&quot; he said. &quot;That should be fun, until I get myself acclimated and learn my way around.&quot; However, it seems he has already been investigating Boston: &quot;The way I learn a new city is by travelling out, adventuring out, getting lost on purpose,&quot; he said. &quot;This past weekend, I was a little frustrated because I was lost for about an hour, an hour and 30 minutes and I couldn&apos;t get where I needed to. [But] that&apos;s it. Boston, or actually heaven, has been good.&quot; There has been no lucky fan named by the player as of yet but Ochocinco does have one or two needs that must be met. &quot;I&apos;m not sure how it&apos;s going to work, but they have to have [the] internet. They have to have [an] Xbox,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s about it.&quot; When asked if the plan was serious, he replied: &quot;Have I ever lied to you before?&quot; And in response to the reminder that there were some &quot;crazy&quot; fans out there he simply said: &quot;I rode a bull.&quot; USA Taking the piste There was no such lightheartedness at the New York Post who were unsurprisingly harsh on the member of the US Ski team who urinated on an 11-year-old girl during a flight back from training camp. Robert &quot;Sandy&quot; Vietze, one of 75 elite skiers in the US, has been bumped from the county&apos;s ski team developmental roster after the incident, terrible in itself but in which he really could not have chosen a victim more likely to raise the hackles of the Post. The girl was flying with her sister and cancer-stricken father on a trip to see her grandmother on eastern Long Island for the first time since his diagnosis. Soon after takeoff, Vietze, who had been drinking, stumbled from his seat and &quot;emptied his bladder onto the girl, who was briefly left alone while her dad and sister were in restrooms.&quot; &quot;I was drunk and I did not realise I was pissing on her leg,&quot; Vietze later told the police. The girl&apos;s father, a stage four cancer patient, caught him midstream and tried to &quot;wipe him out&quot; reported the paper. &quot;Fuck that kid. I don&apos;t want him near my family,&quot; he yelled. The skier slurred that he had suffered &quot;an accident,&quot; reported another passenger. &quot;He&apos;s a very nice boy, one of the nicest, most respectable young people I&apos;ve ever met,&quot; said a neighbour, Colin Seaman. &quot;It would be very hard for me to believe that this even happened.&quot; But the Post was having none of it. &quot;He probably just pissed away his Olympic dreams,&quot; it opened, before referring to him as &quot;The leaky loser&quot; who &quot;expressed no remorse outside his family&apos;s palatial Vermont home, where he ignored questions about the incident and showed no interest in apologising to his victim.&quot; Follow Giles Richards on Twitter: @giles_richards", "title": "Diego Maradona dives in to Dubai and Chad Ochocinco seeks a room-mate", "sentences": ["UNITED ARAB EMIRATES Maradona dives head first in to his new job  Dubai&apos;s The National reports that Diego Maradona took his first training session with club side Al Wasl this week and while he put the team through their paces, he also showed them some of the old magic \u2013 taking a spectacularly theatrical dive \u2013 as the side learnt all of the old masters tricks."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-14T00:32:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/aug/15/improbable-research-skyscrapers-demolish-take-down", "tags": ["Research", "Architecture", "Higher education", "Empire State Building, New York, US", "Education", "Skyscrapers"], "article": "The engineers who designed and built the very tallest, most skyscraping skyscrapers said very little about whether \u2013 let alone how \u2013 someone could safely disassemble such a colossus, should the need arise. About the only person who thought about it long and hard was the writer and illustrator David Macauley. Decades ago, Macauley published a children&apos;s book called Unbuilding. It explains, in words and highly detailed drawings, how to carefully, lovingly take apart the Empire State Building. In the race to build ever-taller buildings, a problem lurks. These towers are so costly, and the real estate market unpredictable enough, that some of them could become financial failures. To simply abandon something nearly a quarter of a mile tall (the Empire State Building), then let it rot and crumble, would be unneighbourly on a grand scale. Indeed, how would one disassemble one of the tallest skyscrapers without risking huge damage to its neighbourhood? And how would this work financially, if the tower needed to be disassembled because the owners ran out of money? David Macauley tells how, if you have the money, to unbuild in a way that is &quot;practical and safe&quot;. You take the building down &quot;floor by floor in the reverse order in which it had been built&quot;. These days, architecturally, things are looking up. The tallest building, currently, the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai, is more than twice the height of the Empire State Building. An architecture firm has just announced plans to erect something even taller, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Financially ... well, it&apos;s a thrilling time for new skyscrapers&apos; owners, and perhaps soon for the neighbours. The book Unbuilding, published in 1980, is a fantasy about the future. In it, the &quot;Greater Riyadh Institute of Petroleum&quot; needs a new headquarters. A Saudi Arabian prince decides, for symbolic purposes, to purchase the Empire State Building, and move it from New York City to Riyadh. (He chooses, on the basis of cost, to transport only those &quot;portions of the building necessary to recreate its appearance&quot;, and build everything else.) New Yorkers are at first outraged at the thought of losing their most beloved building. But after the Prince Ali offers the city new parks, museums, and other compensation, nearly everyone agrees to let him take the Empire State Building. The book at this point has a passage that reads very differently, now in the year 2011, than it did in 1980: &quot;One desperate but clever preservationist suggested that the twin towers of the World Trade Centre be offered instead \u2013 both for the price of the Empire State. In declining the offer Ali suggested that he would be willing to consider pulling them down as a goodwill gesture. With this final show of generosity all remaining resistance crumbled.&quot; Marc Abrahams Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel prize", "title": "Improbable research: how to demolish a skyscraper", "sentences": ["The tallest building, currently, the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai, is more than twice the height of the Empire State Building."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-15T16:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/aug/16/nextgen-series-youth-senior-football", "tags": ["Football", "Aston Villa", "Liverpool", "Manchester City", "Tottenham Hotspur", "Celtic", "Sport"], "article": "Aspiring professional footballers usually miss out on the globe-trotting gap years enjoyed by many of their &apos;civilian&apos; peers but compensation has finally arrived in the form of a glamorous European Under-19 competition. Very much a junior Champions League, the NextGen Series, which kicks off across the continent on Wednesday, features 16 clubs including Barcelona, Aston Villa, Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur and Celtic. Between now and November they will compete in four groups, hoping to progress to the knockout stages in the new year. At this juncture, things deviate from the senior Champions League format as NextGen morphs into a mini, sudden-death tournament likely to be staged in the Middle East \u2013 Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Doha are possibilities \u2013 in January. Liverpool begin against Sporting Lisbon at Anfield on Wednesday night when it is hoped ticket prices of \u00a35 for adults and \u00a32 for children will attract a sizeable crowd. Frank McParland, the head of Liverpool&apos;s academy and reserves, trusts such occasions will enhance the chances of more of his proteges following in the footsteps of Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher. &quot;There&apos;s no doubt the boys are going to be stretched, which maybe can&apos;t always be said when it comes to more regular reserve football,&quot; McParland says.He hopes NextGen will capture the imagination of Liverpool fans facing up to a rare season bereft of first-team European competition. With not only Barcelona but Internazionale, Ajax, PSV Eindhoven, Fenerbahce and Marseille among those involved, the technical bar is bound to be raised as Mark Warburton sees his brainchild finally spring into life. Warburton dreamed up NextGen during a previous incarnation as Watford&apos;s academy director. &quot;I realised 18- and 19-year-olds needed a different challenge to help them make the transition to the first team,&quot; he says. At the time McParland was scouting for Watford. &quot;Three or four years ago Mark and I often discussed how we could improve and advance youth football,&quot; he says. &quot;We used to throw ideas around and say how fantastic it would be to put kids from the biggest clubs in England against the giants of Europe. Now Mark&apos;s got NextGen off the ground and it&apos;s become a reality, it will only benefit our young players.&quot; Defying widespread economic gloom, Warburton has found investors willing to finance the competing clubs&apos; hotel and flight costs in the belief that payback will eventually come in the form of television and sponsorship deals. With broadcasters already in talks with the company, the plan is to expand the competition to 24 teams next season when Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid are expected to join. In time NextGen could not only widen the gulf between the Premier League&apos;s elite teams and the rest but potentially prove a more attractive broadcast proposition than the Championship. For the moment though, it is primarily about rectifying the growing disconnect between the demands of reserve and first XI football. &quot;We want to fill a void,&quot; Warburton says. &quot;Apart from an exceptional few capable of jumping straight into first teams, many promising academy graduates have not been provided with enough consistent high-quality challenges. We think we can avoid wasting talent by helping more young players reach senior level. &quot;The FA Youth Cup aside, English youngsters don&apos;t have enough really competitive games; in many reserve fixtures the result isn&apos;t all that important. And our competition has educational benefits too; the players will learn a lot from travelling abroad. They&apos;ll be out of their comfort zones.&quot; The exposure to big-match pressures allied to the debilitating effects of frequently flying home through the night are cheered by Mark Allen, the head of Manchester City&apos;s academy. &quot;Our young players will now be competing against the best in Europe,&quot; he says. &quot;The experience will give them a proper platform on which to prepare for first-team life. We see this as an important chapter in the development of Manchester City.&quot; NextGen rules permit three under-20s to feature in an otherwise under-19 ensemble, an allowance Allen regards as eminently logical. &quot;The average age of a Premier League debut is becoming older,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s 21 or 22 when it might once have been 17 or 18. We have to bridge the gap and prepare everyone for a better standard of football. And who knows you might see the next Lionel Messi at Hyde [City&apos;s reserve home].&quot; Chris McCart, Celtic&apos;s head of youth development, believes involvement confers the additional bonus of increasing his club&apos;s pulling power. &quot;We&apos;re confident our youngsters&apos; style of play will improve but NextGen should also be excellent in terms of youth recruitment,&quot; he says. &quot;We can now offer the opportunity of overseas travel and games against the likes of Barcelona.&quot; Few gap years can compete.

With barely a fortnight to go, the Spanish players&apos; union called a strike over more than \u20ac50m of unpaid wages and on Wednesday morning another meeting between the league and the players&apos; union, the AFE, broke down. According to the AFE president Jos\u00e9 Luis Rubiales, in the last two years alone 200 players have been affected by salaries that have gone unpaid. So, here we are: three days to go and there&apos;s no football. Another meeting is scheduled for Friday morning. This time Rubiales, who missed Wednesday morning&apos;s meeting because he had just become a father, will be there. Game on? Game off. That meeting will be held less than 24 hours before the season starts (or doesn&apos;t start) and the strike proposal involves refusing to play in weeks one and two of the league season. Could the league go ahead? Don&apos;t rule it out, but the words used on Wednesday morning were: &quot;practically impossible&quot;. Meanwhile, the words used by the LFP and the AFE were largely pretty angry ones. Only, strike threats and last-minute turn around are familiar; threats are easily dismissed. Nah, there&apos;s no way they will actually go through with it. Every year it seems like the season won&apos;t start for one reason or another. Or that if it does, there will be something wrong, something missing. Like footage. The obligatory TV disputes have been at the heart of many of the threats and proposed strike action is nothing new. It is also just another manifestation of the dire financial state of football here. There have been opening weekends when, just days before, no one knew who was playing when. A few years ago, Sevilla were the only team in the league that didn&apos;t have a TV deal so they retaliated by banning all cameras from all their games. Real Sociedad got round the problem of their fans not knowing the score when they played Sevilla by recovering the old tradition of letting off fireworks over the Bay of Biscay every time a goal was scored. Trouble was, no one knew which goal had been scored. Last season there were two proposed strikes; there was even one led by the clubs themselves in a clumsy and frankly baseless protest at the law that protects one game a week on free to air. On both occasions the show went on. For all the threats, it always does. This threat, though, feels different: a team photo of almost a hundred footballers, with Spain captain Iker Casillas and a load of other big names at its head, was designed to show how serious they are. There really is a chance that this won&apos;t happen. If it doesn&apos;t, no one really knows how they&apos;ll fit in the extra two weeks; will they play over Christmas? Will week one (and week two?) be crowbarred in somewhere else or will the entire fixture list be shifted on a week? (If so, Barcelona will be at the World Club Cup when they are supposed to be playing Real Madrid). There is huge uncertainty. But then again the only certainty in the Spanish league is uncertainty. La Liga is, as one wit put it, played by geniuses and run by idiots. The strike may happen but the threat of it is nothing new and it is a consequence of deep, structural problems that have been growing by the year \u2013 much like the gap between Madrid and Barcelona and the rest. This season there will be games at 6, 8, and 10 on Saturdays, 12, 4, 6, 8, and 10 (yes, 10 at night) on Sundays, and 9 on Mondays. But don&apos;t bother asking when they will be and certainly don&apos;t bother trying to arrange a trip to see them \u2026 no one will know that until eight days before. Still, there are some certainties. Although Qatari-owned M\u00e1laga have built a fascinating and strikingly sensible project that may in the long term be able to compete (but more of them in Sunday&apos;s Observer), even an LFP president can see that Madrid and Barcelona will be the top two. Both have reinforced this summer. Despite winning league and Champions League, Barcelona are conscious of the need to evolve tactically, adding new qualities to their game. They also recognise that, in terms of key injuries in midfield and attack, they got lucky last season. With a compact season \u2013 one that might be about to get even more compact if the strike goes ahead \u2013 and with the World Club Championships to play, they have signed Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Cesc F\u00e1bregas. Then there is Barcelona B&apos;s Thiago Alc\u00e1ntara, whose brilliant performances over the summer suggest that he will have a greater part to play. Cesc is symbolic of that desire to add depth and variety. Yes, his signing responds to a kind of emotional need, the Catalan boy coming home, and the most pressing necessity is the future one of replacing Xavi Hernandez and maintaining the continuity of progression in the Barcelona midfield (Xavi is 31, Iniesta 27, Thiago 20: at 24, Cesc fits perfectly in the middle, guaranteeing a degree of continuity). But he also gives an element of drive, speed and the ability to shoot from mid-distance that Barcelona arguably lacked. Alexis offers what is often described as profundidad \u2013 the directness that helps make the pitch longer, to run at and get beyond defenders. Madrid&apos;s signings have been interesting too. Mourinho&apos;s long, public insistence on a third striker last year has disappeared \u2013 for now at least. It may be a tactic and privately he has reiterated the desire for one more signing. But Madrid&apos;s director general Jorge Valdano, the man who once likened Mourinho&apos;s football &quot;to shit on a stick&quot;, and the man whose position always appeared untenable from the very start, has gone. Mourinho now has total power \u2013 a manager not just a coach. Many have criticised Mourinho and in many cases for good reason. But one thing that has been forgotten is that on this issue at least Mourinho was right: Madrid&apos;s model did need to change. In handing him power, president Florentino P\u00e9rez has not only revealed his desperation but also his recognition that the model he built did not work \u2013 even if the media is not exactly falling over itself to point that out. Madrid&apos;s signings reflect Mourinho&apos;s new role. It is not immediately apparent where any of them fit in the starting eleven \u2013 even Nuri Sahin, probably the most exciting of them and, at \u20ac10m, a potential bargain too. But Madrid, who already had an extraordinary squad, arguably the best and certainly the most expensive in history (last season they went in to the Champions League semi-final with a bench that included Kak\u00e1, Higua\u00edn and Benzema), have an incredible collection of players. And they are players that Mourinho believes he can mould and trust. Just looking at the fees is frightening: Pepe \u20ac30m, Ramos \u20ac27m, Di Mar\u00eda \u20ac25m, Kak\u00e1 \u20ac65m, Diarra \u20ac20m, Gago \u20ac18m, Ozil \u20ac18m, Alonso \u20ac30m, Benzema \u20ac35m , Ronaldo \u20ac95m. And those are the players that were already there. Some of them, unwanted, won&apos;t be there for very much longer. They have been joined by Sahin and Hamit Altintop, who are yet to play; Spanish football&apos;s very own Jedward, Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n; Rapha\u00ebl Varane and Fabio Coentrao \u2013 who has been perhaps the summer&apos;s outstanding player from a variety of positions, but not the left-back slot it was assumed he would play. The best performer, though, has been Karim Benzema. Leaner, faster, he had a wonderful run last season, only to find himself playing 57 minutes in the run of four cl\u00e1sicos against Barcelona that ultimately defined the season. Ozil, too, suddenly slipped out of the side when the moment of truth arrived. The Super Copa first leg against Barcelona suggests a more aggressive, more attacking Real Madrid. Thing is, Madrid only got a 2-2 draw on Sunday night. At home. Against a Barcelona side without Puyol, Piqu\u00e9, Xavi and Busquets, before last night&apos;s second leg. And that&apos;s the thing: there may be differences between Madrid and Barcelona but they are nothing like the differences between them and the rest. Both are far too good for La Liga&apos;s &apos;other&apos; clubs. The title may well boil down to the cl\u00e1sicos \u2013 two games out of 36, in which the smallest details could have the greatest of impacts \u2013 or to the odd unexpected draw in a league where draws are the new defeats. Madrid lost last year&apos;s title because Barcelona were the better team, but also because they failed to score against Mallorca, Levante, Osasuna, Sporting, and Deportivo. What, though, about the other teams? Sadly, the response is too often: what about them? Here&apos;s what: Athletic Bilbao: So much for loyalty. Athletic coach Joaqu\u00edn Caparr\u00f3s was criticised for talking to other clubs in the summer rather than committing to Athletic. Then he did, but president Fernando Macua lost the elections and Caparr\u00f3s was out of a job. His replacement is Marcelo Bielsa and Athletic&apos;s style is about to undergo a dramatic change; more technical, more complex, shorter. They have the players, too, with Ander Herrera joining Iker Munia\u00edn, Javi Mart\u00ednez, Fernando Llorente and Andoni Iraola. A European place is likely; maybe even more. Will certainly be fun. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid: Sergio Ag\u00fcero has gone, David de Gea has gone and Diego Forl\u00e1n is going. At Atl\u00e9tico Madrid people are always leaving \u2013 except the two men that really should leave. They have though made some interesting signings led by Arda Turan, with a striker likely to come. Betis: At last they&apos;re back. Arguably, the funnest and funniest team in La Liga return to the top flight. And the league kicks off \u2013 if it kicks off \u2013 with the Seville derby, which should be fantastic and has been missed. Unlike Manuel Ruiz de Lopera, the president who has finally gone. Stuck in administration, they&apos;re likely to struggle though. Espanyol: Callej\u00f3n, De La Pe\u00f1a, David Garc\u00eda, and Chica have all gone and it looks like Osvaldo will be going, Kameni too. The president Daniel Sanchez Llibre has also departed after almost 15 years. Didac, who left last winter, is back though \u2013 on loan from Milan. Last year&apos;s eighth place may be possible again but looks unlikely. Getafe: Hang on a minute. Weren&apos;t these supposed to be golden days for Getafe? Taken over by Dubai-based owners Royal Emirates, the promise was of \u20ac30m a year \u2013 enough to establish Getafe as regular challengers for a European place. There were going to be big signings galore. So, Manu, Parejo, Boateng, V\u00edctor S\u00e1nchez, Alb\u00edn, Marcano and a handful of others have \u2026 erm, gone? Granada: Udinese&apos;s Spanish branch. Granada, propped up by the Italian club where their president and ubiquitous club administrator Quique Pena worked, had 12 Udinese players on loan last season. That was enough to come up via the play-offs. Will that support be enough to stay up. Back in the First Division 31 years later. Levante: Last year&apos;s miracle, this year&apos;s first team down? The lowest budget in the division, they have lost coach Luis Garc\u00eda, the motivational genius who brought them together, and they have also lost nine players, including top scorer Felipe Caicedo. M\u00e1laga: Money, money, money. Sheik Abdullah bin Naser al Thani took over last summer and brought in a new manager and new players. Halfway through the season, it wasn&apos;t working: they were going down. So they sacked the coach and brought some new players. This time it did work, with Julio Baptista leading the way. Now they have signed a load more players, from Van Nistelrooy to Monreal, from Toulalan to Joaqu\u00edn and Isco to Cazorla. Cazorla cost \u20ac19m: more than M\u00e1laga&apos;s entire budget a couple of seasons ago. Suddenly their budget has shot to \u20ac150m, making it the league&apos;s third biggest, and they have spent more than \u20ac50m. But it is not just about money: there is solidity to this project that suggests that this might even work. Mallorca: Safe all season, the project finally looking secure on and off the pitch, suddenly Mallorca found themselves within a goal of going down on the final day. Should not suffer the same fate this season but if Jonathan de Guzman gets his wish of a move to Villarreal, it will be a mighty blow. Osasuna: Osasuna were in relegation trouble right to the end of the league and finished ninth. Which kind of says it all about the different strata in Spain. They&apos;re used to suffering, which is a good job really. Josetxo has gone but, somehow, Patxi Pu\u00f1al \u2013 the man who used to cycle to training after his morning shift at the factory - is still around. Osasuna have signed Nino from Tenerife, which sounds like a good idea when you consider the 17 and 14 goals he has score in the least two years, but then it hits you: he was relegated both times. Racing: Remember Ali Syed? He arrived at Racing as the saviour, going bonkers in the directors&apos; box and promising big things. Well, now he has disappeared and refuses to answer the phone. Racing are in administration, their coach has gone and so have a load of their players \u2013 most of them a little worse off after going unpaid. The new coach is Hector C\u00faper, the man who if there was a competition for coming second would still come second. Sadly, it wouldn&apos;t be a huge surprise if he did it again. Second bottom. Rayo Vallecano: Madrid&apos;s self-consciously left-wing club from the neighbourhood of Vallecas. Rayo&apos;s players went on strike last season. Their owners - the, erm, &apos;controversial&apos; Ruiz-Mateos family - were finally kicked out after 20 years. And they ended up in administration. Still they came up, eight years later. Great fun in their three-sided ground (the fourth is just a huge board covered with adverts), the thing is they are almost certain to go straight back down again. Half the team have gone and there are rumours that the coach may yet walk with four more players after administrators tried to enforce a 70% pay cut upon them. Real Sociedad: The departure of coach Mart\u00edn Lasarte came as a surprise \u2013 not only had he brought la Real up but for much of last season they over-performed. But his relationship with the club&apos;s directors had long been difficult. The new man in charge is Philippe Montanier from Valenciennes and the man who achieved three promotions in a row with Boulogne. His ability to bring through young players is a key reason for la Real turning to him \u2013 19 of the first team squad have come up from Real Sociedad B. Sevilla: Fredi is staying. The legs are creaking and he&apos;s slower than ever but Sevilla could not be happier. Kanout\u00e9 is, some fans insist, the best signing the club has ever made. This summer he talked about finally walking away, six seasons two Copa del Reys and two Uefa Cups later. Such is the respect that Sevilla said they would let him decide and simply wait for him. One day, he announced he was staying. In a team that has desperately lacked a touch of quality of late, he may be important too. Under new management \u2013 Marcelino has joined from Racing \u2013 and with Rakitic giving a degree of control, the aim will be Champions League football. Sporting: They&apos;ve been arguing all summer about the new kit at Sporting. And in the end the fans got their way, too. The team is a different matter: Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel has gone to Roma, Javi Poves decided to ditch football all together for moral and political reasons and by far their best player Diego Castro has gone to Getafe. Not one of their current players got more than 10 goals last season. It won&apos;t be easy to do so this campaign either. Valencia: Amidst all the talk of Madrid, Barcelona and M\u00e1laga, few have noticed Valencia slowly adding to an already impressive squad \u2013 and last season they were the only team that consistently caused Barcelona problems. Joaqu\u00edn and Isco have gone, but Parejo, Piatti and Canales have all joined (even though Canales won&apos;t be able to play against Real Madrid). Lille&apos;s Adil Rami, at centre-back, is a vital addition too. Coach Unai Emery never seems especially well liked at the club, but he&apos;s starting his fourth successive season. Villarreal: It has been a difficult summer for Villarreal. Joan Capdevila and Santi Cazorla both departed \u2013 two of the funniest, nicest guys you could wish to meet in football and the impact on the squad has been genuinely important. Financially, Villarreal are struggling after years of being one of Spain&apos;s most stable clubs and departures were inevitable. Cazorla was Villarreal&apos;s key creative player last season. The good news is that Giuseppe Rossi didn&apos;t join Barcelona and Borja Valero is still around. Zaragoza: Zaragoza haven&apos;t got any money and are in voluntary administration having racked up debts in excess of \u20ac130m. In Spain, administration brings no footballing penalties. In fact, Zaragoza have been largely unaffected. They signed goalkeeper Roberto from Benfica for \u20ac8m. Only they paid 1% of that: the goalkeeper was instead bought by an investment fund in which Jorge Mendes and Peter Kenyon are involved. Other clubs were annoyed but suggested they would do the same, bringing the prospect of widespread third-party ownership (which is not illegal) to Spain. Five others have joined, including three from Madrid and Barcelona&apos;s B teams. Aguirre dragged them out of relegation trouble last season. It is likely to be much the same battle this time round.", "title": "La Liga 2011-12 season preview | Sid Lowe", "sentences": ["Taken over by Dubai-based owners Royal Emirates, the promise was of \u20ac30m a year \u2013 enough to establish Getafe as regular challengers for a European place."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-18T09:35:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/aug/18/horse-racing-tips-horse-racing", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport", "York racecourse"], "article": "5.05pm Hanagan&apos;s the man again Chris Cook: For the second day in a row, Paul Hanagan has nicked a winner in the last race of the day, pushing Dazinski (20-1) to victory in the two-mile handicap from Chilly Filly (5-1). The race will not have made for enjoyable viewing for backers of Tuscan Gold, who unseated Stevie Donohoe coming out of the stalls and then raced among the leaders with ears pricked, showing tremendous enthusiasm and no little ability. Deauville Flyer (4-1) was third and Hawk Mountain (12-1) fourth. 4.25pm A royal winner in the Galtres! Chris Cook: Carlton House let the Queen down in the Derby but perhaps Set To Music could do better in the Leger (she would have to be supplemented). She has just been an impressive winner of the Galtres, a Listed race over a mile and a half. &quot;The style of the victory has slightly caught me on the hop,&quot; says the winning trainer, Michael Bell, who will now mull his options. He said he had been chewing over the possibility of the Prix Vermeille. The filly travelled well under Jamie Spencer, tracking Spin, and bounded forward when asked for her effort, readily passing Cracking Lass (25-1), with Pollys Mark (5-1) three lengths further back in third. Wild Coco, the 11-8 favourite, started to fade a long way out. 3.44pm Blue Bunting, an excellent filly, wins Yorkshire Oaks Chris Cook: She holds off Vita Nova by a length, the pair clear. Her pacemaker, Rumh, set what seemed a steady gallop, with Banimpire and Crystal Capella taking a furlong or so to settle down. Blue Bunting was held up with only Brushing behind her, while Vita Nova raced in third, with Wonder Of Wonders just ahead of her. Blue Bunting (11-4) made her run up the far rail and the result did not seem in doubt for most of the home straight, though Vita Nova (9-2) stayed on well. Wonder Of Wonders (8-1) raced awkwardly once passed but did enough for third. Crystal Capella and Banimpire finished together, neither having got into it after pulling through the early stages. Laughing Lashes finished right out the back, stone last, and has not run her race. This is a seventh Group One success for Godolphin&apos;s newest trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni, who only got his licence at the start of last year. Blue Bunting has won three Group Ones from four starts this year and it is amazing now to recall that she was 16-1 for the Guineas. Well done to m&apos;colleague, Will Hayler, who has nailed the big-race winner today. 3.40pm Here comes the shrewd money Chris Cook: Banimpire now 6s on Betfair. 3.12pm Navajo Chief finishes strongly to land mile handicap Chris Cook: They seem to have gone a sensible pace from the off in that race because Navajo Chief was prominent from an early stage, as were the third, Pintura (6-1), and the fourth, Prime Exhibit (33-1). Smarty Socks (8-1) raced towards the far side while most of the field came up the middle. He ran on well in the final quarter-mile and looked like winning until the winner went past close home. Watching the replay, Smarty Socks was immediately taken across the back of the field to the rail from a wide draw by Silvestre de Sousa, and made up a tonne of ground during the race, which no others seem to have managed. He deserves real credit for finishing so close. Smarty Socks went 1-10 on Betfair while Navajo Chief traded (for buttons) at prices up to 589-1. 2.39pm Best Terms lands Lowther. How was it 11-1? Chris Cook: Not that that sort of thought is especially helpful after the race. Best Terms won the Queen Mary at Royal Ascot when last seen and has whizzed up in the Lowther, two lengths ahead of Fire Lily (4-1) with the pair clear. Best Terms has had an over-reach since Ascot, which prevented her going over to France for the Robert Papin, and perhaps that explains the lack of market confidence in her. But Richard Hannon Jr was clear on Racing UK just before the race that she had made a full recovery. Unbeaten in four now, she broke well and made all. Fire Lily was fourth in the Queen Mary, so that race appears to have been strong this year. The same cannot be said of the Cherry Hinton, won by Gamilati, who was well beaten here. Hello Glory (16-1) ran on to be third. She was the winner of an Ascot maiden when last seen. And, alas, Angels Will Fall has not provided Barry Hills with a last hurrah. Richard Hughes says on RUK that he was a bit disappointed with Best Terms when she worked the other day and, had he been the trainer, he might not have run her. &quot;If she stays a mile, she&apos;s going to be really good,&quot; he says.  Hughes reckons she&apos;ll turn up at Newmarket for the Cheveley Park and is clearly hoping she might be a Guineas filly, though she looks more of a speed horse. You can have 20-1 with several firms. 2.35pm Bogart&apos;s time says ground is drying Will Hayler: The going description may not have changed but the time of the first race certainly suggests that conditions may be drying out, with the winner of the sales race, Bogart, clocking 1.12.68 in victory compared to the 1.15.05 of Bomber Jet over the same trip in the nursery yesterday.  2.35pm Gamilati drifting for the Lowther Chris Cook: Now 6-1 on Betfair from opening 4s. 2.08pm Bogart (17-2) bags the treasure  Chris Cook: All over the place in the Richmond at Goodwood, Bogart has run a much more professional race to win the opener at York, earning prize money of \u00a3136,000 for his connections. Kevin Ryan&apos;s chestnut travelled well throughout and ran on strongly to pull clear of Miss Work Of Art (16-1). &quot;Play it again,&quot; says Lydia Hislop, watching the replay on Racing UK. Insert further Bogey-related gags here. The 15-8 favourite, Crown Dependency, was in trouble from about halfway. For whatever reason, this meeting has not usually been very productive for his trainer, Richard Hannon. It was a dead-heat for third between Ewell Place (40-1) and Gerfalcon (16-1). 2pm More drama in the air than in the Ebor draw Will Hayler: I ended up watching a display from the RAF Falcons parachute display team, stood next to racecourse boss William Derby in front of the grandstands.  I may be wrong, but I don&apos;t think we share the same dark sense of humour, which left me hoping that one of them would end up stuck on the top of the clock tower in the middle of the course. Needless to say, they landed in perfect formation and I was foiled again as they unveiled a &apos;Welcome to Yorkshire&apos; flag on the way down.  The man on the microphone said, &apos;Doesn&apos;t it make you proud to be British?&apos; and everyone cheered. Maybe they ought to look at finding a way to incorporate it into the draw &apos;ceremony&apos; for the Ebor next year. Even Fred Done himself looked bored by the end of proceedings, but the essential problem was that nobody seemed entirely clear as to whether they had received a good or bad draw.  My first instinct was that Lost In The Moment had been kippered by stall 21 and that Saptapadi had fared even worse, widest of all in 22, but other sages in the press room think that if the runners try to come across to the stands&apos; rail (where I believe a fresh strip of ground will be opened on the day), a high draw could prove highly favourable.  Saptapadi&apos;s trainer, Brian Ellison, summed things up when being invited to the stage by draw host Nick Luck to reflect upon getting stall 22. Shrugging his shoulders, he said: &quot;Now they all come down the middle anyway, everyone&apos;s got a chance.&quot;  1.40pm Barry Hills prepares for final bow Greg Wood: Angels Will Fall will not be the final runner of Barry Hills&apos;s long and distinguished career when she lines up for the Group Two Lowther Stakes this afternoon, nor even his last starter in a Group race, as Critical Moment is in the field for the Group Three Strensall Stakes on Friday. She does, though, seem to offer by far his best chance of a final victory in a Pattern event, and there will be plenty of sentimental cash behind her this afternoon. York will make its official farewell to one of the great trainers of the last 40 years tomorrow when Hills, a keen gardener, will plant a copper beech tree in the pre-parade ring. He will also be presented with a specially commissioned &quot;fantasy racecard&quot; commemorating some of his big-race winners on the Knavesmire, including the ever-popular Further Flight and the fine racemare Dibidale, who took the Yorkshire Oaks in 1974. Angels Will Fall is the narrow favourite for the Lowther on Betfair, just ahead of the Godolphin runner Gamilati, while Hills also has a couple of fair each-way chances in the opening race, West Leake Diman and Red Art. 1.30pm Great prize for next week&apos;s competition Chris Cook: By happy chance, a really terrific prize has fallen into our laps for next week&apos;s competition. Our winner will bag two tickets to Cartmel on the following Monday, the 29th of August, a bank holiday, with a three-course lunch in the Chasers restaurant there and \u00a350 in betting vouchers from the Tote. ALSO thrown in is bed and breakfast for that Monday night into Tuesday at the Swan Hotel at Newby Bridge on the southern tip of Lake Windermere. Show up on here on Monday for your chance to win. 1.20pm Victoire Pisa out of Arc Chris Cook: Victoire Pisa, last seen winning the Dubai World Cup under a sensational ride from Mirco Demuro, will not turn up for the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe. Seventh in last year&apos;s Arc, he suffered a leg injury on Saturday while exercising in France and will now return to his normal base in Japan. &quot;On August 13 after training, they noticed that the movement in his left leg was a bit restricted and a vet discovered it was inflamed and that the horse should take it easy for five weeks,&quot; read a statement from the Japan Racing Association. &quot;Because of that, they have decided to pull out of the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe.&quot;  12.45pm Saturday&apos;s declarations . . . Chris Cook: . . . are here. Details of the draw for the Ebor will be added shortly. The draw just took place live on Racing UK, which is a little odd because I don&apos;t really think of the Ebor draw as being an especially hot topic. For the Stewards&apos; Cup or the Lincoln, maybe. The Ebor? Hmmm. Today&apos;s best bets, by Will Hayler Of the last 20 winners of the Irish Oaks who came to York to try and beat older rivals in the Yorkshire Oaks, 10 have been successful. Such bare statistics suggest that the bits of 3-1 available this morning about Blue Bunting (3.40) should be a good bet, but of course few of the horses who set out to try and win again had to beat the horses who finished second, third and fourth at The Curragh, not to mention quality older performers such as Crystal Capella and Vita Nova. Even without Snow Fairy, this year&apos;s Yorkshire Oaks looks a cracker, but I do think (as I said in my preview of today&apos;s TV races here) that Blue Bunting is one I want to be with. Watching replays of recent renewals of the race last night on Racing UK made me realise just how many times the race is won by a bold manouvere right at the start of the home straight and Blue Bunting is the sort of filly who can maintain a grinding gallop all the way to the line from that point. Incidentally, what I also noticed was that coming up the middle of the track in the straight is no new thing. They were doing exactly the same 20 years ago. Maybe the idealistic notion of jockeys taking the shortest and most logical route and sticking to the far rail never really happened at all. Despite no overnight rain, the going remains unchanged at good to soft, good in places, and early course-walkers confirm that a heavy overnight dew has left conditions no quicker than 24 hours ago. Hopefully that will help Wild Coco (4.15) in the Galtres Stakes, as she surely found the going too fast when well beaten at Goodwood last time. Having reportedly worked well at home since that disappointing performance, she can bounce back this afternoon. Tipping competition, day four Already prominent, Shrewdette rocketed to the top by picking Bomber Jet (20-1), a narrow winner of yesterday&apos;s nursery. She is hotly pursued by TheVic, who had both Bomber Jet and Twice Over (11-2). Diegoisgod also had Bomber Jet, while tom1977 and RockyTheHack paired Twice Over with Sea Moon (11-2). Today, we&apos;d like your tips, please, for these races: 3.05 York, 3.40 York, 4.50 York. This week&apos;s prize is a pack of the brand new card game for racing fans, &apos;Collectacard&apos;, produced by Racing For Change in the style of the old Top Trumps games. There are 30-odd cards, each featuring a current Flat racehorse. RFC are pondering a jumps version (which would surely be at least as popular) later in the year. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers. If you have not joined in so far this week, you are welcome to do so today but you will start on -9. In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.

A Guardian investigation into Fox&apos;s role in an alleged threat to withdraw a knighthood from a businessman has revealed that Fox sought the advice of Adam Werritty, a long-term &quot;friend&quot; who ran a charity set up by Fox which was later suspended by regulators. Werritty, who purports to be one of Fox&apos;s official advisers but is not a government employee, organised a &quot;private meeting&quot; for Fox to discuss a highly explosive legal case that centres on life-saving MRSA technology the MoD and its private equity partner, Porton Capital, sold to 3M, the US Post-it note maker. Fox has repeatedly denied that he was personally involved in the case but he faces the embarrassment of being forced to give evidence about allegations of blackmail in a US court. Werritty, who has been a close friend of Fox&apos;s for years and was once a housemate, told Harvey Boulter, the boss of Porton Capital, that Fox would meet him at an upmarket hotel in Dubai to discuss the legal battle with 3M. The MoD, which has already been forced into one embarrassing U-turn over this case, had claimed Fox and Boulter met to discuss an &quot;entirely different matter&quot;. But email correspondence between Werritty and Boulter shows that the MRSA technology, called Acolyte, was on the agenda for the meeting at the five-star Shangri-La hotel in Dubai in June. Werritty emailed Boulter in April saying: &quot;Very good meeting with you in Dubai. Thanks for passing along the below along with the e-info on the two issues [one issue was Acolyte; the other was a mobile phone encryption service developed by one of Boulter&apos;s companies] we discussed. Please leave this with me to push along as discussed.&quot; A month later Werritty emailed Boulter again to say he had passed on Boulter&apos;s concerns about the Acolyte case to Fox&apos;s special advisers, and said: &quot;I&apos;d hope they&apos;d want to make an issue out of this.&quot; On the day of the meeting Werritty emailed saying: &quot;Morning Harvey. He&apos;d [Fox] prefer to have it here [at the Shangri-La]. Let&apos;s meet on the 41st floor lounge.&quot; Witnesses to the 16 June meeting claim Boulter informed Fox about the progress of the legal battle, to which the defence secretary is said to have replied: &quot;I&apos;m sure you&apos;re handling this [the case] in the best way possible.&quot; Fox&apos;s spokesman refused to confirm or deny this statement. Just hours after the meeting, Boulter fired off an email to 3M&apos;s lawyers. It said: &quot;I had a 45-minute meeting with Dr Liam Fox, the British defence minister on our current favourite topic \u2026 As a result of my meeting [with Fox] today you ought to know that David Cameron&apos;s cabinet might very shortly be discussing the rather embarrassing situation of George&apos;s [George Buckley, 3M&apos;s chief executive] knighthood.&quot; [See footnote.] Boulter suggested that a settlement &quot;at a headline of $30m+ will allow MoD to internally save face&quot;. As a result of the meeting Fox now faces the threat of being forced to give evidence in a US court, after 3M launched a blackmail lawsuit. The MoD confirmed that Werritty, who distributes House of Commons business cards that describe him as &quot;advisor to Rt Hon Dr Liam Fox MP&quot;, was not a government employee. The ministry said: &quot;Adam Werritty is not an MoD employee, he is a friend of the secretary of state&quot;. The MoD said no government officials were present at the 16 June meeting and no minutes were taken, which is against protocol. Although no records were kept, the spokesman said: &quot;Dr Fox did not enter into a discussion about this in any respect and at no point raised or discussed the issue of a knighthood.&quot; Werritty ran a charity which Fox founded but which was later suspended by regulators. Fox installed Werritty as the executive director and sole employee of the Atlantic Bridge, a charity closely linked to US neo-conservatives and funded by Michael Hintze, the hedge fund billionaire and big Conservative party donor. Last summer the Charity Commission said Atlantic Bridge&apos;s &quot;current activities must cease immediately&quot;. The commission said the charity&apos;s primary objective appeared to be &quot;promoting a political policy [that] is closely associated with the Conservative party&quot;. &quot;The activities of the charity have not furthered any of its other charitable purposes in any way,&quot; the commission&apos;s investigation report said last July. Members of the charity&apos;s advisory board have included George Osborne, William Hague and Michael Gove. Baroness Thatcher was honorary patron. Werritty is believed to be the charity&apos;s sole member of staff. The charity&apos;s annual report shows it paid its sole staff member \u00a337,151 in 2009 and \u00a315,222 in 2010. Unnamed consultants were paid a total of \u00a363,738 in 2009 and 2010. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 October 2011 to append the following clarification: In the story above, reporting the background to a legal dispute between an investment company, Porton Capital and US conglomerate, 3m, we quote an email from Harvey Boulter, Porton&apos;s chief executive, to William Brewer, a lawyer acting for 3m: &quot;As a result of my meeting [with Fox] today you ought to know that David Cameron&apos;s cabinet might very shortly be discussing the rather embarrassing situation of George&apos;s [George Buckley, 3M&apos;s chief executive] knighthood.&quot; Boulter has contacted us and asked us to state that the meeting at which Buckley&apos;s knighthood was discussed was not the one with Fox but was at another meeting he had that day connected to the dispute.", "title": "Liam Fox's friend set up crucial legal meeting", "sentences": ["Werritty, who has been a close friend of Fox&apos;s for years and was once a housemate, told Harvey Boulter, the boss of Porton Capital, that Fox would meet him at an upmarket hotel in Dubai to discuss the legal battle with 3M.", "But email correspondence between Werritty and Boulter shows that the MRSA technology, called Acolyte, was on the agenda for the meeting at the five-star Shangri-La hotel in Dubai in June.", "Werritty emailed Boulter in April saying: &quot;Very good meeting with you in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-18T20:04:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/aug/19/rolls-building-court-complex-london", "tags": ["Law", "UK news", "London"], "article": "A \u00a3300m state-of-the-art law court complex will open in the next few weeks as the government tries to make the UK the world&apos;s pre-eminent destination for swiftly resolving international high-value legal disputes \u2013 and making a lot of money in the process. The curvaceous, 11-storey Rolls Building in Fetter Lane, close to the Royal Courts of Justice in central London, will contain 31 courts, including three &quot;super-courts&quot; configured to accommodate big, multiparty disputes. The marketing of the Rolls Building, and British justice in general, to a global business audience has already begun, the Queen is being lined up for the building&apos;s inauguration ceremony, and the court&apos;s cutting-edge electronic filing system, which is intended to make it mostly paperless, is being tested. There are, however, dissenting voices who argue that the Rolls Building is about to be unveiled just as the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is closing around 140 magistrates and county courts around the country and preparing to slash the legal aid budget. From October it is hoped that the Rolls Building will become the new home of the chancery division of the high court, the admiralty and commercial court, as well as the technology and construction court. The government hopes it will attract high-profile business disputes from around the world, such as rows over pipelines and property ventures, contested insurance payouts, environmental pollution claims and disagreements over complex contracts. When the project was launched five years ago, it was claimed the Rolls Buildings would develop into &quot;the biggest dedicated business court in the world&quot;. The development comes as the MoJ and UK Trade and Investment are promoting British courts as the gold standard for resolving international disputes, hoping to profit from their excellence. &quot;The message is that it will be a focus for settling international and domestic disputes,&quot; said Michael Todd QC, an expert in company law who is chairman elect of the Bar Council, which represents barristers. In the same way that the City has promoted itself as an international financial centre, he said, London can become a global legal centre. &quot;It&apos;s right that London should be seen as a place where financial disputes can be resolved.&quot; The Rolls Building courts will also be used for mediation and arbitration cases, both increasingly popular alternatives to the traditional confrontations involved in litigation. &quot;There will be 31 courtrooms and 55 consultation suites,&quot; said Todd, who has been involved in developing the project as a previous head of the Chancery Bar Association. &quot;The super-courts are looking particularly good. It&apos;s going to bring together all sorts of experts in tax, shipping, finance and trust law. &quot;The idea is to have an almost paperless court. As lawyers, we are so accustomed to thumbing through bundles of paper. It should be possible to work with less paperwork.&quot; Chris Dale, an Oxford lawyer and software expert who has been developing &quot;e-disclosure practices&quot;, is among those who have been critical of the Rolls Building. &quot;It is no good just inducing wealthy foreigners to spend their money in the commercial \u2026 and specialist courts while small and medium-sized companies (who generate most of our GDP) cannot afford to bring and defend claims,&quot; he wrote on his blog. &quot;It is disingenuous to boast of one shiny new building while neglecting the courts in which most of our litigation is run.&quot; Two-thirds of the Rolls Building, which has a glass and portland stone facade, will be leased by Her Majesty&apos;s Court Service. The courts complex, which occupies the first four floors, was scheduled to cost \u00a370m; the top floors and the basement have been rented out to commercial law firms. The entire building is currently being sold to Legal and General for just over \u00a3300m. The CityUK, a lobby group which represents finance firms, has also been eagerly supportive of the project. &quot;There are a lot of advantages for companies if they use English common law,&quot; said Richard Normington, a senior manager. &quot;The Rolls Building is the physical embodiment of London and the UK&apos;s commitment to provide a modern court service. Its rivals will be New York, Hong Kong, Dubai and Singapore; the French and German justice ministries have also just produced a glossy brochure together.&quot; The UK&apos;s legal sector is already a significant earner, generating \u00a323.1bn in 2009 \u2013 equivalent to 1.8% of GDP. It contributed \u00a33.2bn in exports, triple the level of a decade ago. Of commercial arbitration cases, 90% of those handled by London law firms involve an international party. In a little noticed document released in May, &apos;Plan for Growth: Promoting the UK&apos;s Legal Services Sector&apos;, the MoJ and UKTI urged that London should become an international &quot;hub of expertise&quot;. &quot;People turn to us because they know they will find world class, highly specialised practitioners and expert judges in the specialist courts,&quot; it declared. &quot;They understand that a decision from a court in the UK carries a global guarantee of impartiality, integrity and enforceability.&quot; Among promotional tours already undertaken to drum up business are trade missions to Qatar, the UAE, Oman and Bahrain &quot;to promote the litigation, arbitration and mediation advocacy services&quot;. There has also been an English Law Week in Russia and an Alternative Dispute Resolution event in India, both supported by the MoJ. The official opening of the Rolls Building as well as the 2012 London Olympics are listed in the government document as other events that can be used to market legal services.

There have been hiccups in developing &quot;online payment arrangements&quot;. Computers will be installed in every court to enable judges while on the bench to use online diaries for fixing future hearings. Some of the courts will have video conferencing screens.

That demands a respect for tradition and the time-honoured recipes of generations of anonymous chefs and grandmothers, as well as a hand that turns instinctively to Elizabeth David, rather than to pin-ups of the latest hot chef in Caterer And Hotelkeeper. Martin Wishart, who is feted like royalty on the Scottish gastronomic scene, has just opened the Honours in Edinburgh \u2013 &quot;a contemporary brasserie in an interpretation of the Parisian classic&quot; \u2013 headed up by Paul Tamburrini, whom he poached from Hotel du Vin in Glasgow. There, Tamburrini demonstrated that he could be persuaded to loosen his culinary stays and serve gutsier food, resisting that Michelin star-seeking urge to primp and posh it up. At the Honours, the premises \u2013 previously home to a succession of ailing restaurants \u2013 are unrecognisable. There&apos;s none of the awed hush that characterises Restaurant Martin Wishart, but with its marbled walls and moneyed gold accents, the vibe is more casino in Dubai than the atmospheric Parisian model. Faux brasserie decor might have been worse, of course, and it&apos;s the food that counts. I ordered crab chowder because I\u00a0fancied soup with tangible strands of crab meat through it. Up pops an\u00a0undeniably flavoursome but velvety-smooth soup with a blob of\u00a0invigoratingly piquant a\u00efoli. Half\u00a0crab bisque, half bouillabaisse, it certainly wasn&apos;t a hearty, textured chowder, but it was indicative of a\u00a0kitchen that views &quot;brasserie&quot; through a fine dining lens. And what&apos;s the point of reinterpreting the classic cheese souffl\u00e9 baked in a trusty ramekin? At the Honours, it\u00a0arrives free-standing, upside down in a pool of deeply cheesy b\u00e9chamel with a doll&apos;s tea party-proportioned tangle of spinach. Unfortunately, this\u00a0sleight of hand means the crust goes soggy in the sauce and the texture of the white has to be somewhere between firm and bouncy. Having only tasted the celebrated ib\u00e9rico de bellota pig in cured rather than fresh form, the presa steak \u2013 a famously juicy cut from just behind the shoulder \u2013 was a must. I&apos;d like to be able to tell you whether this semi-wild, acorn-munching porker really does taste perceptibly better than other pigs, but I\u00a0can&apos;t, because it tasted overwhelming of charcoal. And if you like a coq au vin that has been sent to finishing school to prevent it from hanging out with the peasants, then you won&apos;t demur at its treatment here. The bird itself was impeccable (free-range from St Bride&apos;s farm in Lanarkshire) and fell off the bone obligingly. The sauce, however, was a bland hybrid of the rustic red wine braise and that sticky, reduced, all-purpose brown sauce on which so many chefs rely. Give me the real thing any day, with its full-throated, purple, winey juices thickened with beurre mani\u00e9. Then again, when conventional, conservative outfits do let their hair down, they often get it wrong. Brasserie favourites \u2013 tarte Tatin, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e \u2013 are flanked here by a\u00a0list of ice-cream parlour sundaes. Perverse, I\u00a0know, and my peach melba sundae \u2013 a blur of white, orange and scarlet crammed into one of those thick, cafe-style goblets \u2013 rapidly became a mess of fibrous, fragrance-free peach lost in layers of neutral cream, ice-cream and meringue. Chocolate d\u00e9lice though, was unimpeachable, albeit its honey ice-cream wasn&apos;t very honeyed and its preciously named &quot;cr\u00e8me vi\u00e8rge&quot; tasted oddly like plain old whipped cream, but its slim-line serving was so slight as to be borderline mean. Size is an issue in general at the Honours \u2013 that bellota steak was listed as 200g, so I can assume only that it shrank on grilling \u2013 and you need side orders to bulk up the mains, but these come in tapas-sized portions and aren&apos;t cheap, so unless you go for the fixed-price lunch deal or pre-theatre deals, the bill may feel more blow-out than brasserie. Edinburgh&apos;s Wishart fan base will doubtless love the Honours, though: a safe little walk on the slightly wilder side that never strays too far from the fine dining path.", "title": "Restaurant: The Honours, Edinburgh | Joanna Blythman", "sentences": ["There&apos;s none of the awed hush that characterises Restaurant Martin Wishart, but with its marbled walls and moneyed gold accents, the vibe is more casino in Dubai than the atmospheric Parisian model."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-19T21:59:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/aug/20/rafael-nadal-roger-federer-tennis", "tags": ["Roger Federer", "Rafael Nadal", "US Open tennis", "Tennis", "Sport"], "article": "The early departure from Cincinnati of Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer ought not be dismissed as an aberration that will necessarily be corrected at the US Open. In different ways, both these still-great players are suffering at just the wrong moment. Examine their words in the aftermath of defeat in the quarter-finals on Friday and you hear frustration and concern hidden among the buoyancy. Nadal \u2013 who has had his knees rebuilt several times, who limped out of Wimbledon with an injured foot that has yet to heal and who had to play here with ugly blisters on the fingers of his burnt right hand after a cooking accident \u2013 could not have looked or sounded less imposing in trying to explain how he lost in straight sets to Mardy Fish. Not only had he survived three hours and 38 minutes against Fernando Verdasco the day before in draining heat (followed by a doubles match), but he met the rejuvenated American at the height of his power and confidence. Fish might not win at Flushing Meadows, but he is in the mood and form to scare anyone and he could pull off a major shock at his own tournament. Acknowledging Fish was better than him and eager not to make excuses that might undermine his fine 6-3, 6-4 win, Nadal nevertheless had &quot;no feeling&quot; in his right hand when he tossed the ball to serve. He also needed treatment on his foot during the match, a reminder that he was similarly hindered in his movement when 41st-ranked Ivan Dodig embarrassed him. It left a mental scar, as he was honest enough to admit. These inconveniences will probably clear (or be managed) in New York but Nadal is struggling to find his trademark intensity. There is not the convincing blaze in his eye or the consistent threat in his muscular, intimidating tennis. It is inconceivable that Nadal will not rediscover his energy when it matters. But it is far from certain that he will retain his title. As he conceded: &quot;My movements are not prefect, [there are] more mistakes than usual with the forehand. I have to play more inside the court, more aggressive.&quot; And there has been no sign of the rebuilt backhand that served him so well there last year. Federer&apos;s exit was more perplexing and his problems less obvious. He was playing superbly here, fully recovered, it seemed, from defeat by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in Canada and, having just turned 30, he is still one of the healthiest and fittest players on the circuit. Yet that cool control, that has made him pre-eminent for so long, deserted him 6-2, 7-6 against Tomas Berdych, as the radar on his forehand malfunctioned under pressure and he could not do what he does better than almost anyone in the history of tennis: find a way to win when things are going wrong. What once came easily to him is no longer guaranteed. He still lights up the game with his grace and artistry but the mechanics are letting him down. Federer, who has not added to his 16 slams since Melbourne in 2010, is not used to failure (and his win-loss record of 40-10 for the year is excellent, none the less). Nor is he familiar with regular struggle. For most of his career, winning has been a near-given. Against Berdych, who has beaten him three times in their past four meetings, as against Tsonga in the Rogers Cup and at Wimbledon, as well as Richard Gasquet in Rome and J\u00fcrgen Melzer in Monte Carlo, Federer played without an aura. Opponents no longer fear him like they once did. In a television interview this week, Federer uncharitably (although accurately) referred to Novak Djokovic&apos;s dominance over Nadal and said the Serb had no such hold over him. This was a curious denial of the facts: Djokovic, who destroyed Nadal&apos;s invincibility on clay and beat him in four finals, also defeated Federer in the semi-finals of the Australian Open, the final in Dubai and the semi-final at Indian Wells. And lest he forget that he is no longer world No1, he lost to Nadal in Miami, Madrid and Paris. These are difficult times for both of them. Like seasoned fighters, they have to draw on class and cunning to defy age \u2013 not to mention the rise of players who do not now cower in their shadow.", "title": "Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer left at the lights on road to US Open", "sentences": ["This was a curious denial of the facts: Djokovic, who destroyed Nadal&apos;s invincibility on clay and beat him in four finals, also defeated Federer in the semi-finals of the Australian Open, the final in Dubai and the semi-final at Indian Wells."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-20T15:27:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/aug/20/tattenham-corner-horse-racing", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Fit for a King?

As part of his riding agreement with the owner Robert Sangster and legendary trainer Vincent O&apos;Brien, Eddery was allowed stallion shares in racehorses he had ridden. After the 1984 season he had to choose between El Gran Senor and Sadler&apos;s Wells. &quot;El Gran Senor was rated 20lb higher and I could take a share in only one of them and so took him. He turned out to be infertile,&quot; rued Eddery. Sadler&apos;s Wells went on to become the greatest stallion of all time, making his owners hundreds of millions.

The opposition National Transitional Council (NTC) said on Tuesday that guards from a specially trained Tripoli brigade, made up of fighters from the capital, were being stationed at the national museum as well as other key cultural sites. The NTC also negotiated a deal with Tunisian authorities to increase the flow of electricity across the border and carried out emergency repairs to an oil refinery in the coastal town of Zawiya, allowing fuel to be pumped once more to Tripoli, where most vehicles had ground to a halt. Mahmoud Shammam, an NTC spokesman, said half the members of the movement&apos;s executive board, which is functioning as an interim cabinet, would arrive in Tripoli on Wednesday to co-ordinate work on maintaining basic services and food supplies as well as law and order. Speaking from Tunisia, Shammam said the NTC was working as fast as it could to implement a Tripoli stabilisation programme, hammered out in recent months with international advice, particularly from British officials. But he admitted that the speed of the offensive, spearheaded by rebels from Libya&apos;s western highlands, had outpaced the stabilisation effort. &quot;We are a bit late because we thought it would take longer. The swift movement of the battle has left our officials a little bit behind, but we are trying hard,&quot; Shammam said. &quot;We have negotiated more electricity from the Tunisian government and we have got the Zawiya refinery working. But it would help a lot, and we are screaming at our friends about it, if they could unfreeze some of Libya&apos;s money.&quot; British and other European governments have pledged to release millions of dollars of Libyan funds, frozen at the start of the conflict, as soon as stability is restored to the country. The EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, said on Tuesday the release of funds would have to be approved by the UN, but noted that the NTC would need quick access to funds to ensure civil servants were paid and the economy could be kick-started. A meeting took place earlier on Tuesday in Dubai between NTC representatives and experts from an international contact group, including a former British police officer, on how to restore security as soon as possible after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, and avoid a repeat of the chaos and looting that followed the end of the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq in 2003. The security blueprint was drafted with help from a UK stabilisation response team, including former police officers and security experts, which visited Benghazi for three weeks in May. Their recommendations were largely adopted by the NTC. Among the priorities are the assurance of continuity in the government bureaucracy and civilian police, which conspicuously broke down in Baghdad in 2003. To that end, messages have been sent to police stations in Tripoli appealing to the officers there to stay at their posts and continue to enforce law and order. Liaison officers in the Tripoli brigade, which has trained for the task in Qatar, are expected to reassure the police personally that they will be respected in post-Gaddafi Libya. Shammam added that the NTC has been broadcasting public announcements, some by religious leaders, calling on the population to observe &quot;international norms respecting law and order, public property, and the collective memory of Libyan people&quot;, a reference to the nation&apos;s museums and cultural artefacts. Speaking in Brussels , Ashton said EU states stood ready to help with aid, medical supplies and fuel, as well as helping the NTC disarm a population that had grown accustomed to carrying weapons. Another pressing concern on the ground in Libya was the lack of an international mediator that soldiers from Gaddafi&apos;s army could surrender to. Rebel forces, government columns and soldiers trying to return home are forced to use the same coastal roads, leading to confusion and unnecessary clashes. On Monday morning, a convoy of buses and jeeps carrying government troops blundered into a rebel checkpoint, although it was not clear whether they were on their way to bolster Tripoli&apos;s defences or trying to get home to western Libya. Government soldiers taken prisoner have said they were convinced they would be slaughtered if they surrendered and so rarely did so. Rebel officers said they would like a buffer force that would allow pro-Gaddafi unit to laid down their arms. European officials said the new authorities in Tripoli would be able to draw on the EU&apos;s \u20ac7bn neighbourhood policy fund, to help support civil society and governance in the newly democratic countries of north Africa. Ashton made clear however, that the UN would take the lead international co-ordinating role in Libya and a meeting is planned in New York on Friday, involving the UN, EU, the African Union, and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, to divide responsibilities in post-Gaddafi Libya.

A day after the rebels had celebrated their capture of the regime&apos;s stronghold at Bab al-Aziziya, the compound came under heavy fire from the pro-Gaddafi area of Abu Salim and the woods around the city zoo, which rebels said were &quot;infested&quot; with snipers. Green flags, the symbol of the ousted regime, and pro-Gaddafi gunmen could still be seen in front of a large building on the edge of the woods once used by Saif al-Islam, one of Gaddafi&apos;s sons, to receive guests. Gaddafi loyalists, who the rebels said were mostly Arab mercenaries, also fired on the road leading to Tripoli airport. Rebels said 400 people had been killed and 2,000 injured in the battle for Tripoli so far. Beyond the capital, rebel columns closed in on the coastal city of Sirte, Gaddafi&apos;s birthplace, where loyalist troops fired Scud missiles at the rebel-held town of Misrata. It was unclear whether the fighting was a desperate last stand or the start of a guerrilla campaign by a &quot;stay-behind&quot; force, modelled on the tactics Saddam Hussein and his top lieutenants used in Iraq in 2003. A pro-Gaddafi radio station broadcast statements by the deposed leader claiming he had &quot;discreetly&quot; toured the capital and &quot;did not feel that Tripoli was in danger&quot;. He reportedly said the retreat from his citadel at Bab al-Aziziya had been a tactical move and vowed to fight to the death, calling on his supporters to &quot;cleanse&quot; Tripoli of &quot;devils and traitors&quot;.

They are among a growing number of Libyan officials who have switched sides since rebels gained the upper hand. &quot;I put myself in the service of the nation and call on generals and soldiers who are the sons of Libya to join the 17th February revolution,&quot; Ali said in the interview with the Dubai-based satellite channel. In London, the foreign secretary, William Hague, repeated his assertion that the fighting represented &quot;the death throes&quot; of the regime. &quot;I think it is time now for Colonel Gaddafi to stop issuing delusional statements and to recognise what has happened, that control of the country is not going to return, he said in a statement.&quot; &quot;He should be telling his dwindling and remaining forces now to stand down.&quot; Rebel fighters continued to hunt for the fugitive despot, reportedly searching the tunnel network beneath Bab al-Aziziya. Mustafa Abdel Jalil, the head of the opposition National Transitional Council (NTC), announced a reward for Gaddafi&apos;s capture of 2m Libyan dinars (\u00a31m), funded by a businessman in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, and an amnesty for past crimes for anyone in his entourage who killed or detained him. Rebel fighters tried to move into the Abu Salim area, but were kept at bay by heavy sniper and mortar fire from the woods and from high buildings in the district. Around 35 journalists and diplomats have been freed from the Rixos hotel on the edge of Abu Salim, where they had been held for five days by pro-Gaddafi gunmen. Their release was negotiated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, who ferried the journalists to another hotel elsewhere in the city. More details emerged of the operation to take control the city, codenamed Mermaid Dawn. According to a rebel military spokesman quoted by AP, men from Tripoli who supported the revolution slipped out of the capital three months ago for training in Benghazi. They then infiltrated the city either by sea, posing as fishermen, or through the western mountains. &quot;They went back to Tripoli and waited; they became sleeper cells,&quot; said military spokesman Fadlallah Haroun, who helped organise the operation. He said that when the signal was given, on 21 August, about 150 men rose up inside Tripoli. The commander of the battalion charged with defending the entrance to the city, Muhammad Eshkal, was said by another NTC official to have agreed not to put up resistance because Gaddafi had ordered his cousin&apos;s death 20 years ago. A US official was quoted as confirming reports that Qatari special forces had helped spearhead the rebel storming of Bab al-Aziziya, and that British, French and Italian advisers had played a role. In Paris, Nicolas Sarkozy promised the NTC prime minister, Mahmoud Jibril, that French troops would support the rebels as long as pro-Gaddafi forces resisted. An international conference in the French capital on 1 September, co-ordinated by the British and French governments, would meanwhile mark the transition from military to civilian support for the Libyan revolution. NTC leaders had been expected to arrive in Tripoli to help bolster the council&apos;s legitimacy as an interim government, but it was not clear whether they had put off their trip because of security concerns. Some NTC officials were involved in talks in Doha with diplomats from a contact group of major powers, aimed at arranging short-term finance for the government. At the UN, US, British and French diplomats were drafting a resolution ordering the unblocking of $1.5bn (\u00a3900m) in frozen Libyan funds at the beginning of the war. Worldwide, Libyan embassies that had not hitherto changed sides, including Tokyo and Addis Ababa, replaced Gaddafi&apos;s green flag with the tricolour used by the NTC. In London, NTC officials, who already had control of the embassy, laid a doormat bearing Gaddafi&apos;s image so visitors would trample on his likeness.", "title": "Street fighting rages in Tripoli as Gaddafi loyalists fight rearguard action", "sentences": ["&quot;I put myself in the service of the nation and call on generals and soldiers who are the sons of Libya to join the 17th February revolution,&quot; Ali said in the interview with the Dubai-based satellite channel."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-25T00:54:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2011/aug/25/malaysia-kuala-lumpur-airport-ethnic-indians", "tags": ["Malaysia", "World news", "UK news", "Human rights", "Law", "India", "Hinduism"], "article": "In the Hollywood film The Terminal Tom Hanks plays (with obligatory mangled foreign accent) a character who is trapped in New York&apos;s JFK airport. Last week, I had a similar experience at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Malaysia. Whereas Tom Hanks&apos;s character spends years trapped, I was only there for a few hours. The episode was both humiliating and enlightening. I had been engaged by a Malaysian lawyer, Waytha Moorthy, to look into taking action against the British government for its role in the exploitation of Indian Hindus during Malaysia&apos;s period as a colony, and its failure to protect their rights when independence was declared in 1957. Ethnic Indians make up just over 6% of Malaysia&apos;s 28.3 million people, while Muslim Malays account for just over 61% and ethnic Chinese some 25%. A coalition led by the United Malays National Organisation has ruled since independence, which, according to Moorthy, had led to widespread human rights violations and discrimination of the Indian Malaysian population. About 70% live in abject poverty and one in six are effectively stateless as they are denied a birth certificate. Moorthy originally lodged his action on the 31 August 2007, the 50th anniversary of Malaysia&apos;s independence. However, the claim stalled following the arrest of the lawyers involved under a draconian piece of legislation called the Internal Security Act. Moorthy had demanded compensation for Indian Malaysians whose ancestors were brought in by the British government as indentured labour. The claim was that, after granting independence, the British had left the Indians without representation and at the mercy of the Malays. So, the plan was to visit Malaysia and gather evidence and claims that would form the foundation of the case. A recent case involving individuals tortured by British soldiers in colonial Kenya gave fresh impetus to the proceedings. My pending arrival in Malaysia had received advance publicity from local police who had sought to intimidate organisers of the venue where I was expected to meet potential claimants. There was, therefore, some trepidation when I presented myself to the immigration desk on arrival at KLIA. As soon as my passport was handed over at the immigration desk, the slow cogs of government bureaucracy moved into action. Without explanation I was taken to the immigration office. KLIA is an impressive building; made of polished steel and glass it has a central hub with four long offshoots. It is populated by the ubiquitous outlets that make most airports seem identical. However,, the immigration office was a more spartan affair. Teams of immigration officers sat behind desks shouting the names of those refused entry to come forward and explain their reasons for trying to enter. Handing my passport over to one of them I noticed the large sign on the back wall of the office \u2013 &quot;Service with a smile&quot; it said. True to their motto a pleasant immigration officer smiled while she told me that I had been refused entry. I asked for an explanation and was told that the immigration department had no problem with me \u2013 the decision to refuse me entry had come from the very top. I asked for written reasons. The officer agreed that I should be given them but none were given. It was not until I was in transit in Dubai that I found out that I had been classed as a &quot;prohibited immigrant&quot;. I still have no idea what that means and despite the involvement of the British consulate and the British government cabinet office, I found myself stranded, waiting for my return flight. It was clear that the decision was a political one \u2013 I had been refused entry to stop me doing work that the government of Malaysia did not want to take place. Thousands were expected to attend meetings that had been organised. I was to see the ways in which government policies had affected the lives of Indian Malaysians in all parts of the country. Yet, like many governments which seek to stifle opposition, its actions are often irrational because, while refusing me entry into the country, it had allowed my colleague who had been travelling with me to do so. He is now meeting all those potential claimants and collecting evidence to progress the claim. Meanwhile, sitting in the immigration office at KLIA gave me a glimpse of how differently people are treated in Malaysia. Sitting beside me awaiting interrogation were men \u2013 predominantly young, on their own and originating from Pakistan, India or sub-Saharan Africa. They would be summoned to their meeting with an immigration officer via an intermediary \u2013 always a Malaysian of Chinese origin wearing a coloured paper bracelet to signify that he had clearance to come into the airport. He would order his charge in terms which reminded me of a master/servant relationship \u2013 a click of the fingers, a terse command, the use of their surname only. These men appeared to be workers entering the country through the patronage of their Chinese bosses. It didn&apos;t take much imagination to work out how they would be treated once they left the airport terminal. These were the lucky ones. Those sharing my predicament were marched off to a detention centre before being sent back to their country of origin. Thankfully, I was told that I had been spared such a fate. Nevertheless, the experience was a humiliating one. Without a passport or able to leave the terminal I could not check in; I was escorted to the aircraft to be seated; my passport was handed over to the aircraft crew who viewed me with suspicion and contempt. I have often thought that lawyers, as well as doctors, should consider what it is like to be in their clients&apos; position so that it can inform their approach. This was one occasion when I truly felt what it must be like for detainees all over the world \u2013 coming up against foreign jurisdiction; facing a decision which may be wrong and unjust; being treated without dignity; occupying a twilight world of ever-changing time zones and feeling utterly powerless. Having returned to the UK, I am even more determined to ensure that the issues raised by the case are highlighted beyond the borders of Malaysia. Like many in Britain, I had only thought of Malaysia as the country advertised in brochures. Every day, buses pass my office window in central London emblazoned with adverts encouraging us to visit Malaysia, illustrated with montages of sun and sea. Few people are likely look beyond that image or get to see the reality that exists underneath. For me, a country that, on the face of it, is engaged in widespread, institutional discrimination and human rights abuses should rightly be condemned. Even more so when it refuses its citizens access to legal representation.", "title": "On being detained at Kuala Lumpur airport | Imran Khan", "sentences": ["It was not until I was in transit in Dubai that I found out that I had been classed as a &quot;prohibited immigrant&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-25T12:07:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/25/all-over-michael-sorkin-review", "tags": ["Art and design", "Books", "Architecture", "Culture"], "article": "Michael Sorkin has long been America&apos;s most invigorating writer on architecture. His preferred medium is the medium-sized article, journalistic not academic, and his standpoint that of an enraged but forever hopeful liberal, rooted in the dense, diverse streets of lower Manhattan. His targets are the corporate powers that, as he sees it, would crush the freedoms that make cities \u2013 especially his own \u2013 what they are. Also, or more so, the architects who go along with such powers, and obligingly ornament their monuments and instruments with distracting shapes. Also the critics who applaud the architects who dress the works that crush the freedoms. All Over the Map is a collection of his writings from the first decade of this century, and several pieces reveal his fine line in satirical contempt and bleak humour. In &quot;Entering the Building&quot;, he riffs a 62-point hallucination of security measures gone mad \u2013 &quot;allow the Sniffer-Dog (green camouflage uniform) to sniff you wherever he or she pleases&quot; \u2013 which, needless to say, is not so far from a possible reality. The antihero who helps Sorkin to define himself is the late Philip Johnson, the godfather (in the Marlon Brando sense) of American architecture from the 1930s until his death aged 98 in 2005. Early in his career Sorkin outed Johnson as a committed Nazi sympathiser considerably less repentant than he ought to be, as well as a cynical player of power games, which latter characteristic Johnson himself did not\u00a0try too hard to hide. There is a note of regret when Johnson&apos;s death, in the time span of this book, obliges him to write &quot;My Last Philippic&quot;. Except it isn&apos;t: Philip Roth&apos;s novel The Plot Against America, in which Charles Lindbergh becomes a pro-Nazi president in 1940, inspires Sorkin to imagine Johnson embracing the regime, and designing for it remote themed towns for black people and Jews. The features of &quot;New Plantation, Alabama&quot;, privately called &quot;Coontown&quot; by Johnson, included the &quot;&apos;Tar Baby Caryatids&apos; which held up the front porch of &apos;De Gen&apos;ral Sto&apos; on Main Street&quot;. Sorkin&apos;s first book of essays, Exquisite Corpse, appeared 20 years ago, and as he now wryly notes: &quot;My introduction bid a stirring farewell to critical writing, promising that I&apos;d devote myself exclusively to architectural practice henceforth.&quot; He couldn&apos;t stay away, but his pursuit of work as an architect makes his latest book more complicated. Exquisite Corpse had the greater clarity and certainty of someone less enmeshed. In All Over the Map he struggles with the compromises that go with trying to get work from the same political-economic complex that he likes to attack. He flies a lot, which is not very ecological, and accepts commissions in China, which is not a very liberal place. He can also be a lot less fun and agile when he tries to say what he thinks is good architecture. In praising one of his heroes he talks of &quot;closely identifying the prosody of detail and organisation of building to clear social and environmental agendas&quot;. There must be a better way of saying it. For readers unversed in current architectural jargon, appreciation of this book requires some judicious skipping over the muddier parts. His own designs, featured in the book as drawings rather than completed buildings, don&apos;t completely convince that they will unlock the answers to the social issues he raises. He is too much in love with form, favouring grandiose, quasi-natural shapes, like rock formations. There seems no guarantee that they would not end up as the same gross sculptures that you get in Dubai, and which Sorkin excoriates. The most persistent theme is the architectural response to the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre, which happened in Sorkin&apos;s neighbourhood, early in the time span of All Over the Map. He combines his usual astute analysis of the politics with his own ideas of what might be built there \u2013 &quot;A World Peace Dome&quot; for example. These, it seems to me, contribute to the extremity of the debate that took place at Ground Zero, between vision and commerce, which helped make it inevitable that commerce would win. Then again, he comes up with real eloquence and precision in defending his dearest subject, the importance of true, uncompromised public space. He defines essential freedoms \u2013 of assembly, access, and of &quot;use and expression&quot; \u2013 together with the importance of the &quot;stimulating accident&quot;.

The growth forecasts showed that Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted would reach capacity within 20 years, leaving regional airports to cope with the overspill. Daniel Moylan, the deputy chairman of the mayor&apos;s transport authority, said the figures were an &quot;urgent wake-up call. Britain is in serious danger of running out of aviation capacity where it is needed. The government has to react with some urgency because 2030 is not far away.&quot; The Department for Transport (DfT) published forecasts on Thursday in response to a report on aviation emissions by the Committee on Climate Change, which was set up by the Labour government to advise on carbon dioxide reduction targets. The document estimated that by 2030 Heathrow would handle 85m passengers a year, compared with 65m now, with the capital&apos;s top five airports, including Luton and London City, carrying a maximum of 185m by 2040. At that point, regional airports would have overtaken the south-east of England, carrying 210m passengers. &quot;The central forecasts suggest that without new runways the three largest London airports will be at capacity by 2030, and all growth beyond 2040 will occur at regional airports,&quot; the report states. According to the DfT, airline passenger numbers in the UK would more than double from 210m in 2010 to 470m by 2050. The aviation minister, Theresa Villiers, said regional airports could handle the looming passenger overspill. &quot;I firmly believe that regional airports have an important role to play right across the country, providing domestic and international connections and contributing to local economies. We are undertaking a review of our aviation policy and are seeking views on how we can create the right conditions for regional airports to flourish, and how they can support the rebalancing of the economy across the UK,&quot; she said. Manchester airport, the UK&apos;s largest airport outside London, said: &quot;It is not realistic to assume that someone in Kent will come to Manchester to fly to Dubai. But it is realistic to say that someone in Sheffield could choose Manchester to fly to New York, when they currently use Heathrow.&quot; However, BAA which owns Heathrow said the DfT forecasts underlined the need for an expanded hub airport to handle increased numbers of business passengers and contradicted the government&apos;s policy of ruling out a third runway at Heathrow. According to the DfT, demand for international business travel from UK airports would nearly double by 2030. &quot;Without a credible aviation policy the government risks handing this economic growth to our European competitors,&quot; said BAA. The British Air Transport Association, which represents British Airways, easyJet and Virgin Atlantic, said residents in the south-east would have to abandon short-haul flights to Europe. &quot;The coalition&apos;s rash decision to ban desperately needed expansion in the form of new runway capacity at London&apos;s airports means that, simply to maintain projected growth in inbound long-haul tourism, the government expects British people, especially those who live in the south-east, to stop taking holidays overseas.

Previously war-torn capitals such as Baghdad and Kabul have rapidly become targets for western capitalism, with major US and European retailers now jostling for position on shopping streets. And already FTSE 100 constituents such as engineering firm Weir Group and oil major BP are seeking to make contact with Libyan officials as companies formulate early plans to return to a country they fled in February. John Gallacher, Weir&apos;s north Africa operations director, says: &quot;Clearly, if the UK government says it is safe to go back, we would go back. We would like to go\u00a0back.&quot; He adds that the company has consulted with the Foreign Office \u2013 which still deems Libya too unsafe for British nationals to travel to \u2013 and attempted to speak with Libyan contacts. &quot;We have tried \u2013 with very little success, I have to say \u2013 to talk with some people who used to work with us,&quot; Gallacher adds. &quot;We don&apos;t know [if the old contacts will still be around].&quot; Weir had invested millions in the country and earlier this month it announced it would take a one-off charge of \u00a32m following the &quot;cessation of all Libyan project activity&quot;. It was working on power plant refurbishment in Misrata; it is not clear whether that site has sustained any damage, the company says. Meanwhile, BP says it will resume its Libyan operations &quot;when conditions allow&quot;. A spokesman adds: &quot;We received a letter from the National Transitional Council [NTC] in July. We replied a couple of weeks ago saying we were ready and willing to return when conditions allow and if we were invited.&quot; The British-based oil group, which still employs about 100 Libyan nationals, was forced to halt plans to explore offshore in the Gulf of Sirte and onshore in Ghadamis at the beginning of the uprising, which saw the country&apos;s oil output plummet. BP had announced plans to spend upwards of \u00a3540m to fund a joint venture with the Libyans to search for gas and oil that would have seen it take about 19% of any future production revenues. Guma el-Gamaty, the UK coordinator of the NTC, confirms that his organisation had been contacting major companies with existing Libyan contracts and had met some, although he refuses to disclose identities. He says: &quot;Obviously, as soon as the security situation is sorted, all companies involved in Libya can come back as well as new companies. Initially, energy and construction will take priority, along with services such as water and healthcare, which are absolutely vital to the people. There will be major opportunities in [developing new] infrastructure. One thing that will help will be the re-opening of Tripoli airport. That just depends on the security situation. It is not damaged.&quot; However, Libya&apos;s rebels are examining allegations of corruption within the country&apos;s $65bn sovereign wealth fund, a probe that is thought to include examining, and perhaps renegotiating, any contracts that were improperly handed out to friends of Colonel Gaddafi&apos;s son, Saif. One oil industry expert says: &quot;Even though there are these assurances [of being allowed to return], the whole history of the oil industry is of contracts being occasionally rewritten \u2026 But the Libyans will need foreign exchange, so I&apos;d expect them to crank up [oil and gas] production pretty quickly. However, these things do take time.&quot; Other companies also look set to relaunch their Libya ambitions. Last week G4S, the security company that employs more than 600,000 people worldwide, said it was hoping to pick up more work in a post-Gaddafi Libya. Nick Buckles, chief executive of the FTSE 100 company, says he is looking at opportunities to train Libyan police and protect the country&apos;s oil and gas assets. Elsewhere, BP&apos;s rival Shell, which was exploring for gas in the Libyan desert before the conflict, says it has also been in touch with the NTC. Kier, a FTSE 250 listed construction group which is understood to have been examining entering Libya before the conflict, would not say what its strategy was. Lord Trefgarne, the chairman of the Libyan British Business Council, says the body is hoping to lead a delegation of up to 20 of its members to Tripoli and Benghazi, possibly as soon as next month. &quot;We have 140-odd members and certainly a few have indicated that they are anxious to get out there,&quot; he says. &quot;We had the NTC on to us yesterday asking when we are coming. We are watching the situation on the ground. If you take a mission of 15 to 20 people, it becomes quite high profile.&quot; Oil services firm Wood Group, pharmaceuticals firm GlaxoSmithKline and banks such as HSBC and Barclays remain among the membership of the LBBC. One source with knowledge of the situation in Tripoli says: &quot;The Libyans will be dealing with companies very shortly. They need to get the oil fields back onstream and there will be an enormous rebuilding programme. However, the notion that there is a rush to secure contracts is over-hyped. The Libyans will look after the countries that have genuinely helped them and they are the UK, France and the US.&quot; In the longer term, other watchers predict that softer industries will also look to seize opportunities in the country, particularly in travel, leisure and retail \u2013 although a time when you can buy a sandwich in the Green Square branch of Pret a Manger looks some way off. One seasoned Libya investor says: &quot;This is all in the future, as they have got to sort out the political situation \u2013 which will be trickier than you think. But Gaddafi&apos;s vision was building a new airport as a &apos;gateway to Africa&apos;. &quot;There has been talk of a Dubai-style development, whereby alcohol is tolerated in certain parts.

He says he won&apos;t be taking part in today&apos;s competition, as he&apos;ll be somewhere up a hill in the Lake District. Johne5knuckle: I had a sleepless night on Sunday. I&apos;m not sure if it was caused by the burden of being the Talking Horses Cartmel correspondent for a day, or the overdose of cardamom pods I had eaten during a particularly fine curry earlier in the day. But whatever it was, lack of sleep was not going to spoil a rather unexpected dose of fortune: a day at the races in the spectacular and unique setting of Cartmel in the south Lakes, plus lunch and \u00a350 of Tote betting vouchers thrown in, followed by a night at the popular Swan Hotel &amp; Spa at nearby Newby Bridge. I won the prize by default, but you never look a gift horse etc. I still had to deal with that pressure, though. First up, a quick photo receiving my Tote vouchers and none other than jockey Richard Johnson getting into the spirit and doing the presentation. It had to be a sign, didn&apos;t it? I had just shaken hands with the guy who was riding odds-on favourite Saved By John in the first, there were only four runners and Johnson was there for only two rides. He didn&apos;t exactly commit either way when asked about the horse&apos;s chances, giving what seemed a fair assessment: he could think of worse favourites, but the horse had run just four days earlier, so this race might come too soon. As it turned out, the jockey tried his best, but he knew his fate halfway up the run-in, having to settle for third as the only horse I had discounted, Below The Deck, took it up close home after a canny waiting ride from Brian Hughes. Saved By John looked like he might also have a few ideas of his own about the game. You have to stay positive and it helps if you are betting with somebody else&apos;s money, so it was onward to race two, a juvenile hurdle with a standout favourite in the shape of John Quinn&apos;s Countrywide Flame, ridden by Dougie Costello. The trainer&apos;s only runner of the day at the track, the jockey&apos;s only ride, and the form of the horse&apos;s sole run, winning as he pleased at Market Rasen, was easily the best on offer. There were a few debutants and a Donald McCain runner, but nothing was going to put me off the Quinn horse, who opened up 7-4 generally, got backed into 5-4 and won like a 1-2 shot. So, I had broken my duck, Talking Horses could hold its head high in Cartmel and the pressure was off. The third race seemed a straightforward choice between multiple course and distance winner Soul Magic and, er, multiple course and distance winner Soul Magic, who opened up around 10-11, which, given the circumstances, seemed a steal. The opposition looked either simply not up to the task or dodgy (Tranos, the only credible opposition, seemed to have an attitude problem on his previous run). Soul Magic hacked up, with upcoming claimer Gary Rutherford looking round for dangers turning for home on that long run-in they have at Cartmel. On to the fourth race, then, and just four runners, one of which, Ringsend Rosie, was going to have to depend on the others falling (which is what had happened for the horse&apos;s only ever win). Then word came from our host that Nigel Twiston-Davies had made the journey up to saddle the first of his two runners at the track, Kilvergan Boy. The horse had run well enough and was still leading when unseating at the track four days earlier, so if he could stand up, he was in with a shout. Another short-priced favourite, and he wasn&apos;t always fluent at his fences, but he plugged on and overcame a slip in the final furlong to cling on for victory. Three winners on the bounce - nosebleed territory. Surely my luck could not hold. Race five looked tricky. Just five runners, but I gave a good chance to two, Bankstair and Golden Dream, while another, Iona Days, opened up an unexpected favourite (to my mind) and was then backed strongly on course. I stuck with Golden Dream (good trainer with a new stable jockey, Danny Cook, who would be hungry for success). The jockey pushed his mount into the lead turning for home, but when he looked round to see where the dangers were, he suddenly became aware of Wayne Hutchinson coming upsides on the favourite. And it was Hutchinson who found more from his mount to score well. By now, the money was safe for the day and I had kept back two \u00a35 vouchers, one for each of the last two races, which had a somewhat open look to them. But our host did point out that Scotswell, in the sixth race, was well in, as he was running without a penalty for a victory last week. The horse represented the combination of trainer Harriet Graham and jockey Gary Rutherford, already on the board with Soul Magic. I had originally picked out Painted Sky, but was persuaded in the strongest terms that Scotswell was a good thing. On went the fiver and it was never in doubt, Rutherford riding with confidence throughout and sauntering home seven lengths clear without touching the horse. Six races in, four winners, all favourites, and I had a big, beaming smile on my face, for which no apologies, but that is what a good day at the races can do to a man. So what could top that? Picking out Brian Ellison&apos;s Lakeman in the last? There was method to my choice: of the principals the strong favourite, Grand Lahou (Richard Johnson&apos;s second ride of the day) was a chaser and this was a hurdle; Souter Point is a dodge-pot (with Timeform squiggle to match); Heart Of Dubai had a chance; Lakeman had been given a couple of recent runs on the Flat and his trainer seemed to be in form - and then the bit of selection magic that would normally be reserved for a once-a-year Grand National pinsticking punter - the horse was called Lakeman, being a descendant of Lake Coniston, and I was in the Lakes and heading for Lake Coniston (the place) the very next day. As the saying goes, simples. The race did not pan out quite as expected and I thought mine was out of it on the final circuit, as he did not jump fluently and seemed to not be going as well as the favourite and the dodge-pot. But Danny Cook kept the horse interested and, on the final turn for home, when Grand Lahou went wide and carried Souter Point with him, mine nipped up the inside and kept on to the line. A 16-1 winner in the last (we won&apos;t mention that the Tote paid a miserly 12&apos;s) and I was (and still am) on cloud nine. The evening, in the plush surroundings of the Swan Hotel at Newby Bridge, went as you might expect. A relaxed full Cumbrian breakfast has helped clear the head and now Lake Coniston awaits. My thanks to zizkov123 for the opportunity, to Talking Horses for making it possible, to John Sexton and Cartmel racecourse for a great day out, to the Tote for the free money and to the Swan for a most relaxing, pampered stay. Today&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook Here&apos;s a thought before we finally move on from Pour Moi. If this were 25 years ago, before the internet and mobile phones and, most importantly, long before Betfair, when do you think we might have found out about his injury? With no &quot;drift on the exchanges&quot; to alert everyone, there would have been no pressure on connections to say anything. The bookmakers might have noticed a few &quot;faces&quot; backing the other horses but there would have been no reason for them to take Pour Moi out of their lists. Punters might have gone on backing him for another fortnight until the news that he had, alas, met with a setback and was now doubtful for the race. Of course, Pour Moi&apos;s owners would never have allowed that to happen, because they don&apos;t want you to lose your money for no good reason. But lesser owners might have let matters drift for weeks and it&apos;s interesting to reflect how Betfair has helped to speed up the spread of information. You can get 6-1 on the leading exchange about Epernay (4.10) for the City Of Ripon, a 10-furlong handicap, which seems very fair about a horse with her record of consistency. Twice a winner over a mile this year, she should eventually prove better at today&apos;s sort of distance, an extended nine furlongs. She went close over that trip at Newmarket when last seen, going down by a head with the third well behind in a 13-runner race. That was her second race in two days (she&apos;d been a close second at Sandown on her previous start) and, with the benefit of a break, she can maintain her progress. With four wins in the past fortnight, Tom Dascombe seems to be emerging from his mid-season slump and I like his Gentle Lord (2.40) in the six-furlong handicap at Epsom. This colt was having just his second start in handicaps and his first for four months when a close third at Newmarket a fortnight ago and a 3lb higher mark is no great concern. He was extremely fresh that day and, if settling better this time, is handicapped to win. You can get 100-30. Dascombe runs Bogey Hole (4.40) in the opener at Southwell and the 10-1 may be too big. She achieved little enough when fourth of six on her debut here this month but, after running green, she was staying on at the finish and it is interesting that she had been sent off favourite that day. She&apos;ll know more this time and the extra furlong will suit. The form on offer from her rivals does not inspire terror. Tipping competition - a new week Congratulations to zizkov123, who picked Glenridding (11-1) on Friday to make himself an emphatic winner of last week&apos;s competition. Alas, he was unable to take the prize but very sportingly passed it on to the runner-up, johne5knuckle, who will hopefully have enjoyed a day at Cartmel yesterday and an overnight stay at The Swan. This week&apos;s competition starts today (yesterday having been a bank holiday). The prize is a copy of Gamble, the new Dick Francis novel, written by the late author&apos;s son, Felix. Published this week, the book tells the tale of a jump jockey whose life is plunged into mystery when a friend is shot dead before the Grand National. Fans of Francis may recognise one or two familiar themses there. To kick things off, we&apos;d like your tips, please, for these races: 3.50 Epsom, 4.10 Ripon, 4.30 Goodwood. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers. In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.

It was the fading Midas Touch, dropping back through the field, who all but brought down Sarafina on the home turn, the filly throwing up clods of Parisian mud as she fought to retain her footing under Gerald Mosse before bravely rallying to finish fast for third place. From out of the vacuum caused by the withdrawal of Pour Moi, it is Sarafina who has emerged as the favourite for the Arc, and understandably so given that her two victories this season have appeared to confirm that she is as good as last year and probably better. Her neck success over Cirrus des Aigles in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud certainly has a new sheen to it after that consistent performer&apos;s 10-length romp in the Grand Prix de Deauville on Sunday. It is unusual, however, for a filly to be at the head of the betting for a race which is usually dominated by colts with Classic form. Though the likes of User Friendly, Leggera and Pride have gone close, only two fillies \u2013 Urban Sea (1993) and Zarkava (2008) \u2013 have won the Arc and Zarkava was the only member of her sex to go off as favourite during that period. Once again, a trio of Japanese-trained potentials are being ignored by punters despite the near-miss with Nakayama Festa, edged out by Workforce in last year&apos;s race. Although Nakayama Festa has been sidelined through injury since November, his profile for the race is hardly much worse than that of Workforce after that colt&apos;s disappointing defeat behind Nathaniel at Ascot last time, yet his odds are predictably seven times longer. After Japan&apos;s one-two in the Dubai World Cup and numerous victories in some of the world&apos;s biggest races since the turn of the century, one wonders what Japanese-trained horses have to do to earn some respect. Nakayama Knight finished fourth of 18 in Japan&apos;s Derby on ground that was probably softer than ideal, is already in France being conditioned for the Prix Niel, and yet is available at well over 100-1 on Betfair. As a three-year-old colt he also ticks the statistical boxes, but it is another member of that age group who takes my eye at a similarly meaty price. Vadamar has disappeared since being beaten five lengths behind Pour Moi in the Derby at Epsom having seemingly failed to handle the track, but he had previously got a lot closer in the Prix Greffulhe at Saint-Cloud despite the trainer Alain de Royer-Dupre feeling that he wasn&apos;t at his best there. Without any fanfare, Vadamar&apos;s name appeared last week among the entries for the Prix Niel, the trial that throws up more Arc winners than any other contest, on Sunday week. Although inquiries to the stable failed to yield much in the way of direction, it certainly seems significant to see Vadamar&apos;s name among the possible runners in the Niel, and a big run there would see his odds come crashing down from the 100-1-plus available on Betfair. The fact that he is proven in testing ground is another potential string to his bow (not something that could be said about many of the leading protagonists) and the Aga Khan, who also has Sarafina in the race, has been prepared to run his good horses against each other in the Arc before.", "title": "Vadamar catches the eye at huge odds for Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe | Will Hayler", "sentences": ["After Japan&apos;s one-two in the Dubai World Cup and numerous victories in some of the world&apos;s biggest races since the turn of the century, one wonders what Japanese-trained horses have to do to earn some respect."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-31T17:47:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/31/cia-rendition-flights-cost", "tags": ["Rendition", "CIA", "US news", "World news", "US foreign policy", "September 11 2001"], "article": "As they powered down the aircraft on the tarmac of Barcelona&apos;s El Prat international airport, the personnel disembarking from a sleek Gulfstream jet would have looked little different from the other tired and hungry aircrew passing through. But as they took off the next morning for Washington on the final leg of a curious odyssey, a glance at their recent layovers \u2013 Riyadh, Amman, Bucharest \u2013 would have given a clue: this was no ordinary plane. According to documents that have emerged from a seemingly obscure legal squabble in upstate New York, the jet, Gulfstream N85VM, formed an integral part of the fleet of private aircraft that helped the CIA to run its clandestine programme of extraordinary rendition after the 9/11 attacks. The records offer an unprecedented insight not just into the movements of the Gulfstream jet, but also into how the rendition programme was subject to a culture every bit as corporate as other initiatives undertaken by a US administration keen on outsourcing the affairs of state to the private sector. Cheaply, if possible. &quot;They were trying to control their funding or their spending, and they wanted the cheapest aircraft to fulfil a mission,&quot; said Don Moss, the owner of the aircraft broker Sportsflight, which arranged for another company to put the aircraft at the service of Dyncorp, a private military company acting on behalf of the CIA. Moss made the remark during cross-examination in a New York court case generated by a legal dispute between his company and Richmor Aviation Inc, which initiated the proceedings to recover payment it claimed it was owed. The Gulfstream IV executive jet was made available at a cut-rate $4,900 (about \u00a33,000) an hour. Crew members were paid $800 a day, according to invoices submitted to the hearing. They would submit expenses claims for meals  (pdf) \u2013 deli sandwiches at $19.95 a time, bottles of wine at $39.95 each \u2013 and stay in expensive hotels: $391 a head for one night&apos;s stay in Barcelona in January 2004, for example; $277 each for accommodation at Shannon on the west coast of Ireland the following August. Before each flight an administrative officer at the US department of state would hand over a &quot;to whom it may concern&quot; letter (pdf) which made clear that their mission offered &quot;global support to US embassies worldwide&quot;. They were warned, however, that they needed to provide detailed explanations on their invoices, as Dyncorp &quot;operate very much like the government&quot; and would reject any claims considered too vague. Despite the attempts to keep costs down, the invoices submitted to the court as evidence show that some rendition operations were eye-wateringly expensive. In November 2002, for example, Gulfstream N85VM made a six-day round trip from Washington, taking in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Shannon, Dubai, Kabul, and Edinburgh (pdf). Richmor&apos;s bill was for $240,643 and 95 cents, including catering, landing fees and the cost of an additional crew member. Another operation that month, which saw the Gulfstream fly from Washington to Kabul via Shannon and Dubai, (pdf) and return via Dubai and Luton, north of London, resulted in a bill from Richmor for $198,930 and 30 cents. Bizarrely, given the purpose of the flights, Richmor was expected to meet US federal regulations, meaning rendition aircraft (pdf) were designated as drug-free workplaces, to be operated only by companies that took affirmative action to employ workers with disabilities. The real value of the documents is the way they allow the most comprehensive and verifiable picture to date of the CIA&apos;s so-called &quot;ghost planes&quot; to be mapped out. In the past, White House administrations under both George W Bush and Barack Obama have moved to ensure that details of the programme did not leak out from court proceedings. However, a lawyer who acted for Richmor&apos;s president, Mahlon Richards, told the Guardian that there was no such intervention on this occasion. &quot;What happened here was that Richmor Aviation entered into a contract with Sportsflight to provide rendition flights for detainees and after I got involved in it and I saw the various invoices from Richmor that were submitted to Sportsflight it was amazing to me that no one from the United States government ever said boo to me about any of this,&quot; said William Ryan, of the law firm Tabner, Ryan and Keniry. &quot;So I just went about prosecuting the case for the client.&quot; Jeffrey Heller, a lawyer at the firm Somer and Heller, which acted for Sportsflight, said that it was &quot;nothing more than an air travel broker&quot;. &quot;I don&apos;t believe that Don Moss had any knowledge, specifically in advance, of what these flights were going to entail,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t think they knew there was going to be these rendition flights. &quot;Sportsflight brokered the contract and then brokers the availability of air travel, so Richmor then has these planes ready and then the government agency goes directing to Richmor to book these flights, so Sportsflight is kind of out of it. They don&apos;t necessarily know where it&apos;s going, when and who is getting on.&quot; Gulfstream N85VM has already been identified as the aircraft that rendered Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, an Egyptian cleric known as Abu Omar, after CIA agents kidnapped him in broad daylight in Milan in February 2003 and took him to Cairo. Through close examination of the invoices it is possible to identify other rendition flights in which a number of high-profile al-Qaida suspects may have been rendered. In August 2003, for example, Richmor submitted an invoice for $301,113 for eight flights over three days that took the Gulfstream to Bangkok, via Alaska and Japan, on to Kabul via Sri Lanka, and then home again via Dubai and Shannon (pdf). This operation appears to have been the rendition of Encep Nuraman, the leader of the Indonesian terrorist organisation Jemaah Islamiyah, better known as Hambali. He had been captured in Thailand shortly before the aircraft set off. The court heard that in October 2004 the aircraft&apos;s tail number was changed to N227SV after the US government discovered that its movements were being tracked. The following March the aircraft was publicly linked to the Abu Omar rendition. Phillip Morse, the aircraft&apos;s ultimate owner, said he was stunned to discover how his plane was being used. Later that year, businessmen involved in the rendition programme spotted a new opportunity after a number of companies that operated the CIA&apos;s own fleet of aircraft \u2013 which also operated rendition flights \u2013 were exposed in the US media as agency front operations. Moss wrote to Mahlon Richards at Richmor: &quot;This has changed the whole posture of the end user, to the extent they are reluctant to operate their own aircraft (pdf) and have elected to ground certain equipment indefinitely. We hope this can be to our benefit.&quot; But the happy days of deli sandwiches, $40 wine and $4,900-an-hour fees were about to come to an end. As a result of media investigations around the world and parliamentary inquiries in Europe, the truth about the rendition programme \u2013 and the fate of its victims \u2013 was slowly becoming clear. Soon Morse and his family were reluctant to climb aboard their own jet. &quot;They were afraid to fly in their aircraft because of all the publicity about their particular airplane,&quot; Richards told the court. Italian investigators began an investigation into the kidnap of Abu Omar that ultimately resulted in the conviction of 23 Americans, all but one of them CIA agents, who were tried in their absence. Two Italian intelligence officers were also convicted. The former head of the CIA in Milan, Robert Lady, was given an eight-year jail sentence. By October 2006, Richards was writing to Moss to complain that his company was suffering negative publicity (pdf), losing business and receiving hate mail. The Gulfstream&apos;s crews were afraid to leave the country. &quot;In the future, whenever the name &apos;Richmor&apos; is googled this will come up. N227SV will always be linked to renditions. No tail number change will ever erase that and our requests for government assistance in this matter have been ignored.&quot; Additional reporting by Sarika Bansal", "title": "Mundane bills bring CIA's rendition network into sharper focus", "sentences": ["In November 2002, for example, Gulfstream N85VM made a six-day round trip from Washington, taking in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Shannon, Dubai, Kabul, and Edinburgh (pdf).", "Another operation that month, which saw the Gulfstream fly from Washington to Kabul via Shannon and Dubai, (pdf) and return via Dubai and Luton, north of London, resulted in a bill from Richmor for $198,930 and 30 cents.", "In August 2003, for example, Richmor submitted an invoice for $301,113 for eight flights over three days that took the Gulfstream to Bangkok, via Alaska and Japan, on to Kabul via Sri Lanka, and then home again via Dubai and Shannon (pdf)."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-31T20:35:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/aug/31/stephen-bates-diary-alistair-darling", "tags": ["Politics", "UK news"], "article": "\u2022 Ah, the season of mellow fruitfulness draws on, nights close in, and that strange scraping sound we can hear is the knives of the political memoir season being sharpened.

Word is that John Sentamu, the archbishop of York \u2013 who has been severely ill with appendicitis this summer \u2013 would be ambitious for the job, a thought to make many bishops blanch, since they rate his abilities rather lower than he does himself. And it is said that Richard Chartres, bishop of London and third in line of seniority, might back Sentamu if only to make sure he is not appointed, and Chartres himself would then gain the primacy. Positively Trollopean and surely wrong-headed, except that it is being circulated by some senior clergy. Such febrility is anyway surely unnecessary, as Rowan still has another nine years before he need retire and both Sentamu and Chartres are older than he is. If he were to go he would be, in Harold Wilson&apos;s felicitous phrase on being succeeded by Jim Callaghan, making way for an older man. \u2022 Flap, flap, over the Channel from Brussels comes the latest scare story: the EU wants to spend \u20ac2m researching homeopathic medicines for animals.

Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    The controversial annual award loathed by architects and their clients is compiled by Building Design magazine, a weekly media fix for architects. This year&apos;s shortlist, drawn from suggestions by members of the public, included the opulent blocks of flats designed for international multi-millionaires by Richard Rogers for the Candy Brothers at One Hyde Park in London, the Museum of Liverpool by 3XN and AEW, and Newport railway station in South Wales by Nicholas Grimshaw and Atkins. Several of the schemes, including MediaCityUK, Newport station and the Museum of Liverpool, have been designed by firms of well-known &quot;signature&quot; architects, then executed by much bigger commercial practices that produced the buildings on time and on budget, but without soul and a spirit of place. MediaCityUK might be anywhere from Salford to Shanghai, and the Carbuncle Cup nomination for MediaCityUK reads: &quot;For an organisation with high cultural aspirations, it is hard to see how the BBC could have sunk much lower.&quot; &quot;If you&apos;re going to spend \u00a3600m on a complete city district that is also the home of one of the nation&apos;s leading cultural institutions as well as other high-profile media and university tenants&quot;, says Hugh Pearman, editor of the RIBA Journal and one of the Carbuncle Cup judges, &quot;then it&apos;s a bit of a shame not to pay more attention to the quality of the architecture. It would have cost very little more to make this place really special.&quot; In today&apos;s issue of Building Design, editor Ellis Woodman writes: &quot;Whatever urban aspiration may be indicated by its name, a city is the last thing one would mistake this development for.

News International confirmed that the secretive reporter had now started work at the paper but declined to reveal further details about his employment. Mahmood&apos;s employment by the Sunday Times comes as former News of the World staff have been told by News International that suitable jobs are not available for them as the consultation following the closure of the Sunday tabloid continues. Around 40 former News of the World staff are planning to launch a class action against the News of the World amid fears they have been &quot;stigmatised&quot; and will be unable to get new employment. However, they are waiting until the redundancy consultation ends on 6 October before taking any action. MediaGuardian.co.uk understands that Mahmood has been recruited on a salary of \u00a3150,000 and will work &quot;under his own steam&quot;, as an investigative reporter with a desk in the paper&apos;s open plan newsroom in Wapping. The company would not disclose whether he will bring his entourage, thought to be a team of journalists, technical staff and bodyguards, with him on his operations. It is understood from sources that his appointment was partly negotiated by James Mellor, the former News of the World news editor who is now the Sunday Times&apos;s deputy news editor. The news is said to have come as a blow to some of the existing staff at the Sunday Times which has its own Insight investigative journalism team headed up by Jonathan Calvert. Insight has enjoyed a range of scoops in the past few years, including the revelations about alleged bribery of Fifa officials and attempts by outgoing MPs to secure lucrative jobs. During his 20-year tenure at the now defunct News of the World Mahmood claimed to have &quot;saved children from paedos and nailed 250 evil crooks&quot;. Another of his scalps was Sarah Ferguson, who agreed to take $40,000 from the fake sheikh to arrange access to Prince Andrew. Meanwhile, many of Mahmood&apos;s former News of the World colleagues are &quot;uneasy and uncertain&quot; about the results of the three-month consultation over their redundancy. They allege there is a feeling that they are not welcome to apply for jobs in some areas of News International&apos;s parent company, News Corporation, because of the stigma of having worked at the tabloid, even though many were not working for the News of the World when the alleged phone hacking took place up to 2006. News International closed the News of the World on 10 July at the height of the crisis engulfing the company over phone-hacking allegations. Some people have now had their second one-to-one meeting with News International executives and decided to take enhanced redundancy packages to leave early after not being offered roles that they want. According to sources, more left last week and have handed back their company mobile phones and laptops. Many were underwhelmed by News International&apos;s efforts to find them work after they were given a list of potential News Corp jobs, which included posts in Russia and Dubai. When the News of the World closed, Brooks told staff: &quot;I will do everything I can, not just to restore the reputation of the current newsroom and under the leadership of Colin but also to find you all jobs if I can, as many of you as I can in the company and that&apos;s a testament to itself.&quot; One News International source claimed: &quot;NI has the massive problem of not being able to find any of the magical jobs for NoW folks the Red Queen [Rebekah Brooks] promised.&quot; Some staff have already found jobs on the Sun and at rival newspaper groups such as Associated Newspapers. A News International spokeswoman said: &quot;We are exploring every opportunity to help employees affected by the closure of the News of the World find new roles. This process will continue throughout the 90-day consultation period.

Once the dust cloud \u2013 visible 20 miles away \u2013 had settled, all that remained was a cathedral-sized mound of rubble and over 3m cubic metres of air. In the subsequent decade, New Yorkers have instinctively turned to the twin towers to orientate themselves, only to find nothing there. But over the last few months, and with the 10th anniversary of the 21st century&apos;s most notorious event imminent, a new structure has started to stretch upwards, piercing the Manhattan skyline, its roof sprouting cranes like the leaves of a young plant. The building already stands boldly above the others around it and it is only two-thirds complete. With every week that passes, it is claiming its status as the pre-eminent Manhattan landmark. By early next year it will supersede the Empire State Building in height. Even now it draws the eye, particularly at night when its construction lights twinkle like a brooch from Tiffany. This week the tower stands at 80 floors and counting. It is going up at the rate of a floor a week, the product of 24/7 activity by a team of 1,100 workers. By the time it opens, it will be 104 floors; a beacon will take it to the historically resonant height of 1,776ft (541 metres). Up on the 55th floor of the emerging skyscraper \u2013 once called Freedom Tower but now known by the more temperate name 1 World Trade Centre \u2013 the stunning views are ample evidence of the building&apos;s potential. You can see way across the water, beyond Ellis Island and Lady Liberty to New Jersey, while below us, the memorial gardens are being assembled in honour of those who died. &quot;This is the worst disaster in our country&apos;s history and we&apos;re up 55 storeys and climbing,&quot; says Lee Ielpi, a New York firefighter who knows more about Ground Zero than most. For the past 10 years he has spent most of his waking life here. He arrived at the site soon after the towers fell and for the next nine months he worked 12-hour days atop the rubble searching for bodies. After the site was cleared, he founded a tribute centre that houses a 9/11 exhibition and works with bereaved families. Ielpi&apos;s son Jonathan, also a firefighter, was called out with the Queens-based Squad 288 after the first plane struck and he was in the south tower helping people escape when it came down. His body was discovered three months to the day after the disaster; Ielpi carried his son out with his own hands. Ielpi rattles off the key statistics, by now as familiar to him as his son&apos;s name. &quot;On this site 2,749 people were murdered in a matter of 102 minutes. There are still 1,125 people missing, 10 years later. Only 174 whole bodies were found. One of them was Jonathan.&quot; Later, he says: &quot;People ask me, &apos;It&apos;s been 10 years, what&apos;s it like?&apos; Well, it&apos;s like I haven&apos;t seen my son for 10 years. Nothing more than that.&quot; Ielpi takes us on a tour of the 16-acre site, which, on 12 September will be opened to the public for the first time. We walk around the footprint of the south tower and come to a stop in front of an oak tree, one of 415 planted at Ground Zero. &quot;This is the first time I&apos;ve seen that guy blooming,&quot; Ielpi says. &quot;I see it and I think of my son. Twenty nine. Married with two little boys. Loved helping people. Knew where he was going on the 11th, knew what he had to do. So yeah, I look at this tree, and this is nice.&quot; Jonathan&apos;s name is etched in a bronze panel that runs around the four sides of the footprint of the south tower. Also named here are the other victims \u2013 those on the aircraft, the emergency workers, and the victims of the Pentagon and Pennsylvania crashes. A second tribute at the north tower bears the names of those who died there as well as those killed in the first terror attack on the World Trade Centre, on 26 February 1993. From Sunday both footprints will be transformed into massive reflective pools with water falling 30 feet from their edges. &quot;I can&apos;t tell you how powerful it is,&quot; Ielpi says. &quot;I&apos;ve stood by that edge and listened as the water cascades down. If you want to hear somebody, there&apos;s a good likelihood you&apos;re going to hear somebody.&quot; Standing in the middle of Ground Zero, you can now start to appreciate the fusion of commemoration and rebirth that is gathering pace. Next year the 9/11 Memorial Museum will open, running underneath the plaza and housing many artefacts from the twin towers, including two enormous tridents from the north tower that are already in place. In 2013 the fourth tower on the site, a 60-floor skyscraper designed by Fumihiko Maki that is now going up, is scheduled to open, followed in January 2014 by 1 World Trade Centre. Towers two and three, by the British architects Lord (Norman) Foster and Lord (Richard) Rogers respectively, have yet to have firm completion dates. The relief that there is something finally happening at the site is palpable. To have had nothing to show a decade after the attacks would have been an enormous embarrassment for New York and for America. Part of the reason for the painfully slow progress has been physical \u2013 the World Trade Centre was built on more than 20 metres of landfill on the Hudson river which, added to the maze of commuter and subway lines that runs beneath it, makes for a fiendishly complicated infrastructure. But a less acceptable cause of delay has been the messy and at times ugly interaction between the countless entities that have vied to control aspects of the project, from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that owns the site, to the private developer Larry Silverstein who leases much of it, through New York city, the railway and subway authorities, insurance companies, local businesses and residents of Lower Manhattan and, of course, the relatives of those who died. Paul Goldberger, the New Yorker&apos;s architecture critic, who has tracked the project over the last decade, says the rebuilding has been beset by &quot;enormous battles between all the participants who could not agree on what to do, how to do it and who should pay for it&quot;. At its lowest point, the paralysis that took hold after 9/11 made a mockery of New York&apos;s reputation as the can-do city where anything is possible. &quot;That&apos;s a myth left over from another age. As New York has become older and more mature, it has lost the we&apos;ll-do-it-no-matter-what attitude that it pioneered but that now exists in places like Dubai or Singapore.&quot; Goldberger has mixed feelings about the redevelopment as it takes shape. He praises the memorial features of the project, with the footprints of the twin towers as their centrepiece, which he thinks will honour the victims in a moving and important way. But he harbours doubts about the buildings that will surround the memorial, particularly 1 World Trade Centre. Designed by the American architect David Childs, it has gone through several incarnations, each one more conventional than the last. &quot;It&apos;s going to be a good building, but no more than that,&quot; Goldberger says. &quot;We lost the opportunity to build a great building by being overly conservative in the design, overly concerned with security. It saddens me that we didn&apos;t take this opportunity to reassert American leadership. America is where the skyscraper began. We could have taken this piece of land, in the city of skyscrapers, and built the greenest, most exciting and innovative skyscraper that will show a whole new direction. We didn&apos;t do that.&quot; Despite the reservations of the city&apos;s pre-eminent architecture critic, commercially 1 World Trade Centre looks set on a path towards success. Tara Stacom, vice chairman of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the property firm handling the leasing of the office space, predicts it will be the &quot;most important building in the western hemisphere \u2013 it&apos;s going to be the coolest, hippest place to work and live.&quot; She says a range of media and law firms, entertainment companies and financial businesses have expressed interest in taking up space, including some from Europe and the UK. In the biggest deal to date, the magazine publisher Conde Nast has signed up for one million square feet \u2013 more than a third of the building. When the idea of another vast tower, which on completion will be the tallest in the Americas, was first suggested, sceptics argued that it would never be built because nobody would ever want to sit in an office high in the New York sky for fear of a repeat attack. But Stacom insists that has not been a worry for prospective clients. &quot;When we tour the site it&apos;s all about what an incredible place this is going to be.&quot; Back at Ground Zero, overlooking the pool at the south tower where his son died, Lee Ielpi says it&apos;s time to move on. &quot;There are some family members \u2013 and you can understand it \u2013 who can&apos;t get beyond 9/11. Their loved ones were taken away in a horrible way. But you have to get on. You never forget, but if you don&apos;t get on you&apos;re going to be trapped.&quot; Ielpi believes that when the rebuilding is finally finished, it will radiate its message far beyond the limits of Manhattan, of New York or even of the US. &quot;We&apos;re putting a memorial here, a museum here, we are going to remember our loved ones, and then we are going to surround it with beautiful buildings to replace those that were destroyed through hatred. We&apos;re going to show the terrorists that through our resilience \u2013 ours, as a world&apos;s \u2013 we can do it. We will overcome the obstructions that come along.&quot;", "title": "9/11 ten years on: America's tallest building rises from the rubble of Ground Zero", "sentences": ["As New York has become older and more mature, it has lost the we&apos;ll-do-it-no-matter-what attitude that it pioneered but that now exists in places like Dubai or Singapore.&quot; Goldberger has mixed feelings about the redevelopment as it takes shape."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-04T13:49:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/sep/06/paul-nicholls-live-racing-september-6-2011", "tags": ["Paul Nicholls", "Horse racing", "Sport", "Horse racing tips"], "article": "4.55pm More from Paul Nicholls Chris Cook: Here&apos;s the last 21 horses that the champion trainer discussed at his owners&apos; day on Sunday. Rebel RebellionHe&apos;s a lovely big, scopey horse and I thought he was an absolute certainty at Ascot [on his hurdling debut last November] but he choked. He then had a breathing operation and won at Kempton in February when I wasn&apos;t sure he was completely ready, so you can forget his first run. He was always going to be a nice chaser. We&apos;ll start him over two miles and see where we go after that. I think he&apos;s got a huge future over fences. Sir Du BearnA novice chaser, he&apos;s had loads of niggles and problems, he&apos;s been quite weak but he&apos;s come together quite nicely now. He just needed a bit of time and he should be winning from early November if we can put his troubles behind him. Bold AdditionHe nearly severed his hind leg at Hereford two years ago and it was a miracle he got over it. It took him a while to get his confidence back but he won three times over hurdles in March and April and he&apos;s still a novice to 1 November. He could run in the Persian War at Chepstow in October and then go novice chasing. It just goes to show, they can come back from injury and still be really good. Current EventHe&apos;s a nice, ex-French four-year-old. He choked on his debut for us at Aintree and then had a breathing operation. Next time, he won at Newton Abbot in March and he&apos;s still a novice to 1 November. I&apos;m itching to run him over fences round the smaller tracks and he could be interesting. Royal CharmWon his first two starts over fences and then took an age to come back to form again and he had one more run when he was third at Aintree. We were talking about the Hennessy but we might for next year to run him in that. He wants soft ground. SonofvicHe&apos;s not the most robust horse and he wants looking after but we&apos;re very much looking forward to him in novice chases this season. He&apos;s certainly got a bright future. GhizaoIf he&apos;d jumped better [at Aintree in April], he&apos;d definitely have beaten Finian&apos;s Rainbow. We&apos;ll give him lots of jumping practice, sharpen him up and aim him at the Haldon Gold Cup and then the Tingle Creek. There&apos;s lots of good races to be won with him. MereheadHe&apos;s a lovely, big, ready-made novice hurdle winner before he goes chasing. He looks great and it won&apos;t be too long before he&apos;s ready to go. Sang BleuHe was slightly disappointing last year when he basically fell apart. He needed lots of time. He&apos;s such a big, scopey horse and I&apos;m hopeful that, now he&apos;s fully matured, he&apos;ll put those runs behind him. Captain KellyA four-year-old Irish points winner, he&apos;ll go novice hurdling this season. We like what we&apos;ve seen and he&apos;ll be interesting when the ground&apos;s a bit softer. AerialWon very nicely on his debut for us at Wincanton but then made a noise when he was going up the hill here. He&apos;s had a breathing operation in the summer. He&apos;s not on a very generous mark for what he&apos;s done but he can run in graduation chases and there&apos;s plenty to come from him yet. Deireadh ReHe&apos;s not been back in all that long and I&apos;m very pleased with him. He&apos;ll have one more run in a three-mile novice hurdle and then he&apos;ll make a nice chaser. SanctuaireHere&apos;s Ruby&apos;s mate [he gave Walsh his 26th Festival winner, breaking Pat Taaffe&apos;s record]. He&apos;s been quite frustrating. He had a breathing operation and then won the Scottish Champion Hurdle. I ran him back too soon at Sandown and he threw his toys out of the pram. He&apos;ll either go novice chasing or go for handicap hurdles. Maybe the Greatwood is an option. He wouldn&apos;t be the easiest ride over fences. Join TogetherA staying novice chaser. Anything he did over hurdles was always going to be a bonus. He&apos;s already been schooled, he&apos;ll want plenty of cut and he&apos;ll be ready to go when it rains in November. What A FriendWe&apos;ve got to space out his runs. He&apos;s got two big targets this season, the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the Punchestown Gold Cup, where he might get some decent ground. I&apos;m going to mind him and, if he can win one of those two big races, that will obviously pay for the season. Flaming GorgeUsed to be with Nick Williams. He&apos;s a novice over fences and his handicap mark of 117 looks very workable. As soon as we get some soft ground, he&apos;ll run in a nice staying handicap chase. Cristal BonusFormerly with Evan Williams. He had a minor injury, got over that and he&apos;s been cantering for about a month. He looks great and he&apos;ll be ready to run at the end of October. He&apos;ll be a really interesting novice chaser and his handicap mark is interesting too. Master MindedThe plan is to beat Long Run in the King George. Well, you&apos;ve got to have an aim. If he gets three miles anywhere, it will be at Kempton, and we&apos;ll make a plan after that. He might have his first run back in the Amlin Chase at Ascot in November, which he won last year. He looks great, he&apos;s had lots of cantering and we&apos;re all very happy with him. Big Buck&apos;sHe won the World Hurdle for the third time, which was amazing, as Ruby dropped his whip this time [he is joking with Walsh, who is standing next to him]. He&apos;s been cantering for a while but we don&apos;t need him to run until the end of November at Newbury, as he&apos;ll follow the same plan as last year, going on to the Long Walk at Ascot, then Cheltenham and Aintree. We&apos;ll see if he can be the first to win four World Hurdles. He&apos;s only eight years old. DenmanHe&apos;s in fantastic nick. I gave him and Kauto Star and extra three weeks on their summer holidays, so they started cantering 10 days ago. He&apos;s still full of his old enthusiasm. This year&apos;s Gold Cup, when he was second for the third time, was probably one of the best races that I&apos;ve ever had anything to do with. I think we&apos;ve all learned now that you don&apos;t run a horse after the Gold Cup and I probably made a mistake in running him and Kauto Star again. He&apos;s going for the Lexus in Ireland and then he&apos;ll have his last run in the Gold Cup. Kauto StarThese last four horses have won 34 Grade Ones between them. Kauto did really well last season, despite what some journalists say. He ran an absolute blinder in the Gold Cup and then he was over the top at Punchestown, so it&apos;s hard to judge him on that. Clifford [Baker, head lad] said he was in danger of being dropped on a car on the road, Kauto&apos;s so fresh. Nothing is set in stone but it looks as though we&apos;ll go for the Betfair Chase. Long Run&apos;s going to go there too, so that&apos;ll give us a good guide as to where we are. What a superstar he&apos;s been. 2.10pm More from Paul Nicholls Chris Cook: Here&apos;s what the champion trainer had to say about another 21 of his horses on Sunday. Rock Of DeauvilleI don&apos;t think he acclimatised last season after joining us from France and he was a little disappointing, though he ran really tidily when sixth in the Fred Winter. He&apos;s going in the right direction and he&apos;s done well over the summer. He&apos;ll be ready to run in mid-October and we&apos;re very hopeful he&apos;ll leave last year&apos;s form well behind. Harry The VikingHe was beaten by Oscargo in a maiden hurdle at Chepstow in March, his only run under Rules so far. He&apos;s done nicely, he jumps well and he should make into a nice novice chaser. BrampourI don&apos;t think he was ever right last season, when he was fancied for the Triumph Hurdle after arriving here from France. He&apos;s come in looking really well and he&apos;s on a handicap mark that I&apos;m sure he can win off. We&apos;re aiming him at Ascot at the end of October and he&apos;ll go for two-mile handicap hurdles, with the Greatwood as a possible. His best is in front of him and he&apos;s one to follow this year. Kauto StoneHe&apos;s an interesting horse, new to the yard, and a half-brother to Kauto Star. He was a five-time winner in France, three times in chases, including a Grade One at Auteuil which Long Run won as a four-year-old. He&apos;s had a good summer out and done very well. He&apos;s not as big or as scopey as Kauto Star but we&apos;re very pleased with him so far. He&apos;ll go for the intermediate chase at Down Royal on the first Saturday in November that we&apos;ve won twice in the past three years with The Nightingale and Noland. We&apos;ll see where go after that. Pacha Du PolderA big, scopey type, he&apos;s entitled to run in novice hurdles until 1 November and we may well run him in one. Then he&apos;ll go novice chasing and he&apos;s in the mould of Star De Mohaison. We&apos;ll get some experience into him in the autumn and he could be one to follow. He&apos;s a lovely type, everyone seems to like him. Tonic MellysseFourth behind Zarkandar in the Adonis at Kempton. We gave him lots of time after that and he hosed in at Ayr in April, though he didn&apos;t beat much. He&apos;s done very well during the summer. There&apos;s a race for him at Chepstow on 8 October but that may come too soon, so he could go to Cheltenham the week after. He&apos;ll start over hurdles and then possibly go novice chasing at some point this season. Red HarbourHe was a little bit disappointing last season. We gave him a breathing operation in the spring and he was then beaten at Haydock, where he was a bit unlucky. He&apos;s a ready-made novice chase winner for October, though I think he&apos;ll be better suited by handicaps, coming off a fast pace. He could make into a nice two and a half mile handicapper. Balding BankerHe&apos;s done loads of jumping and he jumps nicely. He&apos;ll hopefully make into a really nice horse for EBF novice hurdles at the better tracks. Saint RoqueA really nice individual in the could-be-anything category. We won&apos;t see him over fences until this time next year, he&apos;s a novice hurdler for this season. Merrion SquareAn Irish points winner. We&apos;re very pleased with what he&apos;s been doing and he&apos;ll be aimed at three-mile novice hurdles. HinterlandA very interesting three-year-old, he&apos;s a lovely big, scopey horse who&apos;ll make a chaser one day. You&apos;d never know he&apos;s a three-year-old, the way he goes up that hill. He&apos;ll take the same route we took with Sam Winner, starting at the Paddy Power meeting, and he&apos;ll be one to follow. Edgardo SolHe&apos;s only just joined us from France and is a maiden over hurdles and fences. There are some new novice handicap chases that I&apos;ve got my eye on, including one at Newton Abbot on 7 October that could be right for him, but all the options are open for him. TatanianoWe could never really get him right last year and he blew up at Sandown in April [his first run for five months]. I&apos;ve a feeling it&apos;s worth trying him over a bit further and he might go for the Paddy Power or the Old Roan at Aintre. I&apos;m sure there&apos;s more to come from him. Black ThunderHe was fourth on his first start for us in a bumper at Chepstow and then improved to win easily in a bumper at Newton Abbot in May. I don&apos;t like to wind them up too much for bumpers and they are supposed to be races that the horses learn from. He&apos;s had a summer out. He jumps great and is one for the future, so we&apos;ll look after him. We might give him one more run in a bumper, maybe the one at Cheltenham&apos;s Paddy Power meeting that we won last year with Rock On Ruby. Mon ParrainI&apos;m still not sure why he got beaten in the Topham in April, when he looked all over the winner until the run-in. It half looked as though he didn&apos;t stay but he&apos;s only five and he&apos;s a lot stronger this year. I&apos;m not certain about his ideal trip but we&apos;ll enter him in the Paddy Power Gold Cup and see where we go after that. Indian DaudaieAnother one that never really acclimatised last season. He&apos;s had a really good summer out and done nicely and I think there&apos;s a nice handicap hurdle in him, maybe at the Betfair meeting at Haydock, where the brush hurdles might be ideal for him before he goes chasing. There&apos;s a lot to come from him. ToubabI could never get him right last year but he&apos;s only five and he looks great now. I&apos;ve been dying to go over fences with him and there&apos;s plenty to come from him. Five DreamHe loves himself and he&apos;s in great order but he&apos;s in the grip of the handicapper and these horses, when they know they&apos;re not going to win, they look after themselves. There&apos;s a three-mile handicap chase for him at Chepstow on 8 October. The MinackHe made a bad mistake at a crucial stage in the Reynoldstown and then didn&apos;t stay in the Scottish National. He&apos;ll be racing at around three miles on soft ground and I&apos;d hope he can win a chase or two. The NightingaleHe&apos;s never been the easiest to train but he&apos;s best fresh, so we&apos;ll aim him at the Grade One at Down Royal in November that we&apos;ve won in the past with Kauto Star and Taranis. He loves going right-handed and he&apos;s got to have soft ground. Fistral BeachHe got round in the Topham [when he was hampered in mid-race] and I thought that two miles and six furlongs over those fences might suit him. But it&apos;s all got to go his own way and he doesn&apos;t want it too soft. Today&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook Few jockeys can still find any market for their services at the age of 46 and the number who, at that advanced age, are good enough to edge out a regular jockey for a coveted ride, that number must be tiny, even if you scanned the whole of racing history. So that&apos;s something for Kieren Fallon to be proud about as he contemplates tackling the St Leger on Brown Panther, hitherto the mount of Richard Kingscote. I don&apos;t mean that to carry any hint of sarcasm. I feel very sorry for Kingscote but he will hopefully have years ahead of him in the saddle and there will be other chances to take part in big races. He last two rides on Brown Panther were less than inspired and even his winning ride at Royal Ascot, when he made his move a long way from home, suggested that he had rather lost his cool. The horse&apos;s connections are not regulars in Classic races, so I don&apos;t blame them for trying someting different on this occasion. I don&apos;t know the thinking that has led connections of Humidor (4.00) to pick Fallon for today&apos;s race at Leicester, rather than Matthew Davies, who normally has the ride. Davies has gone to Lingfield to partner Grand Theft Equine, the likely favourite for the 5.40pm race, and it is quite possible that he has picked that ride over Humidor. Be that as it may, I think George Baker&apos;s sprinter can get back to winning ways today, having run with credit in Group company on the last two occasions. He tired into fifth in Goodwood&apos;s King George after trying to match those speedsters through the first half of the race but should be back in his comfort zone here, in the most straightforward opportunity he has had since his most recent win in April. Baker is in form, Fallon is going great guns and has a 28% strike-rate from 53 rides here over five seasons. Humidor is 5-2. This is the time of year when maiden races at places like Leicester can often contain really interesting prospects and the 5pm contest is surely worth watching. The newcomers include Estimate from Sir Michael Stoute&apos;s yard, bred by the Aga Khan but now apparently owned by the Queen. This filly is a half-sister to six winners, including the Gold Cup winner Enzeli and the Irish Oaks winner Ebadiyla. Moment In Time also comes from a family that has enjoyed success and is entered in the Fillies&apos; Mile. Velvet Star is a Galileo half-sister to Moon Ballad, who won the Dante and the Dubai World Cup. All these uknowns line up against the six-times-raced Esentepe, fourth in the Chesham. The one I like is Corsetry (5.00), out of the same dam (Lingerie) who produced Shiva, Light Shift and four other winners. Two of those siblings won on their debuts, while two others were beaten half a length or less and Sir Henry Cecil&apos;s charge is entered for Redcar&apos;s Two-year-old Trophy, so she may well have shown some sign of precocity. She&apos;s 15-2. It&apos;s hard to know what the going on Lingfield&apos;s turf course is going to be like. There was just 1mm of rain overnight but it is raining now and there will be more through the morning. I fancy a couple of horses drawn near the stands&apos; rail, which is often favoured on the straight turf course there, and have hope neither will prove terribly ground-specific. Angel Cake (2.10) was beaten just half a length (in Denmark!) on her fourth start last time, while a straight course may help Camache Queen (3.10) settle better than Warwick last time, where she spent the first half of the race on the turn. More from Paul Nicholls&apos; owners&apos; day I&apos;ll be back later with details of the remaining 42 horses that the champion jumps trainer discussed on Sunday. Tipping competition, day two Stefanjames1979 and wiggy12 set the early pace, having both found Puy D&apos;Arnac (12-1) and Kathleen Kennet (11-4).

Mir Tohmas Wazir was helping to construct a US-funded road in Paktika, a volatile southern province, when insurgents attacked. A hail of gunfire sliced through the air, killing two policemen: the 23-year-old civil engineer leapt into a car and scrambled to a nearby US base where, his employer assured him, a waiting helicopter would whisk him to safety. But first there was a problem. At the base gates an American sentry, suspicious of the bedraggled Afghan, yelled at him to stop. Wazir lifted his shirt, slowly, to show he wasn&apos;t wearing a suicide belt. Then he carefully produced a military contractor&apos;s badge. The soldier, relieved, lowered his gun. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought you were a Talib.&quot; The young Afghan smiled, thanked him and walked into the base \u2013 failing to tell the soldier he was half-right. On the day that airliners smashed into the World Trade Centre in New York 10 years ago, Wazir was on the frontline of Afghanistan&apos;s civil war, fighting with the Taliban. By his own admission, he wore an archetypal look: black turban, thick beard, Kalashnikov rifle. The 17-year-old from Kabul was a cook, driver and sometime fighter for the Taliban, engaging in dogged battles against their bitter enemy, Ahmad Shah Masoud, who had been assassinated by an al-Qaida suicide bomber two days earlier. When news of the attacks on America filtered through on BBC, his comrades cheered. &quot;They were very happy,&quot; Wazir recalls with a wry smile. &quot;Their attitude was: &apos;Good enough for the Americans. Let them come and get us now, if they can.&apos;&quot; That rough-cut teenage warrior is virtually unrecognisable today. The beard is shorn, his battle clothes replaced with slacks and lilac shirt, and the gun with a\u00a0laptop. Over the intervening decade, as momentous change swept Afghanistan, Wazir has wholeheartedly embraced the post\u2011Taliban transformation. He has a third-level education, a young family and a thriving engineering business with work across the country. From his headquarters in west Kabul the good-humoured businessman negotiates contracts, surfs the internet and swaps jokes with colleagues. &quot;Hey Tohmas!&quot; a subordinate shouted recently after a company meal, pointing to his bulging waistline. &quot;How many months pregnant now?&quot; It is no small irony that most of Wazir&apos;s corporate revenue comes from US government contracts. &quot;Major changes have come to Afghanistan over the past 10 years,&quot; says Wazir, thumbing his chest. &quot;Like me.&quot; The young entrepreneur&apos;s story illustrates how the decade since 9/11 has transformed the fortunes of some in Afghanistan, where conflict is enmeshed with ethnic politics, clan loyalties and simple economics. It shows how western aid has enriched some Afghans, but not nearly enough. And as western armies nudge towards an exit in 2014, it shows how even those fragile gains could be easily undone. By his own account Wazir was a reluctant gunman. Like the Taliban, he was an ethnic Pashtun, but their arrival in Kabul in the late 1990s ruined his life. The Taliban arrested his father, a former communist intelligence official, and sentenced him to death. Wazir hocked the family lands to bribe a judge, who commuted the sentence to 20 years, but he was forced to quit school and seek work. But jobs were scarce in Taliban-held Kabul, a city run with a mix of iron discipline and comic-book economics. Then his relatives offered a way out. Taliban recruits His father&apos;s family hails from Margha, a small village deep in the mountains of southern Paktika province. The Pakistani border lies a few miles away; on the other side is the tribal area of Waziristan. In mid-2001 the villagers sent a message to Wazir. They said the Taliban were pressuring them to provide recruits for the fighting: if he signed up they would pay a handsome reward. He assented. &quot;I needed the money,&quot; he says. The 17-year-old was dispatched to the northern front in Takhar province, where he met several Taliban luminaries including Baitullah Mehsud, who would later start the Pakistan Taliban, and Nek Muhammad, a celebrated commander from Waziristan. &quot;He was very friendly, and interested in volleyball,&quot; Wazir recalls. Otherwise Wazir found war to be an ugly business. He was sucked into vicious battles and saw things that turned his stomach. His\u00a0cousin, who had joined the Taliban with him, lost a leg to bomb shrapnel. A\u00a0few weeks after 9/11, Wazir decided to\u00a0get out. Desertion was a dangerous adventure \u2013 commandeering a taxi, crashing through Taliban checkpoints and hiding with relatives. Reaching the northern city of Kunduz, Wazir witnessed the night-time evacuation of Pakistani soldiers and al-Qaida fighters who, he said, were airlifted out by Pakistani military helicopters. Finally, in early October 2001, he bluffed his way on to an aeroplane destined for Kabul. The American invasion was looming, so he slipped across the border into Waziristan, thinking himself safe. But the war followed him. Nek Muhammad, who had also crossed into Pakistan, found Wazir in the main town, Wana. Muhammad ordered him to the Tora Bora mountains, where Osama bin Laden was preparing his stand against US special forces. Wazir pleaded to be dismissed. &quot;I said I wanted to study, not fight,&quot; he said. Amazingly, Muhammad agreed. A year later, in 2002, his father was freed from jail. The family returned to Kabul where the city&apos;s post-Taliban renaissance was just starting. The deserter&apos;s life was about to be transformed. Wazir resumed his studies with hungry enthusiasm, taking classes in English and computers that started at 5am. One of his teachers was so impressed that when Wazir ran out of money he waived his fees. &quot;He kept saying he wanted to get an education to improve his family&apos;s life,&quot; said Hashim Alavi, owner of the reputed Jihad Danesh educational institute. Alavi, who later became a senior UN official, said he had no inkling of his star student&apos;s past. Neither did Wazir&apos;s classmates, many of whom came from the Hazara community that suffered brutal persecution under Taliban rule. But Wazir had grown to reject much of what the Taliban stood for. During the first presidential elections in 2004, he turned up at the polls before dawn and voted for Hamid Karzai. After graduating in civil engineering, he joined the aid boom. The US was pumping billions of dollars into roads, schools and infrastructure; Wazir got a job analysing the soil, tarmac and concrete quality on the projects. The wages left him gobsmacked \u2013 at first $200 a month, then $600, then $1,000. By the time he was ambushed by the Taliban in late 2007, his monthly wages were over $2,000. &quot;I got so happy. It was very strange, almost unbelievable,&quot; he says. A few years ago Wazir set up his own construction services company. One of a handful of Afghan contractors certified by the US army corps of engineers, he runs projects in 17 provinces, offices in Kabul and Kandahar, and employs 50 people. He enjoys many of the trappings of the new elite \u2013 trips to Dubai, a smart Jeep, shopping trips to the city&apos;s western-style malls. His wife just gave birth to their second child and his father is back at work with Afghan intelligence. His fortunes to some degree reflect those of the city around him. At night, Kabul&apos;s once dark hills sparkle with light since regular electricity was introduced a few years ago. Gleaming hotels and apartment buildings, mostly owned by politicians, rise in the city centre. There are at least six daily flights to Dubai. More people flood into the city every day, hoping for their own slice of success. One-quarter of all Afghans live in the bulging cities, making it among the most rapidly urbanising countries in Asia, according to a recent report. Yet if Wazir could be a poster boy for the immense possibilities of the past decade, his life also reflects its pressing failings. Driving through the chaotic city traffic, he fends off beggars and bribe-seeking policemen. His Midas touch has eluded most Afghans, for whom life remains short, brutish and poverty-stricken. Karzai, sheltered inside his fortified palace, has grown deeply unpopular; the recent assassination of his half-brother, Ahmed Wali, suggests a precarious weakness. &quot;We thought Karzai was the guy we needed; he seemed to speak from the heart,&quot; says Fareedullah, a disillusioned civil servant, shaking his head. &quot;Now everyone has the same feeling: things have gone wrong.&quot; Meanwhile the insurgency gathers steam \u2013 August was the bloodiest month on record for US troops in Afghanistan. Kabul&apos;s &quot;ring of steel&quot; \u2013 a chain of security checkpoints and concrete barriers inside the city \u2013 failed to stop Taliban assaults on the five-star InterContinental hotel and the British Council offices this summer. Wazir, travelling to construction projects around the southern provinces, has seen the insurgency at close quarters. Last February he ran into another ambush, this time in Helmand province. On his way back from surveying a US army-funded school \u2013 a one-day job that earned him $20,000 \u2013 Taliban fighters appeared on the road. They dragged him from his car and clubbed him on the head with their Kalashnikovs. &quot;They said: &apos;Stupid, stupid, you son of Bush!&apos;&quot; he recalls. &quot;And I replied: &apos;Stupid, you son of ISI.&apos;&quot; The Taliban took Wazir to a compound where they debated killing him; he managed to talk his way out of it. Construction contractors tramping into Wazir&apos;s office from across Afghanistan bring more tales of troubles. Mahmood Ahmedi of International Relief and Development (IRD) tells his neighbours in Wardak, near Kabul, that he works for the &quot;Islamic Research Department&quot;. Otherwise, he says running a finger across his throat, &quot;I&apos;m finished.&quot; Wazir&apos;s office manager is Watanyar, a former British military translator who quit after several friends were killed. &quot;It&apos;s just too dangerous now,&quot; he says. From his time in the war zone, he believes 90% of rural Pashtuns support the Taliban; he worries what will happen if they return. &quot;The first people they\u00a0will come after are the translators,&quot; he says. &apos;Transition&apos; Such fears, whether rational or not, are becoming rife. After years of offering policy prescriptions that seemed to change with the seasons \u2013 counter-narcotics one year, corruption the next \u2013 western officials now have just one agenda: &quot;transition&quot;. Most Nato troops are due to leave by 2014; diplomats are talking about talks with the Taliban. And then what? Among anxious Afghans, dark scenarios are doing the rounds \u2013 a return to fundamentalist rule, a spiral into vicious civil war, or a precipitous collapse of the Karzai government. Western officials insist they will maintain a sizable force to support the democratic government; some talk of 25,000 US troops. But the commitment is watery, for now, and many wonder how Karzai will pay his bills. This year foreign donors are spending \u00a37.5bn on the Afghan army, a sum equivalent to the entire economy: estimates suggest at least half this amount will still be required in 2014. The shape of the transition will become clearer in the coming year. But what&apos;s certain is that, after a decade of lofty promises, the western ideal is being dramatically stripped back. &quot;Instead of trying to make Afghanistan into a model society,&quot; says analyst Martine van Bijlert, &quot;we should use the years we have left to help it to muddle through.&quot; &quot;Afghans are used to insecurity. If you get bombed when you go out, well that&apos;s just bad luck,&quot; says Alavi, the former teacher. &quot;What worries them is instability \u2013 the possibility they could lose what they have got.&quot; Even \u2013 or perhaps especially \u2013 former Taliban fighters are rubbing their worry beads. Wazir&apos;s cousins from Margha, along the Pakistani border, have joined the Taliban and vowed to kill him. &quot;They say: &apos;You&apos;re just a kaffir, an American collaborator,&quot; he says. Senior Taliban commanders send him demands for extortion payments, sometimes from Pakistani phone numbers. And he knows the flow of US aid could dry up soon. Wazir&apos;s business partner, Javed, says they looking into businesses such as trucking routes to China. Wazir&apos;s main priority, though, is to ship his family out. &quot;I can&apos;t live free, not like this,&quot; he says. Wazir is thinking of his newborn daughter. He wants her to be educated, but doesn&apos;t see that happening in Kabul, at least not on its present trajectory. &quot;I want her to become a doctor,&quot; he says. &quot;But the situation here is too dangerous. I want a new opportunity \u2013 and I think it will have to be outside Afghanistan.&quot;", "title": "9/11 ten years on: ex-Taliban fighter's journey from AK-47s to US contracts", "sentences": ["He enjoys many of the trappings of the new elite \u2013 trips to Dubai, a smart Jeep, shopping trips to the city&apos;s western-style malls.", "There are at least six daily flights to Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-06T17:16:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/sep/08/artificial-island-pacific-sea-levels", "tags": ["Environment", "Sea level", "Oceans", "Climate change"], "article": "Sea levels are rising so fast that the tiny Pacific state of Kiribati is seriously considering moving its 100,000 people on to artificial islands. In a speech to the 16-nation Pacific Islands Forum this week, President Anote Tong said radical action may be needed and that he had been looking at a $2bn plan that involved &quot;structures resembling oil rigs&quot;:  &quot;The last time I saw the models, I was like &apos;wow it&apos;s like science fiction, almost like something in space. So modern, I don&apos;t know if our people could live on it. But what would you do for your grandchildren? If you&apos;re faced with the option of being submerged, with your family, would you jump on an oil rig like that? And [I] think the answer is &apos;yes&apos;. We are running out of options, so we are considering all of them.&quot;  Kiribati is not alone. Tuvalu, Tonga, the Maldives, the Cook and the Solomon Islands are all losing the battle against the rising seas and are finding it tough to pay for sea defences. Kiribati faces an immediate bill of over $900m just to protect its infrastructure. But history shows there is no technological reason why the nation could not stay in the middle of the Pacific even if sea levels rose several feet. The Uros people of Peru live on around 40 floating villages made of grasses in the middle of Lake Titicaca. Equally, the city of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec predecessor of Mexico City that was home to 250,000 people when the Spaniards arrived, stood on a small natural island in Lake Texcoco that was surrounded by hundreds of artificial islands. More recently, Holland, Japan, Dubai, and Hong Kong have all built artificial islands for airports, or new housing. The mayor of London Boris Johnson has a vision of a giant international airport in the middle of the Thames estuary with five runways to replace Heathrow. Kiribati could also take a lesson from the Maldives, where the rubbish of the capital city Male and the hundreds of tourist islands, is sent to the artificial island of Thilafushi. It&apos;s growing about one square metre per day. Neft Daslari, Stalin&apos;s city in the middle of the Caspian sea, is still operational after more than 60 years. At its peak it housed over 5,000 oil workers 34 miles off the Azerbaijan coastline. It began with a single path out over the water and grew to have over 300km of streets, mainly built on the back of sunken ships. Kiribati could emulate Spiral Island in Mexico. This was constructed by British artist Richard &quot;Rishi&quot; Sowa on a base of 250,000 plastic bottles. The island was destroyed by Hurricane Emily in 2005 but is being rebuilt. With millions of tonnes of rubbish already floating in the Pacific, and plans to collect it, Kiribati could solve two problems in one go. But Tong&apos;s imagination has been stirred by a more futuristic vision. It&apos;s possible he&apos;s seen the &quot;Lilypad&quot; floating city concept by the Belgian architect Vincent Callebaut. This &quot;ecopolis&quot; would not only be able to produce its own energy through solar, wind, tidal and biomass but would also process CO2 in the atmosphere and absorb it into its titanium dioxide skin. Bangkok architects S+PBA have come up with the idea of a floating &quot;wetropolis&quot; to replace eventually the metropolis of Bangkok. They say that Bangkok is founded on marshes and with sea levels rising several centimetres a year and the population growing fast, it&apos;s cheaper and more ecologically sound to embrace the rising seas than fight them. Stranger still could be the German architect Wolf Hilbertz&apos;s idea for a self-assembling sea city called Autopia Ampere. Hilbertz plans to use the process of electrodeposition to create an island that would build itself in the water. It would begin as a series of wire mesh armatures connected to a supply of low-voltage direct current produced by solar panels. The electrochemical reactions would draw up sea minerals over time, creating walls of calcium carbonate on the armatures. Islands have always fascinated political utopians, and now the billionaire hedge-fund manager and technology utopian Peter Thiel, has linked with Patri Friedman, a former Google engineer and grandson of Nobel prize-winning free market economist Milton Friedman to envisage a libertarian floating country. Their idea is to build a series of physically linked oil-rig-type platforms anchored in international waters. The new state would be built by entrepreneurs and have no regulation, laws, no welfare, restrictions on weapons or moral code of ethics. Eventually, millions of &quot;seasteading&quot; people would live there. Plans for a prototype are said to have been drawn up for the first diesel-powered, 12,000-tonne structure with room for 270 residents. Eventually, dozens \u2013 perhaps even hundreds \u2013 of these could be linked together, says Friedman who hopes to launch a flotilla of floating offices off the San Francisco coast next year. In the end, it depends on money, which is in short supply for poor countries. If the world puts up several billion dollars \u2013 as Tong and his people would probably prefer \u2013 it would be technically possible for Kiribati to stay where it is. Realistically, though, Australia, New Zealand and larger Pacific states are likely to be leaned on heavily to provide land for the Kiribatians and the world can expect a series of evacuations over the next 30 years.", "title": "Artificial island could be solution for rising Pacific sea levels | John Vidal", "sentences": ["More recently, Holland, Japan, Dubai, and Hong Kong have all built artificial islands for airports, or new housing."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-08T15:47:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/08/9-11-ten-years-on-shifting-opinions-muslims", "tags": ["Islam", "Al-Qaida", "Taliban", "India", "Pakistan", "Gaza", "Indonesia", "Saudi Arabia", "Egypt", "Jordan", "Morocco", "Afghanistan", "Iraq", "Israel", "Religion", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "New York", "US national security", "US foreign policy", "US news", "World news", "September 11 2001", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "Syeda Anjum Afree, now 21, clearly remembers the day. Coming from school to her home in a small town in a far-flung corner of north-east India she found her family and neighbours grouped around the television. The region had experienced separatist violence for decades, so terrorism was not new to her. But this was different. &quot;I was really shocked. I thought immediately of the common people who are always the victim of these things. The innocent people. That it could happen in America amazed me. It seemed so far away,&quot; she said. Afree is the daughter of cosmopolitan\u00a0Muslim bureaucrats. Her siblings have married Hindus and Christians. She had never seriously thought about her faith and identity. However, the events of 11 September 2001 had an immediate effect. There was a new atmosphere at her convent school. &quot;There was nothing explicit directed at me but I felt it. I heard people saying that Islam was an evil religion and full of terrorists. I was suddenly aware of being Muslim in a very different way,&quot; Afree said. She was one of the 20 students talking with the Guardian last month at Jamia Millia university, a Muslim institution in New Delhi, about 9/11 and its consequences. Young people among the 160 million Muslims in India, a Hindu-majority country with secular democratic institutions, are not necessarily representative of followers of Islam worldwide. But no one person or community is, and scores of interviews conducted by the Guardian in Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Palestine reveal that Afee&apos;s experiences, and the views of the students, find echoes elsewhere. They show how 9/11 forced many who had thought little about their faith and identity to do so; that anti-US and anti-western sentiment remains at historically high levels in much of the Islamic world; that support for al-Qaida and its methods has declined substantially over the past decade, despite initially rising during the Iraq invasion; and that conspiracy theories are prevalent, with hundreds of millions believing that the US government, the CIA or the Mossad, the Israeli overseas intelligence service, were responsible for 9/11. They also show that the desire for democracy, often with a deep religious identity, is widespread. On America Several of the themes that emerge anecdotally from our interviews are supported more scientifically by polling. In 2002, the Pew Research Centre started surveying public opinion in the Islamic world for its Global Attitudes project.     The Statue of Liberty from Jersey City, as the lower Manhattan skyline is shrouded in smoke four days after the attack. Photograph: Dan Loh/AP    &quot;We&apos;ve seen a decline of support for terrorism, America&apos;s image in decline during the Bush years, a lot of support for democracy in general and certainly we see high levels of religiosity in societies that we survey,&quot; said Richard Wike, the project&apos;s associate director. But he added that the Muslim world is far from monolithic and warned against making sweeping conclusions. &quot;Pakistan, Egypt and Jordan tend to be more traditional or conservative in their views on law and the teachings of the Qur&apos;an, gender issues and so forth than Turkey or Lebanon for example. We&apos;ve tried to correlate views on gender with age, socioeconomic [status] or education levels and it&apos;s pretty tough to make generalisations,&quot; he said. Opinions have evolved over the decade and any snapshot can be misleading. So, whereas the image of the US reached a low in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq, it has since recovered in some areas. Pew reveals that in Indonesia in 2000, 75% of people saw the US positively; six years later, approval levels fell to 30%. More recently, helped by President Barack Obama&apos;s own links with the country, they have climbed back to 54%. Elsewhere, though many still remember their anguish over the scenes in New York City and Washington DC and prefer Obama to his predecessor, feelings towards the US remain generally negative. In Pakistan and Turkey in 2000, levels of favourable sentiment towards the US were 23% and 52% respectively; but is now, according to Pew, 11% and 10%. Before 9/11, Zia Akhtar, 43, a Pakistani mechanic, held a positive view of the US. &quot;But now I&apos;m afraid they could attack us at any time,&quot; he said. Like many others, Akhtar makes a distinction between government and people. &quot;I&apos;m not against the people of the US, I&apos;m against their government,&quot; he said. Amira Salah-Ahmed, 28, an Egyptian journalist, said the difference &quot;between the American people and the US government \u2026 has gotten muddled \u2026 for many people. At a younger, more naive age I definitely had a more idealistic view of\u00a0the US as a world power and its role in promoting peace\u00a0and democracy. Now I think US foreign policy is the bane of our existence, especially in this part of the world,&quot; she said. Beyond the widespread anger at wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, another element frequently cited as damaging relations, at least amongst the wealthy and educated, were the tightened visa regimes and cuts in exchange programmes that were immediate consequences of the 9/11 attacks. &quot;I used to see Europe or even the US as a dream destination as a student or one day for a holiday. Now I&apos;d got to Dubai or Malaysia where I don&apos;t feel like a criminal,&quot; said Khaled al&apos;Otaibi, who runs a mobile phone business in the Saudi Arabian port city of Jeddah. Resa Aprienengseh, 25, a teacher from West Sumatra, Indonesia, claimed that when friends had tried to go to America they had been &quot;turned away because their names sounded Islamic&quot;. She added: &quot;People in France bumped into me and tried to knock me down because of my headscarf.&quot; There were some exceptions. Iyad Krunz, 38, an NGO worker in Gaza, remembers watching the attacks on TV in his office. &quot;My colleagues started to scream [for me] to watch the TV. I had mixed feelings and reactions, shocked disbelief mainly,&quot; he said. &quot;I was shocked by the action itself\u201a the killing of ordinary people\u201a but I was more shocked by the US reaction, the destruction in Afghanistan and Iraq.&quot; New security arrangements meant it took three months for Krunz to get a visa to visit his brother in the US, instead of the usual three weeks, but his feelings about the country have not been changed. &quot;I visited the US and I loved the community, the people and the freedom. I&apos;d like to go back.&quot; On al-Qaida One key factor in the rejection of militant extremism from Morocco to Malaysia appears to be the proximity of violence. In country after country, support for Osama bin Laden, for al-Qaida&apos;s methods or for violence against civilians, relatively high when the attacks occurred thousands of miles away, declined steeply when militants struck at home. &quot;When it was a long way away it seemed somehow unreal. But when it was on the streets of my own town then that was very different,&quot; said Mohammed al&apos;Najdi, 31, a vegetable seller in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia&apos;s capital. &quot;I knew the brother of one of the policemen who was killed. That really shook me up and made me think.&quot; One of the most dramatic examples of this shift of opinion happened in Jordan: before the hotel bombings in Amman, in November 2005, support for suicide bombing (outside Israel-Palestine) stood at 57%, according to Pew; that declined to 12% by 2009, dropping by more than half in the months after the hotel attack. In Indonesia, support for radical violence fell to 20% after the first Bali bombing, in 2002, from 26%, and then dropped further, to 11%, after the 2005 bombings. The steepest drop in support for terrorism happened in Morocco: in 2006, after successive waves of bombings in previous years, nearly 80% of people surveyed said violence against civilians was never justified \u2013 more than double the proportion who expressed this view in 2004. In Turkey, despite the growing chaos in Iraq, confidence in Bin Laden to &quot;do the right thing in world affairs&quot; dropped from 15% before the 2002 Istanbul bombing to 7% in the year, then to 3% by 2005. In Egypt, the attacks of 2004 and 2005 led to 68% of people remaining &quot;very or somewhat concerned&quot; by 2006 about the rise of Islamic extremism. On religion     Afghan women in Kabul at a rally for the legislator Malalai Joya. Photograph: Shah Marai/AFP/Getty Images    Rejection of extremism has not necessarily translated into more support for western-style secularism though. Large majorities in many Muslim-majority countries \u2013 including Egypt and other nations in which regimes have been overthrown in recent months \u2013 still want political systems to include significant religious elements. Religion is also gaining new prominence in people&apos;s lives and identities. Some observers and researchers even talk of a new wave of social and religious conservatism emerging from the polarisation of recent years. Ali, 29, the manager of a computer shop in a high-end, multi-floor electronics bazaar in Kabul, Afghanistan&apos;s capital, was a refugee in Peshawar, the frontier city over the border in Pakistan, in September 2001. He was too young to immediately understand the significance of the event, he said, but he was pleased with US invasion and the ousting of the Taliban, which he and his family thought would improve their lives and end the war. &quot;It&apos;s been 10 years that we&apos;ve lived in Afghanistan. My life is improved, I have a better job than I would have had in Pakistan, but if you look at the national perspective, I think the future is dark,&quot; Ali told the Guardian. He said people still think of the Taliban with fear and hatred \u2013 &quot;They are only supported in rural areas, and even there it is because people are ignorant&quot; \u2013 but there are signs of a new conservatism more generally. &quot;In Kabul I see a lot of young men growing their beards and going to the mosques. It is not like they are supporting the Taliban; they have become more religious just for Islam itself.

There are people trying to promote the idea that Islam is a terrorist religion. We need more commitment and attachment to the religion so we can stand against those people.&quot; For Saadine Lamzoua, 25, a Moroccan journalist in Rabat who watched 9/11 unfold on al-Jazeera, religion has become more important in his life. &quot;It gives me a sense of belonging to a very large community and brotherhood with people from different countries and races with whom I share the same faith,&quot; he said. As ever, the situation is complex. Maryam Zaweej, 28, is a Pakistani aid worker. Her view of Islam, however, has changed little during the decade and described her religious commitment as &quot;mediocre&quot;.

On the perpetrators Then there are the conspiracy theories. These are not limited to the Islamic world but, Wikes said, year by year they are becoming increasingly prevalent among Muslim communities. Among the students gathered by the Guardian at Jamia Millia university, more than half did not accept the &quot;official version&quot;. And the conspiracy theories span social strata: in Saudi Arabia, a wealthy female university lecturer and a 44-year-old male labourer both said it was &quot;too early to be sure&quot; who was responsible for 9/11. Neither wanted to be named. &quot;It can&apos;t have been Arabs. You need a powerful organisation to do that. And you have to look to see who has gained the most benefit,&quot; the lecturer said. A Moroccan businessman, Nourdean, 57, and Selma Batenang, 47, a drinks seller in Jakarta, Indonesia, described al-Qaida as &quot;puppets&quot;. And Aprienengseh, the Sumatran teacher, said the fault lay with &quot;someone else trying to make war, create problems between Christianity and Islam&quot;.

Photograph: Ben Curtis/AP    Some, even after so many years of violence, reveal a guarded optimism for the future, in part due to the Arab Spring. For the journalist Salah-Ahmed, as for most Egyptians, the events of 9/11 are made more distant by this year&apos;s dramatic political upheavals, which she believes could have a lasting impact on global power structures. &quot;A few months ago I could have listed the major events of the past decade in order of importance \u2013 but then the revolution came along and overshadowed everything that&apos;s happened since 2000.&quot; Ismail Gad, 41, an Egyptian clothes shop owner, said his life had improved during the decade. &quot;I&apos;m now married, I have two kids, and Egypt has had a revolution. Terrorism seems [now] to have been reduced and in many ways things feel safer and more secure.&quot; For most interviewees the focus is simply on the gritty business of getting through life. Zaweej, the aid worker, is worried about the economy. &quot;We have gone down financially, and our politicians are so corrupt. Hopefully in the next election better people will be elected, and foreigners will start investing here again.&quot; For Akhtar, the mechanic, &quot;if business is good, then everything is good&quot;.

The faux-ruined walls and clashing colours personify the aspirations of the nouveaux riches, a shallow world of image and artifice. In a rare moment of design slapstick, Michael Douglas (as Gordon Gecko) puts his drink on the coffee table and it falls through \u2013 he thinks there&apos;s glass there. You can hear the modernists tutting. With its deceptive surfaces and furniture that doesn&apos;t do what it&apos;s supposed to, postmodernism is not just the backdrop to but a metaphor for unbridled capitalism, where a plump balance sheet conceals all manner of sins and where marble-effect plastic laminate hides chipboard. But was postmodernism really so bad? Already we&apos;re in cliche territory. If there were a critic&apos;s rulebook, it would stipulate the need to begin any piece on postmodernism with a pop culture reference and a tone of moral ambivalence. That mandatory disapproval is based not so much on the carnival of bad taste that romped through the 1970s and 80s, but on the fact that this bad taste was only skin deep. For, according to the standard reading, postmodernism was fickle and ironic, obsessed with style for its own sake. Where modernism was about high-minded notions such as essence and truth to materials, perhaps even a social agenda, postmodernism was about surfaces and signs. As Fredric Jameson put it in his brilliant Postmodernism: Or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, &quot;it is like the transition from precious metals to the credit card&quot;. With a major retrospective of postmodernism opening at the V&amp;A Museum later this month, the question is whether we have anything new to say about this phenomenon. Will the show reinforce old cliches, or will it manage to capture some of postmodernism&apos;s complexity? One of the awkward things about the postmodernists was that few of their leading lights actually wanted to be one. Ettore Sottsass, arguably the godfather of postmodernist design, felt that it was an American architectural movement. And in some ways he was right. In architecture, the agenda was set across the Atlantic, by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown&apos;s embracing of Las Vegas neon, by the historicist references of Michael Graves, the vertiginous corporate lobbies of John Portman and the assemblage style of Frank Gehry&apos;s house. But in design, the main impetus came from Europe. There were exceptions, such as the American Peter Shire, whose Bel Air chair does a fair impression of a cornice abusing a beach ball. But when Sottsass founded the Memphis group in Milan in 1981, along with Michele De Lucchi and Marco Zanini and others, he unleashed postmodernist design&apos;s boldest force.     Power of PoMo ... Michael Graves's the Swan and Dolphin Resort at Disney World, Florida. Photograph: Victoria Slater-Madert    Memphis was garish and irreverent, trawling history for allusions and splattering them with previously unthinkable patterns. It was a self-conscious riposte to modernism&apos;s steel-tube sobriety. Martine Bedine&apos;s Super lamp was like a child&apos;s toy, part ferris wheel, part puppy on a leash. Sottsass&apos;s Casablanca sideboard has something Aztec about it, and that kind of arbitrary reference was pure postmodernism \u2013 it might be neo-Mesopotamian, like Sottsass&apos;s 1972 Lapislazzuli teapot, or neo-art deco primitivism like the 1982 Murmansk fruit bowl.     Plundering the past ... Ettore Sottsass's Aztec-referencing Casablanca sideboard (1981). Photograph: Photo Studio/V&A    But what Memphis is chiefly remembered for is the plastic laminate that gave these pieces their dizzying visual effect. Thanks to this emphasis on shock-and-awe surfaces, it has become common to suggest that Memphis products were designed merely to look good in photographs \u2013 that it was mediatised furniture for an image economy. Jameson made the same point about postmodern architecture. This may be true, although in Memphis&apos; case I&apos;m not sure it was as conscious as that. Certainly, news of Memphis travelled fast \u2013 influencing some of the worst design of recent times \u2013 but Memphis itself was never a commercial success. The only people who seemed to do well out of it were Abet Laminati, the Italian laminates company that produced the riotous veneers Sottsass and co made all the rage. The problem with the conventional reading of Memphis as ironic, mediatised furniture was that Sottsass, at least, was not that cynical. A romantic, he believed that domestic objects could take on an almost sacred quality. A truer postmodernist was his compatriot Alessandro Mendini, who had established the Studio Alchimia group even before Memphis. Sharing none of Sottsass&apos;s optimism, Mendini was much more the ironist and iconoclast, seizing the opportunity to break all of design&apos;s rules \u2013 such as originality. His Proust armchair, a baroque confection daubed in pointillist brushstrokes, crosses furniture with an impressionist painting. He once described it to me as &quot;hermaphrodite design&quot; \u2013 nothing is his except the act of creating a hybrid. It was literate, sophisticated and meant as a joke. Just as architectural postmodernism descended into the pejorative &quot;PoMo&quot;, with pastiches such as Philip Johnson&apos;s AT&amp;T building (which crossed a skyscraper with a Chippendale cabinet), so postmodernist design fell into gimmicky merchandising. Mendini was a key culprit, with his toy-like Anna G corkscrew for Alessi, shaped like a woman in a dress. Even more literal was Michael Graves&apos;s kettle, also for Alessi, with its whistling plastic bird perched on the spout. Abandoning the old form-and-function dogma, design embraced its new nature as kitsch \u2013 kitsch that still sells rather well today, we might add.     Kitchen kitsch ... Michael Graves's postmodernist kettle for Alessi (1983). Photograph: Mike Kitcatt/V&A    From here, the link to pop and street culture is an easy one, and the V&amp;A retrospective promises to regale us with instances of where postmodernist design culture simply became popular culture. Hip-hop sampling, Peter Saville&apos;s New Order record covers, Grace Jones&apos;s eclectic styling and the Levi&apos;s ad in which Nick Kamen strips off in a launderette are all claimed as a groundswell of the postmodern ethos. There&apos;s a good theoretical basis for a lot of that, but it threatens to confuse postmodernism with 1980s popular culture generally \u2013 and resuscitating Neneh Cherry as a postmodern icon feels like the 80s revival run amok. In fact, revivalism seems to be one of the permanent legacies of postmodernism. Retro has become a perpetual condition. You can see it in ultra-conservative magazine design and referential fashion statements. If chameleon style-shifters such as Madonna and Grace Jones are postmodernists, then so is Lady Gaga. What is Apple if not neo-modernism, a revival of the minimalism preached by Dieter Rams and the Ulm design school in the 1960s? And the image economy (if that really is a Memphis legacy) is now so advanced that designers publish computer-generated images of work that is not only skin-deep, but doesn&apos;t even exist. In architecture, meanwhile, PoMo didn&apos;t die so much as find itself exported to the new bastions of turbo-capitalism: mirrored glass (and the lack of financial transparency that goes with it) abounds in Moscow, while the towers with the funny crowns migrated to Dubai and Shanghai. The V&amp;A ends the story in 1990 (well, shows have to end somewhere) but postmodernism is proving a difficult habit to kick. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2011 to replace the term Formica (which is a registered trademark) with the words &quot;plastic laminate&quot;.", "title": "Has postmodernist design eaten itself?", "sentences": ["In architecture, meanwhile, PoMo didn&apos;t die so much as find itself exported to the new bastions of turbo-capitalism: mirrored glass (and the lack of financial transparency that goes with it) abounds in Moscow, while the towers with the funny crowns migrated to Dubai and Shanghai."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-12T16:12:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/sep/12/asamoah-gyan-sunderland-al-ain", "tags": ["Sunderland", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Asamoah Gyan began a new life with Al-Ain in the United Arab Emirates on Monday claiming that part of his heart still belonged to Sunderland. Meanwhile, thousands of miles away on Wearside, Niall Quinn opened the door to the possibility of the African footballer of the year eventually returning to the Stadium of Light. The Ghana striker has swapped Wearside for a year-long loan in the Gulf. Although Gyan has quadrupled his Premier League wages to \u00a3125,000 a week and Sunderland have received a \u00a36m signing-on fee, it still seems a strange move for a 25-year-old watched by Real Madrid, Tottenham, Marseille and assorted Turkish clubs last season. It is just a year since Gyan became Sunderland&apos;s record signing when Steve Bruce plucked him from Rennes for \u00a313m but, despite considerable evidence that he had become increasingly disillusioned with life at the Stadium of Light, the player hinted he harboured slightly mixed emotions about his departure. &quot;I will continue to wear my favourite No3 jersey at Al-Ain as I begin a new adventure but with Sunderland still ingrained on my heart,&quot; Gyan said as he was introduced to a new public at the Khalifa Bin Zayed Stadium. &quot;I know this move will come as a surprise to many at Sunderland considering things I have said in the past month but sometimes fans do not understand why we do certain things. In due course certain things will come to light.&quot; While Quinn, Sunderland&apos;s chairman, said that not only he but Bruce, Ellis Short, the club&apos;s owner and various board members were all &quot;baffled&quot; by Gyan&apos;s decision to head to the UAE, he denied bridges had been burnt. &quot;The olive branch is there for Asamoah to return but he will need to convince Steve, the board and every fan of his commitment,&quot; said Quinn who is nonetheless delighted Gyan has agreed to make a &quot;sizeable&quot; donation to the club&apos;s charity foundation during each month of his loan. Sunderland&apos;s chairman blamed agents for unsettling his star striker. &quot;From the moment Asamoah returned for pre-season training we could tell people were trying to move him on,&quot; said Quinn. &quot;We hoped it would pass, rebuffed approaches from the Premier League, France and Turkey and felt the player would settle back down and continue to help our cause. We were also receiving real interest from Al-Ain but, by Wednesday, it looked as if it had lost momentum.&quot; This proved a false dawn as, on Friday, a delegation from Al-Ain fresh off the daily Emirates Dubai-Newcastle flight turned up at Sunderland&apos;s training ground determined to sign Gyan on loan. By the early hours of Saturday the contract was signed. Quinn said he agreed to part with the striker due to a combination of his &quot;negative attitude&quot;, the fact the UAE transfer window still had 50 days to run, Gyan&apos;s &quot;determination&quot; to head east and the fact Sunderland stood to lose his services for several weeks to the African Cup of Nations in the New Year.", "title": "Niall Quinn keeps door open as Asamoah Gyan leaves Sunderland on loan", "sentences": ["We were also receiving real interest from Al-Ain but, by Wednesday, it looked as if it had lost momentum.&quot; This proved a false dawn as, on Friday, a delegation from Al-Ain fresh off the daily Emirates Dubai-Newcastle flight turned up at Sunderland&apos;s training ground determined to sign Gyan on loan."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-12T16:27:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/sep/13/sergio-aguero-manchester-city", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Champions League 2011-12", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "On a cool early evening in Manchester, high above a city that now defines his new world, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and a football are inseparable. He cradles the ball as he talks, stroking it with a smile whenever he sounds exuberant or intrigued by the latest twist in a journey that has taken him from a rough quarter of Buenos Aires to Madrid and now Manchester. Here, in an old English industrial city that has audaciously reinvented itself, Ag\u00fcero has begun his latest adventure with a deadly flourish. Ag\u00fcero and Manchester City open their Champions League campaign at home to Napoli on Wednesday. It may be the first time in 43 years that City have played at the peak of European football, but the way they have begun this season suggests they are in the mood for glory. Fired by outrageous wealth, the depth and quality of their squad is now epitomised by Ag\u00fcero&apos;s cool brilliance and his rush of six goals in his first four games for the club. &quot;There is a very special feeling in Manchester right now,&quot; Ag\u00fcero says in his Argentinian-accented Spanish. &quot;I am beginning to understand how much this game against Napoli, and this whole competition, means to City&apos;s fans. They believe we can go a long way in this competition and I think they are right. &quot;We have all the conditions in place to go much further than anyone might have expected just a few months ago. But we are starting to appreciate that for the City fans, who have supported the club in difficult moments over many years, it will mean most to them if we do well.&quot; Anticipating all that awaits the blue half of Manchester, Ag\u00fcero talks animatedly while resting his chin on his football. But asked how his English lessons are progressing, he says, hesitantly, in English: &quot;Lowly?&quot; &quot;Slowly,&quot; it eventually emerges, is the word he meant to say. But Ag\u00fcero looks as if he could kiss the ball when, chattering in Spanish about Diego Maradona, he realises that another tentative introduction of an English phrase, &quot;my father\u2011in\u2011law&quot;, is\u00a0correct. &quot;You know I phoned him, my father-in-law,&quot; Ag\u00fcero says. &quot;I said: &apos;Guess what? Guess who we&apos;ve got in the group stages? Napoli.&apos; Diego just shouted: &apos;Napoli!&apos; He then said: &apos;OK, fantastic, that&apos;s a game I&apos;d love to see.&apos; Of course he made history in Napoli and he is still an idol there. He never got to play against Napoli in his own career so it&apos;s great another family member can now step in against his old team.&quot; The night would be made complete in Manchester by the sudden arrival of Maradona. And, in an even more combustible setting, Napoli would surely erupt in late November if Maradona attends the return match. &quot;He would love to be here,&quot; Ag\u00fcero nods, &quot;but his work in Dubai [where Maradona&apos;s surreal coaching career resumes with a club called Al-Wasl] meant he could not come to Manchester this week. The season in Dubai is starting and even Napoli is a little too far for him.&quot; Did Ag\u00fcero discuss his move from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid with Maradona before he signed for City in early July? &quot;No,&quot; Ag\u00fcero says. &quot;There was actually a silent period between us when all the negotiations were going on. I couldn&apos;t really spread the word to anyone about what was happening. But a few days before I actually came here I called Diego and told him I was planning to join Man City. He just said: &apos;I wish you all the luck and hope you do well.&apos;&quot; Ag\u00fcero&apos;s parents are currently with him in Manchester but the presence next door of his wife, Giannina, and two-and-a-half-year-old son Benjam\u00edn, seems most striking. Giannina, Maradona&apos;s daughter, ensures she and her son with Sergio maintain a discreet distance. But, with a grandad like Maradona, and his own dad, Benjam\u00edn Ag\u00fcero might turn out to be a decent player one day. Compared to Carlos Tevez, who has trumpeted his family&apos;s apparent loathing of Manchester, the extended Ag\u00fcero clan appears settled. &quot;You know,&quot; the 23-year-old Ag\u00fcero says, &quot;ever since I got engaged to her, my wife told me: &apos;Look, I know football, I understand how it works. I will follow you wherever the game takes you.&apos; That&apos;s exactly what happened. It&apos;s maybe not an easy city to adjust to \u2013 but I&apos;m doing well so far and the main reason is down to my wife and family. They understand that this is an important club that made a decisive bet on me for their new project. It helps when you feel wanted not only at home \u2013 but at work. &quot;I&apos;ve been with my wife for four years. Ever since we got married, and had Benjam\u00edn, they&apos;ve been with me. My wife came here to Manchester four days after I signed. We&apos;ve found a house we want to live in and it&apos;s obviously important they enjoy the city by themselves. They&apos;ve started to explore Manchester and they&apos;re getting to know the new environment. They like it very much \u2013 as does the whole family. My mother and father can&apos;t be here as often because I have brothers living in Argentina but it&apos;s important I&apos;m with Giannina and Benjam\u00edn. &quot;I actually think going from Buenos Aires to Madrid was more difficult. Of course me being only 18 then was a big factor but La Liga seemed much harder and more physical than Argentina. That was a big adjustment. Also, the Madrid weather was not so good. Coming to Manchester you could say the first week was awkward but then I started adjusting and my team-mates helped a lot. Now it&apos;s already OK.&quot; What was most awkward about his first week in Manchester? &quot;Well, mainly in the sense that when you&apos;ve been with one team so long, you are familiar with how they do things and the whole environment. It&apos;s difficult when you suddenly have new team-mates and a new way of doing things. But after the first week it got easier. You start to feel used to the manager, your team-mates, the routine, the place itself. It&apos;s an adaptation process and it still hasn&apos;t ended. I take it week by week.&quot; But what is the mood of the usually grouchy Tevez? &quot;I&apos;m only really with him at the training ground. At training, obviously, everyone is happy and we&apos;re just working together. I can&apos;t really say how he feels beyond that because I would be commenting on his life and I&apos;m sure he would like that as much as I would if he was commenting on mine. But I really don&apos;t know. For me, everything is fine. I&apos;m adapting quite well to English football with the same will I&apos;ve always had.&quot; A clinical hat-trick against Wigan last Saturday was just the latest evidence that Ag\u00fcero could become the most significant signing of the season. He also started his first Champions League season with Atl\u00e9tico, in 2008-09, with a spate of goals. &quot;I scored a goal in the qualifying game for the Champions League against Schalke, when we won 4-1. And then in the first group game against PSV we won 3-0 and I scored two. I also scored in the next game against Marseille. So I had a good start in this competition.&quot; The only time Ag\u00fcero sets his ball aside comes when he reaches for his new Puma boots \u2013 which he will wear for the first time against Napoli. Draping them around his neck, and clutching them happily, Ag\u00fcero says: &quot;If I could score a goal with these boots against Napoli it would be a great debut for me and City in the Champions League. Of course, winning the game is much more important but a goal would be nice.&quot; After four Premier League games for City, in which they have scored 15 goals and been the only team apart from Manchester United to collect maximum points, does he feel even more confident that the club is on the brink of a considerable breakthrough? &quot;Yes. City has been quite a big club for a while but some really good investments have been made. If you look at the last three signings \u2013 me, Owen [Hargreaves] and [Samir] Nasri \u2013 it clearly shows a club investing in players with the aim of achieving something. As long as the group stays tight, like now, and we&apos;re playing good football, the results will keep coming. Hopefully we can win a lot of trophies for the club.&quot; Could City actually win the Champions League at their first attempt? &quot;Well,&quot; Ag\u00fcero grins, &quot;it&apos;s a really tough competition. But I think we have as good a chance as any other team. The club might not be experienced in Champions League football but we have experienced players.&quot; The champions, Barcelona, whom Ag\u00fcero played against so often during four seasons in Spain, are still the benchmark. &quot;Of course,&quot; Ag\u00fcero says. &quot;They are above everyone else because they&apos;ve proved this over the last four years. But they are still just a football team and at Atl\u00e9tico we beat them three times in a row at our stadium. Last year we lost 2-1 \u2013 but we beat them every time at home before that. They can&apos;t stay dominant for ever. Other teams have the potential to overtake them.&quot; Ag\u00fcero believes City now belong among those aspiring clubs. His own ambition is also made plain when he admits that he dreams of one day replacing Lionel Messi as the world&apos;s leading player. &quot;There&apos;s no doubt Messi is currently the best player in the world. He&apos;s won the Ballon d&apos;Or the last two years. But it is my dream too to reach such a level and I work every day with the aim of winning that trophy one day \u2013 so I can say: &apos;Yes, I am the best player in the world.&apos;&quot; Before then, Ag\u00fcero reflects on his extraordinary rise from poverty and hardship in Buenos Aires. &quot;I think about it \u2013 a lot. It&apos;s something that goes with you, as baggage in a way. I think of it even more when I watch TV and see people struggling to live. I was lucky. Although my neighbourhood was very humble, I always had my family and friends. But it helps me to remember the effort I had to make and the obstacles I had to overcome to reach this point. I had to sacrifice a lot, as my family did, and now it has paid off. &quot;I like to think that people who really know me understand I am the same person \u2013 and that is something I will always fight to maintain. Obviously the money is there, but I want to stay the same. At the same time I want my son to enjoy what I didn&apos;t have. My father-in-law often looks at all the toys and games Benjam\u00edn has. Diego says: &apos;I didn&apos;t have this&apos; or &apos;I didn&apos;t have that.&apos; I say: &apos;Well, me neither. But it&apos;s something your grandson and my son can\u00a0enjoy.&apos;&quot; As darkness spreads across Manchester, there is just time for one last question. It follows an appraisal by Ag\u00fcero of the more famous club that has ruled this city for decades. &quot;United have been dominant for so long but this season this is a real chance we can challenge them \u2013 with the new players and the talent and the mentality within the club. I&apos;ve never won a league championship anywhere and so I really want to do it here \u2013 and I expect to do it here. Let&apos;s hope.&quot; Could City overcome a rejuvenated United and win the league in Ag\u00fcero&apos;s first season with the club? &quot;S\u00ed!&quot; Ag\u00fcero exclaims. &quot;And I don&apos;t think you need to translate that word.

The jockey, who broke his right arm and thumb in a pile-up at Glorious Goodwood on 30 July, was spotted aboard an unknown chestnut during first lot from Sir Michael Stoute&apos;s yard. Contacted later at his home, Moore was reluctant to discuss his hopes for his recovery. &quot;I&apos;ll have news for you at the start of next week,&quot; he said. &quot;There&apos;s really nothing more to say until I&apos;ve seen the doctor again.&quot; Asked if this had been the first time he had sat on a horse since his injury, Moore replied: &quot;Not necessarily.&quot; The jockey had spoken this week about his fitness regime, describing himself as &quot;in very good shape&quot; after plenty of &quot;swimming, rowing and that sort of thing&quot;. From an early stage in his recovery, Moore has been focused on returning to action in time to ride Workforce in the Arc, which they won together last year. Workforce can be backed at 7-1 to repeat the feat. Next month&apos;s Champion Stakes is in danger of being overshadowed by the Arc, with So You Think and Nathaniel more likely to turn up at Longchamp than Ascot, but another serious contender emerged for the British race when Dubai Prince carried the Godolphin colours to victory for the first time. He was ridden by Kieren Fallon while Frankie Dettori watched from the weighing room, having apparently been unable to do the weight of 8st 6lb. Last seen winning a Group Three at Leopardstown for Dermot Weld in October, the horse suffered a hairline fracture in the pelvic region soon after joining his new trainer, Mahmood al Zarooni, in the winter. This was an easy success against a handful of rivals for whom no great hopes are held, but Dubai Prince at least maintained his unbeaten record. &quot;He moved beautifully today, did all that was asked of him and it couldn&apos;t be a better reintroduction really,&quot; said Diana Cooper, representing Godolphin. &quot;The next step will be decided in the next week or so.&quot; Marcus Tregoning enjoyed his fifth victory in the Haynes, Hanson and Clark Conditions Stakes \u2013 which has often brought talented young horses to light \u2013 with Cavaleiro, who holds a Derby entry. This is Tregoning&apos;s first year in charge of his own business after ceasing to be a salaried trainer for Hamdan al Maktoum, and it has been a trying one. His tally of 18 winners means this is likely to be his least productive season since 1998, his first year with a licence. &quot;In all honesty we haven&apos;t had quite the ammunition, not so many to work with,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s been very disappointing. But we&apos;ve put that right with this horse.&quot; This time of year often brings unwelcome news about chasers and hurdlers who will miss the jumps season with a variety of injuries, and Imperial Commander is the first major name to be ruled out of the winter&apos;s action. The 10-year-old has sustained a tear to a tendon in a foreleg while spending the summer in Northern Ireland, but hope remains that he will return to contest major races next autumn. &quot;We haven&apos;t seen him as he hasn&apos;t been back to the yard,&quot; said his trainer, Nigel Twiston-Davies. &quot;He&apos;s been in pre-training in Northern Ireland and hadn&apos;t returned. I&apos;d imagine we won&apos;t see him back until next year now, but I would hope he will return. I haven&apos;t seen it myself but the injury sounds very slight and he should be fine for next season.&quot; Since beating Denman by seven lengths in the Cheltenham Gold Cup 18 months ago, Imperial Commander has won only one of his three races, the Betfair Chase last November. He cut a leg that day and did not run again until this year&apos;s Gold Cup, when he was pulled up.

His next task will be the sprint race on Ascot&apos;s inaugural Champions Day card next month, which will also be his first race against his stablemate, Society Rock. The pair were successful within 45 minutes of each other at Royal Ascot this summer, Deacon Blues in the Wokingham and Society Rock in the Golden Jubilee. The first of those is a handicap, the other a Group One, but Deacon Blues is so progressive that he is 5-1 favourite for the Qipco Sprint, half the price of Society Rock. &quot;I&apos;m running out of excuses to keep them apart,&quot; said James Fanshawe, who trains them. He would only grin when asked to compare the two. &quot;I&apos;m saying nothing. You would never know from Society Rock at home, you would not get a clue, apart from when he tries to buck his rider off. He just does it on the course.&quot; Deacon Blues was dropping back to five furlongs for the first time in his life but was not lacking for pace and finished powerfully under Frankie Dettori to beat Masamah. Fanshawe said that Johnny Murtagh, twice successful on the horse this year, had phoned him as Deacon Blues crossed the line, presumably to mix congratulations with a pitch for the ride on Champions Day. Dettori, however, expects to be free and to keep the mount. &quot;Hopefully, Deacon Blues will still be in one piece,&quot; Fanshawe said. &quot;You never quite know if they still retain their form by the middle of October but it&apos;s been the aim for him.&quot; The other Group Three race on this card is called the Arc Trial but perhaps it, and indeed this entire meeting, might now be better rebranded as a trial for Champions Day. Green Destiny came from an unlikely position to win impressively and will now be aimed at the Champion Stakes, according to William Haggas, his trainer. &quot;That was the idea of coming here, to see,&quot; Haggas said. He conceded that the horse had had a hard race but added: &quot;It&apos;s my job to freshen him up again. And if I can&apos;t freshen him up, I&apos;ll blame the fact that [the Champion Stakes] is right-handed and why on earth did they move it from Newmarket to Ascot?&quot; Green Destiny kicked off a Group-race double for Kieren Fallon, who then won the Mill Reef Stakes on Caspar Netscher. This two-year-old was having his eighth race of the year but appears to be thriving on it. Whether he will still be up to a tilt at the Breeders&apos; Cup by the beginning of November must be open to question, but that is the plan as outlined by his trainer, Alan McCabe. Richard Hannon was here, watching on television as his Tell Dad won first prize of \u00a3108,000 in a Tattersalls Millions race at Newmarket, stretching the trainer&apos;s lead to around \u00a3600,000 in the title race. Hannon said he hopes to run the classy Bronterre in a similar, still more valuable race at Newmarket next month. The colours of the prolific owner Dr Marwan Koukash were carried to victory in the Ayr Gold Cup for the second year in a row when Our Jonathan bounded two lengths clear of the well-backed Eton Rifles.

I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever had a bet on a Canadian race but tonight&apos;s the night because Wigmore Hall (9.34) runs in the Northern Dancer Turf Stakes. This will be the fifth different country in which Michael Bell&apos;s four-year-old has raced this year and he has still not been sighted in Britain since last year&apos;s Champion Stakes, despite being trained in Newmarket. He has run some fine races, as when third in the Dubai Duty Free and fourth in the Arlington Million. He was ridden for the first time in Chicago by Hayley Turner, who gave him a terrific ride until the turn for home. At that point, it seemed to me, she hesitated fractionally too long when the time came to make a move and suddenly they had nowhere to go. They finished best of all when finally in the clear and were unlucky not to be second at least. Jamie Spencer, who won the Million on Cape Blanco, is back in the saddle this time. Wigmore Hall looks like the outstanding talent in tonight&apos;s race (won last year by the Barry Hills-trained Redwood) and is bred to cope well with the step up to 12 furlongs. Betfair&apos;s market hasn&apos;t settled down yet but I hope to get 6-4 and perhaps better will be on offer. Coolminx, winner of Ayr&apos;s Bronze Cup two days ago, has been taken out of the sprint handicap at Hamilton, leaving the runner-up from that race, Jeannie Galloway, with a fair chance of compensation. At 5-1, I prefer Amitola (3.40), who was stuffed in her first two starts of the year but did much better last time and has come good at this time of year in the past two seasons. She is only 1lb higher than when winning a more valuable race at Newmarket last September. Jump racing returns to Britain after a 10-day break and the quality on offer will gradually begin to improve until the core season comes along in a couple of months. One thing to look out for is the return to the saddle of Noel Fehily, out since December with a wrist injury after enjoying great success on some of Paul Nicholls&apos; horses that autumn. He&apos;s in a couple of handicap hurdles at Plumpton. At Uttoxeter, 4-1 is better than I expected about a promising young horse with David Pipe, Taratata Sivola (3.50). He had been struggling around Auteuil but won on his British debut at Market Rasen last month. Perhaps he prefers decent ground (it was almost always deep at Auteuil when he ran there) or perhaps he&apos;s just taken time to mature. Either way, he is likely to be ahead of the handicapper.

Michael Bell&apos;s four-year-old, whose four previous races had been in Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United States, started favourite at 6-4 and beat Simmard by a neck. Jamie Spencer took a brave route on Wigmore Hall in the 12-furlong contest, sitting behind the pace and against the rail and waiting patiently in the straight for a gap that briefly seemed unlikely to appear. As soon as he found running room, Spencer drove Wigmore Hall into an advantage that he maintained to the wire. The victory earned nearly \u00a3200,000 in prize money for Mark Hawtin, Wigmore Hall&apos;s owner, taking his career winnings to nearly \u00a3900,000, all but a fraction of which has been earned overseas. Spencer was less fortunate an hour later, however, as he had nowhere to go in the home straight on Ed Vaughan&apos;s Dance And Dance in the Grade One Woodbine Mile. Dance And Dance, the runner-up in the Royal Hunt Cup at Royal Ascot in June, looked to have something left to give inside the final furlong of the $1m (\u00a3636,000) contest but had no chance to prove it as Turallure came with a trouble-free run down the middle of the track to beat Courageous Cat, the hot favourite, in the final strides. Both the winner and runner-up are now likely to oppose the brilliant French mare Goldikova when she attempts to win the Breeders&apos; Cup Mile at Churchill Downs in Kentucky in early November for an unprecedented fourth year in a row.

Frankie Dettori was in the saddle at Newbury two days ago and also when Deacon Blues won a Group Three at the same track in July.

Johnny actually rang up to congratulate everybody when we were in the winner&apos;s enclosure. &quot;It is going to be difficult a problem working out who will ride him at Ascot if he gets there. Johnny has ridden him to win a Wokingham and a Group Three and Frankie has ridden him to win two Group Threes.

The assassination of Burhanuddin Rabbani by men posing as leading Taliban envoys looked certain to tip the country even deeper into crisis. Rabbani was a former president of Afghanistan, respected religious scholar and chairman of the country&apos;s high peace council. The explosion in the heart of Kabul&apos;s diplomatic district kills off a peace process that was already on life support. It also deprives President Karzai of an important ally who had flown into Kabul specifically to meet the men claiming to be Taliban envoys and emboldens his enemies who are implacably opposed to the idea of powersharing with armed insurgents. &quot;This absolutely shows that peace with the Taliban is dead,&quot; said Ahmed Wali Massoud, the brother of a famous anti-Taliban guerrilla leader who was killed by suicide bombers days before the terrorist attacks of September 11. &quot;It doesn&apos;t work, it won&apos;t work,&quot; he added. The high peace council, a body set up last year by Karzai, has been trying to get talks off the ground against an increasingly inauspicious background. Insurgent groups have stepped up their attacks, not least launching spectacular assaults in the Afghan capital and assassinating key Karzai allies. And a set of secret talks mediated by the German government with a senior Taliban official has already collapsed. Last week Rabbani led a conference of provincial governors and officials in the southern city of Kandahar to develop policies for reintegrating insurgents who want to give up the fight. Not surprisingly a meeting with two men claiming to be senior Taliban officials was the first thing on Rabbani&apos;s agenda after flying back to Kabul from a subsequent trip to Dubai. According to an aide to Rabbani they said they represented the Quetta Shura, the Taliban&apos;s governing body, and had an important message to deliver. Not only were the visitors deemed too important to search thoroughly, inspecting a turban is still generally seen as disrespectful, even though there have been three other cases this year of the headgear used to conceal bombs. The aide said that when Rabbani entered the room one of them approached him, hugging him tight and placing his head on his victim&apos;s chest. Shopkeepers nearby heard a muffled bang from inside the building, which was still loud enough to set off the &quot;duck and cover&quot; alarms at the US embassy a short distance away. The former president was killed instantly while four others in the room were injured, including Masoom Stanekzai, a highly-regarded technocrat who runs the day-to-day operations of the peace council and had brought the men to Rabbani&apos;s house. The second man was also seriously injured. His turban was burning when he was found, according to an official from the country&apos;s interior ministry. He was taken to hospital, where strenuous efforts were made to keep him alive in the hope he would help investigators with their enquiries. On hearing the news Karzai scrapped plans to participate at the United Nations general assembly and announced that he would immediately return from New York to Kabul. Rabbani&apos;s killing is also looks set to exacerbate already acute ethnic tensions in the country. A Tajik and former warlord from northern Afghanistan who fought against the Taliban, Rabbani was a controversial choice as a point man on reconciliation issues. But although many observers argued that the Taliban would never take a man with his background seriously, his appointment was also designed to appease northern, non-Pashtun Afghans who were deeply suspicious of any peace deals. Haroun Mir, a political analyst with a background in northern mujahideen groups, said the death would &quot;increase the ethnic and geographic divide&quot; in Afghanistan. &quot;There were voices in the north that were critical of the peace process, but because of Rabbani&apos;s involvement, and because he was so respected, they kept quiet. These more critical voices will not now remain quiet.&quot; Abdullah Abdullah, the country&apos;s leading opposition figure, said the death of Rabbani showed the insurgents were trying to wipe out the political figures who ruled the country before the emergence of the Taliban in the 1990s. &quot;We should recognise and know our enemy from lower ranks up to the top officials of the country because by any means, by any way, they are trying to kill us and eliminate all high ranking officials and jihadi leaders.&quot; Former intelligence chief Amrullah Saleh, a northerner who has warned in the past that the north might be forced to rearm if a Karzai cut a &quot;deal&quot; with the Taliban, once again warned of the risk of &quot;civil unrest&quot;. &quot;The killing of Rabbani who had devoted his life to serving Afghanistan and to peace once again reminds us that reconciliation cannot be possible from a position of weakness but strength only,&quot; he said. &quot;It is time for us to unite for change and for defeat of the Taliban.&quot;", "title": "Afghanistan peace process in tatters after murder of key negotiator", "sentences": ["Not surprisingly a meeting with two men claiming to be senior Taliban officials was the first thing on Rabbani&apos;s agenda after flying back to Kabul from a subsequent trip to Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-20T19:59:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/22/muhammad-relic-presented-to-chechnya", "tags": ["Islam", "Chechnya", "Europe", "World news", "Religion", "Ramzan Kadyrov"], "article": "Ramzan Kadyrov, the eccentric leader of Chechnya, is famous for his collections of wild animals and luxury cars. Now he claims to be the new owner of a bowl once used by the prophet Muhammad, allegedly presented to him by descendants in London. A publicity video shows Kadyrov, who has been accused of widespread human rights abuses in the republic, collecting the purported relic from a private jet at Grozny airport on Wednesday before getting into a convertible Rolls-Royce covered in black and gold rugs, also said to have been brought from London. The Rolls-Royce leads a motorcade of dozens of luxury cars to the city&apos;s grand mosque, opened by the Chechen leader in 2008 as part of his drive to increase the official role of Islam in the republic. Thousands of residents lined the streets as Kadyrov waved and wiped away tears. Wearing a bright purple suit and black skullcap, Kadyrov pushes through a massive crowd at the mosque, allegedly the largest in Europe. As he opens the box to reveal the bowl, Kadyrov erupts into loud sobs, shoulders shaking. He covers his reddened face after he kisses the allegedly holy bowl for the first time. Kadyrov then thrusts the relic above his head, leading the crowd in chants of &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot;. Kadyrov has built an all-encompassing cult of personality in the republic and often goes to great lengths to put his faith on show. He is still battling the remnants of an Islamist insurgency \u2013 last month the road Kadyrov travelled down on Wednesday was hit by a suicide bomb attack that killed nine people and injured 22. Kadyrov told the crowd that the sacred bowl &quot;was brought from London to Grozny by British Muslims&quot; and dated back 1,400 years. His press service said the bowl had been kept in London by descendants of Muhammad&apos;s cousin, Ali. &quot;We put a lot of effort into getting the Great Prophet&apos;s bowl to our republic,&quot; Kadyrov said at the unveiling. The bowl will be kept at the mosque and brought out every year on Muhammad&apos;s birthday, when any believer will be allowed to drink from it, the press service said. &quot;Many expressed keen interest in the bowl, but the descendants decided that Ramzan Kadyrov deserves to keep it, and so it has been passed to him.&quot; The statement failed to mention whether Kadyrov paid for the purported relic.

Her legacy rolled into Britain on the second leg of a world tour to regale fans via the medium of diamonds, pearls and outrageous haute-couture. Inside auctioneers Christie&apos;s London HQ, reporters jostled with photographers and the dignitaries tripped over the TV cables. It was part showcase and part circus. All that was missing was the woman herself. Highlights from the Elizabeth Taylor collection plays to the public this weekend before moving on to Paris, Dubai and Hong Kong before a grand, everything-must-go auction in New York in December. The collection includes paintings by Degas, Renoir and Van Gogh and dresses by Valentino and Versace. All in all, it paints a vivid picture of a person with expensive tastes and the means to sate them. &quot;Elizabeth Taylor was the last great movie star, the queen of Hollywood,&quot; explained Jonathan Rendell, deputy chairman of Christie&apos;s Americas. &quot;She was \u2013 can we say? \u2014 an enthusiastic collector of couture, of paintings and, most of all, of jewels. What all this reveals, I think, is a woman who understood her contract with the public. She knew she had to provide them with glamour. She never left the house without looking perfect.&quot; The two-time Oscar-winner died in March at the age of 79, leaving behind a vast array of personal effects, including 269 individual jewels and a wardrobe bulging with an estimated 400 outfits. December&apos;s four-day auction is expected to fetch upwards of $50m (\u00a332m), with a portion of the proceeds earmarked for the Elizabeth Taylor Aids Foundation. Rendell could not say where the rest would go. &quot;I&apos;m not privy to the wishes of the trustees,&quot; he said. Whether mounted behind glass or draped on mannequins, the items serve as an index of a life lived in the limelight. The couture section contains the black velvet evening cape, emblazoned with giant silver scorpions, that Taylor wore to the 40th-birthday party of Princess Grace of Monaco, together with the silk chiffon wedding dress from the first of her two marriages to fellow actor Richard Burton. Pride of place goes to the luxuriantly beaded Tiziani kimono that enthusiasts may remember from the 1960s melodrama Boom. While Joseph Losey&apos;s film bombed at the box office, the kimono, praise be, emerged unscathed. The collection also finds room for Taylor&apos;s personal art collection, where a Van Gogh landscape (estimate price $5m-$7m) sits cheek by jowl with a Degas self-portrait and a scene of rustic France from the Fauvist artist Maurice de Vlaminck. A separate room is given over to Andy Warhol&apos;s classic silkscreens, together with a letter of thanks from the subject herself. &quot;Dearest Andy,&quot; it reads. &quot;I&apos;m so proud I finally have your &apos;Liz&apos; and thank you for signing it so sweetly to me. I do love you. Elizabeth or Liz (of Andy Warhol fame).&quot; For most visitors, however, the highlight is likely to be the jewellery. There, glittering under glass, lies the Mike Todd diamond tiara which sat atop the actor&apos;s head at the 1957 Oscars. The 33.19-carat Elizabeth Taylor diamond was her personal favourite stone and one that she wore every day. Viewed from a distance, the JAR sapphire earclips might be a pair of especially gaudy Christmas baubles, while legend has it that the ping-pong diamond rings were Taylor&apos;s reward for besting Burton in a game of table-tennis. According to Christie&apos;s, the jewellery alone is expected to fetch between $35m and $40m when it goes under the hammer. &quot;But we&apos;re known for being quite conservative with our estimates,&quot; said Rendell. &quot;It&apos;s going to be a popular sale.&quot; As visitors shuffled between the display cases, the late actor beamed down on them from a series of arty black-and-white posters, each adorned with a pithy quotation. &quot;The more the better has always been my motto,&quot; said Taylor in one. Over by the exit, another poster struck a cautionary note for any millionaire magpie who is tempted to throw open their chequebook. &quot;You can&apos;t possess radiance,&quot; it warned. &quot;You can only admire it.&quot; Or to put it another way: you can&apos;t take it with you.

The question whether or not a non-believer can appreciate religious art without sharing in its maker&apos;s religious purpose seems to assume that all religious art is made by believers. This is a false assumption. Anybody doubting whether a non-religious person can produce religious art should go and see David Mach&apos;s mammoth exhibition Precious Light currently on display at the City Art Centre in Edinburgh. Internationally acclaimed Turner prize nominee Mach is self-confessedly non-religious, and has worked for over three years on this exhibition, so far investing \u00a31m of his own money in it. Mach is best known for his imposing and provocative public art \u2013 sculptures made out of mass-produced found objects such as car tyres, magazines and coat hangers. In addition, he produces large-scale but minutely constructed Breughelesque collages of people set in panoramic scenes in modern world cities. Precious Light, billed as a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the King James Bible and consisting of works re-imagining well-known biblical stories in modern settings, includes both media. Apart from his colossal sculpture Golgotha in the entrance hall, with the figures constructed entirely out of coat hangers without the curved handle, most of the works consist of collages depicting action-packed epic Old and New Testament scenes \u2013 Noah&apos;s Ark, the Tower of Babel, Egypt&apos;s plagues, Jonah and the Whale, the Nativity and the Last Judgment in all its agonising apocalyptic drama. These are all set against the skylines of famous world cities: Noah&apos;s Ark in the hills of Edinburgh, Jonah and the Whale on the beaches of San Francisco, the Red Sea parting in Dubai, and the Nativity in Florence. Mach explicitly states that he does not believe in either God or Jesus. Yet, like so many other contemporary artists \u2013 from Gilbert and George and Damien Hirst, to Chris Ofili and Tracey Emin \u2013 he still remembers and returns to the Bible stories he was told as a child, at home, church or school. For many like him these stories linger on as fertile sources of creative imagination. Works like Mach&apos;s challenge the assumption that only artists of faith can produce religious art. Indeed, it can sometimes be the artist without faith who does the better job, unencumbered by expectations of conforming to the standard interpretations of either the church or the history of art. This should give us pause. If it is possible for artists without faith to produce religious art why would the viewer need faith to appreciate it? For Mach the Bible contains examples of all the human drama and archetypes we encounter in our lives today \u2013 love, pain, struggle, accidents, ecstasy, violence, natural disasters and much more. For him, religion is not about a spiritual experience of sublime beauty, but about providing a narrative to frame the blood and guts of 21st-century living. Or, as he put it to me some days ago in his studio at the Edinburgh exhibition: &quot;There is so much fucking shit coming at us \u2013 people are looking for some larger themes.&quot; A recent film attempting something similar is Terrence Malick&apos;s The Tree of Life, described admiringly by the Guardian&apos;s Peter Bradshaw as a &quot;Christianityless metaphysics&quot;. Malick&apos;s microcosmic story of an ordinary personal loss is situated in a larger context of cosmic dimensions. Unlike Mach, Malick is known to be a believing Christian. Yet, compared to Mach&apos;s visionary imaginings, I felt that Malick&apos;s lingering shots of natural beauty and heavenly reconciliations, however brilliantly filmed, were sappy and sentimental, relying on cliched notions of what a &quot;spiritual experience&quot; might entail without offering us any new angles. As a Christian, I was vastly more moved and enriched by non-believer Mach&apos;s gutsy, off-beat renderings of cataclysmic biblical events than by the syrupy beauty shown to us in Malick&apos;s metaphysical &quot;masterpiece&quot;.", "title": "Not all religious art is made by believers | Adrienne Dengerink Chaplin", "sentences": ["These are all set against the skylines of famous world cities: Noah&apos;s Ark in the hills of Edinburgh, Jonah and the Whale on the beaches of San Francisco, the Red Sea parting in Dubai, and the Nativity in Florence."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-23T16:24:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/24/tony-blair-mark-labovitch-resignation", "tags": ["Tony Blair", "Politics", "Business", "UK news"], "article": "Tony Blair&apos;s business operations are under scrutiny after the departure from his investment firm of a high-profile banker with connections to some of the world&apos;s richest investors and the revelation that the former prime minister secured big deals in the Middle East. Mark Labovitch&apos;s resignation as chief operating officer of Blair&apos;s Firerush Ventures, little more than a year after he was appointed to the post, threatens to leave a hole in Blair&apos;s business empire. Labovitch, 48 \u2013 who was appointed at the same time as a former Lehman Brothers banker, Varun Chandra, joined Firerush as an adviser \u2013 was seen in financial circles as someone who could open doors for Blair. The Financial News newspaper described him as possessing &quot;an expansive Rolodex of contacts and relationships built up during more than a decade as a senior investment banker&quot;. Firerush is crucial to Blair&apos;s fortunes, not to mention the 130 people who work for him. Blair explained a couple of years ago, when his staff was much smaller, that he had to &quot;earn \u00a35m a year to pay the wages&quot;. Firerush, which gives its address as a PO box in west London, is licensed by the Financial Services Authority to offer investment advice in a number of countries, including three that have low-tax environments \u2013 Gibraltar, Lithuania and Romania. Records filed at Companies House show that the Oxford-educated Labovitch joined Firerush on 1 June last year. He resigned on 28 July this year. It is unclear why Labovitch \u2013 who is reportedly to become a director at Coventry City football club and has joined Gems, a Dubai-based provider of private education \u2013 parted company with Blair. In an email sent to the Observer, he declined to comment. Blair&apos;s spokesman also declined to answer emailed questions regarding Labovitch. News of his departure comes as a Channel 4 Dispatches programme to be broadcast on Monday reveals Blair&apos;s role in two multi-billion-dollar contracts in Palestine. The programme shows how, in his role as the Quartet&apos;s representative to the Middle East, Blair helped persuade the Israeli government to open up radio frequencies so that a mobile phone company, Wataniya, could operate in the West Bank. He also championed the development of a huge gas field off the coast of Gaza operated by British Gas. Both Wataniya and British Gas are major clients of JP Morgan, the US investment bank that pays Blair \u00a32m a year for a role as a senior adviser. A spokesman for the former prime minister said on Saturday: &quot;Tony Blair has advocated for the both the Wataniya project and the Gaza gas development at the direct request of the Palestinians. It is his responsibility as Quartet representative to work to build the Palestinian economy and the Wataniya project represented the single largest foreign direct investment there has been into the Palestinian Authority.&quot; The spokesman added that in neither case was Blair aware JP Morgan had a connection with the company. Blair&apos;s business empire sparked interest in his relationship with the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), the $70bn fund used to invest the country&apos;s oil money abroad. Blair&apos;s close links to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the country&apos;s former leader, are well documented. Last week a senior executive of the fund suggested that the former prime minister had made representations to Gaddafi on behalf of JP Morgan. It also emerged that, after he stepped down from No 10, Blair wrote to Muammar Gaddafi offering investment advice for projects in Africa. &quot;You know I am doing a lot of work there and know of good worthwhile projects for investment,&quot; Blair told the despot. A spokesman said Blair never sought payment nor received it from Gaddafi or the LIA. Since he left office, Blair&apos;s business empire has helped him sustain a jetset lifestyle. The Daily Mail claims he is a regular at Abu Dhabi&apos;s Emirates Palace hotel, one of the most expensive resorts in the world. He has acquired a \u00a35.75m country house in Buckinghamshire and a \u00a33.7m home in London. Blair and his wife, Cherie, have also bought properties for their children. In addition to his work for JP Morgan, Blair is on a lucrative contract to advise insurance firm Zurich and is understood to be paid as much as \u00a3200,000 a speech. Blair has also been paid for consultancy work by a South Korean oil firm, UI Energy Corporation, which has extensive interests in the US and Iraq, and by the ruling family in Kuwait, from whom he received a reported \u00a31m fee. Another of his companies, Tony Blair Associates, which offers &quot;strategic advice on both a commercial and pro-bono basis&quot; has a contract with Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi investment fund. Blair also earns a reported \u00a3700,000 a year as an adviser to Khosla Ventures, a US venture capitalist firm founded by Indian billionaire Vinod Khosla. Labovitch&apos;s exit follows that of another Firerush director, former No\u00a010 staffer Jo Gibbons, who was Blair&apos;s director of corporate affairs and left last year. He advised Russian oligarchs during his time at the investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein and was responsible for stitching together more than $8bn-worth of deals for oil and gas giant Gazprom. He also has strong connections to wealthy investors in the Middle East and was, until recently, an executive of the company that owns the Independent newspaper. As COO of Firerush, Labovitch was at the centre of a complex web of companies that, due to the way they are structured, have to disclose only a minimal amount of information concerning Blair&apos;s business operations, the profits he makes or indeed how he makes his money. However, someone familiar with Blair&apos;s business activities suggested he is keen to cultivate closer relationships with Russian oligarchs. Earlier this month he gave a speech at the eighth Yalta annual meeting organised by Yalta European Strategy, which campaigns for Ukraine to join the European Union. The Yalta meetings are promoted by a foundation set up by Victor Pinchuk, one of the world&apos;s richest men, who has an estimated fortune of $3.3bn and owns TV channels and steel plants.", "title": "Tony Blair's business empire hit by second high-profile resignation", "sentences": ["It is unclear why Labovitch \u2013 who is reportedly to become a director at Coventry City football club and has joined Gems, a Dubai-based provider of private education \u2013 parted company with Blair."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-24T20:39:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/25/killer-elite-review-jason-statham", "tags": ["Jason Statham", "Thriller", "Action and adventure", "Robert De Niro", "Film", "Culture"], "article": "This violent conspiracy thriller is based on The Feather Men, an allegedly fact-based book written in 1991 by Ranulph Fiennes about a Dubai sheikh who hired a band of assassins to kill four British soldiers, most of them SAS veterans, whom he held responsible for the death of his sons during an operation in Oman.

On Sunday evening, amid the cheers of fans and the bloody death throes of fighting bulls, Barcelona hosted its last-ever bullfight. As dusk fell in the Catalan capital, sequin-clad local matador Seraf\u00edn Mar\u00edn dispatched the last of six bulls on the sand of the packed La Monumental bullring \u2013 where touts had been offering tickets at eight times their original price. With bullfighting banned in Catalonia as of next year \u2013 and with Sunday&apos;sfight marking the end of the season in Barcelona \u2013 no Spanish fighting bull will be killed in the city in the name of sport or art for the foreseeable future. Supporters denounced the ban as an infringement of civil liberties. Opponents declared it an enlightened move away from mindless barbarity. &quot;We have won the war, but today we will lose a battle as six animals will die,&quot; said a 32-year-old protester who gave only her first name, Montserrat. &quot;They are pigs,&quot; said Antonio, 70, an elegant white-suited fan, pointing to the small crowd of animal rights protesters gathered outside La Monumental. Either way, it was a historic moment. An 18,000-strong crowd packed into the stands to watch the matadors in their shiny &quot;suits of lights&quot; step out for the last time to the sound of trumpets and a\u00a0band playing pasodoble tunes. There was huge demand for tickets from those keen to witness the end, while some fans allowed inside dug up handfuls of sand to take home with them as souvenirs. &quot;I have been queueing here since Thursday and have slept outside three nights running,&quot; said Jordi Piqu\u00e9, who snapped up one of the few remaining tickets sold at the gate on Sunday morning. Although bullfighting has been on the decline in Catalonia for decades, Barcelona once hosted major fights. It was a sign of the dwindling local popularity of what Spaniards call their &quot;national fiesta&quot; that architect Richard Rogers had already turned the city&apos;s other major bullring, Las Arenas, into a shopping mall. Critics of the ban blamed the hand of Catalan nationalism. Deputies in the local parliament, they said, had voted it through purely because bullfighting was emblematic of Spain and they wanted to differentiate Catalonia from the rest of the country. &quot;The parliament banned bullfighting because it is a Spanish fiesta, not to protect animals,&quot; Mar\u00edn told El Mundo newspaper. Last night he and the other bullfighters were greeted with cries of &quot;Liberty! Liberty!&quot; and chants against Catalan nationalism. But activists and many locals said the ban reflected the sensitivity of locals to the needless suffering of animals in the name of entertainment. &quot;We are glad that the torturing of bulls in Catalan bullrings is over,&quot; said anti-bullfight protester A\u00efda Gasc\u00f3n. The first recorded bullfight in Barcelona was in 1387. In 1835 an angry crowd of fans rioted, burning down local monasteries and convents. Thousands of bulls have died on the sand of La Monumental, a neo-mudejar style building decorated with white and blue tiles, since it was built in 1915. Eight bullfighters have reportedly also died after being gored here. Spanish kings, the fascist dictator General Francisco Franco and regional Catalan presidents like Llu\u00eds Companys are among those to have been guests of honour here. Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s, a bullfighter loved by artists and leftwing intellectuals, was the star of a bill that included Mar\u00edn and Juan Mora. The three bullfighters killed two bulls each. Tom\u00e1s lived up to his reputation as a hero to Barcelona bullfight fans with his first bull \u2013 being awarded the gory trophy of the bull&apos;s ears as cheering fans waved white handkerchiefs to express admiration. Later he and Mar\u00edn were both carried out of the ring on the shoulders of fans who will now have to travel out of Catalonia to see them fight. The nearest working major bullrings are in the south of France and the neighbouring regions of Aragon or Valencia. A taxidermist has already been asked to preserve the head of the last bull to be killed. Other remains were set to be sold in butcher&apos;s shops \u2013 where the meat of fighting bulls, or toros bravos, which live a free-range existence before they die, is\u00a0prized by some clients. La Monumental, which has also hosted concerts by The Beatles and the Rolling Stones, is expected to receive planning permission for a change of use. Among the projects proposed for the site are an indoor market, a block of luxury apartments and a mosque financed by Dubai. In the blood Although the origins of bullfighting may stretch back to the gladiators and wild beasts in Roman amphitheatres, the contemporary fight started in Spain in the early 18th century. Horseback bullfights had been popular in medieval times, but in 1726 matador Francisco Romero began fighting on foot with a cape and a sword \u2013 sparking a new fashion. Rings were built to prevent fighter or bull getting cornered, with the oldest standing example the late 18th century La Maestranza, in Seville. Matador Juan Belmonte, who shot himself in 1962, is credited with founding the modern school, drawing the bull dangerously close to his body with the cape. Daredevil fighters like Belmonte helped fuel popular enthusiasm for the fight and fascinated foreigners, with writer Ernest Hemingway displaying his obsession in Death in the Afternoon, The Sun Also Rises and The Dangerous Summer. By the mid-20th century successful bullfighters were stars, and millions watched matadors like Manuel Ben\u00edtez, El Cordob\u00e9s on television. Seen as an art form rather than a sport by fans, bullfighting is also popular in southern France and some South American countries. The biggest ring, seating 48,000 people, is in Mexico City. But in Spain the number of fights has fallen by a third over the past three years as the residential construction bubble burst and Spanish town halls, which funded many fights, lost income from building licences. Some 1,700 fights were registered in 2010 \u2013 and more than 7,000 bulls were put to the sword. At least 500 farms, including a handful in Catalonia, rear the bulls.", "title": "Last bullfight in Barcelona sells out as Spain marks end of 600 years of history", "sentences": ["Among the projects proposed for the site are an indoor market, a block of luxury apartments and a mosque financed by Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-25T19:14:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/27/school-cancels-event-meg-rosoff", "tags": ["Meg Rosoff", "Books", "Children and teenagers", "Culture"], "article": "The award-winning children&apos;s author Meg Rosoff&apos;s reimagining of God as a sex-mad teenage boy in her new novel There Is No Dog has proved unpalatable for a Christian independent school, which cancelled an event with the author because of the &quot;blasphemous&quot; nature of the book, her publisher said. Rosoff had been booked to appear at the Bath boarding and day school Monkton Combe this week, as part of the Bath festival of children&apos;s literature. But her publisher Puffin said the school pulled out of the event after reading her novel, telling festival organisers that their objections centred on its &quot;blasphemous&quot; and &quot;unsuitable nature&quot;. Puffin added that the Emirates Airline festival of literature in Dubai also withdrew an invitation to Rosoff to speak at its 2012 festival after reading the novel and feeling it was &quot;unsuitable&quot; for their audience, and publicity director Adele Minchin said that &quot;a number&quot; of other schools had also declined offers for Rosoff to speak to their pupils about There is No Dog &quot;because they felt it was too controversial a subject matter to expose their pupils to&quot;.

She said it was &quot;disappointing that some schools feel that the subject of my book is unsuitable for their pupils as I consider it part of my job as a writer to explore sensitive issues, and to let my adolescent readers find hope, humour and redemption in a world full of danger and loss&quot;. Minchin at Puffin added that it was &quot;a great shame that a school would see fit not to give their pupils the opportunity to explore their beliefs and to engage with such universal issues as religion with a hugely popular author of Meg&apos;s calibre.

Festivals have never been more popular, and are typically a huge litter-generating, electricity-consuming exercise in wasteful excess. Yet Sunrise has shown that they don&apos;t have to be this way, proving that you can host a wild, hedonistic party, with loud music, light shows and a raucous crowd, without impacting on the environment. The festival policy is based on wanting to &quot;live in harmony with the earth&quot; and making changes at grassroots level in the hope they will inspire others.

Gebrselassie, who was forced to pull out of the Berlin marathon last weekend with a respiratory problem and then saw Kenya&apos;s Patrick Makau break his world record by 21 seconds, said Farah had a good chance of winning a medal in the 5,000 metres and 10,000m. The 38-year-old Gebrselassie dominated at those distances for a decade, winning gold in the 10,000m in 1996 and 2000, before switching to the road in 2004. But he said that there was a danger Farah, who won gold in the 5,000m and silver in the 10,000m at the Daegu World Championships in South Korea recently, could be affected by the pressure of a home Games. &quot;He is amazing, this athlete. He is so strong, this year especially. He will be the only one to challenge the Ethiopians and the Kenyans come the Olympics,&quot; Gebrselassie said. &quot;But don&apos;t pressurise him. I know the British media. For an athlete, if it&apos;s too much it&apos;s very difficult. I know, I&apos;ve been to different Olympic Games. Look at Paula [Radcliffe] in Athens and Beijing. I don&apos;t want to criticise the media, but one of her problems was that you pressurised too much.&quot; Gebrselassie said that as soon as he heard Farah had begun working with Alberto Salazar, the coach with whom he moved to the US to train earlier this year, he knew he would be in medal contention. The Ethiopian, who is yet to qualify for the 2012 Olympic Games, said he is still confident he could win marathon gold in London despite a new generation of athletes snapping at his heels. The lure of winning gold at the 2012 Games is one of the reasons he reconsidered his decision to retire in 2010. Gebrselassie said he was also confident he could win back the world record, believing it is possible to run below two hours, three minutes and 30 seconds. Makau set the new mark at two hours, three minutes and 38 seconds. &quot;When I broke the record it was not the record of Haile Gebrselassie, it was the record of somebody else. I have broken maybe 27 world records. And this runner is especially strong. I was not that surprised when he broke that record,&quot; he said. Gebrselassie, who mentors 14 young athletes as part of a scheme sponsored by G4S, said his career would feel incomplete without a marathon gold. &quot;I have two Olympic golds in the 10,000m. But imagine winning gold in the marathon, it&apos;s something very important. Plus, it&apos;s London. If I stopped running tomorrow without achieving this thing, it would be like I was missing something,&quot; he said. &quot;When I switched from 10,000 to the marathon, I was planning two achievements \u2013 the world record and the Olympic gold. I achieved one and I&apos;m begging God for the other. If I achieve that, my career is full,&quot; he said, but added he would not retire even if he succeeds. Gebrselassie welcomed the decision to move the 2012 marathon from London&apos;s East End to the centre of the city, finishing on the Mall, which proved controversial with local boroughs. &quot;I prefer the centre of the city. London is a historical city, you can show a lot of good things here. The stadium is also not that bad, but I prefer the finish to be as it is now, in the centre of London,&quot; he said. But he called on 2012 organisers to move the start time, arguing that running in the midday sun in August could be too hot. &quot;The only thing I don&apos;t like is the time. 11am in the morning is a little bit difficult. 9am is fine, 11am is getting hot,&quot; he said. The Ethiopian, who did not run in the Beijing Olympics due to concerns about the polluted air affecting his asthma, said he is targeting a marathon in either Dubai or Tokyo as his next race.", "title": "Haile Gebrselassie warns against piling pressure on Mo Farah", "sentences": ["The Ethiopian, who did not run in the Beijing Olympics due to concerns about the polluted air affecting his asthma, said he is targeting a marathon in either Dubai or Tokyo as his next race."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-30T13:11:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/sep/30/claims-five-placed-arc-outsiders", "tags": ["Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "In Derby week, I had a look at outsiders who had been placed in recent runnings of the race. It proved timely, as the pattern was of Aidan O&apos;Brien-trained front-runners getting a soft lead on fast ground and just keeping on to the line, as Treasure Beach did this year. So here&apos;s a similar exercise for the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe, to be run at Longchamp on Sunday. Below are the last five horses to make the first three at odds of 20-1 or bigger. The odds in question are taken from the result as recorded by the Racing Post and I believe they are the industry SPs issued by British bookmakers. Anyone betting on Sunday&apos;s race should remember, however, that you do have the alternative of taking the odds offered by the French Tote (the PMU) if that looks like being a better option. If you don&apos;t specify which odds you want, you&apos;ll be paid at the industry SP. At this stage, I&apos;m looking at Reliable Man as the best sort-of outsider, though he&apos;s only 12-1 and not certain to start until his trainer satisfies himself that the going is not too fast on the day. A case can be made for Hiruno D&apos;Amour at 14-1, while last year&apos;s runner-up, Nakayama Festa, is being overlooked at 33-1, which may eventually seem generous. Both Sarafina and So You Think are drawn wide, so there must be a chance of an upset on Sunday. Here are your most recent precedents for surprisingly placed runners. 1) Cherry Mix 33-1 Given that he was a three-year-old trained by Andr\u00e9 Fabre, it was probably not clever of us to let Cherry Mix start at such big odds. Fabre has won seven Arcs, six times with a three-year-old, and this grey came within half a length of being another when he chased home Bago in 2004. He was slow to show serious promise. An apprentice race at Fontainebleau was the only success in his first six starts but then he won a Listed at Vichy in July 2004 and followed up the next month in the Grand Prix de Deauville, beating two more-fancied stablemates. That was all that punters had to work with when he showed up at Longchamp, though at least he had won his last two. Those races had been on very soft surfaces, however, and it was no worse than good for the Arc. He ran his race just the same and looked the winner when going two lengths clear halfway up the home straight. But he was getting tired at that point and Bago&apos;s finishing effort was stronger. This doesn&apos;t look like a vintage renewal in hindsight, though that may annoy fans of the third-placed Ouija Board. Just behind her was a 100-1 shot from Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s yard, Acropolis, whose next win would be in a Wolverhampton seller for Tony Carroll more than six years later. Cherry Mix joined Godolphin the next year and became a bit disappointing, though he managed to win three Group Ones in Italy and Germany. 2) Sagara 33-1 Another French-trained three-year-old, Sagara was based with Jonathan Pease. Carrying the Niarchos colours, he won a maiden at Maisons-Laffitte on his first start in 2007. In light of his ability, it seems incredible that this proved to be his only success. There were clues to what might happen in the Arc when he tried the French Derby and then the Prix Niel, both times running on strongly after being held up in rear. In the Prix du Jockey Club, he still finished no better than seventh, though he was only four lengths behind Lawman. But in the Niel, he split Soldier Of Fortune and Zambezi Sun, who had started favourite. Three weeks later for the Arc, Soldier Of Fortune was 100-30, Zambezi Sun was 11-2 and Sagara was ignored at 33-1. Needless to say, he fared best of the three, again running on well after exaggerated waiting tactics. He got a dream run through the pack but it might have been expected that a hold-up horse would be suited by the Arc, which is normally run at a strong pace. This is one opportunity that punters really missed. 3) Youmzain 66-1 Youmzain, of course, is famous for having masses of talent and a low strike-rate. Specifically, he is known for finishing second in three consecutive Arcs and is the kind of horse who may leave his owners feeling equally cursed and blessed. In hindsight, his connections must regret not going for the 2006 Arc, when he was a three-year-old and highly progressive. After he won the Voltigeur, he ran Rail Link to half a length in the Niel and, since Rail Link won the Arc, Youmzain could surely have gone close. Instead, they redirected him to the Preis von Europa at Cologne, which he won. The following year, he cemented his identity by running third in the Dubai Sheema Classic (a \u00a3255,000 payday), third in the Tattersalls Gold Cup and second in the King George. But there were also a couple of disappointing efforts when he was fifth at Saint-Cloud and fourth at Baden-Baden. Those, rather than his several excellent efforts in defeat, must have been what we were thinking about when we let him go off at 66-1 for the Arc. Also, there is something off-putting about a horse who hardly ever wins, regardless of his talent level. But the Arc suits a lot of hold-up horses and it certainly suited Youmzain. He was finishing so fast at the end that he was only beaten by a head by Dylan Thomas. Anyone who backed him would have had an insight into how his connections felt; such a good, underestimated horse, determined to break your heart just when you thought the big day had finally come. 4) Youmzain 20-1 Mick Channon&apos;s best horse actually managed to win a proper Group One in 2008, the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud, which may explain why he was given a modicum of respect at 12-1 for that year&apos;s Arc. Still, another second place (behind Zarkava) was again more than the market expected of him. And so to 2009, when Youmzain continued to be Youmzain, finishing second or third in Group Ones in Britain, France and Germany, losing out by only a nose in the Coronation Cup. But once more, when the Arc came around, he was available at very healthy odds, 20-1 on this occasion. Then again, it was a lopsided market, with Sea The Stars odds-on and everything else at 6-1 or bigger. Surprise! He was second, staying on well without ever looking like winning. He was six years old but this was within a couple of pounds of his best performance, according to Racing Post ratings. Even at 20-1, he may not have been all that attractive each-way, considering he was so unlikely to actually stick his head in front. But anyone who did the forecast with Sea The Stars must have felt very clever indeed. 5) Nakayama Festa 25-1 My colleague Will Hayler covered himself in glory last year by tipping Nakayama Festa, though the words &quot;each-way&quot; or &quot;place only&quot; don&apos;t seem to appear in his article. A Grade One winner in Japan, Nakayama Festa had beaten Buena Vista, who had previously been second in the Dubai Sheema Classic. That by itself ought to have earned him plenty of respect, and he had a pleasing sighter over the course and distance when second in the Prix Foy three weeks before Arc day. It must be doubtful how many British punters were impressed that he was trained by Yoshitaka Ninomiya and ridden by Masayoshi Ebina. In fact, the pair knew what was required in the Arc, having been second with El Condor Pasa in 1999, Montjeu&apos;s year. It was one of the roughest Flat races I&apos;ve ever seen and Nakayama Festa was briefly hampered on the turn for home. He was still able to get involved in a scrap for the finish with Workforce and, under a stronger ride, may even have prevailed. I believe Mr Hayler is keen on another Japanese contender for this year&apos;s Arc. At some point, their chances will be so widely recognised that there is no value in backing them but we are not quite there yet, judging by the 25-1 about Nakayama Festa last year.", "title": "Claims Five: Outsiders who were placed in the Arc | Chris Cook", "sentences": ["The following year, he cemented his identity by running third in the Dubai Sheema Classic (a \u00a3255,000 payday), third in the Tattersalls Gold Cup and second in the King George.", "A Grade One winner in Japan, Nakayama Festa had beaten Buena Vista, who had previously been second in the Dubai Sheema Classic."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-30T14:55:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/30/carlos-tevez-prince-william-do-your-duty", "tags": ["Carlos Tevez", "Prince William", "The Duchess of Cambridge", "Monarchy", "UK news", "Prince Andrew", "Prince Charles", "Prince Philip", "The Queen"], "article": "This week a \u00a3250,000-a-week footballer called Carlos Tevez refused to get off his bench and play for Manchester City, preferring instead to sulk. In this, he resembles Prince William, who has confided an emotion to the Daily Mail&apos;s Robert Hardman. Hardman, who approaches such errands on his knees, was so busy decorating word trifles in the air he missed a scoop. When asked how he feels about becoming king of England, William said: &quot;I try not to think about it. As I&apos;m flying along in my helicopter through the mountains of Wales, I try desperately hard not to think about it. That can wait\u00a0until I&apos;m a bit older.&quot; (Prince William is 29). The self-pity, which he inherits from his father, who once threw a book at Paul Burrell, is grating. I would not choose a constitutional monarchy, because of the way it strokes the class system and sends its beneficiaries mad with rage and greed. You cannot place a hereditary monarchy with divine-right toys in a modern state and not expect chaos. It induces them to attempt to interfere in politics (Prince Charles), to chum up to dictators (Prince Andrew), to become dedicated racists (Prince Philip), or go into TV (Prince Edward). And that is only a precis; I haven&apos;t included the late Princess Margaret&apos;s habit of touching the TV at Balmoral to see if the servants had been watching, or Princess Michael of Kent&apos;s offer to pop to Dubai to open a supermarket for \u00a325,000 if someone bought her house, or the way other female royals fall into every trap laid by the fake sheikh, like imbecilic dominoes. The varying levels of psychosis and corruption within the royal family&apos;s brains is not in question here; any comprehensive and government-funded attempt at historical re-enactment usually ends in bedlam. (Look to Ultra-Orthodox Jewry for details). The best argument I have heard for a monarchy is that it keeps rightwing nutters in check. Tell a fascist, &quot;The Queen wouldn&apos;t like it,&quot; and they shut right down, perhaps recognising their own. But this is not a good enough argument to warp a liberal democracy for me, even if the increasingly weird antics of the caged animals makes the royal family ever more compulsive viewing, in the way that YouTube videos about cats falling over are compulsive viewing. But it is what we have. In April an Ipsos Mori poll revealed that 63% thought Britain would be worse off without the monarchy, but, in fairness, they think that about The X-Factor, too. So I would ask Prince William to be polite, or at least silent, a skill his competent, if fierce, grandmother has perfected. Look around, William \u2013 this is no time to fly your helicopter into the mist and bemoan your gilded fate. If you don&apos;t like it, you can, like Edward VIII, get off the stage, and spend the rest of your life demanding money for jewels and dog food. Only a sadist would hate you for it. In April, William married. I know this because knit-your-own-royal-wedding-kits were for sale and a blameless republican activist was arrested for &quot;anticipated breach of the peace&quot;, under cover of national joy. To date, his wife Catherine, whose clothing allowance will not be divulged by Clarence House \u2013 any detailed breakdown of the way that the Prince of Wales&apos;s enormous income from the Duchy of Cornwall is spent is &quot;private&quot; \u2013 has done very few official charitable engagements. Such is Catherine&apos;s laziness, I&apos;m beginning to see her job as being there to smell nice, and have lovely hair. Even as others scream \u2013 you can&apos;t be mean to someone so \u2013 what? Nice smelling? Over-projected on to? Rich? I never understand the pity of the populace for the very lucky; I am still amazed that Diana Spencer got a free bus ticket, and that was 30 years ago. I thought the saddest thing about the wedding was a children&apos;s book I found, where you could fill in a fake invitation. That is a metaphor for the British class system for five-year-olds. Learn young. This self-pity among royals seems new, because it is a cliche that the Queen works hard, even if her work is bizarre. To accompany the Hardman article, she was posing staring hard at a man standing on a table doing something to a candlestick; always uncomfortable in front of a camera, Her Majesty looked like Don Corleone in spectacles. It sprouted from the Princess Diana/Sarah Ferguson days, when they had colonic irrigation and moaned that their husbands were rubbish. (This is an argument for marrying royals only to\u00a0each other). I don&apos;t know where the self-pity comes from. George Osborne, by replacing the civil list with a sovereign support grant, tagged to the crown estate&apos;s revenues, has created a financial package that will make royal income recession-proof \u2013 it passed through the Commons this summer without a burp \u2013 and according to last accounts, Buckingham Palace ballroom has a new roof. I know this because the royal family has excellent press representation, and glossy brochures have been produced, in which even the\u00a0Duchess of Cornwall, who I am convinced has retractable fangs, is smiling. It is the press that upsets them, you say? The British media&apos;s treatment of the royal family teeters on the bad side of delusional mania; scream for an objective media if you will, but on 29 April, most of the British press should have been shot. So much on the dress, an expensive homage to blandness; nothing on the foreign royal monsters who were invited; absolutely nothing on the cost. Serial Hello! covers is not intrusion. It is fandom and it does nothing to expel the idea that the royals have the best working conditions in Britain. And, if they will sell access to each other (Sarah York, Sophie Wessex) slag off the Guardian to foreign businessmen (Prince Andrew) and get discovered performing weird sex acts (myriad others), surely they can only blame themselves? Should we spare pity for them, when they have none for us? A charming royal press officer directed me to Prince Charles&apos;s personal charitable donations last year. The figure was slightly less than he spent on stationery and office equipment; it is all there, in vegetable oil-based ink (what is that?). But if not the press, who else? The flag-wavers? Surely they cannot be\u00a0irritated by the sycophants? Perhaps, and they certainly have time for something \u2013 holidays mostly, and in the case of Prince Harry (and Prince William before he married Princess-stay-in-the-house) sitting in Kensington bars drinking Crack Babies. I always mention the Crack Baby cocktail when writing about the royal family because it was so shocking, and such an admission of ignorance, despite the expensive education. What do you do with a Crack Baby, if you are royal? You DRINK it! I yearn for them to do something interesting, or surprising, but they never do. Until now, with Prince William&apos;s tiny admission that he does not really want the job.

Supplemented into the race at the start of the week, she lead home a fillies&apos; 1-2-3 with Shareta and British hope Snow Fairy filling the minor places. The last German-trained Arc winner had been Star Appeal, ridden by Greville Starkey at odds of 119-1 in 1975, but there was no fluke about the 20-1 shot&apos;s victory. Fancied runners Sarafina, Galikova and Workforce, who met trouble at the start, never figured and Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s main runner, So You Think, ran on late into fourth spot. Ridden by Andrasch Starke, the Peter Schiergen-trained Danedream sprinted clear inside the final furlong to add to her two Group One victories in her homeland. Schiergen said: &quot;This is my best moment in racing. I don&apos;t believe it - she was such an easy winner. It&apos;s fantastic and she is the best horse I have trained. It&apos;s a great moment. She is a small filly with a big, big heart and there&apos;s no better race to win. I have trained some Group winners, but she is the greatest filly I have ever trained. She won her last two races very easily, but I didn&apos;t think she would be such an easy winner. This is a really big day for German racing.&quot; Starke said: &quot;It was a dream for me just to ride today in this race. I knew the filly could put up a great performance but there was a lot of competition in the race and good horses. In the last two furlongs she just gave me a great feeling and I was just dreaming. I don&apos;t know what has happened. It&apos;s a dream come true.&quot; Frankie Dettori said of his mount, Snow Fairy: &quot;She ran a super race. A furlong and a half out I thought we had a big chance but when the winner kicked that was that.&quot; Trainer Ed Dunlop added: &quot;I&apos;m very proud to be third in an Arc, it was a great run and she was the leading older horse in the race. It was probably the race of her life. We ran with a view to coming from off the pace and I was delighted with her effort. That was only her fourth run, so hopefully she&apos;ll go back to Japan for the race she won last year or maybe even the Japan Cup or Hong Kong. She stays in training next year.&quot; O&apos;Brien said of So You Think: &quot;I thought he ran very well. He was coming home very well and it was the first time he&apos;d run over that trip for us. He&apos;s a big cruiser and I think he would handle the dirt [Breeders&apos; Cup] no problem, but the boys will have to discuss it before we decide what to do next.&quot; So You Think&apos;s jockey Seamie Heffernan commented: &quot;He had a very wide draw, so you had to make an early decision, and I wanted to make sure there was something left at the finish. I thought it was a good run.&quot; 3pm Dream result for Simcock as Ahead denies Goldikova in Foret Tony Paley: David Simcock&apos;s Dream Ahead got up in the final stride to deny outstanding mare Goldikova in a thrilling Prix de la Foret at Longchamp. Winning rider William Buick said: &quot;David has trained this horse to perfection, it&apos;s not been easy the whole way through. There&apos;s no point saying David&apos;s a good trainer because everybody knows that already. Everything panned out today. I just wish Goldikova wasn&apos;t second because I&apos;m a big fan, but Dream Ahead was a worthy winner, the best horse won the race. I always said he&apos;d be better in a good race because when he gets to the front he does nothing. Today he went a head up and started hanging left.&quot; Winning owner Khalifa Dasmal said: &quot;To beat a horse like Goldikova is unbelievable and we&apos;d have been happy to have finished second. He&apos;s obviously a very good horse and he&apos;s proved it over several distances and on different types of ground. I&apos;ve sold part of him to Ballylinch Stud. I know it&apos;s a shame to retire him, but what would he do next year apart from winning the same races that he&apos;s already won.&quot; John O&apos;Connor, owner of the stud, said: &quot;He won&apos;t run next year and I&apos;d have thought this might be his last race, but we need to have a discussion and there&apos;s no rush to do that. He still has options like Hong Kong, and the Breeders&apos; Cup is not out of the question, but we need to have a re-group.&quot; Trainer Freddy Head said of Goldikova: &quot;I think the mileage is starting to catch up with her maybe, we will have to see.&quot; 2.45pm Dettori delivers landmark win on Dabirsim Tony Paley: Frankie Dettori recorded his 500th career Group-race winner as Dabirsim came from last to first to to win the Qatar Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere at Longchamp. Dettori said: &quot;It&apos;s unbelievable to ride 500 Group winners, it&apos;s an astonishing number so it&apos;s a big, big moment for me, and I&apos;ve been very lucky to ride some very good horses. He will definitely make a Guineas horse, without a doubt. He&apos;s a superstar. When the gap came he took it, he was electric. He&apos;s the best two-year-old I have ridden. He&apos;s got tremendous pace and a great finish.&quot; Trainer Christophe Ferland said: &quot;Frankie was playing with my nerves a bit. He was six or eight lengths behind at the furlong post, but he&apos;s got a lot of speed and he quickened well to get back into the race. We haven&apos;t decided about next year. He&apos;ll be entered in the French and English Guineas. He can run on a straight course or around a bend so it doesn&apos;t matter.&quot; 2.15pm Gosden and Buick have arresting day with Boussac victory Greg Wood: An interesting day for John Gosden and William Buick, who arrived at Longchamp sans their passports after they were arrested when their plane landed in France this morning. It seems that it had flown a little too close to a &quot;secret nuclear site&quot; and the gendarmes wanted to check that the occupants were not spies. &quot;We were met by two giggling gendarmes in a truck,&quot; Gosden said. &quot;They had been told by air traffic control, who must have been bored out of their minds, that the plane coming in had gone close to a secret nuclear site. Now you don&apos;t really have those on the coast between Brighton and Margate do you, it&apos;s the same sort of thing, but anyway we got into the truck and went down to the police station, and being good old English we surrendered our passports in order to get here. We&apos;re looking forward to trying to get them back. &quot;It was a real Welcome to France moment, but we use that airport all the time. The young men were giggling but they had to do it as air traffic control had told them to do it. They wanted to know if we were spies and had been taking pictures of this nuclear site. I said, &apos;do we look like we&apos;re from North Korea.&apos;&quot; The pair celebrated their freedom with victory for Elusive Kate in the Total Prix Marcel Boussac. Buick was happy to go to the front from the start and although she was hanging over to the other side of the track in the closing stages, it was not enough to stop her scoring decisively from Irish raider Fire Lily, with Zantenda only third. Gosden&apos;s wife Rachel Hood part-owns the horse and said: &quot;She&apos;s a beautiful filly and I&apos;m only sorry that our partners from America couldn&apos;t be here. It was unusual to see her drift, but she&apos;s only a baby and was trying to do her best.&quot; Gosden himself said: &quot;She&apos;s a pretty good filly. She ran right-handed at Deauville but she got confused in the downhill section [here)], the ground is a little quicker there. She changed her legs and ended up in the middle of the track. You shouldn&apos;t win from there and I thought the favourite should have won. She likes coming to France, so we&apos;ll come back here for the Guineas and she may go to Churchill Downs for the Breeders&apos; Cup.&quot; 1.10pm Trees fells Abbaye foes The great record of overseas raiders in the Qatar Prix de l&apos;Abbaye was preserved as Bryan Smart&apos;s Tangerine Trees made just about every yard of the running. Having blasted out of the stalls by Tom Eaves in the middle of the track, he had Mar Adentro for company until the final furlong. Jane Chapple-Hyam&apos;s Secret Asset and the Eddie Lynam-trained Sole Power flashed home for minor honours, but it was Beverley Bullet winner Tangerine Tress who held on for an outstanding triumph. The six-year-old had won at Newmarket on his first start of the season but flopped badly at Haydock and Ascot before bouncing back to form last time out, giving away weight to all of his rivals. Sent off at 14-1, Tangerine Trees became the ninth British-trained winner of the Abbaye in 10 years. Nunthorpe winner Margot Did never got involved under Jamie Spencer, while Prohibit found things happening too quickly. A delighted Eaves, registering his first Group One success, said: &quot;It&apos;s brilliant - I can&apos;t really believe it at the minute. &quot;He&apos;s progressed all the time and to win, that is just icing on the cake. I knew he was very quick but he got there very easily and I just tried to hang on to him for as long as I could and kick for home then. To win a first Group One is very special.&quot; Joint-owner Pat Barrell said: &quot;We hoped he&apos;d run very well but we&apos;re only small owners and it&apos;s an absolute thrill to come here - I can&apos;t explain it. He&apos;s a very, very fast horse and Tom gave him a marvellous ride.&quot; Chapple-Hyam said of runner-up Secret Asset: &quot;I&apos;m absolutely thrilled. He&apos;s run a colossal race. He might have been a massive price but at least we&apos;ve been competitive. I would think he will go to Dubai for the Carnival now.&quot; Keagan Latham, rider of Sole Power, said: &quot;As small as he is, he&apos;s as tough as nails and when I eventually got out he absolutely flew home.&quot; Lynam added: &quot;We were possibly a shade unlucky in running. This was supposed to be his last race of the year but after a run like that we&apos;ll have a think about it now.&quot;  PA 12.50pm Bliss for Doumen after Kadran victory Kasbah Bliss came with a withering late run under Gerald Mosse to claim the Qatar Prix du Cadran at Longchamp. The Francois Doumen-trained nine-year-old was last turning for home, but Mosse did not panic and got to work with a couple of furlongs to run. Doumen&apos;s veteran then made stealthy progress in the middle of the pack and quickened up to score readily once switched wide. Kasbah Bliss (7-2 joint-favourite) had finished in the frame in the last three renewals of the two-and-a-half-mile Group One, and was sent off favourite to win a World Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival two years ago. He disappointed in the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot earlier in the season but was back to his brilliant best in his homeland, easing to a comfortable victory over Tres Rock Danon and Ley Hunter. Mosse said: &quot;I had plenty of horse under me and had a lovely run from behind. When I came through he showed a lot of power. I&apos;ve ridden him before and know he has a nice turn of foot. He won very well.&quot; Doumen added: &quot;Running over hurdles taught him to breath properly, and that made him stronger and able to run in Group One races likes this. He has kept the knack of wanting to win and come through the others. When he can get through, that is when he is at his best. He won easily. Mosse said to me after the race he didn&apos;t think he&apos;d win that easily. He said when he brought him through he just went. &quot;It reminds me of The Fellow in the Gold Cup at Cheltenham. He had to run in the race a few times before he won it. It&apos;s the same sort of feeling. I hope to get invited back to Hong Kong as he ran a brilliant race in the Vase there two years ago over a mile and a half. He&apos;s still got that turn of foot. He won&apos;t be going jumping again.&quot; PA Today&apos;s best bets, by Greg Wood It is another blistering day here in Paris with the kind of temperature promised that, in August, sends the locals scurrying to the coast. For this one afternoon of the year, though, they will head to the Bois de Bolougne instead, and Longchamp will have a proper crowd in the stands for the first time since Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe day in 2010. The identity of the horse that they will send off as favourite for the big race this afternoon is still in doubt, with Sarafina and So You Think both looking like credible candidates to head the market. There is no news either about Reliable Man (3.15), which is good news for his supporters as it means that he is still in the race. I&apos;ve thought that he looked the likely Arc winner since the Prix Niel here three weeks ago and assuming that Alain de Royer-Dupre feels that he will act on the ground and lets him take his chance, I can see no reason to abandon him now. In fact, the uncertainty over his participation seems to have worked its way into his price, and Reliable Man&apos;s current odds of around 12-1 are simply too big for a lightly raced Niel winner. One other runner worth a saver is Danedream, a German-trained three-year-old filly who has made her way into the field almost unnoticed, despite having won Group One events on her last two starts by a combined total of 11 lengths. She has a good draw in two, and is a decent each-way price at 25-1. Racing will be underway soon, with the improving Ley Hunter (12.10) the pick in the Prix du Cadran, while Wizz Kid (12.45) has a big chance in the Prix de l&apos;Abbaye. Dabirsim (1.55) is an obvious pick in the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere, while the extraordinary Goldikova (2.30) should take the Prix de la Foret on her final start in France.", "title": "Talking Horses: Best bets and the latest Arc news in our daily horse racing blog", "sentences": ["I would think he will go to Dubai for the Carnival now.&quot; Keagan Latham, rider of Sole Power, said: &quot;As small as he is, he&apos;s as tough as nails and when I eventually got out he absolutely flew home.&quot; Lynam added: &quot;We were possibly a shade unlucky in running."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-02T10:36:38Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/05/rumours-rio-ferdinand-chicago-tottenham", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "US sports", "Chicago Fire"], "article": "&quot;We always enjoy going over to play in America.

And talking of players who are surely too good and too successful to go somewhere like that, according to the Sun Doncaster Rovers are planning a loan swoop for Real Madrid midfield ace Lassana Diarra. Dean Saunders also has a more realistic target in mind, in the shape of Newcastle&apos;s Dan Gosling.

One player already on loan in the Championship \u2013 Blackburn&apos;s Keith Andrews, currently excelling at Ipswich \u2013 has played himself into a possible January transfer to Swansea or Wigan, who also like the look of Bristol City&apos;s Albert Adomah. The Dundee United starlet Scott Allan is the subject of a three-way Premier League gentle-pull-o-war, with Manchester United, Newcastle and now West Bromwich Albion all monitoring the 19-year-old midfielder, whose contract expires next summer. Equally teenaged and no less coveted is Leicester&apos;s versatile 18-year-old Jeffrey Schlupp, a target for Newcastle, Stoke and Liverpool. Blackburn are primed to swoop for former Aston Villa boss Martin O&apos;Neill should Steve Kean fail to turn around the club&apos;s fortunes. Talking of Villa, Stiliyan Petrov genuinely reckons that Gabriel Agbonlahor is as good as Cristiano Ronaldo: &quot;People talk about Ronaldo but when you look at the assets of Gabby, you can put him in the same bracket.&quot; And current Villa gaffer Alex McLeish wants OFK Beograd&apos;s 21-year-old striker Nemanja Milic, whose contract also expires next summer.

Pakistan&apos;s former captain Salman Butt, along with Mohammad Asif, the former No 2 in cricket&apos;s bowling world rankings, and Mohammad Amir, the teenager who was the quickest player in cricket history to take 50 Test wickets, were said to have conducted a betting conspiracy that was &quot;a betrayal of the sport of cricket itself&quot;. The prosecution at Southwark crown court cited telephone and text message records that appear to show a good deal of traffic between the three players, a players&apos; agent and unknown figures in India and Dubai whose involvement was described as sinister. Like the three players, the south London-based agent Mazhar Majeed denies charges of accepting corrupt payments and of cheating at cricket. Asif and Butt were in court and the jury was informed that there was &quot;nothing sinister&quot; in the absences of Majeed and Amir. They are accused of arranging three no balls to be bowled at pre-agreed times during the Test match in August last year. Aftab Jafferjee QC said there were &quot;simply breathtaking&quot; sums of money involved in foreign betting markets, with an estimated $40bn to $50bn spent in the Indian sub-continent in one year alone. Jafferjee, prosecuting, said: &quot;By the time the last Test match at Lord&apos;s took place, each of them were well at it \u2013 the two bowlers being orchestrated by their captain, and the captain&apos;s agent, Majeed, to bowl three no balls at a pre-arranged point in the game. The bowlers were willing participants so that they could all profit \u2013 those lower down the ladder probably profiting less than those at the top. &quot;Their activity represents a betrayal by them of their own team, their own board of cricket, and most damaging of all a betrayal of the sport of cricket itself \u2013 and all for greed.&quot; The case came to light after an undercover journalist for the News of the World made recordings of conversations with Majeed, in which the agent boasted he could arrange so-called &quot;spot fixes&quot; for betting purposes. The court heard what the prosecution described as a &quot;depressing tale of rampant corruption&quot; that provided a menu of events open to be fixed if the price was right. According to the prosecution, even fixing the result of a Test match would not be out of the question for Majeed, who boasted he &quot;already&quot; had six players who would be willing participants in the plot. &quot;I&apos;ve got six first team guys \u2014 all proper players,&quot; Majeed is alleged to have said. &quot;We are not going to do &apos;results&apos; for the next two games because we want Butt to be captain, long term.&quot; A fixed Test, the prosecution alleges, would ultimately have cost \u00a31m. The jury saw photographs of the moment the journalist, posing as a businessman seeking to set up a cricket tournament, handed Majeed \u00a310,000 allegedly in return for a player bowling a no ball. This Jafferjee described as &quot;a &apos;tester&apos; of proof in Majeed&apos;s ability to arrange for [no balls] to happen.&quot; Later, said the prosecution, Majeed demanded a \u00a3150,000 deposit, saying: &quot;That is for your trust. For me to pay my six boys, and to say we are working for a new party \u2026 and they give me the authority. After that, I can give you every result.&quot; Asif will say it was &quot;chance&quot; that he bowled a no ball at the appointed time, Butt that this no ball and the two bowled by Amir were a set of &quot;freakish occurrences&quot;.

With England facing France again, we&apos;re reminded of this bizarre good luck message filmed by country legend Kenny Rogers ahead of the 2007 semi-final between the sides: &quot;Now that&apos;s a fight song for ya \u2026 if you guys can&apos;t beat those French bastards, then this is a waste of time.&quot; Hell yeah!

Some fond memories: providing the support to Ian Botham&apos;s famous knock, while also taking a vital catch to remove Rod Marsh at Headingley in 1981; ripping through West Indies in the 1986-87 World Series Cup; and this: Lillee c Willey b Dilley. 4) With Valencia on the attack against Granada, Sergio Canales runs on to a pass and is promptly taken out by a two-footed lunge from referee Eduardo Gonzalez. Declining to send himself off or even give himself a stern talking-to, the contrite official instead apologises to the Valencia midfielder, who sees the funny side. 5) It&apos;s the Super League Grand Final on Saturday after utterly immense semis between St Helens and Wigan and Leeds and Warrington. Saints lost to the Rhinos in the 2007, 2008 and 2009 showpieces and are out for their first triumph since a belter against Bradford in 2002.

Unsurprisingly, homophobia, or at least a strong perception of it, still lingers. According to recent research by the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender legal group Interlaw, 70% of LGBT lawyers believe there is prejudice within the selection process for judicial office. The judicial appointments committee (JAC) \u2013 the body founded in 2006 to enhance judicial accountability \u2013 is keen to remedy this. Last month, it began monitoring the sexuality of wannabe judges (it already monitors gender, ethnicity, age, professional background and disability). The JAC is also increasing its engagement with the gay lawyer community through talks at LGBT legal events and the publishing of case studies of gay judges. The most recent of these talks took place at Interlaw&apos;s monthly September meeting, hosted by corporate law firm Field Fisher Waterhouse. Disappointingly, the JAC was unable to get any of the few openly gay judges \u2013 who include the court of appeal judge Sir Terence Etherton, the high court and international criminal court judge Sir Adrian Fulford and the circuit judge Jeremy Richardson \u2013 to come along and speak. Instead Tan Ikram, a heterosexual district judge, shared his experiences of what it&apos;s like to hold a judicial post as a member of a minority group. Ikram&apos;s frank talk was useful in the respect that it demystified the judicial appointments process, but the attempt to conflate the obstacles facing judicial candidates from Asian backgrounds with those who are gay was perhaps not entirely successful. Not that the 30 or so attendees seemed overly bothered. There may be widespread suspicion about the judicial selection process, and eye-rolling about the JAC&apos;s stuttering response, but the dominant mood among LGBT lawyers right now is optimism. Daniel Winterfeldt, a partner at CMS Cameron McKenna who founded Interlaw in 2008, said:  &quot;A new generation of junior lawyers who are out and open about their sexuality, and expect it not to be an issue, have fundamentally changed attitudes, and will keep changing them as they rise through the profession.&quot;  The mood is reflected in the dramatically improved recent performance of law firms in the top 100 employers rankings compiled by the gay rights charity Stonewall \u2013 formulated on the basis of a 25-question workplace equality index. In 2007 no law firms made the list; this year six were ranked. Still, law firms remain some way from being gay utopias. A potent undercurrent of unspoken homophobia exists at some of them \u2013 a problem illustrated by a handful of online comments made in response to an article last year advising young gay lawyers on how to come out at work. One read:  &quot;I&apos;m sorry but all of the gay men I have known \u2026 have been heavily into gay pornography, substance abuse and late night sexual encounters \u2026 I would exercise more scrutiny when deciding to hire a gay man just as I would someone with known addiction problems.&quot;  It&apos;s little wonder, then, that law graduate Adam Fellows, who is openly gay, was advised by a junior barrister not to publicly mention the fact he had a boyfriend during his hunt for a traineeship. Another concern is how international corporate law firms increasingly apply anti-discrimination policies in their offices in countries where homophobia is the norm. Prominent gay City lawyers I spoke to were notably reluctant to be quoted on this thorny issue. &quot;The &apos;What happens in Dubai?&apos; question isn&apos;t something the big firms seem to like to focus on,&quot; said Andrea Woelke, a lawyer specialising in family law who heads the other main legal LGBT group, the Lesbian and Gay Lawyers Association (LAGLA). Then there is the frequently bemoaned dominance of legal LGBT groups by a certain type of confident gay man. Just 30% of LAGLA&apos;s members are female. The majority of the attendees at September&apos;s Interlaw-JAC event were men, with most of the sprinkling of women, somewhat surprisingly, of straight sexual orientation. There was a similar demographic at a recent Interlaw &quot;pop-up&quot; charity club night in Soho, London, featuring several celebrity guests from the world of music, which I also attended. One gay male lawyer I met there told me this was because &quot;lesbians are a bit dowdy&quot;. This sort of attitude has led to suggestions that LGBT groups have lost some of their original spirit of mutual support. &quot;It&apos;s not unusual for LGBT to be dominated by gay men. There is always a danger that a professional networking event can become a dating agency,&quot; said Kevin Poulter, who recently helped found the specialist Gay Employment Lawyers Network. But overall, in view of the huge strides made in recent years, it seems unfair to dwell too long on these negatives. And in fairness to the LGBT groups, they tend to be highly responsive to criticism. Interlaw, for example, has established a women&apos;s initiative, which holds quarterly meetings, organised a series of forthcoming events for transgender lawyers and is &quot;seeking to make resources available&quot; for LGBT lawyers employed by UK firms based in countries with homophobic laws. It can only be a matter of time before the judicial appointments process catches up with this trend.

The company, whose projects include providing support services to developments in Dubai as well as building and maintaining schools, roads and railways in Britain, has already been hit hard by cutbacks in the public sector. In June it announced it had negotiated its exit from a number of long-term contracts, which would lead to lower than expected profits from the deals, but this would be offset by a one-off gain from one of the contracts. On Thursday it revealed that due to &quot;an actuarial error&quot; the one-off gain will be \u00a34.3m less than expected, which will have an impact on this year&apos;s profits. Analysts said they believed the problem related to the size of a pension liability that had been taken off the company&apos;s books as part of the contract settlement. Finance director Rod Harris \u2013 who only took up his job in June \u2013 has decided to increase provisions against contract risks and project claims, by another \u00a34m or so. Chief executive Richard Cuthbert has resigned with immediate effect, although he will stay for a short while to &quot;ensure an orderly handover&quot;. The news sent the company&apos;s shares down by more than a third, to 20.5p.

A year earlier it had received a 290p a share bid from VT Group, although this fell through when VT was taken over by Babcock. Following a refinancing, Mouchel has bank facilities of \u00a3170m but it is supposed to make a voluntary repayment of \u00a330m by the end of May 2012. At the end of July its net debt stood at \u00a3879m, compared to its current market capitalisation of \u00a323m. Analyst David Brockton at Espirito Santo said: &quot;The reassessment of contract risk raises further questions with regards to internal controls and, crucially, does not bode well for prospective debt reduction. The negative consequences of [this latest] statement and management change will also act as a further setback as the group tries to build its business process outsourcing capability and deliver a wider business turnaround.&quot; Andy Brown at Panmure Gordon said: &quot;As harsh as it sounds, management change may be the only catalyst to get the share price moving up. The group has attracted enough external interest in the last few years with four &apos;bid approaches&apos; but nothing has transpired.&quot;", "title": "Mouchel chief executive quits after discovery of \u00a34.3m accounting error", "sentences": ["The company, whose projects include providing support services to developments in Dubai as well as building and maintaining schools, roads and railways in Britain, has already been hit hard by cutbacks in the public sector."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-06T18:18:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/06/afghanistan-folly-expense", "tags": ["Afghanistan", "US foreign policy", "India", "Pakistan", "World news", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "Politics", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "Ten years of western occupation of Afghanistan led the UN this week to plead that half the country&apos;s drought-ridden provinces face winter starvation. The World Food Programme calls for \u00a392m to be urgently dispatched. This is incredible. Afghanistan is the world&apos;s greatest recipient of aid, some $20bn in the past decade, plus a hundred times more in military spending. So much cash pours through its doors that $3m a day is said to leave Kabul airport corruptly to buy property in Dubai. Everything about Afghanistan beggars belief. This week its leader, Hamid Karzai, brazenly signed a military agreement with India, knowing it would enrage his neighbour, Pakistan, and knowing it would increase the assault on his capital by the Haqqani network, reported clients of Islamabad&apos;s ISI intelligence agency. Meanwhile, in Washington, the Pentagon is exulting over its new strategy of drone killing, claiming this aerial &quot;counter-terrorism&quot; can replace the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; counter-insurgency. Down in Helmand, visiting British journalists gather to recite the defence ministry&apos;s tired catechism: &quot;We are making real progress on the ground.&quot; The opening decade of the 21st century has been marked by two epic failures by the western powers that so recently claimed victory in the cold war; failures of both intellect and leadership. One is the inability to use the limitless resources of modern government to rescue the west&apos;s economy from prolonged recession. The other is the use of an attack on America by a crazed Islamist criminal as an excuse for a retaliatory war embracing a wide swath of the Muslim world. The decade-long punishment of Afghanistan for harbouring Osama bin Laden has been an act of biblical retribution. The demand that it also abandons the habits of history and adopt democracy, capitalism and gender equality was imperial arrogance. What happened in Afghanistan in the autumn of 2001 has spawned an industry of hindsight, with over a hundred titles of wisdom after the event. We learn of the post-9/11 arguments within the Taliban, many of them old CIA allies. We learn of the possible role of Abdul Haq in Kabul, of Pakistan&apos;s intelligence double-dealing, and of the Kandahar jirga of October 2001 which came close to evicting Osama bin Laden. Yet every counsel of caution in dealing with Afghanistan was disregarded in America&apos;s rush for vengeance \u2013 even the warning of Donald Rumsfeld that America &quot;had no dog in the Afghan fight&quot; and should avoid nation-building after a punitive raid. A great surge of imperial eagerness seemed to overwhelm Washington, London and Nato, as if the whole of western liberalism were craving a role in the world. The occupation of Afghanistan has been a catalogue of unrelieved folly. America is spending staggering sums on the war, which it is clearly not winning. Congressional studies show virtually no US aid reaches the local economy, most remaining with contractors in the US or going on security or being stolen. Local democracy has failed, as warlords feud with drug lords and tribal vendettas resurface. The &quot;training of the Afghan police and army&quot; has become a dope-befuddled joke. Britain&apos;s part in this has been dire. The thesis that Whitehall and its NGOs could somehow end Afghan corruption was absurd. Clare Short&apos;s mission in 2002 to &quot;eradicate the poppy crop&quot; and Kim Howells&apos; spending of \u00a3270m &quot;defeating the drugs trade&quot; were beyond satire. I still have before me John Reid&apos;s briefing as gung-ho defence secretary in 2006, that Britain&apos;s job was &quot;to build a prosperous, democratic, stable and secure Afghanistan&quot;, with British troops &quot;not waging war but helping to rebuild&quot;. I recall General Sir David Richards at the time assuring me it would all be over soon in Helmand thanks to his &quot;inkspots&quot; strategy. The conclusion drawn in Frank Ledwidge&apos;s book, Losing Small Wars, is that the performance of Britain&apos;s 16 Air Assault Brigade in Helmand was &quot;nothing short of disastrous \u2026 leaving a legacy of destroyed towns, refugees and civilian casualties&quot;. Whitehall&apos;s compensation payments to Afghan civilians killed and injured by its troops are doubling each year. Three hundred and eighty-two British soldiers have died in this war. Can any minister look their families in the eye and claim the loss was worth it? Worth what? Except in garrisoned towns, security in Afghanistan is as bad as ever. British soldiers have been told that they are being withdrawn over the next two years. Since they cannot pretend to have achieved their mission, it makes no sense to leave them in harm&apos;s way a moment longer. The policy now is to &quot;talk to the Taliban&quot;, as if it were the German high command on Luneburg Heath. All that is happening is that Karzai&apos;s emissaries and Taliban chiefs are seduced into &quot;talks&quot;, and then murdered either by their own side or by America&apos;s trigger-happy drones. Five of Karzai&apos;s negotiators have already been killed, including his brother. The drones are removing one Taliban or al-Qaida leader after another. While it is hard to feel sorry for them, the wrecking of any hierarchy of control replaces a path to peace with renewed vendetta. American policy has\u00a0turned the tiny cell of Bin Laden&apos;s al-Qaida into a global terrorist brand. What is strange, as Barbara Tuchman wrote, is not the folly of policy as such but its immunity to correction even when known to be folly. Any visitor to Kabul soon learns two things. First that it is senseless to confuse Pashtun nationalism with Taliban insurgency, and that with al-Qaida terrorism. Second, if Nato wants to eradicate a security threat in this part of the world, some accommodation must be made with the mujahideen or, as the Russians found, they will simply win. Accommodation, that is, with their Pakistan sponsors. The only key that unlocks this door is the departure of Nato troops. As during Vietnam, some wars pass the stage where politicians and generals dare step back and look. Pride, a craving for glory, an aversion to defeat, above all, the institutionalising of the war in its surrounding territory, come to drive strategy. Kabul is occupied by tens of thousands of soldiers, diplomats, NGO officials and contractors. Afghanistan has become a stew of the military/industrial complex, with aid mixed in. American estimates from Brown University are that some $3.7 trillion will have been spent avenging the 9/11 deaths. Britain&apos;s contribution to this stupefying sum is \u00a318.8bn. Whether this spending has prevented another terror attack, whether that would be value for money, or whether the whole venture has been little more than a cruel exercise in vanity, machismo and greed can never be answered, though Bin Laden himself was dealt with quite cheaply. All we know for sure is that revenge has not been sweet, just very expensive. The irony of this great folly is that its chief beneficiaries are likely to be those who lost the cold war, Russia and China. As the west&apos;s leaders struggle to rescue embattled armies and embattled economies from morasses of their own creation, they have left their old foes laughing with glee. Democracy has snatched defeat from the arms of victory \u2013 without a shred of a reason.", "title": "Vanity, machismo and greed have blinded us to the folly of Afghanistan | Simon Jenkins", "sentences": ["So much cash pours through its doors that $3m a day is said to leave Kabul airport corruptly to buy property in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-06T19:30:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/06/huaxi-village-tower-china", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Architecture", "Art and design", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "     An incongruous new sight\u00a0has risen up in the countryside of eastern China: a skyscraper taller than any building in London or Tokyo, topped by what looks very much like a giant, golden disco ball. The 328-metre supertower, which juts out of the Jiangsu plains like a trophy on an empty shelf, will be opened on Saturday by the village of Huaxi, a communist model community with a registered population of just 2,000 &quot;farmers&quot;. Having been built up to the heavens during a period of global economic collapse, the megatower will be heralded as the latest symbol of China&apos;s extraordinary economic expansion. But this bizarre new addition to the landscape also speaks volumes about the land pressures, environmental stress, inequality and rash investment that threaten the country&apos;s long-term growth. The skyscraper will primarily be used as a gourmet dining hall and luxury hotel. Though many of those who live in its shadow earn less than \u00a310 a day, there is no attempt to hide the wealth gap. From a gold leaf-covered reception to a 60th floor inlaid with genuine flakes of gold, the building exudes wealth and excess. Its\u00a0proudest feature is a one-tonne, solid gold statue of an\u00a0ox, said to be worth 300m yuan (\u00a331m). The mega-statistics do not stop there. With 826 bedrooms and dining facilities for 5,000 guests \u2013 including southern China&apos;s biggest banquet hall \u2013 there is almost enough space to accommodate and feed all of\u00a0the original village residents at a\u00a0single sitting. It is the brainchild of Wu Renbao, the driving force behind Huaxi&apos;s 40-year transition from a small village to a multibillion-dollar conglomerate with interests in steel, shipping, tobacco and textiles. By turns a communist dictator, capitalist entrepreneur and self-help guru, the 84-year-old is\u00a0among China&apos;s most colourful characters. He is praised for turning Huaxi into one of the richest villages in China and enriching the original residents with annual shares, dividends and free overseas trips. He is also criticised for turning the community into a family fiefdom, in which workers get no holidays and his relatives get the best posts. He has created a hierarchy largely determined by closeness to the Wu clan. Those from the original 2,000 Huaxi families are at the top of the pyramid. Next come the 35,000 residents from neighbouring villages that have been swallowed up by Huaxi&apos;s expansion. At the bottom are 20,000 newly arrived migrants, who provide labour for the factories on 12-hour shifts without weekend breaks. The monthly salaries of 3,000 yuan (\u00a3310) are better than average for low-skilled labour in China, but it is hardly a worker&apos;s paradise. Wu is undoubtedly Huaxi&apos;s greatest draw. Coachloads of visitors \u2013 mostly cadres and retirees \u2013 turn up to listen to the 10.30am lecture he delivers every day in a village auditorium that has been decked out to resemble the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. His close connections to the central government ensure supportive policies \u2013 for example, planning permission to build a 72-storey skyscraper in an area where the next-biggest building in less than 20 floors tall. Wu says he looked to the mega-cities of the Middle East for inspiration. &quot;This tower is my idea,&quot; the patriarch says in such a thick local accent that the\u00a0interpreter needs an interpreter. &quot;We learned from Dubai, but taking into account our domestic situation, we decided the height should be 328m. Why 328m? Because that is as tall as the highest building in Beijing.&quot; Chinese culture loads numbers with significance: 32 is associated with business and eight represents prosperity. As village officials also proudly note\u00a0in the invitation to the opening ceremony: &quot;There are 209 countries that lack such a tall building.&quot; That includes the UK. Even the Shard London Bridge \u2013 which will be the tallest building in the EU when it is completed next year \u2013 is 18m shorter than Huaxi&apos;s new\u00a0village centre. Even for those used to the speed and scale of change in China, this is astonishing. The last time I visited Huaxi in 2005, it was building a cluster of giant pagodas, which then appeared outlandishly large compared to everything else in the village. Today, those same pagodas barely register in comparison to the supertower beside them, which pulsates in all the colours of the rainbow when night falls. It is a tacky but\u00a0impressive reminder of how far the village has come since the Mao era. That message is reinforced at the village museum, where old propaganda footage shows farmers breaking rocks, labouring in the fields and living in small, unfurnished homes. It is also evident in the small park, which preserves Wu&apos;s first factory, a whitewashed, single-storey building. &quot;We used to have a very difficult life. We lived in a thatched shed, ate bran and had nothing in our pockets,&quot; recalls Wu, whose message can be distilled to a drive for GDP growth. &quot;I think it will never be wrong to expand the economy and make ordinary people rich. In our opinion, that is the priority.&quot; This approach has worked for decades and never more so than during the past seven years, when Huaxi&apos;s sales have increased fivefold. But the skyscraper is a towering indicator that business as usual is no longer working. The 3.5bn yuan (\u00a3360m) investment is designed to attract tourists and new business to Huaxi as it attempts the leap from dirty industrial centre to an ecologically friendly service sector economy. In making the transition from third-world village to first-world skyscraper, Huaxi is in many ways a microcosm of China. But the next step will be harder as it tries to cope with the declining competitiveness of its core industry, the inflated cost of land and worries about the environment. In this case, an even wider comparison can be drawn: like the global economy, Huaxi may be bumping up against limits to growth.     A solid-gold statue of an ox in the tower at Huaxi. Photograph: Jonathan Watts for the Guardian    Until recently, the village earned half of its income from the iron and steel industry. But today, this has fallen to less than a third. This collapse is due to rising material costs, the expansion of rival firms and falling demand both overseas and in China. &quot;This is the worst situation I have experienced,&quot; says Yang Yongchang, who has been general manager of the Jiangyin Huaxi Iron and Steel Company for eight years. &quot;It will get worse in the future. People in this industry are panicking.&quot; He says Huaxi is planning to move the factory so it can reinvent itself as a tourist resort and commodities-trading hub. &quot;We&apos;re trying to build an ecological village that looks like a forest garden,&quot; he says. The costs of fast, dirty, old-style economic growth can no longer be ignored. Wu Yunfang, the head of environmental affairs in the local communist party, says the village has recently shut down five chemical and textile factories that once used to discharge pollutants into the local Changjiagang river. She estimates the value of the lost production at 150m yuan (\u00a315m), which adds up to a significant environment bill along with the 350m yuan (\u00a336m) spent on emissions scrubbing and wastewater treatment. Territorial expansion is also becoming more expensive. In the past two decades, Huaxi swallowed 12 neighbouring villages as its industry and influence sprawled outwards. It is not officially a merger. The official terminology is that the villages are &quot;united under Huaxi&quot;, but the reality is far more like a corporate takeover. Huaxi paid an annual fee to the surrounding villages and in return it gained control of economic management, land use decisions, labour issues and political appointments. The loss of independence is worthwhile, according to Zhang Zhongxian, the former head of Xixiang village, who is now working for Huaxi&apos;s labour federation. Since his community was subsumed by Huaxi in 2002, Zhang estimates that average annual incomes have more than tripled, welfare for the elderly and disabled has improved and\u00a0homes and roads have been upgraded. &quot;In five to 10 years, we will be where Huaxi is now,&quot; Zhang says. &quot;Many other villagers want to join. Even some from other provinces.&quot; But land costs have risen dramatically. Huaxi&apos;s village chief, Wu Xie&apos;en \u2013 the son of Wu Renbao \u2013 said this was a major factor in the decision to build the tower, which has been dubbed &quot;a village in the air&quot;. &quot;With the completion of this building, we can save a vast expanse of land. In China, the trend now is to build tall because the more the economy develops, the more space is needed. Where is the space for China in the future? We must look to the sky.&quot; The party secretary says he wants to turn the &quot;city village&quot; of Huaxi into a Shangri-la. &quot;My father made people rich. Now I want to make them healthy and happy,&quot; he says. The tower seems an odd way to do this. But the Wus argue that they have succeeded over the years by anticipating changes in the economic wind and gambling big on the outcome. They are trying again this time. Just in case, the outside world fails to notice, Huaxi has invited the international media to the village&apos;s 50th anniversary celebration on Saturday, when its skyscraper will be officially unveiled. To give visitors a\u00a0better view, villagers have started a helicopter business \u2013 a first step in a planned expansion into commercial aviation and high-end tourism. If anywhere in China can find new areas of economic expansion it is Huaxi. But even with the political connections and business nous, it is hard to imagine that the village will reinvent itself as a tourist centre \u2013 particularly given the advanced age of the\u00a0retired party secretary who is its main attraction. But Huaxi has proved its doubters wrong in the past. Ahead of the opening of their new skyscraper, the mood on the streets was optimistic. In the evening, locals, neighbours and migrants gather to dance on the village square, a huge expanse of concrete between 15-storey pagodas that pulsate pink, blue, green and yellow. One migrant labourer from the steel factory, who declined to give his name, said the\u00a0tower would help the economy and create new opportunities. &quot;Nobody would invest so much money in something that wasn&apos;t sure to be a\u00a0success, right?&quot; Additional reporting by Cecily Huang.", "title": "Huaxi: the village that towers above China", "sentences": ["&quot;We learned from Dubai, but taking into account our domestic situation, we decided the height should be 328m."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-06T20:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/06/afghanistan-time-running-out-peaceful-resolve", "tags": ["Afghanistan", "World news", "Taliban", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "Ten years ago, as the first American bombs fell on Afghanistan, a Pashtun tribal leader slipped across the Pakistani border riding a motorbike. He wore a loosely tied turban, was accompanied by three companions and carried a CIA-donated satellite phone. His name was Hamid Karzai. US-backed militias were sweeping towards Kabul from the north; Karzai&apos;s job was to help rout the Taliban in the south. Using his CIA phone he called in a team of US special forces soldiers, who swooped in by helicopter with weapons for another 300 fighters. Together, they pushed towards the Taliban&apos;s spiritual home of Kandahar. Victory was at hand. But first, a momentous meeting. On the morning of 5 December, Karzai received a Taliban delegation in Shah Wali Kot, 20 miles north of Kandahar. Things were moving fast. Hours earlier, Afghan tribal elders gathered in Bonn, Germany, had anointed Karzai as the country&apos;s interim leader; the UN signed off on the arrangement. In Kandahar, the reclusive Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar dispatched his second in command and defence minister, Mullah Obaidullah, to meet Karzai. Recognising defeat, the Taliban wanted to talk peace: a formal surrender, the transfer of vehicles and weapons, an end to fighting in Kandahar, all in return for assurances their leaders could be able to return to their villages. That night Obaidullah sent bread for Karzai, in a gesture of conciliation. In retrospect, it was a tantalising opportunity for a smooth post-Taliban transition and, perhaps, a novel political dispensation. But it wasn&apos;t to be. Furious after the 9/11 attacks, the US war machine pursued the Taliban hard. Karzai, the new leader, acquiesced. And the Taliban leadership slunk across the border into Pakistan to lick their wounds and plan the resurgence that is racking the country today. The exact circumstances of that meeting are still debated among historians. But the irony is lost on few that, today, President Karzai wants to get back into that room with the bearded Talibs in Shah Wali Kot. After 10 years of steadily rising conflict and with the prospect of a major American withdrawal by the end of 2014, Karzai knows that his political future \u2013 and perhaps that of his country \u2013 could hinge on a negotiated settlement to the conflict. The question is whether there&apos;s enough time left to achieve it. The headlines of the past decade in Afghanistan have been written in blood \u2013 about 17,000 civilians and 2,750 foreign soldiers killed, countless suicide bombings and, in recent years, guerrilla spectaculars such as the recent 20-hour assault on the US embassy. But if war has dominated the news, the greatest failings have been political. At first, it seemed anything was possible. As the Talibs fled in late 2001, reporters filed stories about jubilant women casting off their burqas; kites, banned under the Taliban, fluttered in the skies. Then came more substantial gestures: promises of money, development and democracy. That mood of hope peaked in 2004, with the first presidential poll. Some 70% of voters participated and Karzai scooped a 55% majority, with support from every ethnic group. Designer Tom Ford hailed him as the &quot;chicest man on the planet&quot; for his flowing cape and wool\u00a0hat. An airy sense of confidence gripped Kabul, which expressed itself in small ways \u2013 young lovers who defied convention and eloped in &quot;love marriages&quot;; palatial wedding halls modelled on mirrored-glass skyscrapers from Dubai; flourishing body-building and sports clubs. On the edge of the city, I visited the Kabul golf club, which had shut under the Taliban, now open after the putting greens had been swept for mines. The course pro, recently returned from exile, told me the Taliban had flogged him with a steel cable. Now a gentrified warlord was financing the renovations. &quot;Attack the course,&quot; urged the scorecard. The joke was not seen as bad taste. The Taliban insurgency was distant, largely confined to the southern provinces, more nuisance than serious threat. A Swiss Red Cross worker had been killed in Kandahar in March 2003, but western military officials had started to speak of the Taliban as a declining force. At Bagram airbase, north of Kabul, American soldiers took pedicures and massages in a beauty parlour. &quot;You can&apos;t fight if you have sore muscles,&quot; one young officer told me. Yet this brave democracy had perilously fragile foundations. The US invasion had toppled the Taliban but, many Afghans complained, left behind the force they hated equally: the warlords who had plundered the country for decades. Instead of being banished, many of the old faces were back. Some stood for election, such as Abdul Rashid Dostum, the US-allied warlord accused of suffocating up to 2,000 Taliban fighters in shipping containers. In 2005 Karzai made him chief of staff to the military. The president protested he had little choice but to accommodate such bullies \u2013 the Americans wanted nation building on the cheap. He had a point. The Bush administration, preoccupied with the war in Iraq, had only 8,000 soldiers in Afghanistan at the time of the 2004 election. Commanders, intelligence assets, military equipment \u2013 all were being re-routed to Baghdad. Meanwhile, across the border in Pakistan, the Taliban leadership were plotting a comeback. There was clearly no place in a political process \u2013 American leaders bundled them in the same basket as al-Qaida fugitives, which was a mistake. Then, in 2005, they made a dramatic reappearance. Violent incidents soared to more than 4,000, from 1,500 the year before. Coalition deaths doubled from 60 to 131. Pakistan denied the insurgents were using its territory but Nato officers spoke of the &quot;Quetta Shura&quot; \u2013 the Taliban ruling council headquartered in western Pakistan. More worrying proof was available. In 2006 I attended a funeral north of Quetta for a fallen Taliban fighter; the homily was read by a mullah who was also the provincial minister of health. It was a perfect storm for the British deployment to Helmand. Few took seriously the statement by the then defence secretary, John Reid, in mid 2006 that &quot;not a single shot&quot; might be fired. But British officers did promise to do things differently from the Americans. Criss-crossing the desert in nimble \u2013 but hugely exposed \u2013 open-top jeeps, officers said there would be no kicking down people&apos;s doors. They talked confidently about the lessons of Northern Ireland; young soldiers strolled the bazaars, playing football with local kids. None of that lasted long. By June, British troops had been sucked into a vicious fight in Sangin, a village deep in Helmand&apos;s heroin country that threatened to become a British Alamo. Insurgents streamed across the desert from Pakistan; the death toll inched upwards. British commanders turned to pulverising air strikes and helicopter gunships that killed hundreds of Taliban fighters. But the more the British killed, the more fighters seemed to spring up. The violence spread like a virus. Nato launched Operation Medusa in neighbouring Kandahar in summer 2006 \u2013 the alliance&apos;s first land operation. It was a success, of sorts. Canadian soldiers started the fight and Americans finished it, driving the Taliban back over the border towards Quetta. I toured the battlefield with Colonel Stephen Williams, a flamboyant American who played heavy metal music as his artillery pounded Taliban-held compounds. &quot;Rock&apos;n&apos;roll, man,&quot; he said. But the Taliban were also adapting. The insurgency melted out of sight, instead attacking western and Afghan forces with roadside bombs and suicide attacks. Casualties of western troops mounted, touching a high of 711 last year. Some 2,700 civilians also perished. The main problem was that the Afghan government seemed incapable of holding captured ground. In Kabul, western officials scrambled to come up with\u00a0solutions. Every season brought a new initiative \u2013 counter-narcotics, building the justice system, rooting out corruption. At first western forces demobilised Afghan militias, then they started to arm them. Diplomats attended fundraising events in Tokyo, Berlin and London, trying to maintain flagging interest. The term &quot;Afghanisation&quot; \u2013 putting Afghan soldiers, civil servants or policemen up front \u2013 became an article of shaky faith. But no amount of money or soldiers seemed capable of patching up the deeply dysfunctional relationship at the heart of the affair. Anger and frustration turned to resentment and deep mistrust on both sides. Diplomatic cables from 2009 released through WikiLeaks showed the US ambassador, Karl Eikenberry, describing Karzai as a &quot;paranoid and weak individual unfamiliar with the basics of nation building&quot;. Another cable noted that Karzai&apos;s deputy, Ahmad Zia Massoud, had been questioned after arriving in Dubai with $52m in cash \u2013 raising questions about financial propriety at the highest levels of government. The Obama &quot;surge&quot; of two years ago, bringing the US contingent to more than 100,000 troops, was supposed to rescue the situation. It succeeded in part. Western troops now control a greater swath of southern Afghanistan than they have for years; Taliban violence there is receding. Yet the fight has simply shifted to the mountainous east, along the border with Pakistan&apos;s tribal belt. The area is controlled by the notorious Haqqani network \u2013 the tribal jihadi clan based out of north Waziristan, and recently the subject of friction between the US and the Pakistani military. The US accuses Pakistan&apos;s ISI intelligence service of supporting the Haqqanis, who carried out the daring 13 September attack on the US embassy. The Pakistanis say they don&apos;t know what the US wants \u2013 to make peace with the insurgents, or to fight them. Amid the confusion, the one sure thing is that, by the end of 2014, the US and Britain will have withdrawn most of their troops. Talk of an &quot;endgame&quot; may be premature: informed officials say that between 10,000 and 20,000 US soldiers will remain behind to support Karzai&apos;s government. But will it survive? The prospect of talks with the Taliban has already resurrected old ethnic tensions; grave talk of civil war runs quietly in the corridors of diplomacy. Karzai periodically says he would like to sit down with the Taliban leaders, as he once did 10 years ago.

Despite the furore over that episode, Fox met Werritty again in Sri Lanka a month later when the defence secretary was on an official visit to give a lecture. Though the MoD insists Werritty was not part of Fox&apos;s party, it confirmed that Werritty did meet Fox during the visit. A photograph of Fox arriving to give the address on 9 July shows Werritty in the background, following closely behind Sri Lankan government ministers and the British high commissioner, John Rankin. During the visit, which enraged the Tamil community \u2013 who accuse the Sri Lankan government of war crimes \u2013 Fox also met President Mahinda Rajapaksa, foreign minister Rohitha Bogollagama and economic development minister Basil Rajapaksa. However, the MoD has denied that Werritty was there and insisted he did not accompany Fox during any official meetings. Werritty, who hands out business cards embossed with a House of Commons portcullis logo that describe him as an &quot;adviser to Rt Hon Dr Fox MP&quot;, has visited Fox at the MoD headquarters in Whitehall 14 times in 16 months. After details emerged of Werritty&apos;s links with Fox dating back 14 years he said in a parliamentary answer earlier this year: &quot;Mr Werritty is not an employee of the MoD and has, therefore, not travelled with me on any official overseas visits. &quot; Fox&apos;s spokesman added: &quot;He is a friend of the secretary of state.&quot; However, the MoD backtracked last night. It said: &quot;Adam Werritty was not part of Dr Fox&apos;s delegation and he did not attend any official meetings though he was present at the memorial lecture [in Sri Lanka], which was a public event at which the defence secretary spoke.&quot; The Guardian has been told Fox met Werritty &quot;for a quick drink&quot; after the lecture, which was to honour the late Sri Lankan politician Lakshman Kadirgamar. &quot;Adam Werritty was not there in any official capacity,&quot; an official said. &quot;The trip to Sri Lanka was sanctioned by the Foreign Office. Werritty was not part of the official delegation. Dr Fox has a long-standing interest in Sri Lanka going back to the 1990s when he helped to broker a peace accord.&quot; The revelation of the meeting will increase the pressure on Fox, 50, who has been accused of putting national security at risk by offering Werritty regular access to his office. Questions have also been raised about whether Werritty has sought to profit financially from the relationship. Werritty ran a defence company while Fox was shadow defence secretary, and he was involved in a health company while Fox was shadow health secretary. Werritty, 34, has accompanied Fox on several trips to Sri Lanka, including one in 2009 when the pair reportedly met the president, prime minister and foreign minister. He lived with Fox in a flat near Tower Bridge before the defence secretary married Jesme Baird in 2005. Werritty was a guest at Fox&apos;s 50th birthday party at his official Whitehall residence last month. Last night Fox launched an investigation to clear his name. In a statement, he said: &quot;A number of baseless accusations have been made in recent days. For the sake of clarity I have asked my permanent secretary to establish whether there has been any breach of national security or the ministerial code. She will report back in due course.&quot; Jim Murphy, the shadow defence secretary, said: &quot;This gets murkier and murkier. People will be shocked Liam Fox is unable to provide straight answers to straight questions. &quot;We have previously raised serious concerns about his insistence on visiting a Sri Lankan government failing to produce an independent and transparent investigation into allegations of war crimes. &quot;We need a full explanation for his visit as well as clarification of the role of Adam Werritty. &quot;Mr Werritty&apos;s role is unclear and is now becoming a real concern. We need to know precisely why he was on the visit, why this was denied and especially if he benefitted personally or professionally from the visit.&quot; Fox was initially scheduled to visit Sri Lanka last December but was forced to abandon his plans following a row with the foreign secretary, William Hague, who feared the speech would upset Britain&apos;s carefully balanced relations with Colombo. Fox rescheduled the visit for July despite leaked US embassy cables providing fresh allegations of the Sri Lankan government&apos;s complicity with paramilitary groups in its offensive against the Tamil Tigers.", "title": "Liam Fox was joined by former flatmate on official visit to Sri Lanka", "sentences": ["The defence secretary was under pressure to explain his involvement with Werritty after it emerged he had brokered a meeting in Dubai in June that may lead to Fox being called to give evidence in a blackmail trial in the US."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-07T00:37:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/07/liam-fox-adam-werritty", "tags": ["Liam Fox", "Ministry of Defence", "Politics", "UK news", "Adam Werritty", "Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Lobbying"], "article": "The most senior civil servant in the Ministry of Defence had previously warned Liam Fox about his connections to a self-styled adviser and personal friend, Adam Werritty, the Guardian can reveal. Officials had also previously told Fox to stop Werritty handing out business cards that falsely describe him as an &quot;adviser to the Rt Hon Dr Fox MP&quot;. On Thursday, Fox said he was referring the matter to Ursula Brennan, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence, to investigate &quot;baseless accusations&quot; that the friendship had led to breaches of national security. But according to three separate sources, Brennan had already confronted Fox about Werritty on the day the Guardian revealed that Werritty had brokered a crucial meeting at a five star hotel in Dubai. Sources close to the MoD said Brennan had raised concerns about whether Fox and Werritty&apos;s friendship had strayed into official government business. Werritty, 34, who is not a government employee, has visited Fox at the MoD offices in Whitehall 14 times in a little over a year. One source said Brennan spoke to Fox about Werritty&apos;s role in the meeting in Dubai this summer on 19 August \u2013 the day the Guardian revealed Werritty&apos;s role in the meeting, which has left Fox facing the prospect of being called to give evidence in a blackmail trial in the US. &quot;They have offices next to each other, they discuss any number of matters every day \u2013 she would have mentioned this on the day your story came out,&quot; the source told the Guardian. The MoD did not respond to requests to detail how often Brennan had spoken to Fox about Werritty. The department also failed to respond to claims that the officials had earlier told Fox to stop Werritty handing out the business cards, which are embossed with a House of Commons portcullis logo. This latest revelation comes as Fox said it was &quot;unacceptable&quot; that Werritty had distributed the business cards. &quot;I understand those cards are no longer used. I have made it very clear to him that it&apos;s unacceptable to carry a card saying that he is a personal adviser.&quot; On Thursday Fox asked Brennan to launch an investigation into what he called &quot;wild allegations&quot;. &quot;Because there have been some allegations of security leaks and so on, I&apos;ve asked the permanent secretary to look into that for me,&quot; he told the BBC. &quot;I&apos;ve asked the permanent secretary to look into any of these wild allegations, and I&apos;m very happy to stand by that investigation.&quot; Brennan will investigate whether Fox has breached the ministerial code. Kevan Jones, a Labour MP and former armed forces minister, said it was &quot;unthinkable&quot; that the permanent secretary would not have already raised concerns about Werritty. &quot;She would have raised it,&quot; Jones told the Guardian. &quot;She is there to protect the reputation of the department. And also to protect the secretary of state from any conflict of interest.&quot; The Guardian reported on Thursday that Fox had been joined by Werritty during an official visit to Sri Lanka in July despite claiming that Werritty had never accompanied him on government business. It came a month after the pair went to Dubai to meet Harvey Boulter, the chief executive of Porton Capital, a private equity partner of the government which is embroiled in a legal case over a threat to withdraw a knighthood awarded to the British chief executive of the US Post-it note maker 3M.

Inside he was whisked up to the 41st floor \u2013 which enjoys panoramic views of the city \u2013 but the defence secretary wasn&apos;t there to enjoy the view. He was there for a crucial legal meeting. In the hotel Fox was reunited with Adam Werritty, a close personal friend of his for at least 14 years, and three Dubai-based businessmen, including British private equity boss Harvey Boulter. The meeting, which had been organised by Werritty, who has handed out business cards embossed with a logo of the House of Commons portcullis that describe him as &quot;an advisor to RT Hon Dr Fox MP&quot;, was to demonstrate new technology that might allow troops to call home without fear of the calls being intercepted by the enemy. But there was a second item on the agenda: a highly contentious legal battle. The MoD&apos;s last partnership with Boulter had turned from a potentially life-saving new weapon in the fight against the MRSA superbug into a legal headache. The MoD&apos;s innovation unit had teamed up with Boulter&apos;s Porton Capital to commercially produce technology called Acolyte that is claimed to drastically cut the time it takes to identify MRSA infections. At first it was a major success and the pair sold it to US Post-it note conglomerate 3M in \u00a341m deal. But 3M later claimed the technology failed US tests and refused to pay the full amount. Boulter was furious. He wanted to fight 3M all the way, but to do that he needed the might of HM&apos;s government. The 41-year-old businessman, who spends most of his life on a boat sailing the Gulf, spent weeks trying to get someone in government to listen. He didn&apos;t have much luck until someone introduced him to Adam Werritty. Werritty, 34, flew to Dubai to meet Boulter and discuss his concerns in April. When he got back to London, Werritty emailed Boulter saying: &quot;Very good meeting with you in Dubai. Thanks for passing along the below along with the e-info on the two issues [Acolyte; and the phone call encryption system] we discussed. Please leave this with me to push along as discussed.&quot; A month later Werritty emailed Boulter again to say he had passed on Boulter&apos;s concerns to Fox&apos;s special advisers, and said: &quot;I&apos;d hope they&apos;d want to make an issue out of this.&quot; Fast forward to June, when Fox was on a morale-boosting visit to the troops in Afghanistan and stopped off in Dubai for a few days on the way home. When he landed in Dubai he met Werritty. The MoD says Werritty just happened to be there at the same time and insists he was not part of Fox&apos;s official entourage. Fox chose not to stay in the British embassy but at The Address, a new high-end hotel, which the MoD has not granted security clearance. Early on the morning of Friday 17 June \u2013 a religious day in the Emirates \u2013 Werritty emailed Boulter: &quot;Morning Harvey. He&apos;d [Fox] prefer to have it here [at the Shangri-La]. Let&apos;s meet on the 41st floor lounge.&quot; The meeting between the five men was a pleasant and jolly affair, but the disputed conversation turned toxic the next day. In the early hours of the following morning Boulter fired off an email to 3M lawyers. &quot;I had a 45-minute meeting with Dr Liam Fox, the British defence minister, on our current favourite topic \u2026 As a result of my meeting [with Fox] today you ought to know that David Cameron&apos;s cabinet might very shortly be discussing the rather embarrassing situation of George&apos;s [George Buckley, 3M&apos;s chief executive] knighthood.&quot; [See footnote.] Boulter suggested that a settlement &quot;at a headline of $30m+ will allow MoD to internally save face&quot;. When 3M failed to reply, Boulter followed up the first email with a second sent in the early hours of Sunday morning. &quot;I need to tell something to Dr Fox&apos;s office on Sunday night,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t really want to give a &apos;radio silence&apos; message as he is secretary of defence and will not expect that. I am trying to manage all of the dynamics carefully.&quot; This led to 3M immediately suing Boulter for &quot;blackmail&quot; and calling on Fox to explain exactly what he said in the meeting and whether or not he gave Boulter the go-ahead to send the late-night email. At first Fox fought back strongly denying that the Acolyte technology was ever discussed. &quot;Dr Fox met with Mr Boulter to discuss an entirely different matter,&quot; the MoD said. &quot;At no point did he enter into any discussion about this legal case, nor was there any mention of anyone&apos;s knighthood.&quot; But the Guardian tracked down both of the other businessmen present at the meeting, who confirmed that they heard the MRSA case discussed and Fox retracted his previous denial. &quot;During their meeting Mr Boulter disclosed his involvement in a legal case as a matter of propriety,&quot; the MoD said. &quot;But Dr Fox did not enter into a discussion about this in any respect and at no point raised or discussed the issue of a knighthood.&quot; However, one of the witnesses said Boulter informed Fox of the progress of the 3M legal battle, to which the defence secretary is said to have replied: &quot;I&apos;m sure you&apos;re handling this [the case] in the best way possible.&quot; Fox&apos;s spokesman did not respond to requests to confirm or deny the statement, and 3M is still preparing to call Fox as a witness if the blackmail case reaches court. The highly irregular Dubai meeting has cast a spotlight on Werritty, who has operated in Fox&apos;s shadow for at least 14 years. The Guardian understands that the pair first met while Werritty, who is from St Andrews, Scotland, was at university in the 1990s. Although it is unclear how they first met, it is likely to have been through Werritty&apos;s degree in public policy at Edinburgh. Soon after Werritty graduated with a 2:2, he got a job at PPP, the healthcare company. Soon after Fox founded the Atlantic Bridge charity, which was designed to promote the &quot;special relationship&quot; between the UK and the US, he asked Werritty to run the charity as executive director. The charity was backed by the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) and the hedge fund millionaire Michael Hintze. The funding of the charity, which was supported by senior Tories and patronised by Lady Thatcher, allowed Werritty and Fox to frequently travel to events in America. In one instance Fox flew back from Washington to the UK in Hintze&apos;s private jet, the register of members&apos; interests shows. It has been suggested that Werritty was also present on the jet. While in London, Werritty ran the day-to-day operations of the charity from room 341 in the MPs&apos; block at Portcullis House, which was provided to Fox at taxpayers&apos; expense while he was in opposition until last year. Staff in the building still remember Werritty, who stands taller than Fox and has a receding hairline. Werritty worked for the Atlantic Bridge until last summer when the regulator demanded that its &quot;current activities must cease immediately&quot; because &quot;the activities of the charity have not furthered any of its other charitable purposes in any\u00a0way&quot;. The charity was finally dissolved last Friday after its remaining trustees \u2013 Fox had already resigned from the board \u2013 decided to close it down rather than address the Charity Commission&apos;s concerns. Official records show Werritty collected \u00a390,000 in salary from the charity between 2007 and 2010. But it appears that running Fox&apos;s charity was not political enough for Werritty, a policy-obsessed nerd according to acquaintances. Werritty attached himself to Fox as a self-styled adviser and took an active interest in Fox&apos;s work as shadow health secretary and shadow defence secretary. He was on the board of a health consultancy company while Fox was leading the Tories on health. According to Companies House filings, Werritty owned 11.5% of UK Health Group and Fox owned 2.3%. By the time Fox had moved on to become shadow defence minister, Werritty had become involved in a firm called Securities Futures, which describes its principal activities as being &quot;promoting a better understanding of asymmetric &apos;security&apos; risks that the UK faces and publishing work that encourages a better informed debate on these important issues&quot;. When Fox entered government, Werritty appeared to want to go with him. But instead of getting a job in the civil service or for the Conservative party he knocked up his own business cards embossed with the House of Commons Portcullis logo and just happened to appear at Fox&apos;s side in Dubai and Sri Lanka. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 and 14 October 2011. The original said Werritty stands &quot;a couple of foot taller than Fox&quot;. This has been corrected.

Some trainers will see Saturday&apos;s Dubai Future Champions Day card at the home of Flat racing as a last chance to turn a poor season into a fair one. Others will merely hope to salvage something worthwhile from the ruins. Roger Varian is not one of them. His first season with a licence, having taken over at Kremlin House stables in Newmarket earlier this year from the late Michael Jarvis, has already been one of the most impressive debuts of recent times. There has been something very Jarvis-like about the quiet determination with which Varian, who spent 10 years as the trainer&apos;s assistant at Kremlin House, has progressed through the campaign. Jarvis earned deep respect not just from opponents but also from punters and bookmakers for his ability to place impeccably trained horses in the right races; anyone who staked \u00a310 on every Varian-trained runner this year would be \u00a3500 ahead. Varian&apos;s first runner, Laaheb, was fourth in the Group One Sheema Classic in Dubai. His second, Eton Forever, won the Spring Mile at Doncaster in early April, since when his strike rate has remained above 20%. Last weekend Nahrain was his first Group One winner when ridden by Frankie Dettori in the Prix de l&apos;Opera at Longchamp. So, when Varian saddles Ektihaam, one of the favourites, in the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket on Saturday, he will be in the happy situation of knowing that the colt might be about to make an excellent season even better. &quot;It&apos;s a very lucky position to be in,&quot; Varian said on Friday, while inspecting yearlings at Tattersalls&apos; sales that could form part of his stable&apos;s intake for next season. &quot;I&apos;ve got a great team behind me, from the staff right up to the owners who are supporting me, and we have had some very nice winners this year and then we had a big winner in Paris last weekend. &quot;I&apos;ve got a good number of horses to train and very good owners so, if we weren&apos;t at that level, it would be a disappointing year.&quot; Varian&apos;s yard is already in the top 20 by earnings in Britain this year and, when the \u00a3172,000 for the Prix de l&apos;Opera is added to the \u00a3660,000 his horses have won in 2011, he is within sight of seven figures and will move beyond the million-pound mark if Ektihaam wins the season&apos;s premier juvenile event at Newmarket. &quot;He&apos;s done nothing wrong on the racecourse so far, winning his two starts, and we&apos;re very happy with him at home,&quot; Varian said on Friday, &quot;but he&apos;s got to step up big time tomorrow on what he&apos;s done so far in terms of his form and ratings. &quot;He&apos;s won a maiden and a conditions race very well, though you could argue that [the conditions race] was possibly not the strongest. It looks like a very, very good race tomorrow, full of highly promising horses, and it&apos;s going to be very hard to win. &quot;Power is already a Group One winner and the Coventry Stakes winner [at Royal Ascot], so obviously you have to respect him and there are other unexposed horses very similar to ours. Brian Meehan&apos;s horse [Most Improved] looked lovely at Newmarket last time and Andrew Balding&apos;s [Spiritual Star] won well a couple of weeks ago; you could argue that he didn&apos;t beat much but he absolutely bolted up. It&apos;s a very interesting race for the outsider looking in but for me it&apos;s going to be very tough to win.&quot; Ektihaam is already quoted by the bookmakers at 16-1 for next year&apos;s 2,000 Guineas and could easily head the market for the Classic through the winter if he records an impressive success on the Rowley Mile. Training a Classic favourite and then perhaps saddling a winner would be a logical next step for Varian, who takes a positive view of the high prices being paid for yearling stock at Tattersalls&apos; sales in Newmarket this week. &quot;It&apos;s just the annual cycle we&apos;re on,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s an exciting time of the year with the horses we&apos;re running but it is also an important time to try to restock with the right type of horses for next year. It&apos;s a very strong market and that makes it harder to buy but at the same time it&apos;s a good sign for the industry.&quot;", "title": "Roger Varian hopes Ektihaam can strengthen his Kremlin House takeover", "sentences": ["Some trainers will see Saturday&apos;s Dubai Future Champions Day card at the home of Flat racing as a last chance to turn a poor season into a fair one.", "Varian&apos;s first runner, Laaheb, was fourth in the Group One Sheema Classic in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-07T21:01:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/oct/07/the-secret-footballer-internationals", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Paul Scholes&apos;s recent comments about cliques that existed among Manchester United and Liverpool players while they were away with England won&apos;t have come as a huge surprise to many within the game. Indeed it&apos;s little wonder one or two felt as if pulling on an England shirt wasn&apos;t worth the aggravation. I often think playing for England must be a bit like sleeping with the Queen \u2013 obviously an honour but how much enjoyment do you actually get from it? The reality is that cliques, to varying degrees, exist at all football clubs and aren&apos;t always a bad thing. Sometimes a foreign player will excel because he feels at home with a couple of his fellow countrymen alongside him. On other occasions it&apos;s simply an age thing, where two or three players have come through the youth team together. There are, though, cliques that mutate into what managers often describe as &quot;a cancer in the club&quot; and what players refer to as &quot;poisoning&quot;. They are disgruntled and often older employees bitter about not playing who seek revenge by criticising the club to anybody that will listen. Sometimes, however, a splinter group forms for other reasons, like on weeks such as this one, when the majority of a club&apos;s squad is away playing international football and a small number are left behind feeling like the players nobody wanted to pick in the school playground. At training grounds all over the country you&apos;ll find a curious collection of players either too young, not good enough or, in the case of Jamie Carragher and until the end of last season Scholes, internationally retired. &quot;The bomb squad&quot;, as it is affectionately known, is often the dregs of a club&apos;s playing resources. There would have to be an unprecedented outbreak of cherry blossom poisoning for some of these players to get anywhere near a matchday squad, and for a player who has enjoyed a successful career but is not a current international, the frustration that arises from having to train with some of them surfaces as soon as the sessions start. Many of these players are waiting to go out on loan. Brought in from all over the world for a pittance and earning between \u00a3200 and \u00a31,000 per week, they are often there to boost a club&apos;s bottom line. They learn by playing with reserve squads until they are at a level that allows them to compete in a league like the Championship or lower where, if they are successful, their stock will rise and a permanent deal is done for a tidy profit with an option to buy the player back should he go on to great things. It is strange to think that there are scouts dedicated to finding players who are not good enough to play for the first team and probably never will be, yet, once trained, can potentially bring in hundreds of thousands of pounds in transfer revenue after only a short time (I&apos;ve seen a few move for big fees after an impressive loan spell). It is, in effect, scouting for other clubs that don&apos;t have an overseas network. The job of coaching these sessions on a rainy morning is the equivalent of the graveyard shift on hospital radio; nobody wants to do it but somebody has to. The standard of the training depends on three things: how keen the coach is to be there, how much the players want to be there and how many players are actually present. I remember turning up to a session with five players who didn&apos;t include a goalkeeper. We had a quick warm-up and tried to have a keep-ball game with one in the middle before the coach, realising it was going nowhere, blew the whistle and said &quot;see you Tuesday&quot;. As far as I&apos;m aware, that group of players still holds the land-speed record for going home, packing and getting to the airport, before jetting off for a weekend in Marbella to sip Coronas outside Sinatra&apos;s. Classy. There certainly wasn&apos;t much talk of football for those few days and, if anyone did break the golden rule, he was quickly told to &quot;put the ball away&quot;. It may come as a surprise to some but it is rare to hear players talk about football away from their place of work. Although most love to play, I haven&apos;t found too many who are overly enthusiastic about dissecting the finer points and, out of all the football being played, international matches outside of the major tournaments are far and away those that nobody wants to discuss. The most that foreign players who go away on international duty generally get from a team-mate on their return is, &quot;Who did you play again?&quot; followed by &quot;Oh, right, how did you get on?&quot;. The internationals, on the other hand, are much more interested to find out what happened in Marbella and why one player in particular disappeared for 48 hours and emerged only at the airport, soaking wet and minus his shoes. At least he had his passport. International breaks can be beneficial for teams that have a lot of good players who, for whatever reason, don&apos;t represent their country. It can be a chance to have a break from the domestic schedule and those days off can be a godsend. I&apos;ve had managers who are happy to give players the whole week off (usually because they themselves can&apos;t wait to go away) and managers who see international weeks as a chance to run the nuts off their fringe players, often to punish the one or two bad eggs and avoid accusations of victimisation at the same time. This weekend somebody I know may well score a crucial goal for his country and be crowned a hero back home but somebody else I know will probably come back from Dubai with a story that makes the Rat Pack look tame.

It also emerged that between 2007 and 2010, Werritty earned more than \u00a390,000 as chief executive of the Atlantic Bridge, and that the most senior civil servant in the Ministry of Defence had warned Fox about his connections to Werritty. Ursula Brennan, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence, told Fox to stop Werritty handing out business cards embossed with parliament&apos;s portcullis logo that describe him as an &quot;adviser to the Rt Hon Dr Fox MP&quot;. Pressure has been growing all week on the defence secretary to explain his links with 34-year-old Werritty, who was Fox&apos;s best man and former flat mate. Werritty is not a government employee and has not had security vetting, but has visited Fox at the MoD offices in Whitehall 14 times in a little over a year, and joined Fox on an official ministerial visit to Sri Lanka this summer. He also brokered a meeting for the defence secretary in Dubai in June that may lead to Fox being called to give evidence in a blackmail trial in the US. Company records have shown that Fox was previously an investor, alongside Werritty, in a healthcare consultancy firm, UK Health. Fox arrived in Libya on Friday evening and was reported to have met with Jalal al-Digheily, who is defence minister in the National Transitional Council interim government. He was greeted at the airport in Tripoli by British envoy John Jenkins. The shadow defence secretary, Jim Murphy, said the growing evidence about Fox&apos;s relationship with Werritty amounted to &quot;a crisis engulfing the defence secretary&quot;. &quot;We need a thorough official investigation, but it is not good enough to use that as an excuse for silence,&quot; Murphy said. &quot;There are multiple questions that deserve specific answers, which Liam Fox should provide now. This matter is overshadowing the important work of the Ministry of Defence and only Liam Fox himself can put it to rest.&quot; On Thursday, Fox asked Brennan to launch an investigation into what he called &quot;wild allegations&quot;. On Friday, he said it was &quot;unacceptable&quot; that Werritty had distributed the business cards. &quot;I understand those cards are no longer used. I have made it very clear to him that it&apos;s unacceptable to carry a card saying that he is a personal adviser.&quot; Fox has previously been criticised for using a US aide with links the US intelligence service and army as an adviser at the MoD before he received full security clearance. Fox founded the Atlantic Bridge to strengthen the relationship between the US and UK, and in particular celebrate the Reagan-Thatcher era. He installed Werritty as chief executive, but it has now been wound up following criticism by regulators that it was too political to qualify for charitable status. A string of senior Tories, including George Osborne, William Hague and Michael Gove, have served on the advisory board of the charity, and Baroness Thatcher was the honorary patron. Fox&apos;s parliamentary office was given as the charity&apos;s administrative office in UK charity files, and Werritty is listed as UK executive director in accounts filed in the US for the Atlantic Bridge Inc, the entity which controls the organisation&apos;s US arm. One parliamentary staff member, whose office was close to Fox&apos;s, said he believed that Werritty may have held a parliamentary pass. &quot;I assumed he was a member of Fox&apos;s staff because he was always around,&quot; the official said. The parliamentary commissioner for standards&apos; office, that oversees the list of pass holders, could not verify the claim. A spokesman for Fox insisted Werritty was rarely in the office, although it was manned by an administrator for the charity. The presence of the charity&apos;s administrative office at the heart of parliament also exposed Fox&apos;s potentially embarrassing links to US neo-conservative lobbyists whose views on the environment and public healthcare clash with the stated policies of David Cameron&apos;s government. In 2007, the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), a major US lobbying organisation for big corporations thought to include Philip Morris, Texaco and McDonalds, set up a sister charity also known as Atlantic Bridge, which then funded Fox&apos;s organisation with \u00a328,528 over the past four years, accounts show. Alec did not answer enquiries about whether it funded the charity, but it has described it as &quot;the latest component of its international relations programme&quot; and appointed its director of international relations, Catherine Bray, to run it. Werritty is listed in US charity files as the American arm&apos;s UK executive director, and his address is given as Fox&apos;s former room at the House of Commons. Alec announced the formation of the charity in October 2007 &quot;in conjunction with the Atlantic Bridge Group, a non-profit organization chaired by the British Conservative shadow minister for defense, Liam Fox MP&quot;. As well as 300 corporate members, Alec has 2,000 state legislators as members, and a goal of the combined project was to substantially increase its number of European legislative members. Its slogan is: &quot;Limited government, free market, federalism&quot;. It sparked a transatlantic row when John Campbell, a California congressman and an active member of Alec, attacked the NHS as &quot;enormously inefficient, wasteful and costly&quot; and said it was &quot;nuts&quot; of President Obama to seek to emulate it in his healthcare reforms. Alec has also fought cap-and-trade programmes and other regulations of greenhouse gases on behalf of big business, and has attacked attempts by the Environmental Protection Agency to introduce new rules on air and water pollution as &quot;a regulatory train wreck&quot;.", "title": "'Adviser' Adam Werritty ran charity from Liam Fox's office", "sentences": ["He also brokered a meeting for the defence secretary in Dubai in June that may lead to Fox being called to give evidence in a blackmail trial in the US."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-07T22:13:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/oct/08/talking-horses", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Horse racing tips", "Sport"], "article": "Frankie Dettori and Never Can Tell win the Cesarewitch 4.15pm Frankie Dettori produced a magnificent piece of front-running riding from the worst of the draw to win the Cesarewitch at Newmarket for the first time in his career.  The jockey was winning the marathon race for the first time and was providing trainer Jamie Osborne with one of the biggest wins of his training career.  Drawn widest of all in stall 36, Dettori raced on his own down the centre of the track for most of the race. Ermyn Lodge was second at 16-1; Colour Vision third at 20-1; Mount Athos fourth at 14-1; Rainforest Magic fifth 16-1. Dettori said: &quot;Twenty five years of trying and I&apos;ve finally broke the hoodoo! She&apos;s a front runner but to cut the corner was an advantage.&quot; Press Association Parish Hall wins Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket 3.25pm Jim Bolger improved his incredible recent record in the Dubai Dewhurst Stakes when Parish Hall sprang a 20-1 surprise at Newmarket.  Having won the race with Teofilo, who is the sire of Parish Hall, New Approach and Intense Focus in successive years, the Coolcullen maestro struck again.  Kevin Manning had the colt prominent throughout on the rails and despite seemingly being one of the first under pressure, he kept on galloping.  Most Improved (third at 6-1) and Bronterre were challenging inside the final furlong while Power (second at 15-8 fav) got going all too late and was beaten half a length.  Parish Hall had disappointed in the Phoenix Stakes after winning his maiden but was not beaten far in the Futurity Stakes behind Dragon Pulse. Dragon Pulse had chased home Power in the National Stakes, so Bolger and Manning were quietly confident of a bold show. Press Association Crusade wins Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket 2.50pm Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s second-string runner Crusade won the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket. With plenty of the fancied runners failing to give their running, O&apos;Brien&apos;s Reply claimed third, just behind the supplemented Lilbourne Lad (8-1).  Fourth on his last start in the Tattersall Stakes, Crusade was sent off at 25-1 under Seamie Heffernan and won by three-quarters of a length. The fancied Caspar Netscher looked an unlucky loser having been well behind with a furlong to run before flashing home to finish just behind the placed horses.  Family One, Bapak Chinta and Burwaaz all failed to get involved while Balty Boys and Michael Hills raced alone on the far side and finished fourth. Winning jockey Seamie Heffernan said: &quot;He&apos;s improved from run to run. I&apos;m never surprised [when outsiders win] any more. We have to make them good. It&apos;s grand.&quot; Press Association  Today&apos;s best bets, by Will Hayler David Pipe has a clear chance to continue a fine family tradition with the lightly-raced Beyond in Saturday&apos;s Cesarewitch at Newmarket. Since taking over from his father, Pipe has proved himself to be a chip off the old block, winning the Grand National and landing several well-orchestrated gambles for his owners. Martin Pipe&apos;s remarkable success as a trainer of jumpers has left his name indelibly written into racing&apos;s record books, but he also enjoyed the odd foray into the big staying handicaps on the Flat and took this race twice with Heros Fatal (2000) and Miss Fara (2002). Pipe Jr nominated this race as the target for Beyond (3.50) almost immediately after his victory at Sandown in July on his first start for the stable. There is no doubt that he must improve on anything he has done before, but this son of Galileo has had very little racing in the last 18 months and there must be a chance that while under wraps he has developed physically without the handicapper being able to do any damage. A good-looking draw in stall three and the booking of William Buick offer further encouragement and Pipe believes that moving up in trip will be the making of Beyond. Potential dangers abound in such a competitive contest, but the Irish runners Rainforest Magic and Buy Back Bob are both open to any amount of improvement on what has been seen so far. The latter, in particular, is impossible to assess, having run just once on the Flat, at Gowran over less than half this trip, since being bought by the celebrated gambler Patsy Byrne for 140,000 guineas a year ago. A dramatic market move would come as no surprise. Newmarket 2.05 Despite having to give weight to all of these rivals, Strong Suit scored with authority from useful yardsticks last time out and could well prove a class apart. The improving Chachamaidee poses the greatest threat. York 2.20 A trappy contest featuring a number of in-and-out performers, but Noel Wilson&apos;s Dorback is interesting on his first start for the stable. He has been a frustrating horse to follow this season and looked a weak finisher more than once, but he is handicapped to win a race of this type. Newmarket 2.35 Caspar Netscher is tough and holds a number of these rivals if he is able to reproduce his recent winning form, but Bapak Chinta still has the potential to prove up to scoring at this level despite recent disruptions to his schedule due to training problems. He may have the better of the draw with the stalls on the stands side. The biggest question is whether he will see out the trip, but this may not be a vintage renewal despite the large field. York 2.50 Against older rivals and having raced close enough to a kamikaze early gallop, Oceanway deserves particular credit for sticking on to finish just outside the placings in a competitive handicap at Newbury last time. If she gets to the front here, she could be tough to reel in. Newmarket 3.10 It is hard to assess whether the proven top-level form of Power will hold up against less-exposed rivals such as Bronterre, Most Improved and Ektihaam. However, it may pay to take a chance on the last named, who won a good maiden on his debut, despite showing clear signs of inexperience, and then built on that performance when winning a conditions event at Doncaster (the same which Frankel had taken 12 months earlier). He has still more to offer. York 3.25 It would not be the biggest surprise to see Bannock bounce back after a blow-out when favourite at Redcar last week. His previous form would make him a leading player. But Swiss Spirit was not knocked about when mid-division in the Mill Reef last time and this well-related colt should have learnt plenty. York 4.05 If his draw towards the stands rail does not prove a disadvantage, then Son Of The Cat must have a cracking chance. He did not get much cover in the Ayr Gold Cup last time, but picked up well close to home to finish third \u2013 and quicker ground might have elicited an even better performance. This is a horse who has never been in better form and the fact that Silvestre de Sousa retains the ride is another positive. Seen and heard John Penrose failed to hit the right note in a speech aimed at unifying the racing and betting industries. At the &quot;Leaders in Racing&quot; conference in London on Thursday, the sports minister briefly compared solving racing&apos;s Levy problem to finding peace in the Middle East. Also present was the former British Horseracing Authority chief executive Nic Coward, who quit to join the Premier League. Given that the &quot;Leaders in Football&quot; conference was going on nearby, there was speculation that Coward had walked into the wrong room. A bumper crowd of 50,000-plus watched the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe in Paris, mostly British or Irish. But many were annoyed by the refreshments on offer. Racegoers reported that wine sold out across the public areas well before the big race. &quot;By the second race it was half-bottles only, then only white, and then nothing,&quot; one rosbif said.  Horse sense Richard Hannon stands on the verge of being crowned the champion trainer again this season, with his army of two-year-olds once again claiming pots of prize money. It speaks volumes about the strength of his juvenile squadrons that no sooner has one potential champion \u2013 Harbour Watch \u2013 been ruled out for the season, than another \u2013 Bronterre \u2013 moves in to take his place. And Bronterre (3.10) is no second-rate substitute. Indeed, confidence in the colt&apos;s prospects could not be higher before Saturday&apos;s Dewhurst after he produced a top-drawer piece of work on Tuesday. The booking of Frankie Dettori for the Brian Meehan-trained Most Improved in the same race is interesting. Connections have sold to Godolphin in the past. Maybe they are hoping the Italian will recommend another purchase? At least half of the field in the Cesarewitch have been &quot;laid out&quot; for Saturday&apos;s race, but Veiled (3.50) certainly deserves to be towards the top of any shortlist. Veiled has been given a break since Royal Ascot, that run having come on the back of a busy spell over jumps, but she seems to have been freshened up nicely since. Teddy Grimthorpe and Tom Queally dashed to York for the victory of Jet Away, buoyed by the early-morning work of Frankel on Newmarket&apos;s Watered Gallop. Partnered by Bullet Train, Frankel did everything that Queally wanted and more, leaving the pair full of optimism ahead of next weekend&apos;s QEII at Ascot. Also making a good impression was the Champion Stakes hope Twice Over. One to look out for earlier next week from the Cecil stable is an unraced two-year-old Chignon, who is set to make her debut at Yarmouth on Monday. She is bred to want further than this six-furlong trip, but shows some speed at home. Will Hayler&apos;s best bet Silviniaco Conti 4.10 Chepstow The jumps season moves up a gear at Chepstow where Cue Card and Silviniaco Conti make their public debut over fences. The worry for Cue Card&apos;s backers is whether his exuberant style will play into his rival&apos;s hands here. In the long term, either could go to the very top, but today it is very much Silviniaco Conti who is expected to prevail.

Earlier on Saturday the prime minister declared he had &quot;full confidence&quot; in the defence secretary.

An email from 5 April shows that the defence secretary&apos;s friend, Adam Werritty, met Harvey Boulter, the chief executive of a private equity partner of the MoD. In the email, Werritty says &quot;very good meeting you [Boulter] in Dubai&quot;. Boulter told the Guardian on Saturday night that he first met Werritty to arrange a meeting with Fox in April.  Fox told the BBC on Saturday: &quot;Actually the defence ministry representative asked for it [the meeting] when they happened to be sitting at a nearby table at a restaurant.&quot; He said he was on his &quot;way home&quot; from Afghanistan and made the stop-over to switch from military to civilian aircraft. Fox was speaking to the BBC during a visit to Libya, which has been overshadowed by the controversy surrounding his links to his former flatmate and self-styled adviser. Fox&apos;s declaration that the meeting was accidental comes after emails obtained by the Guardian showed that Werritty had tried to set it up. Further emails appear to show that Werritty&apos;s attempts to set up a meeting date back to April. The correspondence is between Werritty and Boulter, the chief executive of Porton Group, a private equity partner of the MoD. On 5 April, Werritty refers to a meeting between Fox&apos;s self-styled adviser and Boulter in Dubai. He thanks Boulter for the information on &quot;two issues&quot; discussed which he promises to &quot;push along as discussed&quot;. It is understood that Boulter subsequently expressed concerns to Werritty about the possibility of a legal battle about technology developed in partnership with the MoD. Boulter&apos;s private equity firm and the MoD innovation unit sold technology called Acolyte, designed to help the fight against MRSA infections, to US conglomerate 3M. A dispute about the technology led to 3M refusing to pay the full agreed fee for the deal. Sources say Boulter was keen to meet Fox to get him to press 3M to pay him the rest of the money. On 19 May, Werritty emails Boulter to say he had &quot;passed this [Boulter&apos;s concerns about a legal battle] to one of the Special advisers and I&apos;d hope they&apos;d want to make an issue out of this but that&apos;s about all I can do on this&quot;. Harvey Boulter told the Guardian late on Saturday about an April discussion with Werritty about arranging a meeting with Fox. &quot;I met Werritty in April when I first presented this [legal battle over MRSA technology sold to 3M]. &quot;Werritty and I discussed setting up a meeting with Fox. He [Werritty] said he would with Fox at some point in the future,&quot; Boulter said. Boulter said he met Werritty over dinner in Dubai on 15 or 16 June.  &quot;I bumped into him in the restaurant and he offered to set up the meeting with Fox, because he said he [Fox] was in town.  &quot;The fact that a meeting was going to happen was pre-arranged in April. A meeting with the MoD doesn&apos;t happen by chance. I&apos;m sure I wouldn&apos;t have just got to meet him [Fox] unless I&apos;d been pre-briefed.&quot; An email seen by the Guardian, which is dated 7.49pm on 16 June, Boulter, who lives in Dubai, invites Werritty to his house, which is 15 minutes from the Shangri-la hotel where he is staying.

For others, it will be the competition, as the brilliant Frankel tries to extend his unbeaten streak to nine and Sir Henry Cecil attempts to win the trainers&apos; championship in a single afternoon. Speak to Andrew &apos;Chubby&apos; Chandler for half an hour, though, and you are reminded of a third, vital ingredient. It&apos;s called fun. Chandler is the most successful agent in professional golf, with a client list that includes Rory McIlroy, Darren Clarke and Charl Schwartzel, who, between them, won three of the four majors in 2011. But when it comes to racing, he claims to be &quot;just a mug owner&quot;, a description that is in danger of giving mugging a good name. This Saturday, a gelding called Hoof It, which Chandler co-owns with Lee Westwood, another of his clients, is due to run in the Champions Sprint Stakes at Ascot, with \u00a3250,000 in the purse. Westwood and Chandler will be in China on golf business when the race is run, but the excitement that bubbles through as Chandler looks forward to the race is infectious. &quot;We&apos;ve got ways and means,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;ve both got a Slingbox and we&apos;ll be watching, at 11 o&apos;clock at night, somewhere in China.&quot; Chandler and Westwood have been partners in plenty of horses over the past 10 years, most notably Right Approach, who was bought from the Queen and dead-heated for the 2004 Dubai Duty Free at Nad Al Sheba, one of the most valuable events in world racing. Neither man was able to pick up the prize in person, though, because golf intervened. &quot;Lee was playing in the TPC at Sawgrass,&quot; Chandler says. &quot;He was on the 14th and you&apos;re not allowed to use a mobile on the golf course, so I remember disappearing into a portable toilet to listen to the race. It sounded like we&apos;d got\u00a0beat on the line, then it took about five minutes to get the result of the photo, and it turned out we&apos;d got a dead-heat and won $800,000 [\u00a3515,000]. &quot;I wandered out and there was a queue of about 15 people outside, all giving me very quizzical looks. I must have ridden the finish in the toilet, but that paid for our racing for two years.&quot; Chandler and Westwood&apos;s racing interests now extend to nearly 20 horses in South Africa and England, but Hoof It, who was beaten by a whisker when third in the Group One Haydock Sprint Cup in September, is the clear leader of the team. He is outstanding in any paddock, too, a huge, muscular four-year-old, whose best years may well lie ahead. And Chandler and Westwood have been there for\u00a0the whole ride, from the early days when fourth-place finishes in Hoof It&apos;s first two starts did not offer many hints about what was to follow. &quot;David Easterby [the son of Hoof It&apos;s trainer, Mick] gave us a tip on a hurdler at Wetherby, I think it was backed from 14-1 to 4-1 and it won,&quot; Chandler says. &quot;I said to David, should I get you some champagne, and he said, why not buy a horse with us? &quot;We ended up buying into a couple and Hoof It was one of them. He&apos;s not only the biggest horse I&apos;ve ever seen, but he&apos;s also pretty genuine. Number one, he wins, and, number two, he wins at good prices. &quot;We&apos;ve not only knocked it off in prize money, we&apos;ve also made quite a bit betting on him. &quot;The best day I&apos;ve had was when he won the Stewards&apos; Cup at Goodwood. I was looking at them all in the paddock before the race and I thought, there are 28 runners here, and there are 27 Amir Khans and one Mike Tyson. He walked around the ring like he owned it.&quot; What matters more than victory is the entertainment. Stress is what Chandler and Westwood deal with out on the course in their day jobs. Racing, regardless of the prizes on offer, is what they do to escape from the pressure. &quot;We just laugh about it and we enjoy the buzz,&quot; Chandler says. &quot;Lee&apos;s always very good at giving interviews when he\u00a0goes to the races because he knows people are going to talk about racing rather than golf. We&apos;ve decided that it&apos;s always going to be a bit of fun, we&apos;ll never pay a lot for anything, and mostly we&apos;ve paid about 15 grand for a share. If we own 20 per cent of a horse, we think we own it \u2013 and the lucky thing is, if Lee&apos;s involved, people don&apos;t mind if it runs in his colours or mine. &quot;We&apos;re mug owners, but, because we&apos;re sportsmen, we know a bit about what we&apos;re trying to look at. We&apos;ve got a\u00a0book with a list in it of 25 different trainers&apos; excuses and, to save time after a race, we just tell them the number of the one we think they&apos;re going to use. &quot;The two of us are quite similar. We&apos;ve not really got any other hobbies, so racing&apos;s our hobby. It&apos;s got quite a grip on us.&quot;", "title": "Chubby Chandler lines up a shot at Ascot's British Champions Day", "sentences": ["&quot;We&apos;ve both got a Slingbox and we&apos;ll be watching, at 11 o&apos;clock at night, somewhere in China.&quot; Chandler and Westwood have been partners in plenty of horses over the past 10 years, most notably Right Approach, who was bought from the Queen and dead-heated for the 2004 Dubai Duty Free at Nad Al Sheba, one of the most valuable events in world racing."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-08T21:59:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/08/liam-fox-adam-werritty-hotel-meetings", "tags": ["Liam Fox", "David Cameron", "Ministry of Defence", "Defence policy", "Health policy", "Politics", "UK news", "Adam Werritty", "Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Lobbying"], "article": "It was a meeting that had been in the pipeline for well over two months. Adam Werritty, the self-styled &quot;adviser&quot; to the defence secretary, Liam Fox, had met Harvey Boulter, the chief executive of Porton Group, a private equity company early last April, in Dubai where the businessman lived. Boulter wanted a favour. He needed to see Fox to discuss a dispute over a $41m (\u00a326m) payment for healthcare technology. A friendly email discussion followed. &quot;Very good meeting with you in Dubai,&quot; wrote Werritty on 5 April, promising that the matter of the meeting was in hand. On 16 June, on the eve of the talks, Boulter emailed offering transport for &quot;you and your boss&quot; from the Shangri-La hotel in Dubai where Werritty was staying. Fox preferred to meet in his own hotel in the city. Boulter said the encounter took place at 11am and lasted for 40 minutes. The email trail leading to the Dubai meeting in June would appear to contradict the version of events suggested by Fox on Saturday, when he claimed that it took place as a result of a chance encounter in a Dubai restaurant. For the increasingly beleaguered defence chief, the emails uncovered by the Guardian will become the source of yet more questions in Westminster tomorrow. Taken together with Saturday&apos;s other revelation \u2013 the video footage that appears to show Werritty at a meeting with the Sri Lankan president last December \u2013 the new evidence appears to confirm that his friendship with Fox gave Werritty an inappropriate level of access to government. Fox, the one-time hero of the Tory right, known at Westminster for his plain speaking, name-dropping and none-too-subtle methods of self-promotion, is this weekend fighting for his political survival. Monday will see the Commons chamber packed with MPs intrigued by the relationship, and the often mysterious movements of Dr Fox. Labour will be baying for blood \u2013 keen to secure the first cabinet scalp since the Liberal Democrat David Laws was pushed into quitting over his expenses claims within weeks of the coalition government being formed last summer. David Cameron, never close to Fox, of whom he has always been rather wary, will not be quaking in his boots. But he will not want to lose a cabinet minister in the eye of a storm over which he has absolutely no control. Why, Labour will ask, has Werritty, 16 years Fox&apos;s junior and a close friend for a decade and a half, been allowed such access to the defence secretary&apos;s discussions with top brass across the world when he is not a government employee and has had no security vetting? Why did Werritty attend meetings with the secretary of state in London, Sri Lanka and Dubai when he had no official role? How, in relation to the Dubai meeting, can the MoD have claimed it knew nothing of the meeting when the defence secretary has 24-hour security provided by government, watching his every move? Has Fox put national security at risk? What about potential conflicts of interest with his friend&apos;s business interests? Fox&apos;s enemies will want to ask questions about Werritty&apos;s links to a string of companies that have health and defence interests. In addition to a now-dissolved defence advisory firm, Security Futures, a company that Werritty joined in 2006 and whose directors have included the Tory MP Laura Sandys, he is the sole shareholder in a company called Danscotia Consulting, which lists his occupation as business consultant. Records show that in February, Werritty set up Todhia Ltd, in which he is the sole director. Neither company lists the nature of its business with Companies\u00a0House. Companies House records also reveal that in 2002, when Fox was shadow health secretary and therefore someone who was briefed on market-sensitive policy developments by civil servants, Werritty was appointed director of a company named UK Health Ltd. Two years later he became director of UK Health Group Ltd, in which both he and Fox became shareholders. The same year he joined the board of another company, UK Health Supply Services Ltd. Both firms have now been dissolved. But their roles are unknown. For Fox Monday the next 48 hours will be the most critical of his political career since he stood up at the Conservative party conference in Blackpool in 2005 to make his pitch to lead the Tory party \u2013 a bid that was ultimately unsuccessful. On that occasion, with David Cameron also in the race to succeed Michael Howard, Fox was typically, breezily confident, delighting the Tory faithful with patriotic and eurosceptic rhetoric that won him a lengthy standing ovation. On stages across the world, Fox has always been adept at mixing light wit with tub-thumping populist messages. In his Blackpool speech he called for all schools to fly the union flag &quot;as a symbol of what unites us&quot;. He also carefully name-checked the emerging favourite, Cameron. &quot;I play tennis with David Cameron and we&apos;re friends, even though he beats me,&quot; he said. To his fellow MPs and ministerial colleagues, Fox&apos;s current troubles do not come as that much of a surprise. &quot;He is an odd bloke,&quot; said one fellow minister. &quot;He has fingers in so many pies that you kind of think one of them will land him in trouble somewhere along the line.&quot; Another Tory MP said Fox&apos;s tendency to name-drop and brag about his close friendships with Republicans in the US, media magnates such as David and Frederick Barclay (owners of the Daily Telegraph), and his endless globe-trotting, even before he entered the cabinet, has made many bristle and help explain why he has plenty of enemies in the Tory party and in Whitehall. &quot;I think you either roll with the bluster or find it repellent,&quot; said a Tory MP. Fox&apos;s ability to climb the social and political ladder was exemplified last month when Lady Thatcher made one of her rare appearances in public to attend his 50th birthday party. Even before Fox entered the cabinet, there were signs that he had got under the skin of diplomats and military figures in other countries as he roved the world talking up what a Tory government could do. Cables released by WikiLeaks reveal that Fox met the US ambassador, Louis Susman, before the general election and Susman recorded: &quot;Liam Fox affirmed his desire to work closely with the US if the Conservative party wins power \u2026 &apos;we [Conservatives] intend to follow a much more pro-American profile in procurement&apos;.&quot; He also ran into trouble with expense claims that he said proved how well connected he was. In June 2009, it emerged he had claimed \u00a319,000 over the previous four years for his mobile phone. Fox said this was due to regular trips overseas, in his capacity as shadow defence secretary. Fox, who was born and raised in East Kilbride, Scotland, attended the local comprehensive school and then went on to study medicine at Glasgow University. He became president of the University&apos;s Conservative and Unionist Association, and in his spare time took a keen interest in debating, winning national and international prizes. As well as his career in the NHS, he worked as a civilian army medical officer, which enabled him to see army life at first-hand. He entered parliament in 1992 and held a number of junior government posts before becoming a junior foreign office minister in the dying days of the John Major government in 1996. In opposition he occupied the shadow health post and was party chairman from 2003-2005 until he became shadow defence secretary in 2005. On 10 June 2005, he announced his engagement to longtime girlfriend Dr Jesme Baird, 37, director of patient care at the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation. Before the couple tied the knot he said their marriage should end gossip about his private life. &quot;I think that there are all sorts of smears going around and politicians should stick to issues. If someone accused me of doing something against the law I might feel bound to answer it. Otherwise I would have no comment to make,&quot; he told the London Evening Standard. He has irritated the prime minister on numerous occasions, particularly after MoD leaks about defence cuts, but they have had better relations since Fox has shown strong support for the Libya campaign. On Saturday, No\u00a010 said it had &quot;full confidence&quot; in the defence secretary as the pressure on him mounts.", "title": "Liam Fox, Adam Werritty, and the unexplained hotel meetings", "sentences": ["Adam Werritty, the self-styled &quot;adviser&quot; to the defence secretary, Liam Fox, had met Harvey Boulter, the chief executive of Porton Group, a private equity company early last April, in Dubai where the businessman lived.", "&quot;Very good meeting with you in Dubai,&quot; wrote Werritty on 5 April, promising that the matter of the meeting was in hand.", "On 16 June, on the eve of the talks, Boulter emailed offering transport for &quot;you and your boss&quot; from the Shangri-La hotel in Dubai where Werritty was staying.", "The email trail leading to the Dubai meeting in June would appear to contradict the version of events suggested by Fox on Saturday, when he claimed that it took place as a result of a chance encounter in a Dubai restaurant.", "Why did Werritty attend meetings with the secretary of state in London, Sri Lanka and Dubai when he had no official role?", "How, in relation to the Dubai meeting, can the MoD have claimed it knew nothing of the meeting when the defence secretary has 24-hour security provided by government, watching his every move?"], "publicationDate": "2011-10-08T22:06:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/08/emails-video-footage-liam-fox", "tags": ["Liam Fox", "Ministry of Defence", "Politics", "UK news", "Sri Lanka", "Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Lobbying", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "     Defence secretary Liam Fox&apos;s future hangs in the balance as the Observer reveals film and email evidence that appears to contradict prior claims about his friend Adam Werritty&apos;s involvement in meetings with overseas dignitaries and businessmen. The film shows that Fox&apos;s former flatmate, who was also best man at his wedding, met the president of Sri Lanka with Fox for a meeting in a London hotel last year, despite having no role in government. The defence secretary has strenuously denied that 34-year-old Werritty had been present at any official meetings with foreign dignitaries overseas and his department refused to comment on Saturday when questioned about this meeting. However, the video and photographs obtained by this newspaper appear to show Werritty shaking hands with President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Fox&apos;s troubles deepened further on Saturday when the defence secretary said that a meeting in Dubai in June this year with a businessman, also attended by Werritty, only happened as a result of a chance meeting there in a restaurant. Emails between Werritty and the businessman, Harvey Boulter, obtained by the Guardian in August, appear to contradict Fox&apos;s account. They appear to indicate that Fox&apos;s friend had been trying to fix up such a meeting since April. Boulter said: &quot;The fact that a meeting was going to happen was prearranged in April. A meeting with the Ministry of Defence doesn&apos;t happen by chance.&quot; The two sets of revelations came as Downing Street stepped into a row that was threatening to spiral out of control. No 10 ordered the initial findings of an MoD inquiry into Werritty&apos;s role as a self-styled adviser to Fox to be presented to David Cameron on Monday. The inquiry had been due to last another two weeks. Amid signs that support for Fox was ebbing away, No 10&apos;s line was that it was still supportive of him. But the fact that it effectively ordered the inquiry to be speeded up shows its desperation to draw a line under the episode. One source at the heart of government said: &quot;The prime minister is remaining supportive of Liam while the facts are established but we will see what happens on Monday.&quot; Sri Lankan TV news footage and press photographs appear to show that Werritty was part of Fox&apos;s delegation at the meeting with Rajapaksa, who has been accused of war crimes during the country&apos;s civil war. The footage apparently shows Werritty shaking hands and bowing to Rajapaksa. Werritty is present as Fox discusses investment in the country, and plans to integrate Tamil political parties willing to participate within the government, according to Sri Lankan TV footage. The footage was handed to the Observer by Italian blogger Nomfup. Three separate sources have seen the footage and confirmed that they believe Werritty appears in the footage. News of the meeting at the Dorchester hotel in early December will raise fresh concerns about whether Fox has misled MPs and the public about Werritty&apos;s role at the heart of government. The storm engulfing Fox has grown since the Guardian first revealed in August the extent of Werritty&apos;s closeness to Fox, and that he had described himself as an adviser to the secretary of state on business cards, although he is not a government employee. Fox will come under intense pressure when he appears at defence questions in the Commons on Monday. On Saturday night the shadow defence secretary, Jim Murphy, demanded that Fox make a statement to the House. &quot;This is a self-inflicted political crisis and it seems to run and run with fresh allegations every day,&quot; Murphy said. Sources have also told this newspaper that the government investigation into Werritty&apos;s role will examine every overseas trip Fox has taken, both as secretary of state and before as the shadow minister, to discover if he was accompanied by Werritty and if he met foreign leaders. The MoD said the Sri Lanka meeting was a &quot;private engagement&quot;. The Observer understands that Fox is also under scrutiny over other official visits abroad, including the annual trip to the International Institute of Strategic Studies in Singapore. He gave a speech at the IISS in early June, and it is believed he met Werritty during the short stay. Whitehall sources said that the MoD appears to be &quot;99% sure&quot; it has never paid for any of Werritty&apos;s flights or accommodation, but officials are trying to establish if there was any potential blurring of the lines that may have compromised Fox&apos;s position. Fox&apos;s friendship with Werritty is also likely to trigger questions over his involvement in a company called UK Health Group. Records reveal that in 2007 Fox owned shares in the company, as did Werritty. But there is no mention of this shareholding in Fox&apos;s register of members&apos; interests, an apparent breach of parliament&apos;s strict rules. The Guardian has revealed Werritty: \u2022 Involved Fox in discussions with Boulter that have left Fox facing the prospect of being called to give evidence in a &quot;blackmail&quot; trial in the US. \u2022 Was present at a discussion about the possibility of providing British security-sensitive technology to Libyan rebels. \u2022 Has visited Fox at the MoD&apos;s Whitehall offices 14 times in a little over a year and hands out business cards that say he is &quot;an adviser to the Rt Hon Dr Fox MP&quot;. \u2022 Ran a controversial charity from inside Fox&apos;s office in the houses of parliament. \u2022 Collected \u00a390,000 in salary from the Atlantic Bridge charity, which is linked to major US business lobby groups. \u2022 Has previously been present when Fox met Rajapaksa and other senior Sri Lanka ministers. \u2022 Was an investor in the same health consultancy company as Fox. The December meeting at the Dorchester hotel took place when Fox had been defence secretary for six months. After the Guardian revealed that Werritty brokered a crucial legal meeting in Dubai, a spokesman for Fox said: &quot;Mr Werritty is not an employee and has, therefore, not travelled with me on any official overseas visits.&quot; The MoD refused to comment on the meeting. Werritty did not respond to requests for comment. Speaking about the Dubai meeting during a visit to Libya on Saturday which has been overshadowed by the controversy over his links to Werritty, Fox said he had been on his &quot;way home&quot; from Afghanistan and made the stopover to switch to a civilian aircraft.", "title": "Emails and video footage pile pressure on beleaguered Liam Fox", "sentences": ["Fox&apos;s troubles deepened further on Saturday when the defence secretary said that a meeting in Dubai in June this year with a businessman, also attended by Werritty, only happened as a result of a chance meeting there in a restaurant.", "After the Guardian revealed that Werritty brokered a crucial legal meeting in Dubai, a spokesman for Fox said: &quot;Mr Werritty is not an employee and has, therefore, not travelled with me on any official overseas visits.&quot; The MoD refused to comment on the meeting.", "Speaking about the Dubai meeting during a visit to Libya on Saturday which has been overshadowed by the controversy over his links to Werritty, Fox said he had been on his &quot;way home&quot; from Afghanistan and made the stopover to switch to a civilian aircraft."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-08T22:46:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/09/world-cup-south-africa-australia", "tags": ["Rugby World Cup 2011", "South Africa rugby team", "Australia rugby union team", "Rugby union", "Sport", "Australia sport", "Rugby World Cup"], "article": " Nothing to see here, move along.

Does that tell us anything? It would seem not.  The bookies have made Australia favourites for today&apos;s game. The Irish forwards have dominated the Aussie pack already in this tournament. Can the Springboks&apos;s pack do the same? But Australia had the upper hand in the front eight when they clinched the Tri-Nations title in August with victory in Durban.

I can&apos;t imagine the Springboks will be as wasteful with possession and territorial advantage as the Irish were yesterday.  &quot;Boring match,&quot; says Robin Hazlehurst. &quot;Really looking forward to a dull and dreary slug-fest here or perhaps a one-sided massacre. Because I didn&apos;t make it to the pub for breakfast and it isn&apos;t on TV here and I&apos;d hate to miss a decent match. So please avoid all references to &apos;brilliant play&apos;, &apos;fantastic skills&apos;, &apos;tremendous battle&apos; and other such good things. If that&apos;s not too selfish.&quot;  Some pre-match fighting talk from Peter de Villiers. 75% of the people in the world are mad, he says. That means you, you and you. But not you.  &quot;Greetings from Dubai,&quot; says Sarah Bacon. &quot;Watching on OSN Arabia with two one-eyed Taffs and Jerry Guscott on the studio panel. And they&apos;re all picking the Saffers to win. Prove me wrong, Wallabies. Please.&quot;  Anthem watch. South Africa. Powerful. Emotional. Proud. A bit like their forwards. Advance Australia Fair.  Rousing. Determined. Tearful. This is very much on.  I knew Peter de Villiers was picking a fight. &quot;Madness,&quot; says Michael Hunt in an email that may as well be titled. &apos;You&apos;re havin&apos; a laugh&apos;. &quot;Re 75% or people in the world are mad\u2026 is that possible? Surely once you get up beyond 50%, especially in a democratic society, we are talking about the norm rather than the exception, so the supposed mad are the norms and visa versa.&quot;  Peeep!!! South Africa kick off and we&apos;re underway in Wellington.  1 min: South win the ball back from kick off and Matfield makes ground before they&apos;re penalised for going over the top and Australia have the game&apos;s first scrum. Genia chips over the top but Lambie, who may well be targeted by the Aussies, handles it well.  2 min: A fumble by Quade Cooper from a high up and under from Lambie. The Australia No10 is fortunate it goes backwards from his touch. The crowd like that. Cooper&apos;s not that popular round these parts.   4 min: The first South Africa scrum and they are hugely dominant. Steyn chips ahead and finds a nice touch. That&apos;s the first sign of the Springboks&apos; formidable pack doing the business.  5 min: Another chip ahead from South Africa is collected by Genia who fires a pass to Quade Cooper who is literally under his own posts. Cooper moves to the 22 before booting clear. Confident stuff from the Aussies.  7 min: This is a really good start from South Africa. Pietersen and Burger make ground on the right before they steal the Australia line-out and work it left where Habana, Brussow and Fourie make ground thanks to some nifty offloads. The ball isn&apos;t released and it&apos;s an Australia scrum 10 metres from their own line.  9 min: A great break by Jean de Villiers but Bryan Habana can&apos;t quite gather his offload. Australia pick up the loose ball and counter with a long Cooper clearance.  TRY! South Africa 0-5 AUSTRALIA The Australia captain James Horwill barges his way through after South Africa are turned over five metres from their own line. It was a simple try in the end as Horwill barges his way through the defence to touchdown. It is Australia&apos;s first real attack of the game. James O&apos;Connor fails to land the conversion.  13 min: Australia come again as Beale makes 40 yards waltzing his way through the South Africa defence. He offloads to Stephen Moore who is probably not the man you want in that position and Burger gets back to make a fine tackle. South Africa are in trouble here.  14 min: &quot;Great to see Burger make that error,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;What a shame Bakkies Botha isn&apos;t playing so he can make a few too.&quot; Burger has now gone off after picking up and injury making that tackle on Moore.  PENALTY! South Africa 0-8 Australia. James O&apos;Connor lands a simple penalty after Jannie du Plessis was penalised for handling on the ground. South Africa need to hang in here. &quot;To mangle and old saying,&quot; says Peter Gibbs. &quot;And because of the teams and because they&apos;ve both won it twice already, it&apos;s like watching your mother in law cycle over a cliff on a bicycle you don&apos;t like either.&quot;  18 min: South Africa respond well with another chipped kick which puts Cooper and then Genia under pressure. &quot;Curiously liberating,&quot; says Rob Wright. &quot;Now that England are out I can relax and enjoy the last fortnight. Thanks France! Hope Wales beat you a million to nil.&quot;  19 min: Mixed new for South Africa. Burger is back on but Heinrich Brussow has departed with what looked like a twisted knee. Victory for David Pocock already?  21 min: Burger is straight back into the thick of it bursting for the line but he&apos;s held up inches short. There&apos;s a loose touch as the Springboks attempt to push over and they lose possession and Australia clear their lines. Brussow is a huge loss for South Africa.  24 min: This is all going Australia&apos;s way and Pocock is exerting his dominance, turning over at a ruck after Fourie runs out of options when looking for a gap in the massed Aussie ranks. &quot;I like Peter Gibbs&apos; saying,&quot; says Robin Hazlehurst. &quot;But doesn&apos;t it sort of imply they both lose and get knocked out at the same time? Is that possible? Please?&quot;  26 min: Penalty to South Africa as Quade Cooper goes offside after Pocock mis-handled an offload and South Africa pounced.  Morne Steyn misses the penalty. It&apos;s along way out but Steyn, the most accurate kicker in their tournament, has the distance but not the accuracy and the ball drifts wide of Australia&apos;s left-hand post.  30 min: Fourie du Preez kicks forward and Beale does well to catch under pressure. James O&apos;Connor makes a lightening break out of defence but is felled by a tap-tackle. Quade Cooper is then judged to have knocked-on and South Africa have the put-in.  32 min: South Africa have three on two but the pass to Habana is too high and in the brief moment it takes to readjust his footing the momentum is lost. South Africa have a penalty advantage and kick into touch. &quot;Are disqualifications possible?&quot; asks Michael Hunt. &quot;Because that could allow the bike and Mother-in-law conundrum, and we could also start a rumour that the French were quaffing Beaujolais and Boursin from non-official match sponsors, and see if the authorities could clamp down hard on that, thus reinstating England\u2026 or possibly Tonga. Either&apos;s good.&quot;  33 min: South Africa lose possession on the Australia line ... again.  34 min: South Africa come again as Pietersen attempts to dance his way through. It&apos;s resilient Australia defence once again and Pocock, who has been typically immense, emerges with the ball and a penalty.  35 min: A terrible throw from Moore at the resulting line-out and he&apos;s fortunate that a smart tackle from Genia, and the resulting knock-on, prevents South Africa from getting on the scoreboard.  37 min: Penalty to South Africa as Horwill is offside and South Africa should finally get some points on the board ...  PENALTY! SOUTH AFRICA 3-8 Australia Morne Steyn knocks over the simple kick and that may settle the Sprinboks a little. &quot;Can you explain why you are printing comments gloating about Burger&apos;s mistake, and South African injuries,&quot; says Garth Jowett. &quot;It is pretty pathetic ... England were smashed .. Get over it!&quot;  40 min: Another penalty for South Africa as an Australian (I&apos;m not certain who) leaves his feet at the ruck after Genia was turned over. It&apos;s a long way out and Steyn seems reluctant to kick at goal but the clock is already past the 40-minute mark so he has no real choice.  Morne Steyn misses the penalty. It was 60 metres out on the touchline but drifts wide of Australia&apos;s right-hand post.  Half time: South Africa 3-8 Australia.   Half time emails. &quot;So David Pocock is a Southern African?&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Do Aussie cricket fans know this?&quot; &quot;I would respond to the Michael Hunt&apos;s query about the cycle analogy, Says Peter Gibbs. &quot;If it weren&apos;t for the probable Bart Simpsonesque name. Just saying.&quot;  Peeep!! We&apos;re underway in the second half. Can South Africa turn their territorial dominance into points on the board? &quot;Not sure when Pockock came to Australia but it was at least in his schoolboy days,&quot; says Rhys Walker. &quot;Unlike various English cricketers.&quot;  42 min: The pattern at the start of the second half is familiar. South Africa roll through the phases but the Australia defence stands firm. &quot;Re comments,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;I certainly don&apos;t need England to go out in order to dislike the Boks. And I&apos;ve always rather liked the Wallabies.&quot;  43 min: This is good stuff from the Springboks. Or at least it was until three Aussies pounce on Pietersen and Ioane picks up and chips ahead. The Australia fans think he&apos;s been taken out off the ball. Australia keep the ball but Cooper knocks-on and South Africa. It&apos;s been a ragged display from Quade Cooper.  44 min: That&apos;s better from Quade Cooper as he catches a Fourie du Preez box-kick. He&apos;s immediately turned over and South Africa work the space and cross for a try but the whistle has gone for a forward pass by De Villiers and he set-up Lambie who crossed to touchdown. South Africa aren&apos;t happy but it&apos;s the correct decision. Bryce Lawrence becomes the most popular Kiwi in Australia.  47 min: Bryce Lawrence is the toast of the bars across Australia right now as once again South Africa are judged to have played a forward pass. This time it&apos;s the wrong decision and South Africa re furious as Habana was making a lot of ground on the left. &quot;Wonder how a Spanish rugby team would play at the world cup?&quot; asks Rohut Negi. &quot;What would the rugby equivalent of tiki-taka be?&quot;  49 min: Francois Hougaard is on for Bryan Habana and Bismarck du Plessis for John Smit. That&apos;s a big roll of the dice from De Villiers. &quot;Can I add my support to the ubiquitous Gary Naylor&apos;s wishes for the Boks to lose,&quot; says Stuart Wilson. &quot;As an Englishman living in Johannesburg, my day tomorrow will be a lot more peaceful if the Aussie&apos;s triumph. There&apos;s nothing worse than a smug Saffa.....&quot;  51 min: Bismarck du Plessis makes an instant impact at the scrum and South Africa come again through the irrepressible Schalk Burger. &quot;Oi, Naylor,&quot; screams Sarah Bacon. &quot;Pocock moved to Oz in 2002 when he was 14. From Zimbabwe. Can you blame him?&quot;  53 min: Pat McCabe goes off with an injured arm and blood streaming from his nose. Berrick Barnes is on. &quot;The question regarding Gary Naylor&apos;s dislike of the Boks, is &apos;do we really need to know what he thinks?&apos;&quot; asks Garth Jowett. &quot;Is he someone of importance that I should know about?&quot; You are all people we should know about.  54 min: Jannie du Plessis throws a punch off the ball. he needs to be careful - the last thing they need is a man in the sin bin. South Africa have a chance to narrow the gap as Australia are penalised.  PENALTY! SOUTH AFRICA 6-8 Australia. Morne Steyn fires over the kick and we have a huge 20 minutes ahead of us. &quot;In response to Garth Jowett,&quot; writes Geoff Savage. &quot;I&apos;m a Welsh supporter who was more than happy to see England go out yesterday, but equally I&apos;m always happy to hear news of mistakes and injuries where South Africans are concerned.&quot;  56 min: Another mistake from Quade Cooper after his restart on the 22 is charged down by Bismarck du Plessis and South Africa pick up possession. Cooper gets away with it as Jannie du Plessis fails to release on the ground and Australia win the penalty. &quot;Re: Tiki taka rugby,&quot; says Michael Hunt. &quot;Spanish rugby would presumably include a lot of pretty but in this case useless forward passes. Similarly both round-ball and oval-ball England teams pass the ball backwards and sideways quite a lot before hoofing a long ball downfield and straight out of play.|&quot;  DROP GOAL! SOUTH AFRICA 9-8 Australia Australia lose the ball straight away from the line out. It&apos;s worked wide to Hougaard on the left and he&apos;s held up but they work the space for Steyn to knock over a fine drop goal and South Africa lead for the first time.  62 min: Australia just can&apos;t keep the ball - they haven&apos;t worked through more than five phases in the entire game. An email from Phil White: &quot;Garth Jowett: Flying the flag for humourless South Africans everywhere.&quot; he may not need humour - South Africa could be heading for the semi-final. They&apos;re well on top. They&apos;ve won five line-outs against the throw.  63 min: Willem Alberts is back on for South Africa. &quot;Of course I don&apos;t blame Pocock for moving to Australia,&quot; says Gary Naylor of Sarah Bacon&apos;s email. &quot;I never blame anyone for choosing to make a life in another country. Some Aussie cricket fans do.&quot;  64 min: Morne Steyn launches a kick high, high into the air which James O&apos;Connor gathers at the second attempt. That was brilliant. O&apos;Connor was under so much pressure.  65 min: South Africa come again. They really are dominant. If it wasn&apos;t for Pocock this game would be over already - he turns over but again the clearance is charged down.  67 min: It should be game over. Fourie du Preez was crossing for the touchdown but it&apos;s knocked from his grasp as he seemed certain to score. Pat Lambie then tries a drop goal but it drifts just wide of the right-hand post. Australia need to do something and do it quickly. One consolation is that they are still just one penalty kick behind despite being dominated throughout this half. Berrick Barnes seems to have his heads screwed on at least and finds a good touch on the left-hand-side.  69 min: Penalty to Australia after Danie Rossouw fouled at the line-out. Garth Jowett responds: &quot;The fact is that I am an American, with a great love for South Africa ... I was just surprised at the lack of sportsmanship ... No one should gloat about an injury ... And if I lived in Johannesburg I would be a disgruntled Englishman too ... Try living in Cape Town instead.&quot; I don&apos;t think anyone gloated about Burger&apos;s injury - merely his mistake which led to the Australia try.  PENALTY! South Africa 9-11 AUSTRALIA James O&apos;Connor lands a brilliant kick and somehow Australia are in the lead and have eight minutes to hang on. &quot;Anyone out there know how I can watch live streaming here in Hyderabad? asks cricket&apos;s Mike Selvey. Can anyone help?  74 min: The South African players are getting frustrated now. They want quick ball but it&apos;s not coming. Beale goes off and Anthony Fainga&apos;a while I stand corrected by Garth Jowett. &quot; Your Welsh supporter said: &apos; I&apos;m always happy to hear news of mistakes and injuries where South Africans are concerned.&apos; Bad, bad form, Old Chap!&quot;  75 min South African nerves are starting to show now as Pocock and Elsom turnover as the clock keeps ticking. &quot;Any hotel Mike Selvey&apos;s staying in will have have the channel Neo Sports, who are showing it,&quot; says Sathish. &quot;I am in India and watching it on the same channel.&quot;  76 min: Genia chips forward for Australia who have been more settle in an attacking sense since Berrick Barnes came on. Jannie du Plessis then tries to wrestle the ball from O&apos;Connor&apos;s grasp but the winger hangs on and wins the scrum for Australia. The little decisions are going their way now.  78 min: Here come South Africa with 90 seconds to save their World Cup ...  79 min: South Africa are keeping the ball alive in the hope that Australia foul and give away a penalty. They can&apos;t do it. Bryce Lawrence has seen a knock on and is once again the toast of Australia.  Full time: South Africa 9-11 Australia. The defending champions are out and somehow, somehow Australia are in the semi-final.  Post-match comedown.  How did Australia manage that? They will have forgotten what a rugby ball looks like after that second half but will be more than familiar with the sight and David Pocock and Rocky Elsom performing defensive deeds beyond the realm of normal men. Every ounce of their effort was needed to keep Australia in the game and James O&apos;Connor made no mistake with the one chance they had to get the scoresheet in the second half and it proved to be the decisive kick.  That&apos;s it from me. Some lovely emails coming in from disgruntled South African fans and a gracious one from Garth Jowett. But South Africa have only themselves to blame, though I suspect the referee Bryce Lawrence may bare the brunt of their complaints in the coming days with the disallowed try and the soft penalty decision that led to O&apos;Connor&apos;s winning penalty being the decisive moments in a brutal second half. Thanks for all your emails. Sorry I couldn&apos;t publish them all.

There appear to be very significant shortcomings in the scope of the inquiry announced by the MoD. I am concerned that your judgement of Dr Fox will rest on the initial findings of the MoD-led inquiry announced on Friday. While any revelations from the inquiry will of course be relevant, there are important questions which I do not believe will be sufficiently addressed by this process. The terms of reference are narrow and simply inadequate in light of the evidence that has come to light. The Secretary of State said on Friday that he had asked the MoD Permanent Secretary to &quot;establish whether there has been any breach of national security or the ministerial code&quot;. The terms of reference, however, seek solely to &quot;establish that there has been no breach of security&quot;, with no mention of the Ministerial Code. Furthermore, the inquiry will only examine whether &quot;the Department acted in accordance with guidance on propriety&quot;, but it is the Secretary of State&apos;s actions in the carrying out of his official duties which must be the focus of this inquiry. This is a totally inadequate response to the scale and nature of the charges that the Secretary of State now faces. To arrive at a meaningful judgement on whether the Ministerial Code has been breached it is necessary to assess all the issues that have been raised. As you will know, the 2010 Ministerial Code states explicitly that it is not the role of officials to enforce the Code and it is therefore inappropriate for the Permanent Secretary to undertake this role. The Code states that if there is an allegation about a breach then you as Prime Minister should refer this to the independent adviser on Ministers&apos; interests. This course of action is now clearly necessary and I urge you take it immediately. The Secretary of State said on 15th September in Parliamentary Answers that Mr Werritty had not &quot;not travelled with me on any official overseas visits&quot;. The MoD said on 7th October that Mr Werritty &quot;did not attend any official meetings&quot;. New evidence suggests otherwise. Dr Fox told me in a conversation on 13th July that the civil service were present at the Dubai meeting on 17th June. Again, available evidence appears to contradict this. The Secretary of State also claimed to the BBC yesterday that the meeting in Dubai happened by accident when &quot;they happened to be sitting at a nearby table at a restaurant&quot;. Again, this assertion does not seem to be supported by available evidence. There are numerous emails from Mr Werritty making arrangements for the meeting to take place. Importantly, this meeting reportedly discussed how a technology could serve both troops in Afghanistan and be of use in Libya, as well as an ongoing legal case involving the MoD. These are both issues which should not be discussed without MoD officials present. There are a multitude of other issues that have also been raised in recent days that require investigation. We need to know why Adam Werritty had business cards claiming to be an &apos;adviser&apos; to Liam Fox and who paid for them, what was discussed at the 14 meetings held at the MoD, which meetings with MoD or other governments&apos; officials Mr Werritty has been a part of and we need absolute confirmation he has not been privy to any classified information. It is essential that we understand why a non-employee of the MoD enjoys the access he does and we need to be certain no commercial gain has arisen from such access. It is important that the breadth of this inquiry matches the severity of the accusations. I agree with you when you said that the British people &quot;expect the highest standards of conduct&quot; from politicians. This is an opportunity for you to enforce that sentiment. In light of the seriousness of these issues and their being in the public interest I am releasing this letter to the media.

He says the current inquiry, established by Fox himself and due to report to the prime minister on its initial findings on Monday, is inadequate and too narrow. Murphy urges that any breach of the ministerial code should be referred to the independent adviser on ministers&apos; interests, Sir Philip Mawer. Murphy also claimed that a number of Fox&apos;s assurances about his connections with Werritty, including some given to him personally, now appeared to be &quot;at variance with the evidence&quot;. In his letter Murphy claims: &quot;To arrive at a meaningful judgment on whether the ministerial code has been breached it is necessary to assess all the issues that have been raised.

These are both issues which should not be discussed without MoD officials present.&quot; Fox will be forced to clarify his relationship with Werritty when he answers a long scheduled session of defence questions in the Commons on Monday. Although Murphy said he would be urging the Speaker, John Bercow, to require Fox to make a full statement in the Commons, Fox is already due to face Murphy at defence questions. It is likely Downing Street will want a clear line from the hurried inquiry set up by Cameron on Saturday before defence questions start at 2.30pm. Cameron asked the cabinet secretary, Gus O&apos;Donnell, to have an initial report on his desk by Monday, so short-circuiting the more leisurely, fortnight-long internal inquiry initially set up by Fox himself. Cameron will want to have a clear sense of Fox&apos;s culpability by the time he answers any likely questions from the media. Labour has refrained from calling for Fox&apos;s resignation, but the deputy leader, Harriet Harman, piled on the pressure, saying there had to be a full statement on Monday. &quot;There&apos;s now a further question about Dr Fox&apos;s integrity and the question of whether he actually answered truthfully and fully all the questions that have been put.&quot; Werritty is not employed by the MoD and does not have national security clearance. Emails and video footage have emerged appearing to contradict Fox&apos;s explanation of the meetings. A video has emerged showing that Werritty, who has no official role, attended a meeting between the Sri Lankan president and the defence secretary. Emails suggest a meeting with Dubai businessmen was not a chance encounter, as he had claimed. The former prime minister Sir John Major, a veteran of previous cabinet scandals, told the BBC&apos;s Andrew Marr Show: &quot;It&apos;s extremely difficult to handle these. Either natural justice requires you wait a long time and you&apos;re then said to be incapable of making decisions if you operate under natural justice, or you move too speedily and you&apos;re said to be ruthless. &quot;So I don&apos;t know what the situation is. The prime minister has asked for the facts to have a first look on Monday and I think that is right.&quot; The energy secretary, Chris Huhne, urged the media not to rush to judgment on Fox. Overall Fox is seen to have done a good job at defence and Downing Street will be reluctant to lose him, partly since he is a standard bearer of the party right, and someone whom party modernisers would not like to see roaming on the backbenches with a licence to criticise.", "title": "Labour calls for PM to widen Liam Fox inquiry", "sentences": ["Dr Fox told me in a conversation on 13 July that the civil service were present at the Dubai meeting on 17 June.", "Again, available evidence appears to contradict this.&quot; The letter goes on: &quot;The secretary of state also claimed to the BBC yesterday that the meeting in Dubai happened by accident when &apos;they happened to be sitting at a nearby table at a restaurant&apos;.", "Emails suggest a meeting with Dubai businessmen was not a chance encounter, as he had claimed."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-09T14:39:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/09/liam-fox-sorry-adam-werritty", "tags": ["Liam Fox", "Politics", "Defence policy", "UK news", "Ministry of Defence", "Adam Werritty", "Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Lobbying"], "article": "Liam Fox is battling to save his cabinet post by releasing an unreserved apology for allowing distinctions to be blurred between his professional responsibilities as defence secretary and his personal loyalty to his friend Adam Werritty. In a statement issued after a telephone conversation with David Cameron, Fox effectively accepted most of the specific allegations against him concerning Werritty were correct, but insisted they did not represent actual wrongdoing. He said he would answer questions in the Commons on Monday, but clearly hopes his apologies will be sufficient to win support on Conservative benches. The clear signs that he has the support of Cameron will give him serious hope that he can survive the crisis that this weekend looked as if it would certainly end with his resignation. Werritty, a long-standing personal friend of Fox, has been accused of seeing the secretary of state inside the Ministry of Defence as many as 14 times over 16 months, as well as accompanying him on official visits as defence secretary, including a meeting in Dubai in April with a businessman. Contracts were discussed at the meeting in Dubai, which was not attended by civil servants, and which Fox initially claimed was a chance meeting, but which has now emerged to have been organised by Werritty. Business cards have been issued by Werritty describing himself as an adviser to Fox. The defence secretary has said it was wrong of his friend to have portrayed himself in this way, but has not yet said if he was aware Werritty was touting himself in this way to defence contractors. In his statement, Fox said: &quot;At no stage did I or my department provide classified information or briefings to Mr Werritty or assist with his commercial work \u2013 let alone benefit personally from this work. &quot;Nevertheless, I do accept that, given Mr Werritty&apos;s defence-related business interests, my frequent contacts with him may have given an impression of wrongdoing, and may also have given third parties the misleading impression that Mr Werritty was an official adviser rather than simply a friend \u2026 &quot;I accept that with the benefit of hindsight I should have taken much greater care to ensure that any meetings with Adam Werritty, at which defence and security-related issues were raised, were properly attended by officials and recorded \u2013 to protect myself and the government from any suggestion of wrongdoing,&quot; the statement continued. &quot;With respect to my meeting with Mr Boulter in Dubai in June 2011, I accept that it was wrong to meet with a commercial supplier without the presence of an official. &quot;I have apologised to the prime minister and agreed with my permanent secretary to put in place new procedures to ensure that this does not happen again.&quot; Fox&apos;s statement marks a sharp change of tone from his stance on Saturday, when he asserted: &quot;I have absolutely no fear of complete transparency in these matters, I think there are underlying issues behind these claims and the motivation is deeply suspect.&quot; Fox said his permanent secretary, Ursula Brennan, would report her interim findings to the cabinet secretary, Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell on Monday. He added: &quot;It is important that this process is allowed to run its course. I\u00a0will answer all questions in the House of Commons.&quot; In his brief statement on television, Fox was less contrite, saying only that he regretted the impression of wrongdoing had been allowed to develop. The shadow defence secretary, Jim Murphy, has asked Fox to make a formal statement, and not simply answer questions in already scheduled defence questions. He has also asked for the commissioner on ministerial interests to investigate whether there has been a breach of the ministerial code, arguing that the inquiry being conducted by the defence permanent secretary is too narrowly drawn. The statement is unlikely to satisfy Murphy, who argued that Fox had not been clear about the purpose of the meetings, adding that he had been given personal assurances by Fox that now appear not to have been borne out by the evidence.", "title": "Liam Fox says sorry over nature of relations with Adam Werritty", "sentences": ["Werritty, a long-standing personal friend of Fox, has been accused of seeing the secretary of state inside the Ministry of Defence as many as 14 times over 16 months, as well as accompanying him on official visits as defence secretary, including a meeting in Dubai in April with a businessman.", "Contracts were discussed at the meeting in Dubai, which was not attended by civil servants, and which Fox initially claimed was a chance meeting, but which has now emerged to have been organised by Werritty.", "&quot;With respect to my meeting with Mr Boulter in Dubai in June 2011, I accept that it was wrong to meet with a commercial supplier without the presence of an official."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-09T17:27:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/09/liam-fox-adam-werritty-harvey-boulter", "tags": ["Liam Fox", "Politics", "Ministry of Defence", "Conservatives", "Defence policy", "UK news", "MRSA and superbugs", "Dubai", "Sri Lanka", "Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Lobbying", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "Liam Fox&apos;s political hero, Margaret Thatcher, was famous for her loathing of the U-turn, but the defence secretary&apos;s public handling of mounting questions concerning his relationship with close friend, former flatmate, best man and political ally Adam Werritty, has been littered with embarrassing corrections and clarifications that have left his position in doubt. On 12 June, Fox may well have glossed over a small report in the Observer concerning a \u00a341m-plus legal claim being brought in America against the US conglomerate 3M over alleged failure to develop and commercialise a technology invented by Ministry of Defence scientists for detecting the superbug MRSA. Fox, at that time, was still smarting from the leak of a confidential letter to the prime minister, published weeks earlier in the Times, which appeared to challenge government plans to set in stone a promise to meet UN targets of overseas aid. It was the second letter from him to be leaked in as many years and had provoked open irritation in No 10 and the Foreign Office. Fox retaliated by letting it be known he believed one of his cabinet colleagues may have been the source of the leak. This spat had only just subsided when the Guardian and Observer reporter Rupert Neate, who had written the original 3M article, learned that the American group, best known as the manufacturer of Post-it notes, was pursuing a counter-claim containing sensational blackmail allegations which, if true, purported to have been made following a meeting at which Fox been present. Neate immediately began contacting Fox&apos;s office with questions concerning allegations that Fox had held a meeting in Dubai to discuss the 3M litigation with Harvey Boulter, the chief executive of Porton Capital, an investment fund that had collaborated with the MoD on the MRSA technology before it was sold to 3M. Porton and the MoD&apos;s civilian research arm, Ploughshare Innovations, were parties behind the claim against 3M. What did they discuss? Had Boulter been sanctioned to send what appeared to be a threatening email to 3M&apos;s British born chief executive, Sir George Buckley, in which he awkwardly hinted that Buckley&apos;s recently awarded knighthood might be reviewed by the British cabinet? A response came from the MoD press office: &quot;Dr Fox met with Mr Boulter to discuss an entirely different matter. At no point did he enter into any discussion about this legal case, nor was there any mention of anyone&apos;s knighthood.&quot; The denial was emphatic. Fox clearly believed he was drawing a line under the matter. However, the Guardian was able to obtain statements from two witnesses who confirmed that they had heard the 3M case being discussed at the five-star Shangri-La hotel in Dubai. According to one, Boulter had updated Fox on progress in the 3M legal claim, to which the defence secretary allegedly replied: &quot;I&apos;m sure you&apos;re handling this [the case] in the best way possible.&quot; It was evidence that provoked first of several embarrassing U-turns by Fox. The MoD issued another statement: &quot;During their meeting Mr Boulter disclosed his involvement in a legal case as a matter of propriety, but Dr Fox did not enter into a discussion about this in any respect and at no point raised or discussed the issue of a knighthood.&quot; At the same time questions were arising about how official the Dubai meeting had been. The evidence suggested that Fox&apos;s friend of 14 years, Adam Werritty, who had no official function in government, appeared to play a central role in brokering the meeting with Boulter, and was there in person . Emails between the Porton Capital boss and Fox&apos;s friend showed they had been meeting and corresponding on the subject of the 3M claim as far back as March. Who exactly was Werritty? At first, the MoD simply said: &quot;Adam Werritty is not an MoD employee.&quot; Two weeks later, on 17 August, the department added: &quot;He is a friend of the secretary of state,&quot; adding that the MoD covers the costs of trips taken by only employees. The department&apos;s responses on the subject of Werritty then quickly descended into the realms of the absurd, with statements such as: &quot;As he is not an MoD employee, he has not been on any official MoD visits with the defence secretary.&quot; This was another statement \u2013 repeated almost verbatim in a written answer from Fox given in the House of Commons \u2013 that would not stand up to scrutiny. Sri Lankan news footage, posted on the Guardian&apos;s website this weekend, clearly showed Werritty shaking the hand of President Mahinda Rajapaksa at a meeting between the Sri Lankan leader and Fox last December. While in opposition, there had been previous overseas trips by Fox \u2013 to Israel and Sri Lanka \u2013 where Werritty had also been present. Before these facts had fully emerged, however, questions about the relationship between Fox and Werritty were repeatedly batted away by an MoD press officer. &quot;I am afraid my answers are going to be rather disappointing since Adam is not an MoD employee ... If you need anything else in relation to Adam, I am not sure that I will be able to help.&quot; The next piece of evidence unearthed would again force Fox to change his story. The Guardian was shown a business card used by Werritty, embossed with parliament&apos;s portcullis logo, on which he described himself as &quot;adviser to Rt Hon Dr Liam Fox MP&quot;. It later emerged that Ursula Brennan, MoD permanent secretary, told Fox to stop him handing out the cards. Last Thursday, Fox asked Brennan to launch an investigation into what he called &quot;wild allegations&quot;. The defence secretary said: &quot;I understand those cards are no longer used. I have made it very clear to him that it&apos;s unacceptable to carry a card saying that he is a personal adviser.&quot; The MoD said Brennan would &quot;examine the access to departmental premises and information afforded to Mr Werritty, and establish that there has been no breach of security&quot;. Over the weekend, as the political heat has been turned up, a flurry of comments from the embattled defence secretary have not all helped to clarify matters. On Sunday night, however, he issued his most extensive statement, promising to take questions in parliament on Monday. &quot;I do accept that, given Mr Werritty&apos;s defence-related business interests, my frequent contacts with him may have given an impression of wrongdoing, and may also have given third parties the misleading impression that Mr Werritty was an official adviser rather than simply a friend. &quot;With respect to my meeting with Mr Boulter in Dubai in June 2011, I accept that it was wrong to meet with a commercial supplier without the presence of an official. I have apologised to the prime minister and agreed with my permanent secretary to put in place new procedures to ensure that this does not happen again.&quot; How Fox changed his tune On the meeting in Dubai ...  24 June The MoD press office says: &quot;Dr Fox met with Mr Boulter to discuss an entirely different matter. At no point did he enter into any discussion about this legal case.&quot; 17 August The MoD says: &quot;During their meeting Mr Boulter disclosed his involvement in a legal matter of propriety but Dr Fox did not enter into a discussion about this in any respect.&quot; 8 October Fox tells the BBC: &quot;Actually, the defence industry representatives asked for it [the meeting] when they happened to be sitting at a nearby table at a restaurant. So, it&apos;s not that unusual.&quot; Seven hours later a Fox spokesman says: &quot;Dr Fox was referring to Mr Werritty, and not himself, bumping into Mr Boulter at a restaurant prior to the meeting on 17 June.&quot; 9 October Fox issues a statement: &quot;With respect to my meeting with Mr Boulter in Dubai in June 2011, I accept that it was wrong to meet with a commercial supplier, without the presence of an official.&quot; On the status of Adam Werritty ...

He admitted he had blurred the lines between his professional responsibilities and personal loyalties. He promised to answer all questions in the Commons later on Monday. The saga of his friend, Adam Werritty \u2013 the damaging appearance of a man capitalising on his friendship and the potential for a breach of security at the Ministry of Defence \u2013 has been punctuated by such attempts to close the story down. Today, again, the Guardian has evidence that appears to contradict previous accounts of an unorthodox meeting where defence procurement issues were discussed. Making his apology last night, Dr Fox appeared contrite. Just as well. On the evidence of the past week, he will have a lot of questions to deal with. Mr Werritty and Dr Fox are old friends. For a time, Mr Werritty lived for free in the flat for which Dr Fox claimed a Commons allowance, and later he ran a charity promoting relations with the US right from Dr Fox&apos;s Westminster office that the charity commissioners deemed too political for its charitable status. He ran a health affairs company when Dr Fox was shadow health secretary, and added defence to his interests when Dr Fox became shadow defence spokesman. Nothing illegal, but not beyond suspicion either. And when Dr Fox became a cabinet minister after the election, the precise moment at which it became essential that they distance themselves professionally, Mr Werritty instead became a regular visitor to his old friend&apos;s new office \u2013and even commissioned a portcullis-embossed business card inaccurately advertising himself as an &quot;adviser&quot;, a move that could have come from the Del Boy manual of appropriate behaviour. Time after time, Dr Fox has had to amend his account of events. On Monday he will have to explain how a lobbying firm with links to Mr Werritty received a payment for fixing a meeting in Dubai between the defence secretary and the private equity Porton Group. Originally it was described as a meeting that followed a chance encounter in a restaurant. Instead it seems now to have been a long-planned for event. As a result, doubt arises about Dr Fox&apos;s denial in his statement that he had assisted in his friend&apos;s commercial work. Similarly, the denial that Mr Werritty accompanied Dr Fox on overseas visits was undermined by evidence in the Observer yesterday showing Mr Werritty with Dr Fox meeting senior Sri Lankan politicians. The defence secretary&apos;s supporters are protesting too much when they argue that\u00a0the visit was unofficial. That&apos;s still the\u00a0prime minister of Sri Lanka whose hand Mr\u00a0Werritty appears to be so firmly clasping. We have been here before. Dealings that do not pass the perception of conflict of interest test, advisers with questionable links to interested parties: that is why special advisers now have to be vetted, why they must observe their own code, and why there is a compulsory register of their interests \u2013 these are part of the machinery of good governance about which this government is beginning to look casual. As Dr Fox now acknowledges, it is not acceptable to have an off-the-books adviser (any more than it is acceptable for Michael Gove&apos;s adviser to try to avoid leaving an email record of his discussions). It deprives officials of their essential role as guarantors of the public interest. After the past week&apos;s bluster and half-truths from his defence secretary, Mr Cameron faces a tough call on Monday morning. Whatever the interim reports from Dr Fox&apos;s permanent secretary and Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell contain, the minister&apos;s reputation, and that of the coalition, has been tarnished. Dr Fox has some protection: there is no obvious alternative to him as the architect of demanding and unpopular budget cuts. Dr Fox is not readily humbled, but the right&apos;s favourite cabinet minister is damaged goods.

Werritty told British businessman Harvey Boulter that if asked, he must say a meeting to discuss defence and healthcare technology attended by just Fox, Werritty and three businessmen in Dubai&apos;s five-star Shangri-La hotel in June never took place, Boulter has told the Guardian. Werritty has not responded to a request for comment. Fox apologised at the weekend for failing to bring MoD officials to meetings attended by Werritty such as the one on 17 June, at which Boulter briefed Fox about a legal dispute with the US conglomerate 3M over technology jointly developed by the Ministry of Defence&apos;s innovation unit to speed up the cost-effective detection of the superbug MRSA. The technology had been sold to 3M but the US firm had cancelled the project after it failed clinical trials in the US. Boulter was upset and wanted to ensure proper compensation and emailed 3M&apos;s lawyer saying: &quot;I had a 45-minute meeting with Dr Liam Fox, the British defence minister, on our current favourite topic \u2026 As a result of my meeting today you ought to know that David Cameron&apos;s cabinet might very shortly be discussing the rather embarrassing situation of George&apos;s [George Buckley, 3M&apos;s chief executive] knighthood.&quot; Answering questions in the House of Commons on Monday, Liam Fox said Boulter&apos;s account of the Dubai meeting was not reliable because he had initially implied that he discussed Buckley&apos;s knighthood with Fox in the June Dubai meeting, but had subsequently stated that he did not. Boulter has since said there was no discussion of Buckley&apos;s recent honour in the meeting, although he said he did discuss the potential political embarrassment it might cause when he met Werritty a day or two earlier. Werritty was furious after 3M mentioned the meeting in a lawsuit alleging Boulter was trying to blackmail them. &quot;Initially he said to me just tell everyone we didn&apos;t meet in June,&quot; Boulter said, in an interview with the Guardian. &quot;He said anybody who asked, like a journalist, tell them we didn&apos;t meet. I said I can&apos;t do that because clearly we have met. I didn&apos;t know what he was worried about. We now know it was because he wasn&apos;t who he said he was.&quot; Boulter said Werritty then urged him to deny that the subject of the lawsuit had ever been discussed. The MoD later tried to make that claim. Boulter again said he couldn&apos;t do that. Boulter said the 45-minute meeting with Fox and Werritty in Dubai covered defence technology issues which were sensitive enough to be considered classified. In particular, Boulter spent about half an hour explaining to Fox about mobile phone encryption technology that could be used by UK soldiers phoning home and potentially for operational purposes. &quot;We were talking about the technology, the customers and the applications,&quot; Boulter said. &quot;The customers are all classified, as are the applications in defence, security and intelligence. It is extremely sensitive. We didn&apos;t know Werritty was not security cleared and it was not appropriate for him to be there. I am security cleared to UK security check level and the other guys were too \u2013 one UK and one US. Fox is probably cleared to the highest level.

The card looked pretty official and when we bumped into Dr Fox at the end of the meeting and he shook my hand, I thought well thank you, you are the adviser, that&apos;s good enough for me.&quot; The truth, as Fox has been forced to admit as he fights for his job, is rather different. Werritty has been revealed to have no official role in the MoD and his greatest qualification for his self-styled business card title of &quot;adviser to Rt Hon Dr Fox MP&quot; appears to be that he was the defence minister&apos;s best man and remains a close friend. The impression must have been good, as Boulter is familiar with MoD officaldom. He now lives a wealthy life in Dubai overseeing a \u00a3450m investment fund, racing his favourite Ferrari and sailing his yacht, but an earlier part of his career was spent at the ministry advising on the breakup of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency. &quot;He looked like a normal MoD guy,&quot; Boulter reflected as he recalled his meetings with Werritty in April and June. &quot;They dress in a boring style, they all have the same haircut. He fitted in very well. He suggested he could help me brief Dr Fox as the topics I wanted to brief on. He said he would organise a meeting when the boss was in town.&quot; Boulter had his reasons for hoping he had got the right man. After a deal to sell new technology for the early detection of MRSA worldwide had gone bad, the 41-year-old decided he needed government help in the coming legal battle. The technology had been jointly developed by his company Porton and the MoD&apos;s research arm, and around \u00a340m was on the table if a sale to multinational 3M went through. Instead the deal collapsed. With such a sum at stake, Boulter spent tens of thousands of pounds on Westminster lobbyists, Tetra Strategy, to curry support and provide him with access. They pointed him to Werritty. He seemed to Boulter more than just a gatekeeper to Fox: he was actively interested in the issues and would even proffer his views on what the government might do. When Fox was in Afghanistan visiting troops in mid-June, Boulter says he bumped into Werritty at an American-style steakhouse in downtown Dubai, where over a glass of wine in the bar he told him how another of his businesses, mobile phone encryption for use by military personnel, could help the MoD in the Libyan uprising. &quot;I told him there was an opportunity to use it in the Libyan situation,&quot; Boulter said. &quot;I said I could push it to a rebel commander in Libya and if I decide I don&apos;t like him I can withdraw the licence. He seemed to think it was a great British technology. I also said I wanted to make an official offering for welfare calling to the troops.&quot; Boulter said he shared information with Werritty that was commercially sensitive and related to the government&apos;s interests in the MRSA technology called Acolyte. He told him about the state of settlement negotiations and indicated how far apart they still were on the numbers. &quot;I thought I was talking to my co-claimant in the case,&quot; he said. &quot;If he is an adviser to the minister of defence then he is my co-claimant in a high court action reaching litigation.&quot; At another stage, Boulter said Werritty asked what he wanted the MoD to do to help the legal dispute. &quot;I said ideally I want a statement from the MoD saying something like: &apos;We are disappointed Acolyte has been closed and we await the court&apos;s decision,&apos; something supportive. He said: &apos;That seems very reasonable. Let me see what I can do.&apos; He said it like what was on his card: adviser to Dr Fox.&quot; Weeks later, Werritty told Boulter on the phone that the MoD would not be giving a statement before the court judgment. Werritty seemed to be acting like a full-blown ministerial adviser and Boulter confided in him as if he were, on the assumption that he must have robust security clearance. On the subject of mobile phone encryption for troops, Boulter said there were lots of &quot;very sensitive emails on customer information that I sent to him because he was sending them to the boss. Clearly if I&apos;d have known he wasn&apos;t who he said he was I wouldn&apos;t have sent them.&quot; The event that sparked the political storm around Fox took place 41 stories above the atrium in the Shangri-La&apos;s Horizon Club business lounge, a discreet location with views across the desert emirate&apos;s ever-changing skyline. Here, on smart sofas around a screened corner table on 17 June, Fox had a 45-minute meeting with Boulter and two of his business associates about the mobile phone encryption and for the last &quot;five to 10 minutes&quot; about the MRSA legal dispute with 3M. Werritty observed quietly, according to Boulter. Later that night Boulter flew to Italy, from where he spoke to 3M&apos;s lawyer and then emailed him. &quot;As a result of my meeting today you ought to understand that David Cameron&apos;s cabinet might very shortly be discussing the rather embarrassing situation of George&apos;s knighthood ... At a headline of $30m+ you will allow the MoD to internally save face.&quot; These emails were included in court documents filed in the US and have been published by the Guardian. It sounded like the issue of 3M head George Buckley&apos;s recent knighthood had been raised at the meeting or even that Fox had agreed to do such a thing in cabinet. Not so, said the MoD and Fox. Answering questions in the House of Commons on Monday, Fox said Boulter&apos;s account of the June Dubai meeting was not reliable because he had initially implied that he discussed Buckley&apos;s knighthood with Fox, but had subsequently stated that he did not. Boulter had expected the email to remain confidential as part of the settlement negotiations with 3M. When it came out, Werritty was furious and tried to persuade Boulter to deny the meeting ever happened if anyone asked, Boulter confirmed to the Guardian. Werritty has not responded to a request for comment on Boulter&apos;s allegation. What happened at the Horizon Club was fogged further by the MoD, which initially denied the legal wrangle was discussed at all. Boulter said he was &quot;frustrated and upset that Fox issued a statement that said we didn&apos;t discuss Acolyte because it made me look like a liar to the world&quot;. On Sunday, Boulter re-issued a statement making clear the knighthood was not discussed at the meeting. It was on his mind, however. He &quot;discussed the knighthood at some length&quot; with Werritty at the steakhouse two days before the meeting with Fox. &quot;I said it was poor judgment of the government to sanction it. After all it had to go through the Cabinet Office. Werritty agreed with me that that seemed quite inappropriate. I was pointing out the obvious facts and some complicated politics that Fox needed to be aware of.&quot; Speaking about the scandal more generally, Boulter saves his toughest criticism for Fox&apos;s best man rather than the minister. &quot;It shocked me when I found out [Werritty] wasn&apos;t who he said he was,&quot; he said. &quot;It reflected poorly on Fox to let these circumstances develop in this way. He was the minister for defence and he was clearly complicit \u2026 But I think Werritty really overstepped the mark. He leveraged friendship into officialdom.&quot;", "title": "Harvey Boulter: I assumed Adam Werritty was an MoD man", "sentences": ["  Sipping jasmine tea in the spectacular atrium of Dubai&apos;s five-star Shangri-La hotel, British businessman Harvey Boulter reflected on just how convincing Adam Werritty was in the role of Liam Fox&apos;s gatekeeper.", "He now lives a wealthy life in Dubai overseeing a \u00a3450m investment fund, racing his favourite Ferrari and sailing his yacht, but an earlier part of his career was spent at the ministry advising on the breakup of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency.", "When Fox was in Afghanistan visiting troops in mid-June, Boulter says he bumped into Werritty at an American-style steakhouse in downtown Dubai, where over a glass of wine in the bar he told him how another of his businesses, mobile phone encryption for use by military personnel, could help the MoD in the Libyan uprising.", "Answering questions in the House of Commons on Monday, Fox said Boulter&apos;s account of the June Dubai meeting was not reliable because he had initially implied that he discussed Buckley&apos;s knighthood with Fox, but had subsequently stated that he did not."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-10T15:34:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/innovation-education/phil-redhead", "tags": ["Speakers"], "article": "    Phil began his career at Priory School in Slough, where he was also a New Opportunities Fund ICT Trainer, before taking up a post with the borough&apos;s Education Action Zone.

Instead of lodging with the British ambassador or checking into one of Dubai&apos;s many more modest but still thoroughly comfortable business hotels, the defence secretary glided into the marble-floored halls of The Address on 16 June after a short flight from the warzone. His choice guaranteed that whatever business he had on \u2013 and that remains the subject of intense controversy \u2013 he would also enjoy some pleasure. The 63-storey Address is shaped like a stately ocean liner and is an extraordinary oasis of luxury away from the sweltering heat of the desert kingdom. In the coffee lounge glass cases display jewels from Van Cleef and Arples, while through the magnolia-planted gardens guests paddle through five cascading pools with a swim-up wine bar offering one of Dubai&apos;s best views of the 828 metre-high Burj al-Khalifa skyscraper, the tallest building on the planet. At 6pm each evening, a pianist and a flute player strike up in the lobby with twiddly renditions of easy listening classics by the likes of Norah Jones. Outdoor lounges are scattered with beige beanbags and piped house music mixes with tweeting birds. Across a man-made turquoise lagoon a big attraction is the Dubai Mall, which is said to be the largest in the world and contains an improbable ice rink. These sybaritic circumstances were Fox&apos;s base for three nights from 16 June to 19 June, during which he attended the controversial meeting with British businessmen brokered by his close friend and self-styled adviser, Adam Werritty. Hotel records seen by the Guardian show that Fox checked into a 45th-floor serviced apartment. Hotel staff described its balcony, kitchen, living room and bedroom. The cost for the stay, which the Ministry of Defence has said it met, should have been \u00a31,800, but using a special government rate the room-only bill to the taxpayer was closer to \u00a3500. The booking was made while Fox was in Helmand by the British embassy in the United Arab Emirates, according to the hotel computer. The records also showed that Luke Coffey, Fox&apos;s special adviser, was part of his party. Werritty was staying over the same period at the only marginally less luxurious Shangri-La hotel, a short taxi ride away. Fox also used the hotel for some official business, holding a press conference in a function room on the morning of Sunday 19 June for five local journalists. One attendee said it was part of the coalition government&apos;s diplomatic and trade push in the UAE, and particularly Dubai, which is investing billions of pounds in the London Gateway port project. He discussed Libya and Afghanistan, but he also chatted to the journalists about how he learned to dive in Dubai, had got stuck in the sand in a jeep there in the 1990s, and how the seminar room reminded him of a David Lynch film. He even told them how he had managed to get tickets to the men&apos;s quarter-finals at Wimbledon. Fox knew what he was getting at The Address: as the brochure puts it, &quot;matchless elegance and luxury \u2026 exceptional service tailored to your individual tastes \u2026 blissful food and pampering&quot;.

Not from the Scarlet Pimpernel, but Labour&apos;s shadow defence secretary, Jim Murphy! Instead of shooting Fox, he shot his own fox. With enemies like this, who needs friends? Dr Fox had made a statement, full of semi-apologies, half-hearted regrets and partial mea culpas. He accepted he made mistakes. He had blurred distinctions. It was his fault, and he took full responsibility. But he was not to be blamed. He told us he had met Adam Werritty on no fewer than 18 overseas trips. Eighteen! The guy was never away, as impossible to avoid as his own shadow. He turned up on official visits, at conferences, even on family holidays. Instead of a laptop, Fox went abroad with a lapdog. Labour tried to trip the minister up by shouting. &quot;Mr Werritty was dining [in Dubai] at a nearby table,&quot; Fox said, and someone yelled scornfully, &quot;Like yer do!&quot; &quot;Resign!&quot; people shouted at random intervals. &quot;My desire is to be as transparent as possible,&quot; Fox said, and a mighty cry of &quot;What?&quot; zipped through the Commons chamber. But Tory MPs had clearly been whipped to within an inch of their lives, and cheered their man wildly throughout. Up rose Mr Murphy, with his usual expression of a funeral mute who has just heard terrible news. He paid gloomy tribute to Dr Fox&apos;s work. He admitted an &quot;interest&quot; which turns out to be, intriguingly, that the Labour frontbench had accepted \u00a310,000 from a company\u00a0involved in the imbroglio. Then he\u00a0started working through the ministerial code. At this point Fox must have known he was off the hook. On and on Murphy ploughed. &quot;Sections 5.2, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5&quot;, he intoned, like a Speak Your Weight machine with a blown fuse. He landed not a blow. The Tories began their defence. One after the other they stood up and said what a splendid fellow Dr Fox was; how wonderfully magnanimous his apology. Their gist was that this was of no importance compared to the perils faced by our brave armed forces, to whom Dr Fox dedicated his working life, apart from the time devoted to innocent socialising with Mr Werritty. (Who sounds like the genial Dickensian who adopts the poor orphan boy.) They didn&apos;t actually accuse Labour MPs of wanting to see our boys die for their party political advantage, but it hovered in the air. Dennis Skinner pointed out that it wasn&apos;t just the Guardian which had been attacking Fox \u2013 the Tory press was at it too. Dr Fox replied that it was &quot;certainly possible to keep a good bottle for too long&quot;. This is the first time Mr Skinner has ever been compared to a fine vintage wine. By the end, Fox was coasting, even seeming to imply that unlike his Tory colleagues, he thought there was something to investigate. For the moment he was free, hitching a ride home on the tumbril.

Cellcrypt is a subsidiary of a company owned by Harvey Boulter, who has made key allegations about Adam Werritty&apos;s links with Liam Fox. The company makes encrypted telephone technology, which it wanted to sell to the Ministry of Defence. The phones enable troops to phone home from Afghanistan securely. Meetings with Cellcrypt have become central to the allegations that Werritty was acting in some kind of official capacity for his cabinet minister friend and have fuelled suggestions that at some point Werritty may have benefited financially from his friendship with Fox. In June Werritty arranged for the defence secretary to meet representatives of Cellcrypt. Fox met two representatives along with Boulter, the chief executive of Porton Capital, at the five-star Shangri-La Hotel in Dubai. On Monday, in his statement to the Commons regarding Werritty, Fox turned the tables on Labour and accused the shadow defence secretary, Jim Murphy, of also accepting money from Cellcrypt. Fox said they had accepted \u00a310,000. Murphy&apos;s office said that it was true that Murphy had accepted a factfinding trip to Washington paid for by Cellcrypt. It came to \u00a38,100 and covered Murphy, his assistant Joe Carberry, his defence junior Michael Dugher and Dugher&apos;s researcher, plus an independent adviser, and it had been declared on the register of members&apos; interests in August. An aide to Murphy said: &quot;It was part of a trip to Washington and part of our procurement review. We met with over 30 companies as part of the review. We made a virtue of meeting everyone that would accept our meeting. We don&apos;t get money in opposition, but we have to consult as part of our process and so we accepted the trip. &quot;But the idea this was secret is untrue. We have had it on the register of members&apos; interests since August and put Cellcrypt up there. &quot;It was also part of a series of meetings we had over several days with among other people the Pentagon, the department for defence and thinktanks. &quot;Where companies sponsored events or visits, as was the case with a number of organisations, this was properly declared, consistent with parliamentary rules. This consistent transparency is in stark contrast to the actions of Fox, who has not answered so many of the questions that have been asked of him.&quot;", "title": "Firm at centre of Liam Fox allegations also funded Labour trip", "sentences": ["Fox met two representatives along with Boulter, the chief executive of Porton Capital, at the five-star Shangri-La Hotel in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-10T19:39:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/10/adam-werritty-silent-liam-fox", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Politics", "Liam Fox", "Adam Werritty", "UK news", "Conservatives", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "Lobbying"], "article": "The one person yet to speak about the furore surrounding Liam Fox is the man at the centre of all the allegations, Adam Werritty. The 33-year-old has not been seen or spoken publicly since the story erupted, steering clear of the spotlight as his best friend has taken all the flak. Yet Werritty&apos;s business dealings are now at the core of this affair \u2013 put centre-stage by Fox himself in his statement on Sunday, in which he accepted that Werritty has &quot;defence-related business interests&quot;, but insisted that neither he or the Ministry of Defence had ever &quot;assisted with his commercial work&quot;. During his statement to the House of Commons, Fox emphasised that Werritty had a &quot;very wide range of international relations and political links&quot; that were quite separate from and not reliant upon the MoD. In answer to a question, Fox embellished the point with peculiar language: &quot;I am confident that [Werritty] was not dependent on any transactional behaviour to maintain his income.&quot; But if Werritty hasn&apos;t profited from his friendship with Fox, which has included 40 meetings in the UK and abroad in the last 16 months, how has he made his living? Labour believes that has become a legitimate question, particularly as Werritty has led a globetrotting existence over the last two years. It has become the new focus of attack for the party, with shadow ministers demanding transparency about Werritty&apos;s arrangements as the only way of proving what Fox has claimed as fact. &quot;This was a man who was provided with regular access to Fox both in the UK and abroad, yet we have no idea whether they met alone, or with other people. We need to know the nature of these meetings,&quot; said one Labour source. Certainly, the fragments that have come out about Werritty&apos;s life over the past few days suggest someone who would need a healthy income, or at least connections to those who have one. In the most startling revelation of Monday&apos;s statement, Fox admitted he had met Werritty abroad on 18 occasions since May last year. This included conferences where they were both delegates, ministerial visits where they met as friends, and family holidays including a ski trip. In the past 12 months, it is known Werritty flew to Sri Lanka and Dubai (twice). At least one of those flights was first class. He has also travelled to Singapore and Bahrain, where he is understood to have joined the defence secretary, who was on official business. None of the flights were paid for by the Ministry of Defence, which is also &quot;99% sure&quot; taxpayers have never paid for his hotel rooms or living expenses. In Sri Lanka, Werritty has stayed at the smart Cinnamon Grand hotel in Colombo; Iran was another destination for him in the months before the general election. Without knowing details of who paid for these trips, or if Werritty and Fox met others during the time they spent together, Ursula Brennan, the MoD civil servant jointly overseeing the investigation, will find it hard to rule conclusively whether the defence secretary has breached the ministerial code or support his contention that there has been no &quot;wrongdoing&quot;. In her interim report, she said she had commissioned a &quot;trawl for the email and electronic evidence&quot; at the MoD on all 18 trips, &quot;including details of who else was present \u2026 and who attended which formal and informal events&quot;. Werritty lives in a flat in Pimlico, is understood to be a member of the Carlton Club (annual fees of up to more than \u00a31,000), and has been a regular in the Royal Oak pub near the Commons, where he and Fox have become familiar faces over the years. He does not come from a wealthy family; his father is a lecturer, who lives in St Andrews, Fife, where Werritty grew up. Having graduated from Edinburgh University with a second class honours degree in social policy, he moved to London, where he relied on Fox to get a foothold in the capital. Fox has admitted allowing him to stay in the spare room at his flat near London Bridge in 2002, and has stated that he neither requested or received any rent. The Daily Telegraph revealed on Monday that Werritty became Fox&apos;s parliamentary researcher in 2004, and Fox confirmed he was paid \u00a35,800 for his work. Thereafter, Werritty appears to have been involved in a series of ventures, none of which look likely to have made him a fortune. But it is striking how his career has dovetailed with Fox&apos;s. During his early years in London, Werritty was involved in three different health companies. He joined UK Health as a consultant \u2013 at the time, Fox was shadow health secretary. Two years later, he became director of UK Health Group Ltd, in which he and Fox were shareholders. Then he became a director of UK Health Supply Services, which has been dissolved. Another company which ran into the sand was Security Futures, a firm set up in 2005, the year Fox became shadow defence secretary. It boasted that it promoted &quot;a better understanding of asymmetric &apos;security&apos; risks that the UK faces&quot;. Not well enough, it appears, to prevent it from being dissolved. Werritty did earn a salary from Atlantic Bridge, the charity set up by Fox in 1997. Werritty became its executive director and official records show he was paid a total of \u00a390,000 between 2007 and 2010. While in London, Werritty ran the charity from room 341 in the MPs&apos; block at Portcullis House, which was provided to Fox at taxpayers&apos; expense while he was in opposition. Werritty worked for Atlantic Bridge until last year when the regulator demanded that its &quot;current activities must cease immediately&quot; because &quot;the activities of the charity have not furthered any of its other charitable purposes in any way&quot;. The charity was finally dissolved earlier this month after its remaining trustees \u2013 Fox had quit when he went into government last year \u2013 decided to close it downrather than address the Charity Commission&apos;s concerns. Werritty&apos;s name has cropped up at Companies House with two other firms; Danscotia Consulting and Todhia Ltd. But it is unclear what either of them do. Yesterday, it emerged that the businessman Harvey Boulter was paying the London lobbying firm Tetra Strategy thousands of pounds a month for help to secure contacts in defence. But it did not pay Werritty, who set up the meeting between Fox and Boulter in Dubai that has been the focus of the crisis engulfing the defence secretary. Brennan said she will now &quot;in the next phase of the investigation ... seek to confirm the dates and times of the known visits and whether there were any other visits where others were present apart from Dr Fox and Mr Werritty.&quot;", "title": "Werritty remains silent as spotlight falls on his earning and business dealings", "sentences": ["In the past 12 months, it is known Werritty flew to Sri Lanka and Dubai (twice).", "But it did not pay Werritty, who set up the meeting between Fox and Boulter in Dubai that has been the focus of the crisis engulfing the defence secretary."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-10T20:02:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/10/liam-fox-adam-werritty-editorial", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Politics", "Liam Fox", "Adam Werritty", "UK news", "Conservatives", "Lobbying"], "article": "It&apos;s not a bad political rule of thumb that a day when a prime minister makes a speech about immigration is a day when he wants to distract attention from political bad news elsewhere. That is what happened on Monday when David Cameron tried to draw some of the fire from Liam Fox&apos;s ministerial contacts with a speech promising to tighten UK border controls. But the attempt to take the spotlight off Mr Fox made no headway. Mr Fox still dominated the headlines on Monday night. The chances are that he will continue to do so for a long time to come. So he should, because Mr Fox&apos;s relationship with Adam Werritty continues to raise far more serious issues about the misconduct of ministerial business than Monday&apos;s backbench rally of support for the defence secretary allows. Monday was almost certainly the worst day in Mr Fox&apos;s political career. Throughout the ill-tempered Commons exchanges (from which Mr Cameron&apos;s absence was noted) he looked grim. At the end of the day, Mr Fox was still secretary of state for defence. But it would be a mistake to regard Mr Fox as a man who is therefore off the hook. Some media frenzies may occasionally work like that. But the politics of due governmental process is not so easily disposed of. The ministerial code is not optional. Mr Fox has questions to answer about his observance of it. On the basis of Monday&apos;s exchanges, the defence secretary is a man whose ministerial career still hangs in the balance. He still has much to account for. Mr Fox was right to apologise at the weekend for his ill-judged ministerial links with Mr Werritty. He was right, too, to make a statement about it to MPs on Monday. But making the apology and making the statement do not dispose of the serious matters to which they refer. Even Downing Street says he made serious mistakes. If an independent judge had reached the same conclusions about Mr Fox&apos;s ministerial conduct to which he himself admitted on Monday, there would be a new defence secretary by now. Mr Fox&apos;s statement raised more questions than it answered. His Labour shadow, Jim Murphy, posed several of them, listing a number of possible breaches of the ministerial code which Mr Fox is bound to uphold and which Mr Cameron is bound to enforce. These must now be investigated properly. But the Labour backbencher Chris Bryant got close to another weakness in Mr Fox&apos;s story. It is one thing to meet up with a friend when you are on a foreign ministerial trip, Mr Bryant accepted, but to do it 18 times in a little over 16 months with someone who is presenting himself to the outside world as the defence secretary&apos;s adviser? That&apos;s quite a coincidence, especially when Mr Werritty held meetings at the same time, like the one in Dubai with the private equity boss Harvey Boulter, which led directly to private meetings with the defence secretary. Who paid for Mr Werritty to be there? Whom did people like Mr Boulter think they were talking to when they met Mr Werritty, with or without Mr Fox? And what did Mr Fox himself think? He has been less than clear. The 40 meetings (Fox also met Werritty 22 times at the MoD) seem to go beyond friendship. The interim report by the MoD permanent secretary Ursula Brennan contains a number of such puzzles. Even Ms Brennan says her brief probe has revealed a grey area. She is overtly critical of the Dubai meeting and one with the new UK ambassador to Israel. All the other meetings with Mr Werritty also now need to be properly accounted for, and their commercial and financial implications explored. Mr Cameron may have good reasons for not wanting to lose Mr Fox. But both he and the cabinet secretary Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell also have a responsibility to enforce the ministerial code. That&apos;s why there is an independent adviser on ministers&apos; interests to provide advice, based in the Cabinet Office. And that is why Mr Cameron should now hand the Fox case to that adviser, Sir Philip Mawer, to investigate more fully.", "title": "Liam Fox: forty unanswered questions | Editorial", "sentences": ["That&apos;s quite a coincidence, especially when Mr Werritty held meetings at the same time, like the one in Dubai with the private equity boss Harvey Boulter, which led directly to private meetings with the defence secretary.", "She is overtly critical of the Dubai meeting and one with the new UK ambassador to Israel."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-10T20:25:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/10/liam-fox-met-adam-werritty-around-world", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Liam Fox", "Politics", "Adam Werritty", "Conservatives", "UK news", "Lobbying"], "article": "Before Monday, Liam Fox had only admitted to meeting Adam Werritty on trips to Sri Lanka and Dubai earlier this year, and then only after much media scrutiny. There had been speculation about meetings in Singapore too. But in the Commons, the defence secretary told MPs that he and Werritty had met abroad on 18 occasions in the last 16 months, and promised that the details would be published after he had finished his statement. The full list emerged after 7pm and gave remarkable details about how Werritty has tracked Fox across the globe as Fox has conducted official business. Foreign meetings The 33-year-old was in Singapore in June last year when Fox was giving a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. He met him in Abu Dhabi and Dubai days later. The following month they met at the US Central Command base in Tampa, Florida, for an &quot;informal dinner&quot; at a steakhouse with General John Allen, who replaced General David Petraeus as head of Nato forces in Afghanistan earlier this summer. Further meetings followed in Bahrain in December last year, in Hong Kong in January this year, and in Israel in February. Fox and Werritty went on a skiing trip together that month in Switzerland. In March, they met in Dubai, and in April he was on holiday with Fox and his wife in Abu Dhabi. In May, they were in Washington together, and shared a flight home to the UK on a private jet, listed as a trip &quot;on party donor&apos;s aircraft to attend the President Obama state visit&quot;. Later that month they met in Washington and Hong Kong, and they were back in Washington again in July. The list shows that Werritty also accompanied Fox and his family during a two-week holiday in Spain in August. Fox asserts that the meetings with Werritty were all private, social functions, and had nothing to do with the business he was undertaking as secretary of state. And he insists Werritty has not financially benefited from these meetings, or his friendship, either. Nonetheless, the MoD list acknowledges that Werritty was present in both a personal and business capacity at a meeting between the UAE government and British military in Dubai last December. Fox did not go into these details in his statement to MPs, saying only that &quot;as a matter of transparency I would like to inform the house I have met Mr Werritty in a social capacity in the margins of 18 trips overseas, including my annual leave&quot;. In the interim report from the MoD&apos;s chief civil servant, Ursula Brennan, she says, with some understatement, that &quot;the defence secretary&apos;s overseas visits are complex, often involving brief stopovers en route from one location to another&quot;. She says that &quot;maintaining a proper degree of separation (between downtime and official engagements) is necessary for reasons of propriety&quot;. Brennan seems to indicate she is not happy with the way Fox may have blurred the lines, even if accidentally. &quot;The department needs to ensure that a clear distinction is made between party political, personal and government business to avoid the occurrence of actual or perceived conflicts of interest,&quot; she says. She also notes the &quot;potentially grey area&quot; where personal meetings can stray into government business \u2013 which should not happen without a civil servant present. As part of her ongoing review she has commissioned a trawl for &quot;email and electronic evidence&quot; at the MoD on all of Fox&apos;s trips abroad, including his holidays, when Werritty is known to have been there. She is trying to establish &quot;who else was on these trips and who attended which formal and informal events&quot;. MoD meetings In response to a Freedom of Information request, the Guardian discovered last week that Fox had met Werritty at the MoD on 14 occasions in the last 16 months. This provoked the furore about the access he had been given, and the potential for breaches of national security. But it emerged that there were even more visits than those declared under FoI, though no explanation was given about why the initial figures were inaccurate. In her report, Brennan sets out that Werritty &quot;was present on 22 rather than 14 occasions&quot;, and that she cannot yet exclude the possibility that there may have been more visits. And though Brennan says she feels confident that most of the visits to the MoD were &quot;largely personal conversations \u2026 and that the department did not provide Mr Werritty with classified papers or briefings&quot;, the sheer number of visits caused surprise across Westminster. Fox has conceded that at least one of the 22 visits, many of which took place in the Pillared Hall coffee bar in defence headquarters, was inappropriate. This involved Fox and Werritty meeting the forthcoming British ambassador to Israel. Brennan says that, &quot;Dr Fox acknowledges that it was not appropriate for Mr Werritty to have attended such a meeting at the MoD.&quot; In all, she has found - so far - there were only four occasions out of the 22 when Fox met Werritty with others in attendance. In Fox&apos;s statement to the Commons, he said that three of these related to Sri Lanka and one was with someone &quot;known socially to both of us&quot; - presumably, the British diplomat. Fox characterised Werritty&apos;s visits as &quot;short social meetings&quot;. Despite having a large staff to support him, and all the security protocols that come with running one of the biggest and most sensitive departments in Whitehall, Brennan hints at the chaotic nature of Fox&apos;s engagement diary \u2013 saying that she has still to confirm the times and dates of all the times Werritty entered the building. She has asked for &quot;security control logs&quot; to give her a definitive number. When the list of all the meetings they had together was published last night, it emerged that Werritty&apos;s first meeting with Fox at the MoD occurred on 20 May \u2013 just after the general election. He met him again on 21 May. Business cards It was during one of their MoD meetings in June that Fox told his friend to stop using business cards with the portcullis emblem saying he was one of Fox&apos;s advisers, he said. Fox told the Commons he first learned Werritty was using them earlier that month, and at their next meeting, &quot;told him to stop using his business card stating he was my adviser&quot;. Brennan explains that she raised the issue with Fox on 23 August at a routine meeting, the day she returned to the MoD after her summer break. She had read about the cards in a story published in the Guardian on 19 August. &quot;Dr Fox confirmed that he had already dealt with the problem and that it was wrong for Mr Werritty to have used such a card,&quot; she states. Brennan says she checked Fox&apos;s claim that he had asked Werritty to stop using the cards two months earlier with one of his special advisers. &quot;He recalls that immediately after this the defence secretary and the special advisers held a meeting with Mr Werritty at which Dr Fox told [him] that this was unacceptable and he must stop issuing the business cards.&quot; Answering questions in the Commons, Fox was asked if it was true that the former chief of the defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Jock Stirrup, had warned him about his closeness to Werritty. Fox said he did not recall having that conversation. Dubai meeting  Fox did not add anything new to his account of his controversial June meeting with Dubai businessman Harvey Boulter, maintaining it was organised after Werritty bumped into Boulter in a restaurant. He insisted that he had never discussed the issue of 3M boss George Buckley&apos;s knighthood with Boulter and suggested Boulter was unreliable because he had initially implied that the knighthood was discussed but he later insisted it was not. Ursula Brennan made it clear that Fox&apos;s officials had been unaware of the meeting and that she was unhappy about that. In her interim report she said: &quot;If there is a risk that a personal meeting may stray into government business, the private secretary should ensure that an official be present.&quot; Fox&apos;s insistence that the Boulter meeting was arranged after a chance encounter is undermined by correspondence seen by the Guardian which suggests talks had taken place between Werritty and Boulter about setting up a meeting with Fox as early as March. The June meeting was the second time the defence secretary had met the Dubai businessman. The two men met in Dubai in early April when, by coincidence, Fox was in town and was able to shake the private equity boss&apos;s hand. Security  Fox says he did not discuss either commercial or defence matters during private meetings with Werritty. &quot;He had no access to classified material nor was he briefed on classified matters.&quot; The defence secretary does acknowledge that at the Dubai meeting on 17 June there was a general discussion about a communications encryption technology called Cellcrypt and how it might work for the MoD. Beyond that, there was &quot;no discussion of \u2026 any classified information&quot;. Brennan says senior MoD civil servants believe that Werritty&apos;s 22-plus visits to the department were largely personal. But since others were present at only four of them she has only Fox&apos;s word for it. She says civil servants are confident they did not provide Werritty with classified papers or briefings. Boulter says that the call encryption technology he discussed with Fox in Dubai was sensitive and that he would not have done so if he had known Werritty did not have security clearance. In particular he says he discussed the possibility of providing it for UK troops in Afghanistan which would have been highly sensitive information. Fox&apos;s diary Brennan says that during the course of her review she learned that Fox or his office had provided some diary details to Werritty, in connection with visits where Werritty was to be present. She said: &quot;Dr Fox has accepted that it is not appropriate to ask officials to provide ministerial diary information to a third party.&quot; Questioned about providing diary details to a friend Fox was unapologetic. He claimed it was reasonable for ministers to let friends and family know of their movements in order to make arrangements to meet up socially.

Such is the fate of Liam Fox, still hanging on as defence secretary by his fingernails. Sorry, I shouldn&apos;t have &quot;allowed the impression of wrongdoing&quot; over links with my friend/best man/wingman/batman/homie Adam Werritty, he said. Fair enough. But he does seem a bit naive for a defence secretary. If one looks again at the fate of the Atlantic Bridge, the neocon charity Fox set up and to which he installed Werritty as executive director, one sees that even there Liam failed to get his ducks in a row. Asked to explain its view on The Atlantic Bridge, which has now dissolved in the UK for engaging in too little charitable activity, the Charity Commission told blogger Stephen Newton that Fox, a trustee at inception, and his other homies just got it all wrong. &quot;It was their honestly held belief that they had correctly interpreted the advancement of education in a manner that was in accordance with charity law and for the public benefit.&quot; They were not knaves. They &quot;did not act dishonestly, but instead mistakenly believed they were pursuing a correct interpretation&quot;. One shouldn&apos;t pillory a man for getting it wrong. But if that becomes his modus operandi, we do have a problem. \u2022 And on the subject of Fox \u2013 whose meeting with a Dubai businessman was arranged by a paid third party \u2013 we are reminded of the next big scandal that was flagged up by Big Dave, before the general election. &quot;I&apos;m talking about lobbying \u2013 and we all know how it works,&quot; he said. &quot;The lunches, the hospitality, the quiet word in your ear, the ex-ministers and ex-advisers for hire, helping big business find the right way to get its way.&quot; We &quot;must be the party that sorts all this out&quot;, he said. Go Dave. \u2022 It is getting lively in the coalition, what with Ken Clarke slapping down Theresa May, Chris Huhne caught trashing May, and then moving effortlessly on to stick it to the transport secretary Philip Hammond. It started at the top. But it&apos;s catching. As the catgate row escalated, one of May&apos;s special advisers, Fiona Cunningham, emailed one of Clarke&apos;s advisers. &quot;If you don&apos;t shut your man up you&apos;re out of a job at the next reshuffle,&quot; the email said. Labour liked to model itself on The West Wing. This lot seem to like The Sopranos. \u2022 On Monday it was a new initiative to deal with forced marriages; 24 hours later, a women-in-business event at No 10. Both laudable; both mentioned in that document leaked last month on how the coalition seeks to win more support from women. &apos;Twas ever thus. At first sign of trouble, spin, spin, spin. \u2022 Meanwhile, last week&apos;s Guardian revelation that Horizon Nuclear is thinking of pulling out of its bid to build atomic power stations at Wylfa and Oldbury is a bit embarrassing for both Tory energy minister Charles Hendry and his Labour predecessor John Hutton. Hendry and Hutton spoke at the Conservative conference last week at a meeting on &quot;Nuclear New Build&quot; paid for by Horizon Nuclear. Horizon&apos;s chief operating officer, Alan Raymant, opened the meeting with a speech promising &quot;patience and stamina&quot; in building new power stations. Yet RWE, which together with the energy firm E.ON forms Horizon Nuclear, seems to be running out of both. Mind you, Raymant didn&apos;t totally inspire confidence: he talked about the need to double-check on safety after the Fukushima disaster, describing these kinds of disasters as &quot;high probability \u2026 sorry, low probability, high impact events&quot;. Next time, he might want to double-check the script. \u2022 Finally, whatever we think of Big Dave as PM, Berlusconi is much worse. And that&apos;s not just an off-the-cuff judgment. It&apos;s the result of detailed analysis. The French version of the website Slate categorises Silvio&apos;s biggest slip-ups by percentage. Sexist remarks 23%, gross anti-leftist insults 19%, gaffes and clownery 19%, xenophobic cliches 15%, rampant egotism 12%, antisemitism 7%, blasphemy 2%, homophobia 1.5%. The remaining 1.5% probably related to actual politics. Forgive him.

Number 10 sources privately acknowledged that it would be serious for Fox if the inquiry finds he knew Werritty was making money from his access, especially because Fox has not declared this relationship to the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence. In a fraught day Fox gave a Commons statement in which he repeatedly apologised to MPs for the serious mistakes he had made. He received full-throated support from the Tory backbenches. An interim report into his conduct by MoD permanent secretary Ursula Brennan found that since becoming defence secretary 18 months ago, Fox had met Werritty 22 times in the main MoD building and accompanied him or met him on 18 of his 48 visits abroad, including ministerial conferences and family holidays. Venues where they met include Bahrain, Washington, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi and Tampa in Florida for a Centcom meeting with General John R Allen, the commander-designate of the Isaf mission in Afghanistan. Werritty was also present socially during a four-day meeting in Washington in August when Fox met officials at the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. David Cameron continued to give Fox strong, if conditional, support on Monday by describing him as an excellent defence secretary. But in an ominous development O&apos;Donnell, the cabinet secretary, took overall charge of the second stage of the Brennan inquiry. Downing Street had not known that Fox was going to set up the first inquiry and now wants to take charge of the investigation. It is expected to be completed within seven days. In a statement accompanying the interim report No 10 said: &quot;It is clear, as Liam Fox himself said , that serious mistakes were made in allowing the distinction between professional responsibilities and personal loyalties to be blurred \u2013 and this has clearly raised concerns about impropriety and potential conflicts of interest.&quot; Cameron will be aware that the whole of the Conservative party, including the former foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind and the former Foreign Office minister David Davis, are expecting Cameron to protect Fox. The shadow defence secretary, Jim Murphy, said Fox had &quot;driven a coach and horses through the rules&quot; and added: &quot;He [Fox] cannot think a partial apology could give him a free pass around the breaches of the ministerial code.&quot; MoD officials said the initial Brennan investigation had not interviewed Werritty. Furthermore, Fox had not yet been asked if he knew whether Werritty had made money either from setting up meetings between Fox and defence contractors or from providing a confidante&apos;s knowledge to defence firms of Fox&apos;s thinking. Defence officials were clear that Fox personally received no payment from Werritty or from his clients. They also said Werritty had directly arranged only one meeting between the defence secretary and a defence contractor. It was acknowledged that this meeting, in Dubai on 17 June, had been inappropriate and should have included civil servants. Defence officials also insisted there was no evidence of Fox having divulged classified material to his friend, but the MoD accepted the two men had discussed defence issues. Pressed on whether Werritty gained commercially from his longstanding friendship with Fox, defence officials said: &quot;There is not any occasion when any payment has been made or passed. There is no defence relationship or commercial relationship that he [Werritty] has which he has gained from by being a friend of the secretary of state.&quot; Asked whether Werritty had a financial relationship with defence companies, Fox&apos;s aides said &quot;you need to ask Mr Werritty that&quot;, before adding: &quot;He works in international relations, attends security conferences and has private clients.&quot; Repeatedly pressed to say in the Commons if Werritty had received cash from clients due to his access to Fox, the normally plain-speaking defence secretary said: &quot;When it comes to the pecuniary interests of Mr Werritty in those conferences, I am absolutely confident that he was not dependent on any transactional behaviour to maintain his income.&quot; He said &quot;he has a very wide range of long standing business, international relations and political links of his own&quot; adding &quot;he has not been involved in any defence procurement issues&quot;. Brennan&apos;s interim report \u2013 published as Fox defended his conduct in the Commons \u2013 shows : \u2022 Fox allowed Werritty to organise a meeting between him and a defence contractor in Dubai without informing civil servants. \u2022 Werritty had regular access to Fox&apos;s diary, something Fox agreed was inappropriate, and used knowledge of Fox&apos;s movements to arrange meetings for defence contractors. \u2022 Werritty was present at a meeting between Fox and the British ambassador designate to Israel, something Fox admitted was wrong. \u2022 Fox&apos;s diary failed to keep a proper distinction between personal, political and government business, especially on overseas trips. \u2022 &quot;Confusion existed about who is or is not a member of the ministerial party&quot; on these trips. \u2022 Fox knew that Werritty was distributing a business card describing himself as adviser to the defence secretary in June, and told him to stop, but allowed him to produce a second card still describing himself as an adviser. He did not inform Brennan of the episode until she raised the issue after seeing a Guardian report two months later. Fox and his family then went on holiday with Werritty two months later in Spain, suggesting the use of the business card was forgiven. Strikingly the prime minister declined to refer the issue to Sir Philip Mawer, the independent adviser on ministerial standards. Mawer can only investigate potential breaches if they are passed to him by the prime minister. Nick Boles, one of the Tory backbenchers defending Fox, said: &quot;We should not elevate the ministerial code into status of laws handed down by Moses&quot;. Fox repeatedly recognised the seriousness of his errors and was, for the most part, not tempted by the support for him on his own benches to try to attack his detractors. But as he neared the close of his hour long statement, he said &quot;When confronted with these situations, we sometimes find unexpected resilience&quot;.  &quot;What&apos;s unacceptable is constant sniping and innuendo,&quot; he added.  Unanswered questions Has Adam Werritty benefited financially from his links with Liam Fox? Answering questions in the House of Commons Fox used a curious form of words, saying he was &quot;confident that Werritty was not dependent on any transactional behaviour&quot;. Asked later how Fox knew that Werritty had not benefited, officials said his friend had assured him of the fact. Why did Werritty travel to Dubai twice and arrange a meeting between Fox and a businessman? Fox said Werritty did not benefit financially from his role setting up the meeting with Dubai-based businessman Harvey Boulter. Boulter and lobbying firm Tetra Strategy also say they didn&apos;t pay him. So why did Werritty go to all the trouble? And who paid for his flights? Why did Fox spend three days in Dubai at the taxpayer&apos;s expense in June when he only had two engagements there \u2013 one of which his officials were unaware of? The MoD has confirmed that it paid the bill at the exclusive Address hotel. But Fox is understood to have had just one official engagement at a military facility, and the meeting with Boulter that his civil servants were not aware of. When did Fox become aware Werritty was describing himself as his adviser and what did he do about it? Fox said he learned in June his friend was distributing business cards describing himself as the defence secretary&apos;s adviser and immediately told him to stop. But did he previously sanction Werritty representing himself as an adviser or envoy? What exactly was Werritty&apos;s role in Sri Lanka? Fox suggested that Werritty had taken over his work with the Sri Lankan Development Trust, a fund established to promote development following the conflict on the island. Was Werritty being paid for this work, and was he acting as Fox&apos;s envoy to Sri Lanka despite foreign office concern about Fox&apos;s connections with the Colombo government?", "title": "Liam Fox battles to save career as PM gives only conditional support", "sentences": ["It was acknowledged that this meeting, in Dubai on 17 June, had been inappropriate and should have included civil servants.", "Brennan&apos;s interim report \u2013 published as Fox defended his conduct in the Commons \u2013 shows : \u2022 Fox allowed Werritty to organise a meeting between him and a defence contractor in Dubai without informing civil servants.", "Why did Werritty travel to Dubai twice and arrange a meeting between Fox and a businessman?", "Fox said Werritty did not benefit financially from his role setting up the meeting with Dubai-based businessman Harvey Boulter.", "Why did Fox spend three days in Dubai at the taxpayer&apos;s expense in June when he only had two engagements there \u2013 one of which his officials were unaware of?"], "publicationDate": "2011-10-11T00:49:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/11/libya-sirte-battle-gaddafi-fighters", "tags": ["Libya", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "World news", "Muammar Gaddafi"], "article": "     The stories of some of those inside Ibn Sana hospital in Sirte do not add up. Hamad Ashrak Ali from Sudan is lying on a bed in the hospital&apos;s basement. He shows us his wound before explaining the circumstances of it. He has been shot through the side. The bullet exited through one buttock \u2013 the wound is becoming septic. He says he came from Abyei in his own country to Sirte to earn money: &quot;I thought I could earn money here by loading trucks.&quot; He does not explain why he chose Gaddafi&apos;s hometown in particular and claims at first to have been in the hospital with his wound for 50 days. But his wound is relatively recent, the muscles still pronounced. He has not spent almost two months in a hospital bed. &quot;Kids were doing handbrake turns,&quot; \u2013 doughnuts, he calls them. &quot;Someone fired a gun and I was shot.&quot; He is asked again how long he has been in hospital. He changes his story. &quot;Since April,&quot; he says. A bearded fighter from the forces of the NTC suggests quietly that Hamad is lying. Other fighters say they have a list and know who are the mercenaries and pro-Gaddafi fighters in the hospital. Not far away an emaciated man struggles up from his bed, stick thin. Other patients in this dreadful place seem comatose, afflicted with wounds long gone rotten, people in desperate need of evacuation. But for now there is nowhere for them to go. Not even the Red Cross has been able to evacuate the bombed out hospital. The nearby field hospitals are full, as is the hospital in Misrata. So they are stuck in this shattered shell. Outside on the street, a three-car convoy drives by towards the Ouagadougou conference centre. Skinny men with dark-skinned, emaciated faces are packed into two cars, with more sitting slumped in open boots. Recent deserters from the pro-Gaddafi forces, who have been fighting to defend this city for a fallen and defeated regime, they are guarded by NTC fighters in the final car. As the new government force push forward from the east and west towards the sea, life in Gaddafi&apos;s home town and in his second capital is revealed. The pro-Gaddafi forces \u2013 for so long invisible in their positions, where they have poured down fire on the advancing fighters \u2013 have been revealed for what they are. Ordinary men, frightened, who now want only to survive by surrendering, hiding in the hospital or trying to escape with fleeing civilians. What those civilians have been through has also been revealed as the battle lines move forward. In one modest home, its bedrooms turned upside down by the advancing fighters now pinned down on a nearby corner, a child&apos;s homework on the governance of ancient Greece, lies on a cushion. There is a little food in the kitchen, although the fridge is empty, suggesting how hard life has been for those forced to live through the siege of Sirte. But other houses tell a different story. The large terracotta villa of Naqib Ramadan Nasr is close to the television and radio station not far from Dubai Street, the main road that crosses Sirte from west to east where the frontline was located on Monday. Ahmed Brasai, an NTC fighter shows off what he has found inside the house, whose large rooms are ornately and expensively furnished. He holds a sheaf of photographs. The owner of the house with Gaddafi. A picture of Moatissim Gaddafi shaking hands at a military parade, and most strange of all a picture of another of Gaddafi&apos;s sons, the feared Khamis in uniform, disembodied and rising against a pearly sky like some kind of saint. &quot;Look at this piece of paper we found inside the house.&quot; He showed a formal document listing names of people, their makes of car and number plates, with the name of a regime official scrawled on the back \u2013 Ahmed Ibrahim, the brother of Gaddafi&apos;s spokesman Moussa Ibrahim. Four hundred metres away was the frontline \u2013 the television station whose huge white dishes are visible against the trees \u2013 now silenced. Next to it, within a little mosque with a green tipped spire, snipers fire at the advancing gun trucks and the fighters on foot. Rocket-propelled grenades, fired by pro-Gaddafi fighters, exploded in the air above as men run back. Some ground was gained, only a little lost, the frontline in places less than two miles from the sea.

Werritty is likely to be interviewed at the Cabinet Offfice, and the interview could take place later on Tuesday, according to Whitehall sources.

The ICC&apos;s likely reversal after years of planning would be a demoralising outcome for English cricket, with both the MCC and the England and Wales Cricket Board championing Test cricket in the face of mounting apathy from other Test\u2011playing nations. ESPN Star Sports is thought to be pessimistic about the revenue-earning potential of a World Test Championship in India, its chief commercial market, even though India remain third in the Test rankings after their 4-0 whitewash in England this summer and look to be certain qualifiers. The ICC chief executive, Haroon Lorgat, has been an enthusiastic advocate of the introduction of a Test Championship, but it now seems likely to be replaced by the Champions Trophy, the least popular of the ICC&apos;s three global one-day tournaments, but seemingly impossible to kill off. Instead of three five-day Tests, Lord&apos;s will be offered the chance to be one of the hosts for more one-day cricket. The ICC confirmed after a meeting of the executive board in Dubai that a Test championship remained the &quot;preferred option&quot;, but that the board &quot;recognised the significant commercial challenge in trying to replace the Champions Trophy&quot;. The statement went on: &quot;Without the support and consent of the ICC&apos;s broadcast partner, ESPN Star Sports, the financial implications on the members and the development of the game would be significant.&quot; Lorgat&apos;s expression of disappointment did not begin to capture the frustration at Lord&apos;s as attempts to bring a more marketable framework to Test cricket foundered. &quot;It would be unfortunate if the Test Championship is delayed to 2017,&quot; Lorgat said, &quot;but the board needs to balance several objectives.&quot; But the tournament has been ill thought through, despite endless committee meetings at considerable expense, with the question of what would happen if the semi-finals were drawn seeming to take ICC officials largely unawares. Lord&apos;s was awarded only one Test in 2013 \u2013 against Australia \u2013 in the belief that the ground would also stage the inaugural World Test Championship, which involved semi-finals and finals fought out between the top four Test nations in the world, with England to follow up their No1 Test ranking by winning the play-offs in front of their own supporters. England is already set to stage 12 limited-overs internationals in 2013, with five ODIs against New Zealand and a further five ODIs and two T20s against Australia. Lord Woolf, a former Lord Chief Justice, who is carrying an independent review into the governance of the ICC, is charged with ensuring &quot;better decision making to ensure that strategic goals are met effectively&quot;, and the evidence of the ICC&apos;s problems piled up before him as the executive board also backtracked on the use of new technology to aid umpiring decisions. Thanks primarily to resistance from India, the ICC has abandoned attempts to introduce mandatory use of the Decision Review System after only three months. India&apos;s board president N Srinivasan had condemned Hot Sport technology as inadequate after an England tour in which Rahul Dravid suffered several contentious dismissals and had promised to oppose its use at the ICC. The adoption of Hot Spot, in common with ball-tracking technology, will now be subject to a bilateral agreement between participating boards \u2013 and India wants no part of it. There is talk of independent testing, but in the meantime players and spectators will have to make the best of it. Ireland have also learned what qualifying system will be used for the next World Cup. The top two teams in the eight-team Associates and Affiliates ODI 50-over League, which continues until October 2013, will progress automatically. There will then be a further 10-team qualifying event, with the two finalists from that event also qualifying for the World Cup proper in Australia and New Zealand in 2015. At least that is the decision at the moment.", "title": "Lord's suffers Test Championship blow as ICC scraps mandatory DRS rule", "sentences": ["The ICC confirmed after a meeting of the executive board in Dubai that a Test championship remained the &quot;preferred option&quot;, but that the board &quot;recognised the significant commercial challenge in trying to replace the Champions Trophy&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-11T11:40:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/11/liam-fox-control-lobbying", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Liam Fox", "Defence policy", "Politics", "Business", "UK news", "Lobbying"], "article": "There are many questions thrown up by Liam Fox&apos;s relationship with Adam Werritty, but perhaps the most significant is this: if the MoD isn&apos;t paying Werritty, who is? It&apos;s the question most in need of an answer, but the one we&apos;re least likely to get. Which of Werritty&apos;s &quot;defence-related business interests&quot; have had access to the defence secretary? We now know about the &quot;chance meeting&quot; in Dubai between Liam Fox and the private equity firm Porton Capital. We may never know who funded the rest of Werrity&apos;s trips abroad. But we might have known had the government delivered on its pledge to &quot;shine the light of transparency on lobbying&quot;. Ahead of the general election, Cameron promised that he&apos;d &quot;force our politics to come clean about who is buying power and influence&quot;, because, he said, he believes &quot;secret corporate lobbying \u2026 is why people are so fed up with politics&quot;. In May last year, in a concession to the Lib Dems, we saw a commitment from the coalition to deliver on this pledge, with the introduction of a compulsory register of lobbyists. The policy is straightforward enough: a decent lobbyists&apos; register would reveal who is lobbying whom, about what, and how much money is being spent to influence our politicians. It requires a quarterly filing from lobbyists (above a minimum financial threshold) on a public register, some monitoring, sanctions and enforcement powers, and that&apos;s it. The US has one, Canada too, Australia and Germany to an extent. The public administration select committee, which called for a statutory register in January 2009, described a compulsory register as &quot;proportionate and effective&quot;. The committee&apos;s then chair, the parliamentary reformer Tony Wright, echoed Cameron&apos;s words: &quot;There is a public interest in knowing who is lobbying whom about what&quot;, he said. And yet, since May&apos;s agreement, the government has effectively sat on its hands. Eighteen months on, we are still no nearer to having public scrutiny of the UK&apos;s \u00a32bn lobbying industry. We&apos;re told that a consultation on the register, which has been due since last autumn, is imminent. As things stand, Werritty&apos;s actions look like those of a lobbyist. What&apos;s more, it&apos;s apparent that he&apos;s trading on his friendship with Fox, first running a health consultancy when Fox was shadow health secretary, then a defence consultancy. Had the prime minister heeded his own words when he described lobbying &quot;as the next big scandal waiting to happen&quot;, this latest crisis may have been averted. Werritty, and the hundreds like him, would be signed-up lobbyists. We would know who Werritty&apos;s paymasters are, and his dealings would be subject to public and parliamentary scrutiny. Fox is rightly in the dock. But it&apos;s high time those that trade on their friends in high places were made accountable too.", "title": "The Liam Fox affair shows we need tighter controls on lobbying | Tamasin Cave", "sentences": ["We now know about the &quot;chance meeting&quot; in Dubai between Liam Fox and the private equity firm Porton Capital."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-11T12:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/11/shangri-la-liam-fox-adam-werritty", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Liam Fox", "Adam Werritty", "Politics", "UK news", "Dubai", "Conservatives", "Lobbying"], "article": "The Shangri-La hotel, with its five-star facilities, rooftop swimming pool and \u00a3350-a-night rooms, is not the kind of place where anyone on a tight or even moderate budget would stay. Even a pot of tea comes in at over \u00a35 and an expense account would seem essential to all but the richest business traveller. But this is where Adam Werritty checked in on at least one trip to Dubai this year when travelling, in the words of the Ministry of Defence, &quot;in a private capacity&quot;. And travelling in a private capacity is what the MoD says the close friend and best man of the defence secretary, Liam Fox, has been doing when he has shown up again and again, all around the world, at the side of the defence secretary over the past 18 months. Werritty&apos;s movements have led to a growing sense of mystery about where he has been getting the money to travel the world, often to the same places as Fox and in comfortable style. Since Fox took office Werritty has been to Florida, Bahrain, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Washington, Singapore, Israel and Spain, each time meeting the secretary of state for defence \u2013 19 trips in total in which he saw Fox. Details about where his money comes from are scant. Over a four-year period he appears to have been paid \u00a390,000 in salary for his role as executive director of Fox&apos;s charity Atlantic Bridge. But that is now defunct, closed down following a Charity Commission investigation. Accounts filed at the Charity Commission show that in 2008 and 2009 alone the organisation spent more than \u00a315,000 on travel, although that would not necessarily relate to Werritty alone. Certainly, hotel records at the Shangri-La in Dubai seen by the Guardian name the charity as the &quot;company&quot; under which he booked in, but hotel staff could not confirm if the charity had paid. Either way the record showed Werritty certainly spared no expense, selecting one of the more expensive suites in an already expensive hotel. He took a &quot;Horizon deluxe&quot; room on the 40th floor of the hotel in downtown Dubai, one level below the business lounge where Fox met defence industry businessman Harvey Boulter on 18 June in a meeting brokered by Werritty to discuss a possible defence contract and a legal battle involving the MoD. The room currently costs \u00a3320 per night, which means Werritty was spending the same for his room as the records showed Fox did in his rather more elevated capacity as defence secretary when he stayed in the hotel in April. The 41st floor Horizon business lounge is a good place to conduct business. Screened booths fitted with leather sofas are accessed via a manned reception desk and staff take their duty to keep the area exclusive seriously, repeatedly demanding your room number if you wander in for a look. It also emerged yesterday that a pro-Israeli lobbying organisation, Bicom, paid for Werritty&apos;s flight and hotel bill to attend a conference in Israel in 2009 where he was asked to join a panel and talk about Iran. The Herzliya conference was one of the events listed by the Ministry of Defence at which he met Fox. Amid questions as to whether Werritty has been earning money off the back of his access to and relationship with Fox, the defence secretary has said Werritty &quot;has a very wide range of long-standing business, international relations and political links of his own&quot;. Werritty&apos;s name appears at Companies House with two firms, Danscotia Consulting and Todhia Ltd, but it is unclear what either of them do. It is likely that the cabinet secretary, Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell, who interviewed Werritty on Tuesday, will have wanted to know what his business and political relations are. Werritty has so far not made any public statements. Pressed to say in the Commons on Monday if Werritty had received cash from clients due to his access to Fox, the defence secretary said: &quot;When it comes to the pecuniary interests of Mr Werritty in those conferences, I am absolutely confident he was not dependent on any transactional behaviour to maintain his income.&quot; It seems Werritty also chose to eat in one of Dubai&apos;s more expensive restaurants. Boulter said he bumped into him in June, the night before he met Fox for the meeting in the Horizon business lounge that sparked the whole Werritty/ Fox scandal. Werritty was dining at Ruth&apos;s Chris American steakhouse. It is the kind of eaterie that attracts people who prize flavour over economy; fillet steaks sell for \u00a350 each and Maine Lobster goes for even more. To uncork the most expensive wine, a 1996 Chateau Cheval Blanc from Bordeaux, you need at least \u00a33,000, though there is no suggestion Werritty placed an order. Air fares Adam Werritty is known to have made 18 trips abroad over 14 months where Liam Fox was present but the question of how he paid for most of them remains a mystery. Travelling business class, those flights would have cost the 33-year-old more than \u00a338,000, according to Guardian estimates. Assuming Werritty paid for his own accommodation in five-star hotels the estimated 83 nights away could have cost up to another \u00a316,000. Even if he had just stayed one night at each destination, then the total cost of the trips would have reached \u00a340,132.

Those\u00a0in trouble routinely resort\u00a0to euphemism and obfuscation, and yet Liam Fox&apos;s crimes against syntax still stand out as in a class of their own. Consider the torture he inflicted on the language in his Sunday statement. It began: &quot;I accept that it was a mistake to allow distinctions to be blurred between my professional responsibilities and my personal loyalties to a friend.&quot; Distinctions to be blurred. What a choice phrase that is, its use of the passive voice so deliberate and so telling. Fox did not say: &quot;I blurred the distinction.&quot; Instead, by using the passive, he picked up his offence with a pair of sterilised tongs, sealed it in a plastic bag and placed it as far away from himself as he could. That use of the passive turned his sin from one of commission to omission. &quot;You know what distinctions are like,&quot; he was saying. &quot;They&apos;re always itching to be blurred. My error was not to stop them.&quot; I had a flatmate back in my student days who, rather than admit he&apos;d not done the washing-up, would say: &quot;Dishes have been left.&quot; The passive is grammar&apos;s way of telling you somebody is hiding something.     Illustration by Belle Mellor    In the House of Commons, however, the defence secretary surpassed himself. Asked the decisive question in this affair \u2013 did Adam Werritty profit financially from his access to Fox? \u2013 the minister came up with this extraordinary rendition of the language: &quot;When it comes to the pecuniary interests of Mr Werritty in those conferences, I am absolutely confident that he was not dependent on any transactional behaviour to maintain his income.&quot; That formulation was so tortured that Radio 5 Live asked its listeners to volunteer translations. The think-tanker Sunder Katwala floated the interpretation that perhaps Werritty was on a fixed\u00a0retainer for his services, one that did not vary according to whether Fox did or did not give the clients what they\u00a0wanted. Whatever the actual meaning, only a person apparently nervous of full transparency and its consequences would use so opaque a sentence. In other words there is more than linguistic pedantry at stake here. These weasel statements from Fox have come in tandem with his repeated insistence that he has apologised, to the prime minister, parliament and the country. But an apology that is so heavily caveated, convoluted and obscure is no apology at all. It lacks the core elements of genuine apology: full disclosure and a precise admission of culpability. Perhaps he felt such a statement would have eaten up too much Commons time. For there is much Fox needs to confess and to clarify; indeed, the list gets longer each time he or anyone else involved in this story opens their mouth, the picture rendered even murkier by the latest Guardian discovery of Werritty&apos;s Dubai hotel records. Fox could start by admitting that his initial response to the revelations about his association with Werritty \u2013 which he called &quot;wild&quot; and baseless&quot; \u2013 was far from the truth. The charges were neither wild nor baseless. He could then admit that he did not at first offer a full account of the closeness of his ties. The number of meetings between the two has had to be revised upward, with the current figure at 40 \u2013 though that does not include possible encounters in the UK off the premises of the Ministry of Defence. Given how tight the connection between them, it would be a surprise if they had never seen each other outside the MoD. Fox&apos;s allies are clinging to the line that nothing improper happened at any of these meetings, that no state secrets were discussed and that the minister made no financial gain. But that is to miss the point. The reason why we have rules ensuring civil servants sit in on, and take minutes of, ministerial meetings is so that power is not wielded unchecked. We entrust the money we give in tax \u2013 and, in Fox&apos;s case, the lives of our servicemen and women \u2013 to ministers on the assumption that their decisions and conduct are monitored. It&apos;s the same reason people are justifiably outraged at education department officials using private email addresses to get round freedom of information rules. If Werritty was allowed to avoid the usual procedures, including security vetting \u2013 thereby gaining access normally granted only to government officials \u2013 then it is not simply a breach of some stuffy rule. The public expectation that its interests are protected will have been violated. As the former special adviser John McTernan has argued, cabinet ministers&apos; most precious assets are &quot;their time, their attention and their intelligence&quot;, and Fox gave Werritty the unimpeded run of all three. Given the competing demands on a defence secretary involved in two conflicts abroad, to have made a priority of the demands of an old mate is a gross failure of judgment and in itself sufficient grounds, says McTernan, to disqualify Fox for his post. What if Fox gave the full apology he has so far withheld \u2013 would that be enough? No. Only in politics is the mere act of saying sorry deemed to be sufficient punishment. You don&apos;t see rioters walk away from court simply because they had the grace to put their hands up. Nor can they evade a jail sentence by regretting that they had allowed &quot;the distinction between legal and illegal to be blurred&quot;. Even Wayne Rooney gets a three-match ban for blurring the distinction between his studs and an opponent&apos;s leg. But somehow politics is placed in a separate, more convenient, category. In politics, a quick mention of the s-word is meant to close the matter, enabling everyone \u2013 including the culprit \u2013 to move on, as if simply saying that you take responsibility is the same as taking it. It wasn&apos;t always this way. When Hugh Dalton blurted out the secrets of his 1947 budget, he did not get away with a passive statement of regret that &quot;disclosures have been made&quot;, but paid with his job. Nor did Peter Carrington merely rue that the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands had been allowed to become &quot;blurred&quot; \u2013 as Fox would doubtless describe the Argentinian invasion of 1982 \u2013 but resigned as foreign secretary, even though it was his department rather than he who was at fault. Read John Profumo&apos;s resignation statement with its admission that &quot;I misled you and my colleagues and the House&quot;, and you will find nary a passive verb in sight. In recent times the apology has become the pain-free substitute for resignation. There are noble exceptions \u2013 Estelle Morris stepped down, harshly deeming herself out of her depth, while last year David Laws could have clung on but chose not to. Yet most of today&apos;s politicians think that a simple sorry will\u00a0do. It will not \u2013 and David Cameron, always so quick to tell those with less money or power that they must face up\u00a0to their responsibilities, should prove\u00a0that he understands that. If Fox\u00a0hasn&apos;t the decency to quit, Cameron\u00a0should fire him.", "title": "Sorry is not enough.

They reveal that Werritty booked into the five-star Shangri-La hotel earlier this year describing his position as &quot;office of Dr Liam Fox&quot; and naming his company as &quot;Atlantic Bridge&quot;, the defence secretary&apos;s controversial rightwing charity which had close links to a group of powerful American business lobbyists. Hotel staff said it was normal, but not guaranteed, for the named company to pay all or part of the bill. Werritty also gave a contact address at the houses of parliament. The official explanation of Werritty&apos;s role in Fox&apos;s life is being increasingly called into doubt by evidence from countries where the pair travelled. Politicians in Colombo, the Sri Lankan commercial capital, revealed that they too assumed that Werritty was an official adviser when he travelled there before and after Fox joined the cabinet. Ravi Karunanayake, an opposition MP in Colombo, confirmed meeting Fox in 2009. &quot;I simply thought he [Werritty] was an assistant or an official or something similar,&quot; he told the Guardian. Channel 4 claimed Werritty was being asked by the Sri Lankan government to help them lobby for arms and aviation supplies, although its sources have not been confirmed. Lord Bell, whose PR firm Bell Pottinger worked for the Sri Lankan government up until the end of last year, said that Werritty had attended some meetings that his firm had held with the Sri Lankan government but he could not say in what capacity or why he was present. After a big show of support for Fox in the Commons on Monday, there were some private signs that Tories were still disturbed by what they had heard, and were withholding judgment. Werritty was interviewed by a senior Cabinet Office civil servant over claims that he may have profited from his close personal relationship with the defence secretary. It is understood Werritty has claimed that the funding for his trips did not come from defence contractors, but a variety of international Atlanticist philanthropists. He was interviewed at a location away from Westminster by Sue Grey, the long-standing Cabinet Office civil servant responsible for propriety and ethics. There was no requirement for him to meet with civil servants since he is not a government or Conservative party employee. But Werritty&apos;s willingness to co-operate is essential if Fox is to survive in cabinet as Downing Street has privately made it clear the defence secretary will be in serious difficulties if it could be shown that some of Werritty&apos;s income is derived directly or indirectly from his knowledge of Fox&apos;s thinking on defence issues, or worse, from his privileged access to Fox&apos;s diary. Last night it also emerged that the prime minister&apos;s press secretary, Gabby Bertin, was paid \u00a325,000 by a major US drug company to work as a researcher for Fox&apos;s charity while he was shadow health secretary. Bertin, who is now David Cameron&apos;s press secretary, was\u00a0paid by the pharmaceutical firm Pfizer to\u00a0work for Fox&apos;s Atlantic Bridge charity. Bertin was a close colleague of Adam Werritty, Fox&apos;s best man and self-styled adviser. The Guardian also understands that Werritty, 33, will be recalled to give further evidence if Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell, the cabinet secretary, and Ursula Brennan, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence, believe they have not had proper disclosure of his business interests, which will be crucial to establish whether he was able to profit from his friendship with Fox \u2013 something the defence secretary has denied. It is understood that the Cabinet Office is asking Werritty to give written details of his income, including some bank statements. The inquiry is being overseen by O&apos;Donnell. No 10 is aware it cannot afford to be seen to be conducting a whitewash inquiry as David Cameron has courted controversy by refusing to refer the issue to Sir Philip Mawer, the government&apos;s independent adviser of ministerial interests. Mawer is kept on a \u00a330,000 retainer, but cannot initiate an inquiry into a potential breach of the ministerial code unless the prime minister, in consultation with the cabinet secretary, refers the issue to him. Downing Street tried to stonewall any details about the terms of reference of the inquiry, saying simply that all the facts would be established and all the questions being asked will be put to Werritty. In the Commons, the shadow deputy leader, Harriet Harman, pressed Nick Clegg to refer the issue to Mawer, saying it went to the heart of trust in government. She said: &quot;The deputy prime minister has always lectured us on high standards in public office, but while the defence secretary, by his own admission, has fallen short of those standards, the government have failed to refer him to \u2026 Mawer. &quot;Does that not show that they are prepared to sacrifice high standards in public office to protect the secretary of state?&quot; Clegg replied by implying that the cabinet secretary will decide if Fox has broken the code. He said: &quot;I am very clear, of course, that everybody in this government should abide by the very highest available standards and by the ministerial code, both the spirit and the letter, and that is exactly what the cabinet secretary has been asked to look into and to adjudicate on in his report.&quot; Cameron has said Fox made &quot;serious mistakes&quot; in his ties to his former best man, but appears willing to keep him if there is no evidence Fox knew Werritty was gaining from his numerous contacts with Fox. According to a list of meetings released by the Ministry of Defence on Monday, the pair met during the minister&apos;s visits to Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Florida, Bahrain, Hong Kong, Israel, Washington and Sri Lanka. The meetings included one with a senior US general. Fox said they did not discuss &quot;commercial or defence matters, he [Werritty] had no access to classified documents, nor was he briefed on classified matters&quot;. The hotel records in Dubai seen by the Guardian show that Fox took a room in the same hotel on 3 April, when Werritty was also understood to be staying there. It was during that stay that Werritty first introduced Fox to the British defence industry businessman Harvey Boulter in the lobby cafe of the hotel. According to the booking records, Werritty took a room in the 40th-floor executive area which provides exclusive access to the business lounge where he and Fox met Boulter on 18 June in a meeting to discuss a possible defence contract and a legal battle involving the MoD. It is not certain the booking relates to that occasion. The details relate to 2011 but do not specify the dates he was there, and it is possible Fox was unaware of how Werritty was describing himself. But even if the record does not relate to either of the two meetings Fox had with Werritty in Dubai in April or June, the fact Werritty travelled under the auspices of Fox and gave the Fox-founded charity, Atlantic Bridge, as his company will fuel concern about the proximity of their working relationship.

Asked on Wednesday morning whether he should quit, Fox said: &quot;I should carry on doing the job I&apos;m meant to do \u2013 the job I&apos;m paid for.&quot; However, the controversy shows no sign of dying down. On Tuesday night, Fox issued a statement in response to a report in the Sun relating to the burglary of his home at a crucial point of the general election campaign in April 2010. He said he did not know why journalists had been led to believe he had been alone in the flat on the night of the burglary, when a friend had in fact been staying with him. The defence secretary added that the friend in question was not Werritty, his former flatmate who met him on overseas trips 18 times in 16 months. Jesme Baird, his wife, had been stranded in Hong Kong due to the Icelandic volcano ash cloud, he said. &quot;As I told the police at the time, a friend was staying in the guest room \u2026 for the sake of clarity, it wasn&apos;t Adam Werritty,&quot; Fox said. &quot;I was a victim of a violent crime, and I&apos;m appalled at being portrayed as having something to hide. We&apos;re trying to establish why the media were given the impression I was alone.&quot; A 17-year-old from Bermondsey in south London was eventually convicted of carrying out the burglary on Fox&apos;s London Bridge flat. His laptop computer, a mobile phone and the keys to his Skoda car were taken in the raid. The thief or thieves drove the car away, but later abandoned it. Briefing papers for the second debate between party leaders \u2013 which took place on the night after the burglary \u2013 were believed to have been in the vehicle. After the incident, some journalists, including those at the BBC, were allegedly briefed that Fox had been at home alone. The focus on the burglary \u2013 dismissed as an example of Westminster &quot;gossip, innuendo and tittle-tattle&quot; by the employment minister, Chris Grayling, on Wednesday morning, came as fresh doubt was cast on Fox&apos;s claims that Werritty was operating &quot;in a private capacity&quot; when the men met in Dubai this year. Hotel records seen by the Guardian reveal that Werritty booked into the five-star Shangri-La hotel earlier this year, describing his position as &quot;office of Dr Liam Fox&quot; and naming his company as &quot;Atlantic Bridge&quot;, the defence secretary&apos;s controversial rightwing charity, which has close links to a group of powerful US business lobbyists.

Ravi Karunanayake, an opposition MP in Colombo, confirmed meeting Fox in 2009. &quot;I simply thought he [Werritty] was an assistant or an official or something similar,&quot; Karunanayake told the Guardian. David Cameron is unlikely to be able to avoid the allegations surrounding his defence secretary at prime minister&apos;s questions later on Wednesday. Cameron has so far offered solid but conditional support for Fox, saying the defence secretary had made &quot;serious mistakes&quot;, but that he was waiting for the results of an inquiry by the cabinet secretary, Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell, before reaching a judgment. Fox pulled out of a Wednesday press conference he was due to hold in Paris for &quot;logistical&quot; reasons, and will also not attend a keel-laying ceremony in Barrow on Thursday, the MoD said. A spokeswoman said the cancellation of his visit was unconnected to the current controversy over his links with Werritty. His place is expected to be taken by another minister from the department. In recent days, supporters of the defence secretary have hit out at what they have claimed are &quot;insinuations&quot; about Fox&apos;s private life. Speaking on BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme, Grayling acknowledged that &quot;gossip is certainly circulating&quot; but said Fox and his wife seemed to him to be &quot;a very happily married couple&quot;. &quot;If you look around the Westminster village, you will find all kinds of wild gossip about all kinds of individuals in all parties. That doesn&apos;t mean they are not good at their jobs,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought we had got past the point in politics though where we needed to worry about people&apos;s private lives.

She is chair of the Internet Watch Foundation, chair of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors and a Commissioner on the Press Complaints Commission. She previously worked at the Radio Authority and Ofcom.  Next up is Daily Mail editor-in-chief Paul Dacre, making a rare media appearance. Leveson had difficulty getting him to attend last week and you should be able to to hear a pin drop during his presentation.  After 11.30am we will be hearing from Gordon Borrie, former director of the Office of Fair Trading and Sly Bailey, chief executive of Trinity Mirror. Former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie will be the last speaker this afternoon \u2013 probably at about 4.30pm with a presentation titled &quot;Defending freedom of expression&quot;.  9.33am: Two stories that broke late last night that will be of interest to all Leveson inquiry watchers . The former News of the World private investigator Glenn Mulcaire has asked victims of phone hacking not to sue him. His lawyers say they have nothing to gain and it could be construed as &apos;persecution&apos; or a bid to up the costs for Murdoch.  The full story is here. And my colleague James Robinson has reported that Les Hinton is to give evidence to the culture, media and sport select committee for the third time.  He is to appear on 24 October \u2013 full story here.  9.56am: Lord Justice Leveson is now making his opening remarks. The seminar is running about 20 minutes behind schedule. Don&apos;t expect Paul Dacre to take the stand till 10.15am at the earliest.  9.56am: Eve Salomon sat on the PCC for seven years.  She says what it does \u2013 which is deal with complaints \u2013 it does &quot;extremely well&quot;.  9.57am: Salomon, who is a lawyer, says what&apos;s missing at the PCC is the &quot;carrot&quot;.  She chairs the Internet Watch Foundation and says internet providers don&apos;t need statutory regulation to force them to deal with &quot;nasty&quot; problems, such as content unsuitable for children.  She suggest ssomething &quot;light touch&quot; for the future. She developed a cross-media regulatory framework that applies to all content for Dubai, irrespective whether it was in/on film, TV or newspapers. The key elements are: prohibition of hate speech; adequate protection of children; and separation of news from comment among news providers.  10.02am: Why should consumers trust the PCC, she asks. There my be an independent majority (on the committee), but they are not independently appointed and none of the editors are appointed independently, she points out.  She strongly advises working on an &quot;enhanced model of self-regulation&quot;.  The regulator must be seen to be far more independent than it currently is.  10.05am: Dacre is now on his feet.  He says there are thousands of &quot;decent journalists in the UK who don&apos;t hack phones&apos; and in some cases, in the regions, work for a pittance. The newspaper industry is in a &quot;sick financial state&quot;.  Some of our quality papers are losing an awesome amount of money.  10.07am: The industry, Dacre says, is completely over-regulated. Reporters can be criminalised for getting ex-directory numbers which they need to check stories. The growth of injunctions and superinjunctions that prevent information being printed that is freely available on the internet.  The new bribery act makes it illegal to pay a civil servant even one who is willing to pass information on in the public interest. Had the act been law earlier than July, the Daily Telegraph would not have got its MPs&apos; expenses scoop, he says.  10.09am: It would be commercially ruinous to prevent newspapers publishing material freely available on the internet, he says before running through what he says are two major myths.  10.18am: Myth No 1 in Dacre&apos;s own words:  &quot;Myth one: The conduct of the press has deteriorated over the years. It is vastly better behaved and disciplined when I started in the 70s. Then conduct was truly outrageous,&quot; he says.  &quot; It was not uncommon for people to steal photos ... harassment was the rule rather than the exception.&quot; &quot;When a photo is presented [to a news editor now] the question is immediately asked \u2013 did the subject have a reasonable expectation of privacy? Are there children being protected?&quot; The newspaper industry is &quot;indisputably better behaved&quot;, says Dacre.  The audience here is upright with concentration.  10.26am: Myth No 2 is &quot;the phone-hacking scandal means self-regulation doesn&apos;t work,&quot; says Dacre. &quot;The real failure is that phone hacking was illegal. The truth was the police should have investigated it properly and prosecuted the perpetrators.&quot; He says there are plenty of popular misconceptions about the operations of the PCC:  \u2022 That editors sit in judgment on themselves \u2013 they don&apos;t, they leave the room when complaints about their paper are being adjudicated.\u2022 That News International controls the PCC \u2013 this is not true.\u2022 That editors dominate the PCC \u2013 they don&apos;t: they are in a minority of 10 to seven on the commission. \u2022 Editors consider adjudication a slap on the wrist \u2013\u00a0this is not the case; Dacre for one, considers adjudications against his newspaper as &quot;a real act of shame&quot;. The fact is, says Dacre, is that editors are more critical of their own industry than the lay members of the commission. The perception is that the PCC is broke and needs to be changed, he says, but he passionately believes that this is not the case. Rather, he feels the system of self-regulation needs to be enhanced with the addition of an ombudsman.  10.32am: Dacre, the editor-in-chief of the Daily Mail, is delivering a powerful lecture on the future of press regulation and the audience is sitting upright in attention.  He is giving his support to an industry ombudsman who would operate &quot;in tandem&quot; with the PCC. The ombudsman could be a retired judge or civil servant and would have the power to investigate serious wrongdoing and scandals.  It would also have the power to summon journalists and editors and, if necessary in the case of the most extreme malfeasance, to impose fines, says Dacre.  10.36am: Dacre has just launched a virulent attack on &quot;Britain&apos;s liberal classes&quot;, who he says, hate the tabloid press.  The danger is he says this hatred could be a lightning rod for those who want to see the press regulated by statute.  &quot;This liberal hatred of mass-selling newspapers has transmogrified,&quot; he says &quot;into a hatred of self-regulation itself&quot;. The Leveson inquiry over the next few months will be marked by &quot;almost terminal tension between the right to privacy and the public&apos;s right to know&quot; but the industry should not be diverted from the fight to retain self-regulation and make it work.  10.40am: And now for Dacre&apos;s final myth \u2013 that Britain is the exception to the rule, being one of the few countries in the world with a self-regulatory system.  &quot;Au contraire,&quot; he says. There are over 20 self-regulatory systems across Europe which by and large are based on the British system, save for two exceptions \u2013 France, with its &quot;pathetic, torpid and over-subsidised&quot; press, and Italy.  10.42am: Dacre has now finished. No applause. It deserved some.  An audio of his speech will be posted shortly.  10.55am: Roy Greenslade has written an instant analysis of Dacre&apos;s speech. You can read it here.  Guy Black (Lord Black), the former director of the PCC, is on the microphone.  He says he agrees with Dacre that it was an appalling decision when Richard Desmond withdrew from the PCC, undermining its credibility and its ability to regulate the industry as a whole.  Levels of compliance higher than the ASA, at the PCC, he says. And Desmond is wrong to say that the PCC doesn&apos;t provide value for money. That&apos;s says Black, is a canard.  11.00am: And here it is \u2013 audio of Paul Dacre&apos;s speech. Worth listening to. We will post a transcript as soon as possible.  11.03am: Some more gems from Paul Dacre&apos;s speech.  &quot;I unequivocally condemn phone hacking ... such practices are a disgrace and need to be purged from journalism.&quot; The revelations about the activities at the News of the World &quot;shocked and shamed up all,&quot; he said, and reforms need to be instigated &quot;to prevent such criminal activities ever happening again&quot;. But Dacre urges the inquiry and the public to keep the phone-hacking scandal in perspective.  &quot;Britain&apos;s cities weren&apos;t looted as a result; banks didn&apos;t collapse as a result ... the nation didn&apos;t go to war, yet the response has been a judicial inquiry with greater powers than those possessed by the public inquiries into the Iraq war.&quot; &quot;Am I alone in detecting the rank smells of hypocrisy and revenge?&quot; he asked in relation to David Cameron&apos;s motives for setting up the inquiry.  11.17am: The seminar is now having a coffee break \u2013 I&apos;ll be back in 20 minutes.  11.47am: The Leveson seminar is about to resume.  Everybody very impressed with Dacre&apos;s speech, but some criticism at the coffee break that not enough editors were making their voice heard in front of this important audience. &quot;If we don&apos;t speak, the academics will take over,&quot; said one senior newspaper executive.  Others were muttering about the panel of assessors and their lack of newspaper expertise or knowledge, something Dacre raised earlier.  Gordon Borrie, the former director of the Office of Fair Trading, is up now.  11.51am: Borrie says self-regulation can work but enforceability is important:  &quot;My experience of chairing the Advertising Standards Authority is that the system of collective regulation through the adjudication of council is very effective for deciding whether an advert is misleading or whether it&apos;s likely to cause serious or widespread offence.&quot;  Enforceability, in the case of advertising, involves denying offending advertisers media space.  12.01pm: Borrie says trust and credibility are vital for any self-regulatory system \u2013 if the public believes in the PCC, then typical complaints about intrusion, harassment would be dealt with satisfactorily. He says the PCC also has to deal with the problem, voiced by others, of its &quot;invisibility&quot;. Licensing of journalists, which Dominic Lawson recently referred to as the &quot;media version of the dangerous dogs act&quot; would be a disaster, says Borrie, who believes &quot;the basic essential for success is corporate governance at the top of each company&quot; which will then ensure &quot;high ethical standards&quot; across the board. &quot;The Calcutt report did favour some licensing system, but there should be extremely strong opposition from the media for that,&quot; says Borrie.  12.02pm: Stephen Hill, former chief executive of the Financial Times, is now speaking.  He is making some interesting points about corporate governance \u2013 it it is to work all newspapers need to pull together and ensure no-one falls out of line. &quot;If one competitor is assiduous and the other is not, then over time one may be disadvantaged and be tempted to change [its behaviour],&quot; he says. &quot;The key element of corporate government is consistency and transparency. &quot;If we are to review ethical standards, we need to sure the standards are common to all participants.&quot; Hill also gives some valuable insight into the workings of TV regulation \u2013 he spent six years on Channel 4 board. The code of conduct for TV producers &quot;is not enough&quot; on its own, experience shows. &quot;What really matters are the policy and procedures that each company creates to ensure compliance.&quot; Channel 4, for example, produces a handbook distributed to 3,000 independent producers; it also holds masterclasses for its suppliers to ensure they are aware of the laws and procedures.  12.08pm: Sly Bailey, chief executive of Trinity Mirror, is outlining the risk control system at the publishing group.  It will sound fairly alien to most journalists who work for family-controlled operations or trusts such as the Guardian, and that, of course, is because Trinity Mirror, unlike other newspaper groups, is a publicly listed company in its own right. She explains how the board cannot run every aspect of the business \u2013 it cannot be &quot;omnipresent&quot; \u2013 so it operates a rigorous &quot;risk assessment&quot; system.  &quot;it&apos;s a very full bottom-up analysis of what we do with the business and the risks associated with that,&quot; she explains and involves every aspect of the business ranging from the macroeconomic issues, supply chain issues to major editorial issues.  At the moment it has 27 key risks which are reviewed every year.  12.22pm:Bailey says what is important, however, is how the systems are actually implemented and put into practice.  But she agrees that unless you work in a PLC, the system will be unfamiliar to most in the newspaper industry. At the heart of the system is a &quot;risk map&quot; \u2013 this, she says is a living, breathing document, constantly updated.  In addition to the risk map, Trinity Mirror operates an early warning system.  &quot;We ask circa 70 of our senior executives from finance managers to advertising managers, lawyers to editors, signing a certificate at the end of each financial year to confirm whether or not they have any risk matters they wish to bring to the attention of the board. &quot;  These statements then feed into the one she makes to the board and the board statement that flows from that is then published in the group&apos;s annual accounts.  12.28pm: Bailey, almost sensing how her description will go down the audience of editors and journalists, unaccustomed to documenting their efforts to maintain ethical standards, says:   &quot;You may think that this is little more than signing pieces of paper. In practice, it absolutely influences the way in which executives run and manage the business and is another tool that helps maintain standards.&quot;   12.31pm: Bailey says the Mirror has fast-track reporting systems allowing anyone in the company to flag up suspected fraud; it also has a whistleblower&apos;s charter.  &quot;As it cascades through the business, corporate governance becomes good management,&quot; she insists. She says the system is not &quot;bomb proof but can minimise the risks of wrongdoing&quot;.  12.35pm: Bailey revealed that the company&apos;s recent review of editorial controls and procedures found that its internal controls were &quot;robust&quot;.  She didn&apos;t give many details, but said some areas however, would be strengthened as a result of the review across Trinity&apos;s 165 newspapers and 500 websites.  &quot;These include training, legal oversight, expectations of third party suppliers and digital controls.&quot; &quot;Proper processes lead to proper behaviour and need not limit creativity,&quot; were her concluding words.  12.38pm: Interesting that Bailey did not address phone hacking.  Although it wasn&apos;t an explicit subject she was asked to address \u2013 the title of the seminar was &quot;Approaches to regulation - a supporting free press and high standards&quot; \u2013 it was something that Dacre lost no time tackling by describing the practice as a &quot;disgrace&quot;.  12.45pm: The audience are now being asked to discuss the three presentations.  Alan Rusbridger, editor-in-chief of the Guardian, says any future form of the PCC will have to work out how self-regulation can work when governance goes so &quot;badly wrong to the extent that the PCC itself is being lied to&quot;. He says it &quot;behoves us as members of the industry to talk about the PCC and to be critical of the bits that go wrong.&quot; Paul [Dacre] knows this, Rusbridger said, joking that he would be &quot;looking for a correction and clarification&quot; in the Daily Mail&apos;s new column on page 2.  Sly Bailey says the risk system at Trinity Mirror works well.  &quot;In the hundreds of thousands of stories that Trinity Mirror publishes every year, we make very few mistakes,&quot; she tells the Leveson seminar.  The detailed PLC processes operating at Trinity Mirror send &quot;a certain shiver&quot; down the spine, said Ian Hargreaves, professor of journalism at Cardiff University. &quot;It is important that we don&apos;t end up treating the regulation of journalism through the corporate system,&quot; he said.  &quot;Finely detailed control is not what this is about, and what we&apos;ve learned from the Leveson inquiry so far, is rather encouraging.  &quot;There is recognition, including now from Associated, that there needs to be some kind of co-regulatory back up to the self-regulatory system in essence.&quot;   Hargreaves says the Desmond issue is something the Leveson inquiry should not be too concerned about.   &quot;All you do is create a system that most want to be part of. If the inquiry strays off to something from that thought, [the press] will stray into something that will sow the seeds of its own destruction.&quot;   Bailey says the primary function of the board is not to concern itself with the detail of editorial but to drive the company&apos;s strategy, deliver value to shareholders and ensure policies on areas such as succession are in place.  &quot;The board of Trinity Mirror do not sit around talking about the detail of editorial matters.  &quot;If I chose to bring to their attention the fantastic coverage of the riots during the summer, they will happily listen to that, but it&apos;s not their primary function,&quot; she said. &quot;Their function, however, is to understand the process of what we do, how we do it,&quot; she added.  1.23pm: Leveson has been urged to take on board the lack of support for statutory regulation voiced at the seminar today.  Guardian columnist and professor of journalism Roy Greenslade says he wanted it on record that Paul Dacre is absolutely right to say the behaviour of journalists is indisputably better than it was.   &quot;I agree with a great deal of what Paul Dacre has to say, in particular in relation to the standards in the 70s \u2013 in my case in the 60s [when I started in journalism]. There was no code in those days. So we learned, if we did at all, ethics on the hoof.  &quot;It was a total ignorance of the NUJ&apos;s own code which lead eventually to the formation of the code in 1990 and that was created by editors and I&apos;m still looking to a collective of editors to get together and to hammer out something that is built on and improves on what was built on 1991. &quot;Not a single speaker has spoken for statutory regulation and hope that Lord Leveson you will take to heart that there is no support for statutory regulation [among editors in the room].&quot;   1.22pm: The seminar has broken up for lunch, so what better time to launch our inaugural Leveson caption competition.  Entries in the comment boxes below \u2013 best entries will be used in the blog at the end of the day. Keep &apos;em clean.  And anyone who wants inspiration from Paul Dacre&apos;s speech, listen to the Audioboo below.  2.22pm: Welcome back. Paul Dacre&apos;s speech was the talk of lunch and it will be a tough act, even for Kelvin MacKenzie, to follow. Here&apos;s the link to the full text.  I was talking to George Brock, former managing editor of the Times, now at City University London, during the break. What was &quot;striking&quot; about Dacre&apos;s speech, Brock said, was that it was full of noise and bangs, but when the smoke cleared there were two amazing concessions \u2013 an acceptance that a system that included financial penalties for errant newspapers might work and an acceptance that the PCC wasn&apos;t perfect and could be improved through co-regulation with an Ombudsman. The latter point is very significant, given that Dacre has been such a champion of the PCC in the past. The new system of co-regulation Dacre is proposing \u2013 and we have his full speech now to allow us absorb what he said in full - would include an ombudsman which have the power to summon editors and journalists and impose fines.  Here&apos;s some extracts from his speech:  Dacre on Cameron and the PCC  Self-regulation, I would argue, is at the very heart of a free press. Which is why I profoundly regret that a prime minister \u2013 who had become too close to News International in general and Andy Coulson and Rebekah Wade in particular \u2013 in a pretty cynical act of political expediency has prejudiced the outcome of this inquiry by declaring that the PCC, an institution he&apos;d been committed to only a few weeks previously, was a &quot;failed&quot; body.   Dacre on licensing of journalists  Over the past month, I have read calls by so-called academic experts for the licensing of journalists and the need for a regulator with supervisory powers over the press, to set and monitor standards and have the right \u2013 backed by the force of the law \u2013 to conduct spot checks on newspaper offices and seize equipment and evidence. My own response to these experts is that they should emigrate to Zimbabwe.  On liberal and popular agendas  My worry is that this liberal hatred of mass-selling papers has transmogrified into a hatred of self-regulation itself and I would ask the inquiry to be aware of this bias. The Hampstead liberal with his gilded life-style understandably enjoys the Guardian \u2013 a paper that deals with serious issues. But does he or a judge have any right to deny someone who works 10 hours a day in a Sunderland call centre and lives for football, the right to buy a paper that reveals the sexual peccadilloes of one of his team&apos;s millionaire married players \u2013 a player who uses his celebrity to sell products to him and his children.  Dacre on the ombudsman  The commission should continue to do what it does well: resolve complaints, issue adjudications and impose the Code. An ombudsman \u2013 possibly a retired judge or civil servant, and possibly advised by two retired editors from both ends of newspaper spectrum \u2013 could have the power to investigate, possibly with specialists co-opted onto his panel, potential press industry scandals.  The ombudsman could also have the power to summon journalists and Editors to give evidence, to name offenders and, if necessary \u2013 in the cases of the most extreme malfeasance \u2013 to impose fines. On the principle of &quot;polluter pays&quot; offending media groups could, within reason, be forced to carry the costs of any investigation affecting their newspapers.   2.38pm: Desmond Browne, QC, is now speaking. &quot;I do not go as far as Paul Dacre, and I never thought I would say that,&quot; he says, in respect of a new system which would include a regulator which could impose fines.  &quot;But I do strongly believe the PCC should have the power to award compensation up to \u00a320,000,&quot; says Browne. This, in the long run, would be cheaper for the industry.  He also believes newspapers need to take apologies more seriously.  &quot;There is simply no point in an apology if it is forced and is insincere,&quot; he says and the new regulator should have the power to force newspapers to place apologies in truly prominent position. &quot;If that means a front page apology for a front-page error so be it,&quot; he says.  3.12pm: One of the high-profile victims of phone-hacking, a former employee of model Elle Macpherson, has just told the Leveson inquiry that she does not want to see the press &quot;muzzled&quot;.  Mary Ellen Field has said that although she was the &quot;victim of criminal behaviour&quot; it was journalists who ultimately got her legal representation and ultimately redress. She is a currently negotiating a compensation deal for alleged phone-hacking with News International. Field worked as Macpherson&apos;s adviser for two years but Macpherson blamed her for leaking stories to the press and she lost her job.  I became very ill. Then in July 2009, I spoke to the Guardian and expected to get writs and nothing happened,&quot; she said today. &quot;I wrote to the police when Mulcaire was arrested and then jailed and no one responded. I wrote to my former employers expecting to get my job back because it was proven that I had done nothing wrong. I was brought up to believe the price of liberty was eternal vigilance. The people in this room are supposed to be vigilant, you&apos;re supposed to protect us from the excesses of power but in my case you didn&apos;t.  But the reason I am here and I have lawyers now is because of journalists. A group of journalists got behind me from all over the world, since the beginning of this year.  And that wouldn&apos;t have happened without journalists and I don&apos;t&apos; want to see the press muzzled and I want to see you doing your job you are supposed to do and that&apos;s to be vigilant.&quot;   3.12pm: Bob Satchwell of the Society of Editors is the latest to tell the Leveson inquiry seminar that the 70s and 80s were the &quot;bad old days&quot; when the attitude &quot;was never apologise, never explain&quot;. Most complainants, says Satchwell, aren&apos;t looking for compensation, but an acknowledgment that the paper got it wrong. Stephen Pritchard, the readers&apos; editor of The Observer, agrees \u2013 he says nine out of 10 people are just looking for an apology or a correction.  3.16pm: Helen Goodman, the new shadow culture secretary, says ordinary people generally don&apos;t know where to turn if they have a grievance against a newspaper.  The new system should not be &quot;complainant dependent&quot; and a regulator should be able to consider third party complaints.  3.35pm: Just a little food for thought from Clayton Hirst from Ofcom who has emailed us.  Paul Dacre in his Leveson speech today compared the PCC&apos;s budget with Ofcom&apos;s. Thought you might be interested in some facts on this.   Budget Ofcom&apos;s budget for 2011/12 is \u00a3115.8m; the PCC costs around \u00a32m a year. Remit PCC is the self-regulatory body for newspaper and magazine content. Ofcom is the independent regulator for the TV and radio, fixed line telecoms and mobiles, the airwaves over which wireless devices operate and postal services. Cost of handling and resolving broadcast complaints  Ofcom handles complaints from TV and radio listeners, considers them and when appropriate investigates, which can lead to a statutory sanction. This function costs about \u00a32.1m a year. This includes all direct and indirect costs including complaint handling, triage, assessment, resolution, governance and share of overheads. Workload The PCC received over 7,000 complaints in writing in 2010. Ofcom received 24,462 TV and radio standards complaints in 2010/11 and 171 fairness &amp; privacy complaints. Ofcom licenses around 1,800 TV and radio stations.    4.05pm: Due to technical issues, we have moved our coverage to a new blog here: http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/oct/12/leveson-inquiry-kelvin-mackenzie", "title": "Leveson inquiry seminar - Wednesday 12 October 2011", "sentences": ["She developed a cross-media regulatory framework that applies to all content for Dubai, irrespective whether it was in/on film, TV or newspapers."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-12T14:27:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/oct/12/icc-test-championship", "tags": ["Cricket", "England cricket team", "India cricket team", "Sport", "Sports rights", "Sky Sports", "Sky plc", "Media", "International Cricket Council"], "article": "When any sport settles its broadcasting rights, it sells its soul. That much is inevitable, for without the massive amounts that television pays no professional sport would be able to survive, or at any rate compete, in the modern age. As far as England cricket is concerned, even those who would champion relentlessly the idea that someone (they never say who) will broadcast on free-to-air television the many hours and days of cricket \u2013 international, domestic, women&apos;s, home and abroad \u2013 that Sky has done in the past couple of decades, generally concede that the national side would not have reached the current level of excellence without the sums garnered in broadcasting deals done with the England and Wales Cricket Board. But with the flogging of the assets goes some of the capacity to make independent decisions. A contract is a contract. So the recent totally extraneous pair of Twenty20 internationals against West Indies that were tagged on to the back end of the season at a time when the grounds are being closed down and pitches top-dressed for the winter were a function of fulfilling a contractual obligation to Sky following the original Stanford agreement. The tune is called by he who sticks his coin in the jukebox. Now it has happened again, with the decision, made at the International Cricket Council executive board meeting in Dubai this week, to dispense with the idea of a Test match championship, to be played in England the year after next, and revert instead to the original plan of holding the Champions Trophy it was to replace. The Test championship will not now take place until 2017 at the earliest, when the next round of ICC broadcasting deals will have been made, which \u2013 at a time when the whole point was to regenerate interest in, and add context to, Test cricket \u2013 may come too late if the televisual behemoth that is T20 continues to spread and dominate. In confirming its preference for the Test championship in 2013 \u2013 a tournament involving the top four sides in the ICC rankings, with a final at Lord&apos;s \u2013 the executive board nonetheless recognised &quot;the significant commercial challenge&quot; in attempting to replace the Champions Trophy. It could not afford, financially, to cross swords with the ICC&apos;s broadcast partner ESPN Star Sports, with whom it had brokered a deal involving a one-day tournament. This at a time when the global future of Test cricket is in jeopardy. The financial implications of cancelling the Champions Trophy were thought to be considerable. The suggestion is that as a result, each of the Test\u2011playing countries would be required to take a cut in income of $3m and associate nations $1m, something that could be absorbed by England, Australia and India but not by the remainder. Viewing figures would be down, it is confidently estimated, and advertising income, the staple of television cricket deals, would follow them. It is hard to blame those who voted for the status\u00a0quo. Beyond this comes another consideration, of a kind that manifested itself during the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean, when what had been scheduled as the premier broadcasting opportunity \u2013 the expected Super Eight match between India and Pakistan in Bridgetown \u2013 was replaced by Bangladesh against Ireland following the non-qualification of India and Pakistan. Advertising income plummeted and the rights holders felt they had been sold a pup. The structure of the last World Cup ensured such a scenario was not possible again. Suddenly India&apos;s struggles in the Test matches last summer, with the relinquishing to England of their position as the No1\u2011ranked side as a result of their 4-0 loss in the series, has in itself become an issue. India have dropped to third behind South Africa and a poor series in Australia over the new year would see those two adversaries close to one another. The cause for nervousness among those who would try to sell the Test championship is obvious, for a competition without India would be a commercial non-starter. That the Board of Control for Cricket in India does not recognise there may be a future problem in the development of a strong Test side, or acknowledge its shortcomings as did England, with the Schofield report in 2007, and as has Australia, with its Argus report, is a concern for those who value Test cricket as a vital part of cricket&apos;s profile.

The late-night drinking session in some of Dubai&apos;s most exclusive hotel bars was to toast Luke Coffey, Fox&apos;s policy adviser, a former US army captain. The six-strong party are understood to have started at the opulent Address hotel where Fox was staying at a \u00a3500-a-night cost to the taxpayer. They went to the top-floor bar of the 63-storey Address, which is shaped like an ocean liner, before moving\u00a0on to other bars where they downed giant &quot;treasure chest&quot; cocktails. It is understood the celebrations lasted until 3am. A source who witnessed the session told the Guardian: &quot;It was quite a boozy affair; they were drinking huge cocktails and they caused quite a stir. I was told it was a stag do for one of Fox&apos;s advisers.&quot; Dan Jarvis, Labour MP for Barnsley Central and a former parachute regiment officer in Iraq and Afghanistan, said: &quot;Our forces will be shocked that, while they are on the frontline risking life and limb, the secretary of state for defence is on a stag do on taxpayers&apos; expense. They expect leadership, particularly now, but they are not getting it from Liam Fox.&quot; Questions will be raised about whether Fox deliberately extended his stopover in Dubai to give Coffey a special send-off into married life. Fox was spending three nights at the exclusive Dubai hotel on his\u00a0way back from visiting troops in Afghanistan in June, despite having only two official\u00a0engagements scheduled in his diary. Fox arrived in Dubai on 17 June and immediately met Werritty. After their meeting with Dubai-based British businessman Harvey Boulter on the 41st floor of the Shangri-la hotel the pair are understood to have spent the rest of the day lounging by the pool and in Werritty&apos;s hotel room. Questions have already been raised about Fox&apos;s regular trips to Dubai. According to the former defence minister Bob Ainsworth, a stopover in Dubai, sometimes known as &quot;Las Vegas in the desert&quot;, is unprecedented. &quot;I have never been to Dubai,&quot; Ainsworth said. &quot;I doubt I made half the number of trips he made in all those three years.&quot; Protocol dictates that official trips back from Afghanistan or Iraq stop off in Qatar or Bahrain. Fox has been to Dubai five times since the election, meeting Werritty on each occasion. The minister once took a &quot;weekend leave break&quot; in the emirate on 6-8 August 2010. However, on the visit in June, Fox did not take leave and was being funded by the taxpayer. His only official engagements were to meet local journalists on 19 June and to visit troops at the nearby Al Minhad airbase. The Ministry of Defence declined to comment as to why Fox&apos;s trip lasted three days when both engagements could have easily been done in one day. Labour has questioned why taxpayers are paying more than \u00a3170,000 a year for Fox&apos;s three official advisers when he appears to prefer to rely on the advice of Werritty. Two of Fox&apos;s highly trained official special advisers \u2013 Coffey and Oliver Waghorn \u2013 are paid \u00a360,740 a year, while Hayden Allan collects at least \u00a352,215, giving a total wage bill of at least \u00a3173,695 a year. The bill for Fox&apos;s advisers is the fourth-highest of any minister in parliament, behind only the prime minister, the deputy prime minister and the chancellor. Fox spends more on advisers than William Hague, the foreign secretary, and the leader of the Lords, Lord Strathclyde.

We are all familiar with the argument that wages must reflect responsibility, that the powerful deserve more ample remuneration because of the weight carried on their shoulders; that reducing the incentive for doing the top jobs would see talented folk trot off to Dubai or Silicon Valley where they can rake in a salary more befitting their awesome talents. But how big must that incentive be? Is living in a house 50 times bigger than the man who empties your bin not enough to make you feel valued? Does taking holidays 100 times more exotic not make you feel like you&apos;re living in the social strata to which you belong? How much nicer can a suit or handbag or dinner set that costs 565 times more than the one the rest of us might buy at John Lewis be? It is, of course, beyond the grasp of the mayor of London to determine the salaries of the highest and lower earners at companies listed on the capitals&apos; stock exchange. However, the wages of those working for organisations within the fold of the Greater London Authority are not. Unfortunately, during Boris Johnson&apos;s tenure as mayor, the excessive salaries of London&apos;s public-sector bosses have worsened. The number of GLA employees earning more than 10 times the living wage has risen from 62 to 97, and the chief executive of Crossrail, Rob Holden, earns \u00a3857,134: a figure approximately 55 times the London living wage. For this reason, this week I have launched a pledge to institute a 10:1 pay ratio as part of my mayoral election campaign. My proposal is that those working for City Hall and related organisations such as Transport for London, the Metropolitan Police and fire service should earn no less than 10 times the amount of the highest paid. We believe there is a real appetite for London&apos;s governing institutions to institute a reasonable pay ratio: the Institute for Public Policy Research recently found that 78% of British people would support government action to reduce the gap between high and low earners. Evidence shows that more equal societies tend to be happier and healthier as well as experiencing lower levels of violent crime. Recent experiences at local government level demonstrate it is possible to reduce the pay gap quickly and effectively by freezing high salaries and performance-related pay, reducing pay when staff members are replaced or contracts renegotiated and lifting pay for the lowest paid. In addition, ensuring top salaries do not exceed the 10:1 ratio does not mean such jobs become disincentivised: five local councils have recently managed to recruit replacements on much lower salaries in the past year, most recently Islington, which cut its chief executive&apos;s salary from \u00a3210k to \u00a3160k. People value public service, and it is probably also worth asking the question whether someone who wouldn&apos;t work for the people of London for less than \u00a3151,000 is really the ideal candidate for a top public position. If the prime minister can work for about that, why can&apos;t they? In a climate of public sector cuts, it is entirely unjustifiable for the salaries of public servants to grossly outweigh those of other workers. The mayor was recently forced to rethink the refusal of a 4% increase to the poorest paid at City Hall (costing \u00a350,000) after Green London Assembly members exposed a combined \u00a373,000 increase paid to two of his advisers. However, the 10:1 campaign is also part of a broader argument. At this time of austerity, we need national government and industry to work together to reduce pay gaps in the private sector, and a mayor of London who helped the capital lead by example with a 10:1 maximum ratio would help move the argument for fairer pay across the country \u2013 and including the City \u2013 forward.", "title": "London's City Hall must lead on closing Britain's pay gap | Jenny Jones", "sentences": ["We are all familiar with the argument that wages must reflect responsibility, that the powerful deserve more ample remuneration because of the weight carried on their shoulders; that reducing the incentive for doing the top jobs would see talented folk trot off to Dubai or Silicon Valley where they can rake in a salary more befitting their awesome talents."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-14T13:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/14/liam-fox-innuendo-defence-secretary", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Politics", "Liam Fox", "Oliver Letwin", "Conservatives", "Lobbying"], "article": "The question is, when al fresco Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin dumps government papers in the park bin, does Adam Werritty sidle\u00a0along later and fish\u00a0them out? Who knows at this stage, but it has been a week in which it has become possible to begin enjoying certain aspects of this\u00a0government. When the grimmest financial unknowns are battering at the door, there is great comfort to be had in\u00a0sitting back to enjoy a classic old-fashioned defence scandal with a side order of innuendo. Sling another chair leg on the fire, and let&apos;s hope that some tear in the scandal continuum will see the bin story collapse into the rather more radioactive buddy movie that is Defence Secretaries Like Us. Convergence is possible. After all, both Letwin and the newly resigned Liam Fox have starred in one of those idiosyncratic Tory burglaries. Letwin once let a young man into his house to use the loo at five in the morning, only for the little tinker to rob him, causing the then shadow home secretary to pursue him clad in only a bathrobe. It now seems a burglary at Fox&apos;s flat last year had elements of the obscure, in that Conservative officials apparently felt moved to conceal from journalists that a man (not Werritty) had been staying in Dr Fox&apos;s spare room at the time. It takes one back, really, this sense that the cabinet are a bunch of chaps with a range of eccentricities and appetites upon which they are conducting a doomed struggle to keep a lid. It somehow has a different quality to the Blair years, where the scandals involved dreary things like passports or visa applications or property deals; or horrors such as the death of David Kelly. To my mind, there were two unexpungeable black marks against Liam Fox. The first was his fondness for Dubai, a place he and Werritty met five times since the election. I&apos;m afraid the world can be divided into people with whom one would care to spend any time, and people who like Dubai. The second and more alarming black mark was the defence secretary&apos;s sensational ineptitude as a strategist. Dr Fox might have viewed each day&apos;s survival as a battle won in his war \u2013 as might his allies \u2013 but in fact it was the opposite. David Cameron played this perfectly, allowing the darling of the rightwingers to cling on for the full media evisceration. Had Fox resigned on Monday with some huffy but terse statement about having made mistakes and not wanting to distract from the government&apos;s vital work, he would have gone to the backbenches bloodied but unbroken, where he would have remained a low-level threat and might even \u2013 in the meltdown that may occur when those financial unknowns batter down the door \u2013 have seen serious anti-Cameron support coalesce around him. But his insistence on remaining in post allowed the prime minister to watch with a face set to &quot;fair and sympathetic&quot;, as an old rival was more irredeemably damaged with each new revelation. Fox&apos;s apparent inability to see that this was what was happening to him was most diverting for the rest of us, though would have been less so had he been defence secretary at the time of the cold war, when rather more first-class game theorists were required. Of course, we had an inkling of the ex-defence secretary&apos;s dimness last year, when he felt moved to make a statement saying he was &quot;disgusted and angry&quot; at the &quot;thoroughly un-British&quot; latest edition of the Medal of Honor computer game series, which was set in Afghanistan. According to the MoD, &quot;he wanted to comment on this as it&apos;s part of the wider picture of defence&quot;. What a mind he is. I suppose there was a chance the defence secretary might have survived but even if he had, the former GP would have been reduced to the level at which one always sensed the Cameron toffs felt he belonged. To the upper classes, as I wrote in a column about Fox last year, being a GP is almost akin to being\u00a0a\u00a0servant. The doctor is certainly not a friend, more someone one has to keep around in case one gets shingles. You give him a middling bottle of whisky\u00a0at Christmas, and might ask him to make up a bridge four if someone had flu, but you&apos;d have no hesitation in reminding him of his place. Thus Fox has now been restored to his rightful position in Cameron&apos;s model\u00a0village. It&apos;s difficult to decide which was more devastating for him \u2013 the vote of confidence from the PM or his having been disowned by Natalie Imbruglia, the erstwhile popstar once romantically &quot;linked&quot; to him in rumours\u00a0he battled bravely not to stop. &quot;Please!&quot; sniffed Imbruglia at the opening of some envelope this week. &quot;He&apos;s a friend of my manager.&quot; Perhaps all that remains in this imbroglio is to see how far the bonds of Fox&apos;s remarkable friendship will stretch.

Sometimes, however, they come with a gruesome symmetry. On Friday, an rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) fired by pro-Gaddafi forces, defending their last pocket of resistance in the city, caused some of the casualties. But it was a mortar fired by the government&apos;s own fighters that caused the most. Both incidents occurred within a few seconds. The fighters were bunched near the frontline on Dubai Street on the southern front occupied mainly by fighters from Misrata when the two rounds came in. &quot;It was a mistake,&quot; said a passing fighter a few minutes later in the chaos as the injured were treated. &quot;The RPG came from Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s forces. But I was close to where the mortar was fired. They fired it straight into the air. It came down on our men. We are shooting our own people.&quot; There were too many casualties at first for the medics at their open-air field station to cope with. So the Guardian&apos;s driver and translator, both medical students who worked during the siege of Misrata in the intensive care unit, helped treat the wounded, more than 20 of them. One was a young fighter brought in limp and pale from shock, hit by shrapnel in the shoulder that had penetrated his neck. Another older man arrived hanging to the back of a jeep, his lacerated scalp bleeding heavily over his clothes, blood bubbling from his mouth. In the small space that the last uncaptured ground in Sirte provides for assaults, such incidents are escalating. Without proper communications and a dangerous rivalry between the forces from Misrata on the pocket&apos;s southern and western fronts, and fighters from Benghazi and the towns to the east, those fighting Gaddafi&apos;s soldiers are killing each other in increasing numbers. Eastern soldiers said three men they lost on Thursday in an attempt to assault the pocket were killed by Misratan fire. Shells and mortars misfired or falling short have killed others while crossfire is commonplace. Two days ago, a shell fired from behind Sirte exploded close to the Guardian&apos;s car near a column of government fighters. Blame has fallen on &quot;weekend fighters&quot;, who are unwilling to go forward and fire from behind their colleagues towards their backs, or inexperienced government troops, who lack the ability to accurately aim their mortar batteries or are ignorant of their targets. The randomness of the government fighter&apos;s fire was underlined on Friday at a battery made up of odds and ends of improvised rocket systems, a recoilless rifle, anti-aircraft guns and an armoured carrier parked on a rise a few hundred metres from the pocket&apos;s southern edge. The Guardian watched rockets from a homemade system on a pickup truck fly in wildly different directions and distances. &quot;I&apos;ve had too many friends die in this fucking city,&quot; said Mhjurb Ibrahim, a lawyer from Misrata. &quot;Twenty-two of them have died. Five in the first day of the fighting.&quot; It is these problems of co-ordination as much as the fierce resistance of the remaining Gaddafi fighters occupying high buildings in Sirte&apos;s District 2 that have slowed up the advance and forced government fighters to bring up tanks and other heavy weapons to pound the buildings occupied by their foes. Shells flew into the tight packed collection of buildings on Friday at a rate of almost one a minute at times, sending up clouds of concrete and white smoke that drifted across the rooftops. &quot;We cannot go into the pocket yet,&quot; said one of the eastern forces&apos; commanders, Abdul Salam Rishi. &quot;When we tried, there were still too many snipers. So we&apos;ll bomb with artillery and tanks. Then we will attack.&quot; The difficulties of the government in bringing a final end to the siege of Sirte came as a gun battle erupted between revolutionary forces and supporters of Gaddafi in the heart of the Libyan capital, Tripoli, for the first time since the longtime leader was ousted and forced into hiding. Shouting &quot;God is Great&quot;, anti-Gaddafi fighters converged on the Hay Nasr district of the Abu Salim neighbourhood in pickups mounted with weapons, setting up checkpoints and sealing off the area as heavy gunfire echoed through the streets. Fighters at the scene said the shooting began after a group of armed men tried to raise the green flag that symbolises Gaddafi&apos;s regime. Assem al-Bashir, a fighter with Tripoli&apos;s Eagle Brigade, said revolutionary forces suspected there were snipers in the surrounding high rises after spotting a man trying to raise the green flag. Ahmad al-Warsly, from the Zintan brigade, said several Gaddafi supporters apparently planned a protest but drew fire because they were armed. They fled and were pursued by revolutionary forces, prompting fierce street battles. &quot;It seems like it was organised,&quot; he said. &quot;They were planning to have a big demonstration, then the fight started.&quot; The violence in the capital, which has been relatively calm since it was taken in late August, underscores the difficulty Libya&apos;s new rulers face in restoring order as Gaddafi remains on the run.", "title": "In the chaos of Sirte, anti-Gaddafi fighters are killing each other", "sentences": ["The fighters were bunched near the frontline on Dubai Street on the southern front occupied mainly by fighters from Misrata when the two rounds came in."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-14T17:06:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/14/guardian-broke-fox-werritty-story", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Adam Werritty", "Politics", "Liam Fox", "Conservatives", "The Guardian", "Newspapers & magazines", "Newspapers", "The Observer", "Media", "UK news", "Lobbying"], "article": "12.6.11 In a small piece in the Observer, Neate reveals the Ministry of Defence&apos;s civilian research arm, Ploughshare Innovations, and various private investors are suing the US company 3M for up to \u00a341m in damages for not commercially developing a new technology that could have been vital in the fight against the deadly MRSA hospital superbug. 21.6.11 3M accuses Harvey Boulter, CEO of Porton Capital, an investment fund that worked with the government on the MRSA test, of &quot;blackmail&quot;.

Almost immediately he met up with Adam Werritty, his best man, former flatmate and firm friend of 13 years. Werritty, 33, a Scottish Tory who first met Fox when the defence secretary went to speak at Edinburgh University \u2013 where Werritty was a student of public policy \u2013 had arrived in the emirate a few days earlier to set up meetings for his &quot;boss&quot;. Top of Werritty&apos;s agenda for Fox was a meeting with Dubai-based British businessman Harvey Boulter on the 41st floor of the five-star Shangri-La hotel. At 11am Werritty and Fox were whisked into the hotel and rode the elevator to the executive meeting suite, one floor above Werritty&apos;s room on the 40th floor. Waiting for them was Boulter, 41, chief executive of Porton Capital, and two executives from Cellcrypt, a Porton company that creates state-of-the-art encryption software. As they settled into the sofas, Boulter offered to supply Cellcrypt for free to British troops in Afghanistan so that they could call their loved ones back home without fear of their calls being intercepted by the Taliban. Fox loved the idea. But just as they were about to wrap up the 45-minute meeting, Boulter got to the topic that had been worrying him for months: of money that had slipped through his fingers. The last deal Boulter and the MoD teamed up on had gone wrong. Boulter had helped the government commercialise and sell potential life-saving MRSA technology to the American conglomerate 3M for \u00a341m. But 3M, the maker of Post-it notes, had refused to pay all the money, claiming the MRSA technology, called Acolyte, didn&apos;t work. Boulter had managed to get coverage of the story in the Observer a few days earlier. While Fox and Werritty went out partying that night to celebrate the forthcoming marriage of Fox&apos;s official adviser Luke Coffey, Boulter jumped on a plane to Milan. Early the next morning, as he stepped off a plane in Italy, Boulter cranked up the pressure on 3M&apos;s lawyer. He sent a hastily drafted email that 3M later alleged implied that the government would raise questions about a knighthood awarded to 3M&apos;s British chief executive. Boulter&apos;s email said: &quot;David Cameron&apos;s cabinet might very shortly be discussing the rather embarrassing situation of George&apos;s [George Buckley, 3M&apos;s chief executive] knighthood&quot;. Life was about to get even tougher for Boulter, one the richest western men in Dubai, as 3M launched a blackmail lawsuit against him based on that email allegedly punched out on his BlackBerry in the middle of the night. But the first he heard of the lawsuit was when the Guardian called on the afternoon of the following Monday to seek comment after 3M dropped the legal papers with this paper before telling Boulter. The private equity boss denies that the emails, available in full on Guardian.co.uk, constitute blackmail, and claims that when he mentioned the threat to Buckley&apos;s knighthood he was not referring to the meeting with Fox. The Guardian wanted to know what happened at that meeting so contacted the Ministry of Defence, assuming they had a record of exactly what took place. The MoD replied on 24 June: &quot;Dr Fox met with Mr Boulter to discuss an entirely different matter. At no point did he enter into any discussion about the legal case.&quot; Curious. Who was telling the truth? A flamboyant race car-driving businessman or the secretary of state for defence? In order to find out, the Guardian tracked down the other two executives present at the meeting, who confirmed that the Acolyte case was discussed. The MoD then issued a backtrack statement on 17 August. &quot;During their meeting Mr Boulter disclosed his involvement in a legal case as a matter of propriety, but Dr Fox did not enter into a discussion about this in any respect and at no point raised or discussed the issue of a knighthood.&quot; Surely the MoD official who sat in on the meeting must have kept a record of the meeting? So why was the department changing its position? There was a simple answer from the MoD: there were no officials present at the meeting. Who, then, was Adam Werritty? &quot;Adam Werritty is not an MoD employee. He is a friend of the secretary of state,&quot; the MoD said. But Boulter was adamant Werritty was Fox&apos;s official adviser, and he said he had his business card to prove it. &quot;Adviser to the Rt. Hon. Dr Liam Fox MP&quot;, the card read under the House of Commons Portcullis logo. On 19 August the Guardian revealed Werritty&apos;s existence, but our questions did not stop there. How many meetings had this unofficial adviser set up? Who had he met? Defence bosses? Generals? Heads of state? Did he often travel abroad with Fox? Did they meet up at the MoD&apos;s HQ on Whitehall? The MoD said it was &quot;unable&quot; to say if Werritty had been to the MoD because those sorts of records were hard to collate and the paper would have to wait for the answers to a Freedom of Information request. Step forward John Mann MP, who tabled a parliamentary question, to which Fox replied that he had met Werritty 14 times inside the MoD in the 16 months since the election. The defence secretary added that: &quot;Mr Werritty is not an employee of the Ministry of Defence and has, therefore, not travelled with me on any official overseas visits.&quot; Given the defence minister&apos;s not very transparent track record, was this really true? After trawling the internet for days the Guardian and the Observer came across photos and videos that showed the dynamic duo meeting the president and various ministers of Sri Lanka. These were &quot;not official&quot; meetings, the MoD said. But by now things had started to smell, and Fox&apos;s department was forced into releasing a record of every meeting the pair had ever had. There were 40 \u2013 22 at the MoD and 18 overseas \u2013 where Werritty had been present including meetings with the forthcoming British ambassador to Israel and US General John Allen, who was soon to be appointed commander of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. Werritty&apos;s jetsetting \u2013 he appeared to be on a plane, first-class, almost every other week \u2013 raised further questions about the self-styled adviser who did not appear to have a regular job. Fox reassured the house on Monday that Werritty was &quot;not dependent on any transactional behaviour to maintain his income&quot;. This distinctly odd turn of phrase had Fleet Street a-flutter trying to track down how Werritty funded the 19 overseas trips (the MoD added one more at the last minute on Thursday night) that are estimated to have cost more than \u00a350,000. Revelations that Tory donors and shadowy figures were supporting a company set up specifically to support Werritty appears to have been the final straw in the pair&apos;s long relationship.

The final revelation that appears to have forced the defence secretary to buckle came on Friday from documents which showed that his self-styled adviser had received \u00a3147,000 from companies which had paid for a jet-set lifestyle. Those who had paid money to Werrity&apos;s company, Pargav Ltd, included a corporate intelligence company with alleged close links to Sri Lanka, a property investor who lobbies for Israel and a venture capitalist. The money, according to the donors, was supposed to help foster peace initiatives. In the process, it paid for five-star hotels and first-class travel for Werritty. And at some of the destinations, he had met Fox in the company of heads of state and foreign generals. The disclosures of a money trail and further undeclared meetings were, it seems, to prove crucial in the decision by Fox to stand down. It emerged on Friday that Werritty was the hidden hand behind Pargav Ltd, a not-for-profit company. According to the Times, six different financial entities had paid \u00a3147,000 \u2013 up to \u00a335,000 each \u2013 to the company since October last year. The entities include Tamares Real Estate, an investment company owned by Poju Zabludowicz, a Tory donor who is also the chairman of and major donor to Bicom, an organisation that lobbies on behalf of Israel. Zabludowicz, 57, who was born in Helsinki and now lives in Hampstead, is one of Britain&apos;s richest men. He has some investments in the arms industry \u2013 his father built up the Israeli arms company Soltam in the 1950s after working closely with Shimon Peres, who was then the director general of the Israeli defence ministry. A spokesman for Zabludowicz said he owned a &quot;legacy&quot; arms business in the US, but added that it was not a significant part of his empire. Most of his assets were now in property, he said. &quot;Any suggestion that he has benefited from this relationship [with Pargav] would be completely wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;For many years, Poju Zabludowicz has helped fund not-for-profit organisations, not individuals, due to his passion for the promotion of peace and understanding between peoples in the United States, Europe and the Middle East.&quot; Another firm, G3 Good Governance Group, a private intelligence company, made a reported donation of \u00a315,000 to Pargav, which was intended to go towards charitable work. The private company, which provides advice on risky overseas investments and investigative services, has attracted little attention from the media until this week. It styles itself as an &quot;independent strategic advisory firm&quot; offering &quot;insight, analysis and advice to help leaders make informed decisions and realise value in complex situations&quot;. It says it places the &quot;highest priority on integrity, discretion and trust&quot;. It operates out of an undistinguished building in Mayfair and has been chaired by Chester Crocker, the US assistant secretary of state for African affairs under President Ronald Reagan, since at least 2005. With another office on Madison Avenue in New York and a network spread around the world, the firm reportedly has 32 analysts. Interest in the links between G3 and Fox was aroused earlier this week when it emerged coincidentally that the Sri Lanka Development Trust was also based at the same building as G3. The trust was set up by Fox to rebuild the country&apos;s infrastructure using private finance and is now based in Edinburgh. Crocker refused to comment. One of his allies had told the press that he had no involvement with Sri Lanka and had not heard of the trust. Perhaps the most damaging disclosures showed that many of the financial transactions of Pargav corresponded with the 18 destinations that Werritty and Fox visited together over the past 16 months. Reports claim that \u00a3583.34 left the company&apos;s accounts on 21 December to pay The Palace, a five star resort in Dubai. Ministry of Defence records showed that Fox was also in the UAE city from 17-22 December. Pargav&apos;s finances, according to reports, track Werritty back to Dubai in June, when he fixed a meeting with Fox for Harvey Boulter, a British businessman. In Sri Lanka the following month, the accounts reportedly showed that Werritty withdrew \u00a3117.73 from the Hatton National Bank. Records at Companies House show that Werritty is not the director of Pargav, despite being its only prominent employee. Oliver Hylton, a charity adviser to a hedge fund, told reporters on Friday that he had signed up as its director after being asked by Werritty. He said that Werritty was an &quot;adviser of some sort&quot; to Fox. &quot;Adam is a good and honest man. He has just been making a living,&quot; he said. Hylton added that he had met Werritty through Tory donors. Another reported Pargav sponsor was Michael Lewis, 52, the vice-chairman of Bicom until 2007 and boss of Oceana Investments. A Conservative party donor, he also gave \u00a313,832 to Atlantic Bridge, the charity set up by Fox and run by Werritty from Fox&apos;s parliamentary office. Lewis donated \u00a35,000 to Fox&apos;s leadership campaign in 2005. There have been other intriguing connections between Fox&apos;s best man and Bicom, which is devoted to seeking a more supportive environment for Israel. It also paid for Werritty&apos;s flight and hotel bills when he attended a conference in Israel in 2009 to speak about Iran. Bicom&apos;s former communications chief is Lee Petar, who left Bicom several years ago to form Tetra Strategy. Emails seen by the Guardian show that Petar had been working to arrange a meeting between Boulter, a private equity boss based in Dubai, and Fox or Werritty since March this year. Following this week&apos;s media storm surrounding Fox, the donors to Pargav may now be ruing the day they got involved with Werritty. Jon Moulton, a venture capitalist who has been listed as making several donations to Pargav, issued a statement following Fox&apos;s resignation claiming that Fox had lobbied him for money on Pargav&apos;s behalf. &quot;Before the last election, I had made several on-the-record donations to support Dr Fox following a request to do so from a Conservative party fundraiser. &quot;After the election, I was asked by Dr Fox to provide funds to a non-profit group called Pargav involved in security policy analysis and research and, after obtaining written assurances as to its activities, I provided personal funding to Pargav. &quot;Neither I, nor any of my associates, have sought or received a benefit of any form from Pargav. I have not received an account of Pargav&apos;s activities, nor have I been involved at all with Pargav, since funding. I will not be doing this again,&quot; he said.", "title": "Liam Fox resignation: Adam Werritty money trail was final straw", "sentences": ["Reports claim that \u00a3583.34 left the company&apos;s accounts on 21 December to pay The Palace, a five star resort in Dubai.", "Pargav&apos;s finances, according to reports, track Werritty back to Dubai in June, when he fixed a meeting with Fox for Harvey Boulter, a British businessman.", "Emails seen by the Guardian show that Petar had been working to arrange a meeting between Boulter, a private equity boss based in Dubai, and Fox or Werritty since March this year."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-14T20:05:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/14/dubai-liam-fox-fundamentalism-capitalism", "tags": ["Dubai", "Human rights", "Middle East and North Africa", "Liam Fox", "Politics", "World news", "Lobbying"], "article": "One thing confused me about the headlines this week, which were essentially a morality tale about the loneliness of the professional politician. Why did Liam Fox choose Dubai for his mysterious stopovers between London and Afghanistan? Why couldn&apos;t it be somewhere else, perhaps the Wembley Plaza Hotel in Middlesex? Four times in 18 months the former defence secretary laid his head there, when Bahrain, or maybe Oman, were the usual options. But it was Dubai, one of the seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates. Of all the slave states in all the towns in all the world, he walks into mine. Fox is not alone. In 2010, over 700,000 British tourists stayed in Dubai&apos;s hotels, according to the Dubai tourism website. The British are Dubai&apos;s best customers, which exposes how much people will collude with, or ignore, evil if their hotel rooms are cheap, sumptuous and have cable TV. Virgin Holidays say on its website: &quot;Dubai is like no other place on Earth. It is a truly fabulous destination where visitors can indulge in top-quality hotels, great shopping, fine dining, state-of-the-art spas and, of course, fantastic beaches. There is, however, more to Dubai than meets the eye \u2026&quot; Yes indeed, it is unique, and there is more than meets the eye. That copy could be rewritten to say, &quot;It is a truly fabulous destination where visitors can indulge in top-quality state censorship, great homophobia, fine misogyny, state-of-the-art police brutality and, of course, fantastic indentured servitude,&quot; and it would not be libelous \u2013 not in Britain, anyway. Dubai does not impose income tax, so the tourists are joined by an international convention of laughing parasites \u2013 all refugees from tax. I used to hate them, until I realised that any British people who want to live in Dubai, we can probably afford to lose. I went to Dubai two years ago because a friend was going for work and I am not a woman to let a friend go shopping in a tyranny alone. I knew there would be trouble, reading the guidebook on the plane. Dubai practises religious tolerance towards all religions, it said \u2013 except Judaism. So I knew I shouldn&apos;t do anything explicitly Jewish in the UAE, such as complain about the racist cartoons of hook-nosed Jews sitting on the world as if it were a big space-hopper made of gentiles. UAE newspapers think all Jews look like Harvey Weinstein crossed with Shrek. But Dubai, owner of the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building \u2013 or spike \u2013 on Earth has worse to show us than some casual antisemitism. Dubai, like the rest of the UAE, is a repressive state, hiding behind religious piety and that dreadful word glitz. If Mickey Mouse is in residence here, he has some of the smartest kids locked up in Space Mountain. Do not dare to be gay, or adulterous, or a democrat in Dubai. Homosexuality will get you up to 10 years in prison \u2013 party on, gays! A group of transvestites got five years in Abu Dhabi for dressing up; two lesbians got a month in Dubai, for kissing on the beach, before being spat out with deportation. I met a British woman in prison in Dubai. She was there for adultery, on the word of her husband \u2013 pale, thin, denied access to her children, almost too atrophied to speak. In the end, I didn&apos;t interview her. Appearing in the British media might prejudice her case, and, anyway, she had no words. It is an authoritarian oligarchy; the face of its ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, smiles from billboards and, sometimes, from our Queen&apos;s own carriage at Ascot. There is no press freedom in the UAE, just self-censorship. Insulting the royal family, or the flag, or possibly the architecture, will get you banged up. Everything gets you banged up in Dubai, except conformity and mindless shopping in the malls, one of which has a mountain in a fridge, which you can ski down \u2013 if skiing, rather than shopping in a tyranny, is your thing. And in neighbouring emirates it is little better. Human Rights Watch is detailing the case of five Emirati reformers, all awaiting trial for talking about democracy. The attorney general, Salim Saeed Kubaish, says they are in prison for &quot;instigation, breaking laws and perpetrating acts that pose a threat to state security, undermining the public order, opposing the government system, and insulting the president, the vice-president and the crown prince of Abu Dhabi&quot;. One, Nasser bin Ghaith, an economist and lecturer at Sorbonne Abu Dhabi, managed to get a statement out from al-Wathba prison this month. &quot;I have reached,&quot; he writes, &quot;an unshakeable conviction that this court, measured against international norms of justice, is merely a farce and facade meant to legitimise and make credible verdicts and penalties that may have already been decided. It is purely an attempt to punish me and those with me for our political opinions.&quot; They will not get a fair trial. And who built this city in the desert? There are 250,000 foreign workers in Dubai, drawn mostly from India and Bangladesh. They are indentured servants, that is, slaves. The usual way to recruit them is to draw them a picture of joy \u2013 great wages, fabulous working conditions \u2013 and charge them an enormous recruitment fee. Then, when they arrive, the construction companies often steal their passports, deny them their wages, and say they must work endlessly to pay for their return home, while living 10 to a room and working in the terrible heat. In Dubai, they cannot change jobs, and they cannot strike; those who do face violence, or deportation. Last year 113 Indians committed suicide in Dubai, or one every three days. And there is no stopping. The recession is a blip as the UAE expands like an octopus. A vast project is afoot to create a new tourist paradise. Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi will be ready in 2020. The Louvre, which should know better, but doesn&apos;t, will have an annexe there; so will the Guggenheim, and so will New York \u2013 New York! \u2013 University. We asked a Welsh couple why they came here. The answer arrived, from the man: the hotel staff would hold my dick if I asked. For me, that is not an advert, but others like to travel where labour is cheap and desperate and therefore loving. In my hotel they styled the ethnic minorities. African men carried my bag (my bag-carrier had a law degree), Bangladeshi men cleaned my room, and Thai women with false names \u2013 who can be bothered to pronounce a Thai name when there are so many of them? \u2013 served my dinner. These were human being beings acting as wallpaper. It is almost understandable, if you are\u00a0a psychopath. For every piece of human misery Dubai offers, it has a wondrous piece of leisure to distract you. This is, entirely, its terror. So there are buildings of incredible scope and ugliness, fake islands in the shape of continents, and the Burj al-Arab hotel, which is shaped like a sail and stuck above the Arabian Gulf. This is all meat for gibbering travel PRs. There are many places on Earth as repressive, but North Korea and Saudi Arabia are not touted as dirty weekend destinations for residents of liberal democracies. Dubai is a place of horror, the land where fundamentalism meets hyper-capitalism. Could anything be worse? So again, Liam Fox, why?", "title": "Why Dubai?

They could have been forgiven for thinking Liam Fox, with his neatly parted hair and clipped Scottish accent, resembled the GP he had once been, rather than a potential Tory leader. But, although few of the business leaders knew much about the shadow defence secretary, they were familiar with his charity, the Atlantic Bridge. This was the organisation whose patron, Lady Thatcher, was lionised in the US for her support of the free market and American military airbases on British soil. It was the organisation whose members in 2004 were ushered into the White House to be briefed by Karl Rove, George W Bush&apos;s special counsel. And it was the organisation whose cocktail parties in the Carlton Club in London and Charlie Palmer&apos;s steakhouse in Washington were high points of the transatlantic social calendar. Shortly after addressing the business leaders at Pittsburgh&apos;s Duquesne Club \u2013 &quot;the finest city club in the country&quot;\u2013 Fox explained that the Atlantic Bridge promoted the special relationship between the UK and the US by creating &quot;a network of individual people who can know one another&quot;. He declared: &quot;We are trying to bring people together who have common interests and to recognise that in an ever more globalised economy, we will all be called upon to defend those common interests.&quot; Last week those interests came back to haunt not just Fox, whose fall on Friday rocked David Cameron&apos;s coalition government, but also many Tory members of the cabinet, whose extensive links to the Atlantic Bridge are now under scrutiny. The irony is that it took a furore around Fox&apos;s friendship with a relatively minor player in the saga \u2013 a lobbyist, Adam Werritty \u2013 to make these links apparent. Admittedly, senior Tory cabinet ministers had been scrambling to distance themselves from the Atlantic Bridge long before the scandal brought Fox down. The organisation&apos;s website \u2013 and that of its sister charity across the Atlantic \u2013 has been dismantled. But old caches of the site reveal that, while shadow ministers, George Osborne, Michael Gove, Chris Grayling and William Hague were all on its advisory council alongside Fox, its UK chairman. All four stood down as awkward questions over its political activities, which contravened charity laws, resulted in the organisation being wound up. But the links to the cabinet do not end there. Cara Usher-Smith, the director of business development at Iain Duncan Smith&apos;s Centre for Social Justice, was a former director of the Atlantic Bridge. David Cameron&apos;s press secretary, Gabby Bertin, admitted last week that she was paid \u00a325,000 by the US drug giant Pfizer when working as the &quot;sole employee&quot; of the charity. Other senior Tories, notably Michael Ancram and Michael Howard, attended its receptions. Sir John Major gave a keynote speech at one of its US fundraisers. Its formidable connections to leading Tories were eclipsed only by its links to senior members of the US Republican party. The Republican senator for Arizona and Senate minority whip, Jon Kyl, and Jim DeMint, a Republican senator for South Carolina and a leading light in the Tea Party movement, were two powerful American members of its advisory council. To outsiders, the charity may have appeared to be little more than a social club, keen to throw a party in New York to promote Hague&apos;s book on William Wilberforce or hold a dinner for 14 in parliament&apos;s Club Room \u2013 an apparent breach of parliamentary rules. But the group&apos;s members were deeply serious in their beliefs, and Fox was more than happy to promote his neoconservative leanings when abroad. In a speech to Atlantic Bridge members in New York in November 2002, Fox warned &quot;the natural desire to avoid conflict has been reinforced by an innate pacificism in many sections of western society, especially in continental Europe&quot;. He told his audience: &quot;For too many, peace has come to mean simply the absence of war. We cannot allow that corrosive view to go unchallenged.&quot; Fox also used the speech to criticise the NHS, which he said had &quot;responded to a funding increase of almost 11% with only a 2% increase in activity&quot;. He was preaching to the converted. The Atlantic Bridge&apos;s addresses and conferences were all about promoting market liberalisation. A typical theme of one conference, held in both Los Angeles and Pittsburgh in July 2006, was entitled &quot;Killing the Golden Goose \u2013 How Regulation and Legislation are Damaging Wealth Creation&quot;. An earlier address in 2003 asked: &quot;How Much Health Care Can We Afford?&quot; Members of the Galen Institute, a thinktank which promotes &quot;freemarket ideas in health&quot;, attended its conferences while the failed bank Lehman Brothers, sponsored at least one event, as did the powerful neocon thinktank the Heritage Foundation. But in 2007 the Atlantic Bridge&apos;s relationship with big business entered a new realm, one that threatens to pose uncomfortable questions for Cameron and his party. The organisation signed a special partnership with the American Legislative Council (Alec), whose motto is &quot;Limited government, free markets, federalism&quot;. Overseen by Catherine Bray, a former adviser to the climate-change sceptic Roger Helmer, a Tory MEP, the project focused on &quot;providing an arena for young conservative leaders on both sides of the Atlantic to build close personal and professional relationships&quot;. Alec is one of the most powerful lobbying organisations in the US. Funded by the likes of Exxon Mobil, tobacco giant Philip Morris and the National Rifle Association, it holds conventions where legislators mingle with lobbyists. According to the Centre for Media and Democracy, a liberal, non-profit, American-based media research group, it uses these events to wine and dine state legislators and present them with pre-drafted bills drawn up on behalf of its members. Alec boasts: &quot;Each year, close to 1,000 bills, based at least in part on Alec model legislation, are introduced in the states. Of these, an average of 20% become law.&quot; One of its biggest supporters is the Koch Foundation, whose founders, the oil barons Charles G Koch and David H Koch, have funnelled about $55m to climate-denial front groups, according to Greenpeace, and are generous donors to the Tea Party movement. Alec&apos;s involvement with Fox&apos;s charity coincided with a large increase in funds to the US arm of his organisation. Accounts show that by 2009 the Atlantic Bridge was bringing in $280,508, more than double the $133,926 it was receiving in 2007. The huge rise in income, which dwarfed that of its UK sister organisation, coincided with a significant expansion in the charity&apos;s advisers and directors. By 2009 Werritty, whom the US accounts list as the (unpaid) UK executive director of the Atlantic Bridge, found himself reporting to a new chief executive officer, Amanda Bowman, the former New York director for the Centre for Security Policy, the neocon think-tank that opposed the planned Park 51 Muslim community centre close to the site of Ground Zero. Further administrative firepower came with the appointment of an impressive group of well-connected lawyers and lobbyists whose clients operate at the heart of the military-industrial complex. Scott Syfert, a lawyer with Moore &amp; Van Allen, which has represented military, chemical and energy interests, became executive chairman of its executive council. Frank Fahrenkopf, president of the American Gaming Association, which represents casino operators, also joined the council, as did Michael Hintze, an Australian billionaire hedge fund manager who has donated more than \u00a31m to the Tories and whose firm, CQS, has invested in firms with defence contracts. John Falk, a US lobbyist whose company, Firecreek, represents the Kestral Group, one of Pakistan&apos;s largest defence firms, joined its board of directors. So did Michael Fullerton, a former US department of homeland security adviser now working for Kestral. Randall Popelka, whose Capitol Bridge lobbying firm represents defence interests, joined as its US executive director. As the Atlantic Bridge boasted on its website: &quot;We have created a network of like-minded people \u2013 in politics, business, academia and journalism.&quot; It is hard to escape the conclusion that in the space of five years the Atlantic Bridge went from a small, Tory-leaning charity, dispensing freedom medals in the name of Thatcher, to an influential networking club linking most of the cabinet to powerful business interests, neocons and Tea Party enthusiasts. For Cameron, who preaches the gospel of &quot;compassionate Conservatism&quot;, the revelation is embarrassing. Given the elevated circles he was now moving in, it was hardly surprising that Werritty exploited his new contacts. By 2009 a powerful lobby group, Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre (Bicom), was covering the cost of Werritty&apos;s trip to an important security seminar in Israel. Bicom&apos;s former communications director, Lee Petar, who runs a lobbying firm, Tetra Strategy, put Werritty in touch with the Dubai businessman, Harvey Boulter, whose meeting with Fox triggered the initial furore that led to his his demise. Werritty&apos;s links to another businessman may also attract interest. It has emerged that an obscure company called Pargav financed his trips. Pargav was partly funded by Tamares Real Estate, an investment company owned by Poju Zabludowicz, chairman of Bicom. It was also funded by the Good Governance Group (G3), a private investigations company staffed by former MI6 officers and founded by Andries Pienaar, a South African who once worked for the security giant Kroll. The Observer has established that Pienaar has extensive interests in the defence sector. G3 boasts the defence contractor BAE Systems as a client, and its sister company, investment firm C5 Capital, of which Pienaar is a director, focuses on the security sector, seeking investment in &quot;niche sectors that mitigate risk and protect assets and lives \u2013 such as cyber security, biometrics, detection and communications&quot;. C5 is known to have been interested in buying cyber security firms which had contracts with MI5. Pienaar played a key role in establishing the Sri Lanka Development Trust, whose address was listed at G3&apos;s headquarters, and which paid for several of Fox&apos;s trips abroad. &quot;We agreed to help Dr Fox because of our longstanding interest and involvement in conflict resolution and reconstruction,&quot; the Good Governance Group said in a statement. Ultimately, Fox paid the price for blurring the lines between his political and personal life. But the warning signs had been there for some time. Eyebrows were raised two years ago when he appointed a former US army captain, Luke Coffey, as his special adviser. Coffey is a member of the Council for Emerging National Security Affairs, a thinktank that promotes US national security and is staffed largely by ex-CIA agents. The appointment spoke volumes about Fox&apos;s thinking. The Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott observed: &quot;We are allies of America, but we are not the 51st state.&quot; Fox disagreed.

With their risky swipe at collectivism, John W Henry&apos;s Fenway Sports Group placed Kenny Dalglish and his men under extra pressure to entertain the punters in Dubai and Hong Kong. To command a higher price in the entertainment market, you ought to have something decent to sell. And Liverpool showed enough in this 1-1 draw with Manchester United to avoid any demand for refunds in the distant lands where the Premier League plants its flags. Or &quot;EPL&quot;, as Henry called it in David Conn&apos;s Guardian interview this week, as in English Premier League. &quot;We knew virtually nothing about Liverpool Football Club nor EPL,&quot; Henry admitted, in a week when Ian Ayre, his managing director, floated the idea of unequal sharing and heard the English game blow a raspberry. As this game ignited with Rio Ferdinand&apos;s clip on Charlie Adam and a subsequent Steven Gerrard free-kick, 68 minutes in, it was odd to think this passion play was framed, in part, in the offices of a New York merchant bank: Inner Circle Sports, who advised not only Fenway on their takeover, but Tom Hicks and George Gillett. At the other end of the pitch chugged a side who are owned by residents of Florida. Nice of Gary Neville, then, to say on Sky that Liverpool have their &quot;identity&quot; back. With no clear plan for stadium building or redevelopment, and a \u00a335m striker who didn&apos;t kick a ball here, Liverpool may be viewed as a mildly confused aristocrat still trying to recover from a run of bad experiences. On the pitch, though, events are starting to turn their way. Helped by Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s decision to start without Wayne Rooney, Nani and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, Liverpool were able to assert their hunger in a first half that confirmed Gerrard&apos;s steady return to form. The old ground-burning, comic-strip Stevie G has yet to reappear, but he is finding his rhythm again after six months out. He can still turn a game, too, especially when Ryan Giggs peels away from a wall. That lapse by United&apos;s oldest player opened the gap for Gerrard to swing his free-kick past David de Gea. By then, Nani and Rooney were stripping for action, but Liverpool held the advantage. Anfield&apos;s joy was doused when Hern\u00e1ndez connected with a Danny Welbeck flick-on with 15 minutes to go. At the end, though, Liverpool bore the greater look of satisfaction. For this campaign to yield a dividend, as Inner Circle might say, Dalglish needs his summer signings to exert a rapid catalytic effect. In the industry, most experts say Liverpool have made solid additions without yet adding a lot of title-winning lustre. Luis Su\u00e1rez is the best acquisition of the past two years: not only for his movement, but for his footwork in tight spaces around the area. Compression is a challenge Su\u00e1rez solves by dancing out of trouble. Below the Su\u00e1rez tier of virtuosity, Stewart Downing is destructive in bursts and intelligent in his positional awareness. In his mid-20s, he rations his attacks on full-backs more than Dalglish may like, concentrating more on accurate delivery. Behind him, Jos\u00e9 Enrique posted one of his best performances since joining from Newcastle, snuffing out Park Ji-sung and hounding Chris Smalling, United&apos;s right-back. In the centre, Adam is a constant irritant to opposition midfielders. Not the most athletic runner, Adam compensates with craft. His tumble for Gerrard&apos;s free-kick was preceded by an audacious slalom through three United players. Jordan Henderson, the most speculative of Dalglish&apos;s signings, made a pleasing impact when replacing Lucas Leiva. At this point in the reconstruction only Andy Carroll presents a problem of integration, of style and tone. In large measure, football, even at this level, is a straightforward process of performing simple tasks: receiving and giving the ball, moving into space, creating angles and taking up the correct positions. But the best sides do much more. Only when Rooney, Hern\u00e1ndez and Nani came on to rescue United did you see the champions in plot-changing mode. Until then, they were workmanlike. These are the assets Liverpool crave. They possess them in Su\u00e1rez and Gerrard, and sometimes Downing, Dirk Kuyt and Craig Bellamy. Adam&apos;s run towards the Kop for the Gerrard free\u2011kick was another spark of possibility. It conveyed boldness, conviction, ambition. It was Liverpool in their best match-grabbing mode, not subservient to United, not stuck in a rebuilding phase. When a late chance fell to Martin Skrtel, conversely, you felt the inevitability of his miss and saw the upper-mid-table mediocrity Liverpool are trying to take to the dump. John W Henry&apos;s musings this week said the figures are hurting. Knowing &quot;nothing about the EPL&quot; before they swooped on a household name in chaos, they now know too much about what it takes to compete with United or Chelsea or Manchester City. So high were Liverpool in the European hierarchy, it was impossible to imagine a complete collapse. The sheer force of history held them up until new owners could come in. It is a bit soon, though, to confuse that history with the current box-office appeal of this squad, abroad.

Fajla, a Malian driver who worked at the Ibn Sana hospital when the besieging government forces announced their intention to take Sirte in September, was owed 3,736 Libyan dinars, a small fortune. So while others fled he stayed in the city with his five children, aged between four months and nine years old, and his wife and a cousin. His home was in District 2, at the heart of the last remaining pocket of pro-Gaddafi loyalist fighters, still being pounded yesterday by artillery and anti-aircraft guns. Until Friday that is, when Fajla and his family slipped out. I found them sitting by a wall near the field hospital outside the city, uncertain what to do or where to go. &quot;I left the hospital on 15 September, the day the fighting started,&quot; he explained. &quot;I haven&apos;t been back since. I came to Libya 13 years ago to earn money. For 10 of those, I worked as a tailor. For the last three years, I worked in the hospital.&quot; He showed his pass from Ibn Sana. It described him as a driver and a tailor. &quot;The only time I went out of my house was to search for food for my children. I had a car from the hospital. After a while, they would not let me get food from the shops. All the shops were closed. They said: &apos;Bring your family to the security building.&apos; Outside was a place where you could buy food. &quot;We were in my house with another Malian family of three and hid in the basement. Most days I slept and hid in my house. I did not know what was happening outside. &apos;We were lucky. Nothing happened to our house. All the other houses around ours were hit by shells and missiles. Most of the houses were empty. They fired during the day, but not after seven at night. Then it was quieter. &quot;There was water, but we had no electricity. I was not frightened for myself but for my children and my family. Every day we talked about escaping. My life was in the hands of God. &quot;Then three days ago the other family went and did not return. So on Friday, before seven in the morning, I went out of the house and walked 100 metres. No one fired at me, so I went back for the family and we walked out with the clothes that we were wearing. Then some government fighters picked us up and took us here. &quot;I would have left Libya in February,&quot; he added sadly. &quot;But I needed the money.&quot; Details of conditions for civilians and pro-Gaddafi troops in the last pocket held by Gaddafi fighters in Sirte&apos;s District 2, a coastal strip no wider than 700\u00a0metres and often narrower, and perhaps a kilometre and a half in length, are difficult to come by. The pocket centred on this neigbourhood is defined by a handful of landmarks. At its western end lies Sirte&apos;s television station, with its pair of ruined satellite dishes. It runs east through houses and expansive villas to an open area of sand skirted by the grey hulks of unfinished buildings before reaching the &quot;high rises&quot; \u2013 long feared by the government fighters&apos; commanders. The high rises are really not so high, a cluster of two dozen buildings in a district backing on to the sea, apartments and shops and offices, an area of diminished sovereignty that runs out just short of a tall aerial. It is difficult to know how many civilians have been trapped, although M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res suggested on Friday that as many as 10,000 are still suffering what Fajla and his family went through. In places it has been flooded thigh-deep with a rank mixture of water and sewage that has settled in the dips below a low, narrow ridge that runs just above the coastal road. The discovery of four groups of bodies numbering between 30 and 42, shot with their hands tied, has hinted darkly at executions in the area controlled by Gaddafi forces. At first it was believed they were captured government fighters. Now it appears they were civilians of Sirte. &quot;They are not from the katiba [government militias],&quot; said Dr Mohammed Abdel Rauf, whom I met near the pocket&apos;s southern front line. &quot;The fighters came to see if the dead were among their missing and did not recognise the bodies. They had been divided into groups. There was a group who were dark-skinned and another group with lighter skin. Some had green army jackets. They were aged between 18 and 35-40, although I did not look at their faces. &quot;There was a cousin of one of the men who I chatted with.&quot; Rauf relayed the story of the cousin&apos;s dead relative, how the Gaddafi troops took him when they couldn&apos;t find his father and told the man&apos;s mother she could have her son if the father surrendered himself. When he did not surrender, they killed the son. He supplied his own theory for the other dead. &quot;I think they were all citizens of Sirte who refused to fight.&quot; Then there are snatches to be pieced together. First, there are clues to the strong loyalties of those still inside. In a recently captured house a child&apos;s homework project is found, a large sheet of yellow paper covered with pictures of Gaddafi fighters routing the &quot;rats of the revolution&quot;. A government fighter saw the picture and flew into a rage, grabbing the sheet and tearing it into pieces. And in house after house there are snapshots or stylised pictures of Gaddafi and his family. Inside one of the government ambulances I found a group of doctors leafing through a pile of photographs an inch thick that somebody had collected: Gaddafi in close-up, Gaddafi sitting in a group, Gaddafi greeting friends \u2013 all signs of a cult of personality that permeated much of Sirte. Explaining, perhaps, its bitter and intransigent resistance even to the very end. Then there are clues to the morale of those inside the pocket. Fighters who have captured those left inside, fighting to the end, say it is every man for himself within the pocket. That it is chaos. Certainly soldiers captured in the last few days look haunted and terrified, bruised and crying from beatings they have received. Others have been thin and emaciated. What is certain is the damage that has been wrought on District 2 by the relentless fire levelled at it over the past three days. On Dubai Street, where the road curves round into a narrow canyon of three-storey and four-storey buildings, flooded at road level, the government fighters&apos; southern advance has been held up, and it is possible to glimpse the damage from a front line sectored by machine-gun fire. Shells have blasted through walls and windows. Where walls have not been scorched, they have been smashed through by anti-aircraft guns fired from pick-up trucks or punctured by .50-calibre rounds. Every few minutes on Friday another shell would hit the rooftops, some only a few hundred metres distant, sending up clouds of white smoke and concrete dust that merged with the grey smoke of fires. &quot;We think there are 200 to 300 of them left, according to our intelligence,&quot; said Abdul Salem Rishi, one of the commanders of the eastern forces from Benghazi who have been assaulting the pocket from close to Sirte&apos;s coastal road. &quot;We listen to their radios, but for the last two days we have heard nothing.&quot; It is a silence that prefigures the end of the resistance in District 2, in Sirte itself and of its last pocket of followers of Abu Muammar, which might happen in a day or in 10 days, but cannot be avoided.", "title": "Gaddafi loyalists hold out in last desperate resistance at Sirte, as families flee", "sentences": ["On Dubai Street, where the road curves round into a narrow canyon of three-storey and four-storey buildings, flooded at road level, the government fighters&apos; southern advance has been held up, and it is possible to glimpse the damage from a front line sectored by machine-gun fire."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-15T23:08:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/16/observer-editorial-end-crony-capitalism", "tags": ["Liam Fox", "Adam Werritty", "David Cameron", "Politics", "UK news", "Lobbying"], "article": "The scandal that brought down Liam Fox ought not to have come as a surprise to at least one member of the cabinet who predicted something very like it in a speech 20 months ago. When his party was still in opposition, but looking forward to office and all the temptations that come with power, a leading Tory warned that the uproar over MPs&apos; expenses could be merely the harbinger of a much larger scandal. The cause would be a vast but shadowy industry with the potential to be much more corrupting of democracy than parliamentarians over-claiming for plasma TVs and scatter cushions. The next big scandal waiting to happen was lobbying or, to give this often opaque business its proper description, the trading of cash for access and influence over government. This Tory knew of what he spoke because he had done some lobbying himself before he became an MP. &quot;We all know how it works. The lunches, the hospitality, the quiet word in your ear, the ex-ministers and ex-advisers for hire, helping big business to get its way.&quot; The author of that speech was David Cameron and how prescient he has proved to be. The scandal that ruined Dr Fox is, at heart, a scandal about lobbying. Many elements have swirled around the affair, including what the former defence secretary called &quot;whispering from the weeds&quot; about his sexuality. But the central cause of his downfall is clear. He had to go once it was revealed that Adam Werritty \u2013 his former flatmate, self-styled &quot;adviser&quot;, broker of unrecorded and undeclared meetings and near-constant companion around the globe \u2013 was funded by tycoons and companies with a direct and commercial interest in defence-related businesses. It is not yet entirely clear just how many corporate concerns were gaining privileged access to the defence secretary via his best man. But we already know quite enough to see that it was very wrong. The &quot;chance meeting&quot; in Dubai between Dr Fox and one defence-related company was the explicit result of lobbying. The company paid \u00a310,000 a month to lobbyists Tetra Strategy to secure a meeting with the defence secretary. Tetra put the company&apos;s boss together with Mr Werritty. At the behest of his friend and in breach of the ministerial code, the defence secretary then met Harvey Boulter, the American head of an investment fund that had an interest in a firm that wanted to sell technology to the Ministry of Defence. Another thing we know is that Mr Werritty conveniently changed his interests whenever his friend changed political portfolios. When Dr Fox was a Tory spokesman on health, his best man ran a health consultancy. When Dr Fox moved to defence, his best man became a defence consultant. Had Dr Fox been appointed transport secretary, on past form Mr Werritty would have developed a consuming interest in rail franchises, airport landing rights and motorway construction. Mr Werritty&apos;s financial backers were a group of rich men who appear to have been funding him to stay close to the defence secretary and exploit the networking opportunities that followed. The motives of such patrons can be various: the pursuit of an ideological agenda; the hope of picking up privileged information; or the potential for commercial gain. Often, all three are in the mix, for such people can find it difficult to distinguish between what they see as the global greater good and their own personal and corporate interests. Before he resigned, Dr Fox was forced to concede: &quot;I know it looks bad.&quot; It looks bad because it was bad. Lobbying is especially intense and lucrative when it comes to defence procurement. At stake are contracts worth hundreds of millions and even billions of pounds. This is why the Ministry of Defence rightly has strict rules about meetings between decision-makers and suppliers. No officials were present so we cannot be sure exactly what transpired when Mr Boulter and Dr Fox met at that hotel in Dubai. That is why the rules say officials should be present \u2013 so we can be sure that nothing improper takes place. What applies to defence is true across government. From health to education, welfare to planning laws, hosts of lobbyists are trying to bend ministers and officials to favour the interests of their clients. They swarmed to the recent Conservative conference just as they used to cluster around Labour conferences when the other side had the power. It is not just the potential for corruption that demands much greater public scrutiny of the \u00a32bn lobbying industry. There is also the general danger that their activities undermine democracy and good government by distorting decision-making in favour of their clients at the expense of the public interest and ordinary voters who can&apos;t buy access to power. Many in the industry will protest that this is an unfair characterisation of what they do. They argue it is quite legitimate to present the concerns of their clients to ministers before decisions are made. Fine. If what they do is truly reputable, they ought to have nothing to fear from a lot more light being shone into this twilight world. Transparency is what the prime minister has previously promised. He said in his speech last year that &quot;secret corporate lobbying... is why people are so fed up with politics&quot; and promised to &quot;force our politics to come clean about who is buying power and influence&quot;. One of the first pledges made when the coalition came to power was to introduce a compulsory register of lobbyists. Lobbyists would be obliged to make regular declarations of the identities of their clients, whom they had met and what was discussed. This was a very good idea and yet nothing has happened to progress it into law. A consultation has been stalled \u2013 could that possibly be because someone has been lobbying? The result of this foot-dragging is that we are no closer to the government fulfilling David Cameron&apos;s pledge to &quot;shine the light of transparency on lobbying&quot;. In the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, the prime minister was right to introduce greater openness about the relationships between politicians and media proprietors. As a matter of urgency, he ought now to do the same about lobbying. The register should be enacted. Ministers and their advisers should also be obliged to make a quarterly declaration of meetings with lobbyists and other special interests. Officials should always be present at those meetings to record exactly what was said. It is time for David Cameron to be true to that speech he made 20 months ago and make good on his promises to clean up what he called &quot;crony capitalism&quot;. Otherwise he may find that it is not just Dr Fox who is shot.", "title": "Honour the pledge to clean up lobbying, Mr Senate | Observer editorial", "sentences": ["The &quot;chance meeting&quot; in Dubai between Dr Fox and one defence-related company was the explicit result of lobbying.", "No officials were present so we cannot be sure exactly what transpired when Mr Boulter and Dr Fox met at that hotel in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-15T23:09:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/16/andrew-rawnsley-liam-fox-not-untypical", "tags": ["Liam Fox", "David Cameron", "UK news", "Politics", "Lobbying"], "article": "Who was the first cabinet minister to resign from Tony Blair&apos;s government? No, it was not Peter Mandelson. He made a habit of resigning, but he was not the first to go. No, it was not David Blunkett either. No, for those of you who can&apos;t remember, I am not going to tease through the entire list of the many ministers compelled to quit during the Labour years. The answer is Ron Davies \u2013 remember him? \u2013 who resigned as secretary of state for Wales amid the most lurid headlines about his &quot;moment of madness&quot; on Clapham Common. That sudden departure from government was accompanied by a media storm of a similar intensity and duration to that which has just attended the downfall of Liam Fox. Then the waters closed over the head of Mr Davies and the Blair government sailed on without him to win two further elections. Cabinet resignations seem to matter a huge amount at the time. They scream from the front pages, they dominate the bulletins, they even generate some good jokes. My favourite about the Fox affair is that he actually wrote his resignation letter a week ago, but made the mistake of giving it to Oliver Letwin to hand to the prime minister. Dr Fox finally went on Friday only because it took that long for someone to fish his letter out of the park bin into which the ditzy Mr Letwin had discarded it. I&apos;d say that the fall of Dr Fox had taken on an aura of inevitability from Tuesday as resourceful journalists began to join the dots between Adam Werritty, his best man and self-styled &quot;adviser&quot;, and defence-related industries. I&apos;d also say that Number 10 could grasp that too. Whatever Downing Street says to the contrary, David Cameron and his advisers have been obsessed with how to handle this affair. As for Dr Fox himself, the termination of his cabinet career will matter for the rest of his life. When he dreamed of his place in history, he did not have in mind that he would become the first defence secretary to be forced to resign because of scandal since Jack Profumo had to go in 1963 because of the lies he told about Christine Keeler. Technically speaking, Dr Fox is the first-ever defence secretary to be forced to resign because, in Profumo&apos;s day, the job had the more bellicose title of secretary of state for war. In the grand scheme of things, most resignations from the cabinet don&apos;t have a discernibly lasting impact. They only do so if the voters and media draw from them larger conclusions about the government. The fall of Jack Profumo was one of those resignations which did have a greater meaning because it brought to a head and crystallised a wider feeling that Harold Macmillan&apos;s Tories had grown corrupted by being too long in office. It also led to the conclusion that a prime minister once famed for his assured political skills had lost his touch. Macmillan resigned a few months later. Number 10 is very anxious that we should see no Profumo-like parallels. They want Liam Fox tagged, bagged and binned as a resignation which has no larger consequences and says nothing more deeply damaging about this government. &quot;It was a unique set of circumstances,&quot; says one adviser to the prime minister. Even as Mr Cameron was before the cameras expressing the ritual obsequies for a fallen colleague, other Tories were privately voluble that Dr Fox was &quot;always a maverick&quot;, &quot;a chancer&quot;, &quot;committed the most dreadful errors of personal and political judgment&quot; \u2013 in other words, the only conclusion we should draw from this affair is that Dr Fox was the author of his own demise. Since this also happens to be true, many may be inclined to agree that his case is unique. Number 10 is quietly congratulating itself on the way in which the prime minister has handled the first resignation of a Conservative from his cabinet. Characteristically nervous about the right of his party, Mr Cameron did not want to get into the position of having to sack one of their champions. Dr Fox could have been a rallying point for discontent with the coalition if he had been sent to the backbenches looking like a victim or a martyr in the eyes of the right. So Mr Cameron commissioned an investigation by the cabinet secretary, probably not the retirement present that Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell first had in mind. This tactic has exposed the prime minister to two charges. One is that he was subcontracting his own responsibilities to police the conduct of his ministers to an unelected civil servant and this placed the cabinet secretary in the embarrassing and constitutionally dubious position of declaring whether a minister is fit for office. The second charge is that Mr Cameron has revealed himself to be feeble and dithering when it comes to dealing with errant ministers because he did not act faster and fire Dr Fox when it was becoming daily more apparent that he had to go. Prime ministerial weakness and indecision has been Labour&apos;s accusation, but made rather half-heartedly because Labour itself had not actually called for the defence secretary to resign. As it turned out, the media, which work to quicker deadlines and are often faster to the facts than inquiries by the cabinet office, accumulated evidence which was just too damning so Dr Fox went before Sir Gus had formally reported back to the prime minister. But the end result was still the one originally desired by David Cameron. He comes out of it looking like someone who waited for the evidence before he came to a verdict about a colleague, the defence secretary&apos;s blood is not on his hands and Dr Fox is sent to the backbenches looking like neither a victim nor a martyr, but a fool. Even Tories who share his Thatcherite views and initially rallied to him now accept that he did for himself. The vacant chair at the Ministry of Defence has been filled by Philip Hammond, a solid, amiable, unflashy accountant who goes to drinks parties \u2013 the ones I see him at, anyway \u2013 accompanied not by his best man, but by his wife. From a Number 10 point of view, that is a damage-limitation job well done. Wound cauterised. Case closed. Please move along. Nothing more to see here. They hope we will forget Liam Fox&apos;s resignation as quickly as we did that of Ron Davies. I wonder about that. For there are some wider lessons to be learned and David Cameron would be sensible to absorb and act upon them before another scandal of a similar nature comes along. To start with, this affair has exposed a glaring omission in the ministerial code of conduct: it covers conflicts of interest that may arise from the activities and interests of spouses and other family members, but not &quot;friends&quot;. This did not seem to matter in the past, but surely does in a government in which some ministers appear to be closer to their friends than they are to their spouses. The prime minister surely ought to ask the cabinet secretary to have the code rewritten to close that loophole. And get it done by Monday evening. It is also high time, as is argued in the leader comment opposite, that David Cameron made good on his previous pledges to introduce robust laws to control the activities of lobbyists and clean up what he once called &quot;crony capitalism&quot;. I don&apos;t say all Tory ministers display such a cavalier disregard for the rules as Dr Fox. At least I bloody well hope they don&apos;t. But he was not quite so entirely untypical as it would suit the prime minister to have us believe. Dr Fox has not been the only cabinet minister to give the impression that he believes that only &quot;the little people&quot; have to obey the rules. Most voters will not have followed every twist and turn of the Fox hunt, but some of the details are liable to resonate in the public consciousness. Secret meetings with controversial American tycoons at gold-plated hotels in Dubai. Trips on private jets paid for by more rich men, often based abroad. Undeclared encounters with foreign potentates at more five-star hotels. This is not the lifestyle of most voters. These are the sort of things that tend to stick in the public mind because they confirm suspicions that people already harboured about Tories. I don&apos;t say that every Conservative minister has the same appetite for luxury globetrotting or unusual friendships as Dr Fox. But he is not the only senior Tory who has hitched rides on rich men&apos;s jets. Some of the plutocrats who financed his best friend&apos;s activities turn out also to be funders of the Tory party. The downfall of Liam Fox prompts us to remember that George Osborne almost did for himself with a dangerous liaison on a Russian oligarch&apos;s yacht and that David Cameron himself has had to apologise for getting too snug with media moguls. So I don&apos;t think we are all going to be entirely persuaded to see this in the way Number 10 would like us to see this, as no more than the case of one exceptionally foolish cabinet minister who went rogue. There are patterns here. This resignation brings them into sharper relief. And we will all be looking that much harder in future for who next in the cabinet might repeat them.", "title": "Dr Fox is not so rare a beast as Mr Cameron would have us think | Andrew Rawnsley", "sentences": ["Secret meetings with controversial American tycoons at gold-plated hotels in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-15T23:09:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/16/gilad-shalit-palestinian-prisoner-swap", "tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Palestinian territories", "Gilad Shalit", "Hamas"], "article": "Abdul al-Aziz Salaha The highly public role of Salaha, 30, in the killing of an Israeli soldier became one of the defining images of the second intifada.

Michael Hintze, a hedge fund owner and major Tory party donor, provided Werritty with free office space at the plush headquarters of his \u00a35bn CQS hedge fund and allowed Fox and Werritty to travel on his private jet. Hammond lists him on the MPs&apos; register of interests as a donor several times, although his spokesman yesterday said the hospitality before and after the election had been properly registered, and openly declared. As the Liberal Democrats indicated they will use Fox&apos;s resignation to speed up the introduction a register of lobbyists, it emerged that the company set up to support Werritty&apos;s jet-set lifestyle was created days before regulators demanded that Atlantic Bridge, which had been paying for Werritty&apos;s flights around the world, suspend all its activities. The Guardian has discovered Pargav Ltd, which paid for Werritty to travel the world first class and stay at the most exclusive five-star hotels, was founded on 25 June last year \u2013 just eight days before the Charity Commission demanded that Atlantic Bridge&apos;s activities &quot;must cease immediately&quot;. Pargav, which received \u00a3147,000 in donations from Tory party supporters and businessmen, was founded at offices of the same accountancy firm that audited the charity. The revelation raises questions as to whether Atlantic Bridge&apos;s trustees, who were led by Fox until May 2010, set up Pargav after they got wind that the watchdog was about to force the suspension of the charity, which was run by Werritty. A Charity Commission spokesman said it would have allowed the trustees of Atlantic Bridge to see the details of its report a &quot;couple of weeks&quot; before it was completed on 5 July 2010. There was a further blow for Werritty last night when the City of London police confirmed that its economic crime unit is considering whether to launch an investigation into allegations that the lobbyist may have committed fraud. Police may decide to investigate whether Fox&apos;s long-term travel companion profited from misrepresenting himself as an official adviser to the former defence secretary. If an investigation is launched it is likely to centre on whether Werritty was gaining pecuniary advantage by misrepresentation by handing out business cards embossed with the logo of House of Commons portcullis and describing him as an &quot;adviser to Rt Hon Dr Liam Fox MP&quot;. Defence business people who claim they were misled by Werritty, including Dubai-based private equity boss Harvey Boulter, are understood to be pressing police to launch a full-scale investigation. Boulter said he passed on financially sensitive information to Werritty only because he was led to believe Werritty was an official government adviser. Werritty has been accused of seeking to misrepresent himself to a string of foreign generals, business people and even overseas heads of state. Hintze was at a Buckingham Palace reception for prominent Australians last Thursday when he learned that further details of his involvement with Werritty were to be made public. That night, Lord Bell, the PR man who helped Lady Thatcher win three elections, assisted Hintze to leak full details of Werritty&apos;s funding to the media. The next day, Fox resigned as defence secretary. The sole director of Pargav is Oliver Hylton, one of Hintze&apos;s closest aides and the manager of his charitable foundation that paid the donations to Atlantic Bridge. Hylton has said he was &quot;naive&quot; to sign the documents that allowed Werritty to create Pargav, which also sought donations from private equity boss Jon Moulton and companies linked to the defence industry. Both Pargav and Atlantic Bridge gave their registered addresses as the offices of accountants Kingston Smith at 60 Goswell Road, central London. Also registered at that address was Security Futures, a global risk consultancy which counted both Werritty and Hylton on its board until it was wound up last year. The company secretary of Security Futures was Tory MP Iain Aitken Stewart, a close friend of Fox and Werritty. One of the key donors to Pargav has been Michael Lewis, who is a former vice-chairman of Bicom, an organisation that lobbies on behalf of Israel. He has donated \u00a313,832 to Atlantic Bridge and \u00a35,000 to Fox. Bicom has been linked to Werritty, and paid for the 33-year-old&apos;s flight and hotel bills when he attended a conference in Israel in 2009 to speak about Iran. Bicom&apos;s former communications chief is Lee Petar, who left the lobby group to set up PR outfit Tetra Strategy a few years ago. Emails seen by the Guardian show Petar had been working to arrange a meeting between Werritty and private equity boss Harvey Boulter in Dubai in June. An invoice seen by the Guardian shows Petar received thousands of pounds from Boulter for help setting up the meeting and for PR advice. Jon Moulton, the private equity tycoon who bought Reader&apos;s Digest and has donated \u00a3400,000 to the Tories, has given \u00a335,000 to Pargav. He said Fox requested he pay money into the company. &quot;After the election, I was asked by Dr Fox to provide funds to a non-profit group called Pargav involved in security policy analysis and research and after obtaining written assurances as to its activities I provided personal funding to Pargav,&quot; Moulton said.     Ministerial meetings Photograph: Official records    &quot;Neither I, nor any of my associates, have sought or received a benefit of any form from Pargav. I have not received an account of Pargav&apos;s activities, nor have I been involved at all with Pargav, since funding. I will not be doing this again. Other donors to Pargav include Tamares Real Estate \u2013 an investment company owned by Tory donor and Bicom chairman Poju Zabludowicz \u2013 and the Good Governance Group (G3), a private investigations company staffed by former MI6 officers and founded by Andries Pienaar, a South African who once worked for the security giant Kroll. The concerns over Werritty&apos;s funding come as the Guardian reveals that ministers held meetings with corporate officials on more than 1,500 occasions in the first 10 months of the coalition government. The Charity Commission&apos;s report into the Atlantic Bridge, published on 26 July last year, said the primary objective of the charity, which was supported by George Osborne, William Hague and Michael Gove, appeared to be &quot;promoting a political policy [that] is closely associated with the Conservative party&quot;. It said &quot;current activities must cease immediately&quot; because &quot;the activities of the charity have not furthered any of its other charitable purposes in any way&quot;.

President Barack Obama seems to believe that the &quot;Iranian bomb plot&quot; allegations provide a genuine case against the Tehran regime \u2013 otherwise he would not have taken the risk of having them scrutinised in a civilian court. Obama&apos;s confidence seems to stem from intelligence gathered inside Iran, which convinced the US government that the head of the revolutionary guards (IRGC) had co-ordinated the plot. Despite Obama&apos;s confidence, some experts are expressing serious doubts about whether the IRGC would be involved in such an uncharacteristically unsophisticated operation with a trail leading right to their doorstep. There are others who doubt whether the Mexican Zetas drug cartel would want to be involved in such a joint operation with the IRGC. Should evidence from the US fail to convince the courts and the case is thrown out, Khamenei would have good reason to celebrate. This would boost his position at home, where he could say that his regime has been the innocent victim of a US intelligence plot, like Mohammad Mosaddegh was in 1953. Abroad he could say the precedent set by the case discredits all US opinion and reports with regards to Iran&apos;s nuclear programme. In the meantime, Obama is using the evidence at his disposal in an effort to bring Russia and China on board but the worst news for Khamenei is Obama&apos;s talk of imposing severe sanctions. This could mean sanctions against Iran&apos;s central bank \u2013 a very serious threat, which Khamenei can only ignore at his peril. New sanctions will mean less money at home to buy the loyalty of the IRGC and politicians, which could impact on the regime&apos;s stability. Gone are the days when true believers joined the revolution because of ideology. These days the revolution is being run by the IRGC whose loyalty Khamenei needs to buy through corruption and lucrative contracts, so that its officers can send their wives and kids on expensive shopping trips to Dubai. The same goes for people outside the IRGC, such as President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who took 100 people with him on his recent trip to the UN in New York, including his son, wife, daughter-in-law and her mother. While he was giving his anti-US tirades, his entourage were busy shopping. Less money could also mean more corruption scandals surfacing as means of score settling between factions who will be fighting over less money. The recent corruption scandal surrounding more than $2.6bn (\u00a31.6bn) of embezzled money from banks could be a sign of things to come. Ahmadinejad or his right-hand man Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei could be the biggest victim from the fallout. Both have been divisive figures and Khamenei will now have more reason to weaken them. He may even consider removing them, although the chances of this in the immediate future are not very high. Such quarrels within the regime are what dreams are made out of for its opponents as they can be fatal. Although the regime has called the recent accusations &quot;lies&quot;, within the corridors of power serious questions are probably being asked about the IRGC. Questions such as: is it possible that the organisation has become so inefficient and lax that a rogue operative could undertake such an initiative? Is it possible that Khamenei was kept out of the picture? Or was Khamenei set up by those inside the regime who want to use the wrath of US to weaken him? The worst case scenario for Khamenei would be if he had supervised or approved the plan himself and news about this reached Iran&apos;s politicians. This would damage his standing, as well as that of his IRGC allies. It would make them look incompetent and careless. The affair could also impact on the position of IRGC Quds force commander Qasem Soleymani inside Iran and any potential political ambitions he may have. However, there is also some good news for the regime. Regardless of whether the Iranian government is innocent or not, US reaction to the allegations will put an end to the internal fighting and discussions about whether Iran should seriously pursue dialogue with the US. Those against can use Obama&apos;s reaction to justify their anti-US stance. This would be a welcome development for Khamenei as this question has been yet another divisive issue within his regime. Most probably, recent events will push Khamenei towards taking a harder line at home. He already has enough problems with his own politicians, and now with the US. He will have even less patience for what the people of Iran want.", "title": "Iranian 'bomb plot' could have severe consequences for Khamenei | Meir Javedanfar", "sentences": ["These days the revolution is being run by the IRGC whose loyalty Khamenei needs to buy through corruption and lucrative contracts, so that its officers can send their wives and kids on expensive shopping trips to Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-18T09:09:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/18/liam-fox-security-risk-report", "tags": ["Liam Fox", "Politics", "Adam Werritty", "UK news", "Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "House of Commons", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "Lobbying"], "article": "Liam Fox put the security of himself and his officials at &quot;risk&quot; on overseas visits by releasing details of his diary to Adam Werritty, the cabinet secretary Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell has concluded in his report into the former defence secretary. In a damning assessment of Fox, O&apos;Donnell said that the former defence secretary was guilty of multiple breaches of the ministerial code after &quot;blurring&quot; the lines between his private and official responsibilities. O&apos;Donnell said: &quot;Dr Fox&apos;s actions clearly constitute a breach of the ministerial code which Dr Fox has already acknowledged. This was a failure of judgment on his part for which he has taken the ultimate responsibility in resigning office.&quot; Downing Street immediately announced David Cameron had accepted O&apos;Donnell&apos;s report, which recommended a tightening of the rules governing relations between ministers and civil servants. But there was criticism after No 10 delayed publication of the report until 5.30pm. Fox had hoped to make a personal statement to the Commons on Tuesday afternoon. Sir George Young, the Commons leader, will make a statement to MPs on Wednesday. Liam Fox said: &quot;I am pleased that the report makes clear that the two most serious allegations, namely of any financial gain sought, expected or received by myself and any breach of national security, have no basis. As I said in the House of Commons last week, I accept that it was a mistake to allow the distinctions between government and private roles to become blurred, and I must take my share of the responsibility for this. &quot;More care should have been taken to avoid the impression that anyone other than ministers and officials were speaking on behalf of the government, as this was not the case. Although there were no actual conflicts of interest I acknowledge that in order to avoid any possible perception of this, all private interests should have been fully declared to the permanent secretary. &quot;I welcome the recommendations in this report, which will provide greater clarity for ministers, officials and private individuals in the future.&quot; In a 10-page report, which explains why Fox resigned so abruptly on Friday, O&apos;Donnell found that the former defence secretary had: \u2022 Put officials at risk by disclosing details of future overseas visits to Werritty. &quot;The disclosure outside MoD of diary details about future visits overseas posed a degree of security risk not only to Dr Fox, but also to the accompanying official party. Dr Fox has accepted that such disclosures were not appropriate.&quot; \u2022 Ignored concerns from Ursula Brennan, his permanent secretary. &quot;The risks of Dr Fox&apos;s association with Mr Werritty were raised with Dr Fox by both his private office and the permanent secretary. Dr Fox took action in respect of business cards but clearly made a judgment that his contact with Mr Werritty should continue.&quot; \u2022 Wrongly allowed Werritty to attend a meeting in September last year with Matthew Gould, then the British ambassador designate to Israel. &quot;As a private citizen, however, with no official locus, it was not appropriate for Mr Werritty to have attended this meeting. Dr Fox has since acknowledged this. This highlights the blurring of lines between Dr Fox&apos;s private and official responsibilities which he has since acknowledged was not appropriate and not acceptable.&quot; \u2022 Mistakenly met Harvey Boulter in Dubai on 17 June with Werritty with no MoD officials present. &quot;Dr Fox has acknowledged that conducting this meeting without a private secretary present was unwise and inappropriate.&quot; \u2022 Allowed the appearance of a perception of a conflict of interest after arranging for Werritty to meet a donor to Pargav, the company that funded his trips. &quot;The links between Dr Fox and Mr Werritty means that the donations given to Mr Werritty could at least be seen as giving rise to the perception of a conflict of interest.&quot; \u2022 Failed to inform Brennan of his friendship with Werritty. &quot;He should have declared to his permanent secretary that Mr Werritty was a friend who had a company, Pargav, which was funded by a number of donors, some of whom had provided funding to Dr Fox when in opposition.&quot; \u2022 Fuelled a &quot;general impression&quot; that Werritty spoke on behalf of the British government through his &quot;close and visible association&quot; with his friend who used &quot;misleading business cards&quot;. Printed with the parliamentary Portcullis, these described him as an adviser to Fox. O&apos;Donnell, who said that Fox&apos;s former supporter Jon Moulton had contacted him, named the supporters of Pargav. They are: Oceana Investments, Jon Moulton, G3 Ltd, Tamares, IRG Ltd and Michael Davies. O&apos;Donnell concluded his report with a series of recommendations designed to prevent a repeat of the lax way in which Fox met Werritty and other business people overseas without officials. These will mean: \u2022 Ministers will have to inform their department if they discusss &quot;substantive issues&quot; with external organisations when no officials are present. \u2022 Departments should clarify who is, and who is not, a member of a ministerial visit overseas. \u2022 Officials should accompany ministers to all meetings overseas where official business is discussed. \u2022 Permanent secretaries should discuss with new ministers whether any acquaintances or advisers have contractual relationships with a department or whether they are involved in policy development,", "title": "Liam Fox put security at risk, Downing Street report finds", "sentences": ["This highlights the blurring of lines between Dr Fox&apos;s private and official responsibilities which he has since acknowledged was not appropriate and not acceptable.&quot; \u2022 Mistakenly met Harvey Boulter in Dubai on 17 June with Werritty with no MoD officials present."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-18T17:46:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/defence-and-security-blog/2011/oct/18/liam-fox-and-adam-werritty-and-report", "tags": ["Liam Fox", "David Cameron", "Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Lobbying"], "article": "Liam Fox has admitted many misjudgements over the last fortnight. But he got one decision just right - his resignation last Friday. The report by Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell, which can be found on the Cabinet Office website, leaves many questions unanswered and is frustratingly short of detail. But if David Cameron was presented with this and Fox was still in post, he would have to sack him. O&apos;Donnell makes clear that Fox gave access to Adam Werritty that he was not entitled to, held meetings with him without proper civil service supervision, and was warned about his conduct, yet continued to see his best friend regardless. Because Fox also introduced Werritty to a donor, the money given to his friend could give rise &quot;to the perception of a conflict of interest&quot; - yet another breach of the ministerial code. As O&apos;Donnell concludes in paragraph 21 and 22, Fox knew that he&apos;d made grave mistakes, and the implication is that he was right to resign.  Dr Fox has already accepted that his actions and judgement fell short of the standards of conduct required in the Ministerial Code and the evidence in this report supports the conclusion of a clear breach of the Ministerial Code. He should have declared to his Permanent Secretary that Mr Werritty was a friend who had a company, Pargav, which was funded by a number of donors, some of whom had provided funding to Dr Fox when in Opposition...   This was a failure of judgement on his part for which he has taken the ultimate responsibility in resigning office. Your foreword to the Ministerial Code makes clear that you expect Ministers to act in the national interest, above improper influence, and to serve to the highest standards of conduct. The Ministerial Code sets out very clearly the standards of behaviour required from Ministers.Dr Fox did not live up to these standards which he has since acknowledged.  O&apos;Donnell also makes clear that Fox was warned by both the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence, Ursula Brennan, and his private office, about the risks posed by his friendship with Werritty. And he did very little about it. Worse than that, O&apos;Donnell reports that for two sensitive meetings where civil servants should have been present - one in Dubai and one in Tel Aviv - Fox turned down advice to have someone from the MoD in the room. He says...  &quot;Private office attendance was offered for both the visits set out above and declined by Dr Fox.&quot;  The wonder is that Fox thought, until the end of last week, that he could tough this one out. By his own admission he had broken the ministerial code, and O&apos;Donnell&apos;s report was never going to disabuse him of this. In fact, O&apos;Donnell, cheekily perhaps, borrowed the phrase used by Fox in his apology last week, about him &quot;blurring of lines&quot; between his work and his friendship. O&apos;Donnell couldn&apos;t find any evidence that his behaviour had breached national security, or that he had benefited financially from his friendship with Werritty. Fox will cling on to that...but is hardly consolation.

The report says Fox did not benefit financially from the relationship. But it has not answered whether Werritty profited from Fox allowing foreign leaders and businessmen to assume that Werritty was his official adviser. 2: Why did payments by companies and individuals enable Werritty to fly first class and stay at some of the world&apos;s most exclusive hotels? And did they benefit from Werritty&apos;s closeness to Fox? The O&apos;Donnell report has named all of the donors to Werritty&apos;s Pargav Ltd company. We already knew about four: Jon Moulton, a Tory donor and private equity tycoon who bought Reader&apos;s Digest; Good Governance Group (G3), a private investigations company staffed by former MI6 officers; Tamares, an investment company owned by Tory donor Poju Zabludowicz; and Michael Lewis, the boss of Oceana Investors and a former chairman of Bicom, an organisation that lobbies on behalf of Israel. The report added two new funders Mick &quot;the miner&quot; Davis, the boss of Xstrata, the FTSE 100 mining company and chair of the trustees of the Jewish Leadership Council. The other funder was named as IRG ltd. 3: Did Fox solicit Tory donors and businessmen to pay money into Pargav to help support Werritty? Moulton has said Fox requested that he pay money to Pargav. Moulton paid \u00a335,000 to Pargav in February. Moulton says Fox asked him for the funds both verbally and via email. He is said to have forwarded the email to O&apos;Donnell. Did Fox also solicit funding from the other companies and individuals that funded Pargav? 4: Which other ministers met Werritty, and when? O&apos;Donnell confirmed that Werritty met defence ministers Gerald Howarth and Lord Astor. Labour has demanded the publication of a full list of all of Werritty&apos;s ministerial meetings. William Hague, foreign secretary, has said it is likely that Werritty has met some other ministers. &quot;I think you will find that contacts with other ministers apart from Fox with Mr Werritty would be very slight,&quot; he said on Sunday. Hague has said he has not met Werritty since becoming foreign secretary despite featuring on the advisory board of Fox and Werritty&apos;s Atlantic Bridge charity. Hague has spoken at Atlantic Bridge events, and the US arm of the charity has hosted a book signing for him in New York. The report says Gerald Howarth, parliamentary under secretary of state of international security strategy, &quot;met Mr Werritty twice at social events and one official meeting at the suggestion of Dr Fox&quot;. How Howarth and Astor introduced to Werritty, and were they aware that he was not an official adviser? 5: When did Fox first learn that Werritty was handing out business cards embossed with the Commons portcullis logo that described him as an &apos;adviser to Rt Hon Liam Fox MP&apos;? Did Fox tell him to stop using the cards, or just adapt the wording? 6: Has Werritty met senior civil servants? How often, and were they aware that he was not an official adviser? The MoD&apos;s list of meetings shows Fox and Werritty met with Ursula Brennan, the MoD&apos;s permanent secretary, on 13 June. This is just four days before Fox and Werritty&apos;s highly controversial meeting with Harvey Boulter in Dubai. Did Brennan question why Werritty sat in on that meeting? Was Brennan aware that Werritty was not one of her department&apos;s officials? If so why did she meet him? 7: Who has Werritty met while representing Fox? 8: Was the Atlantic Bridge charity, which was primarily funded by hedge-fund boss Michael Hintze and a powerful US rightwing business organisation, set up primarily to fund Werritty&apos;s trips to meet up with Fox overseas? The O&apos;Donnell&apos;s report did not examine the Atlantic Bridge, which was shut down last month following a Charity Commission investigation. Pargav was created just days before the commission ordered that the Atlantic Bridge cease all its operations. 9: Why was Fox with Werritty in Dubai for four days at taxpayers&apos; expense when he only carried out two official engagements?", "title": "Liam Fox report \u2013 the unanswered questions", "sentences": ["This is just four days before Fox and Werritty&apos;s highly controversial meeting with Harvey Boulter in Dubai.", "9: Why was Fox with Werritty in Dubai for four days at taxpayers&apos; expense when he only carried out two official engagements?"], "publicationDate": "2011-10-18T20:11:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/18/adam-werritty-pro-israel-funders", "tags": ["Adam Werritty", "UK news", "Liam Fox", "Politics", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Lobbying"], "article": "Update 25 October 2011 - International Resources Group (IRG), a Washington based company owned by L-3 Communications, have asked us to make clear that they have not funded Pargav and we accept this. On 25 October, our apology for this error was published in the Clarifications and Corrections Column. Three of the six donors who funded Adam Werritty&apos;s jetset lifestyle were prominent pro-Israel business figures. Gus O&apos;Donnell&apos;s report into the Liam Fox affair identified two previously unknown funders of Pargav, the company which paid more than \u00a3140,000 towards Werritty&apos;s first class flights and five star hotels. One of these was Mick &quot;the miner&quot; Davis, the boss of the FTSE 100-registered mining company Xstrata and a leading figure in the UK Jewish community. It has previously emerged that two of the donors to Pargav were financier Michael Lewis and the real estate tycoon Poju Zabludowicz, both linked to the British Israel Communications and Research Centre (Bicom), the UK&apos;s main pro-Israel lobby group. Davis, 52, is chairman of United Jewish Israel Appeal, a British charity which splits its contributions between charitable work in the UK and Israel. He collects one of the biggest pay cheques in the FTSE 100 and was paid \u00a321.2m last year. Davis, Lewis and Zabludowicz are all big donors to the Tory party. Davis gave \u00a3150,000 to Conservative party central office over the last 21 months according to Electoral Commission records. He also gave \u00a37,500 to the office of the education secretary Michael Gove in August. In June, Davis was among a delegation that included Zabludowicz, the chairman of Bicom, which met the foreign secretary William Hague to discuss the impact of the Arab spring on Israel. Last year Davis was at the centre of a fierce controversy within the UK Jewish community after he made highly critical remarks about the Israeli government. Lee Petar, a boss of Tetra Strategy, the lobbying firm that introduced a Dubai defence contractor to Werritty, was previously communications chief for Bicom. Another company called IRG was named by O&apos;Donell as a donor to Pargav. A Washington-based company that describes itself as an international professional services firm that helps governments, also called IRG, last night said that it was not the company involved. O&apos;Donnell reported that Werritty identified the other funders of Pargav as G3, an international investigation company run by former MI6 employees, and the private equity tycoon John Moulton, who owns Reader&apos;s Digest.

The damaging findings in a report by the cabinet secretary Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell will raise questions as to whether the Ministry of Defence informed either the intelligence services or Downing Street of their private concerns about Fox&apos;s serial misconduct.

A few hours after Fox used his resignation statement in the commons to attack the media for pursuing him with &quot;vindictiveness, even hatred&quot;, the parliamentary standards commissioner announced that he would investigate a complaint lodged by a Labour MP. John Mann wrote to John Lyon last week asking him to examine allegations that Fox allowed Werritty to live rent-free in his London flat which allowed him to run a business from a property funded by parliamentary allowances. A spokesman for Lyon said: &quot;The commissioner has received a complaint from John Mann and he has accepted it.&quot; The announcement came shortly after Fox criticised the media as he apologised to MPs for breaching the ministerial code over his friendship with Werritty. In a personal statement to MPs, Fox also hit out at a Dubai-based businessman whose confirmation of a meeting with Fox helped trigger the former defence secretary&apos;s downfall.           He said it was wrong of the press to report &quot;unquestioningly&quot; allegations by Harvey Boulter, who met him and Werritty in a Dubai hotel in June, when Boulter is involved in a blackmail case. &quot;Last week&apos;s media frenzy was not unprecedented, and it happens where a necessary free press and politics collide,&quot; Fox told MPs. &quot;But I believe there was, from some quarters, a personal vindictiveness, even hatred, that should worry all of us.&quot; The former defence secretary spoke to MPs shortly after Sir George Young, the leader of the Commons, announced that the government was accepting in full the recommendations of a report into him by the cabinet secretary, Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell. O&apos;Donnell called for tighter rules on ministerial contacts with outsiders after finding Fox guilty of multiple breaches of the ministerial code for a &quot;blurring of lines&quot; between his official and private responsibilities. Fox admitted the code had been breached, but was careful not to say directly that he had breached it. In a carefully-constructed sentence, he said: &quot;The ministerial code has been found to be breached. For this I am sorry. &quot;I accept it is not only the substance but [also] perception that matters. That is why I chose to resign. I accept the consequences for me without bitterness or rancour. I do not blame anyone else, and I believe that you do not turn your back on your friends or family in times of trouble.&quot; Fox then turned on the media for hounding his family and accepting Boulter&apos;s claims without question. He said: &quot;It is unacceptable that family and friends who have nothing to do with the central issues should be hounded and intimidated by elements of the media including, in this case, elderly relatives and children.&quot; He added: &quot;It is difficult to operate in the modern environment, as we know, where every bit of information, however irrelevant or immaterial, is sensationalised, and where opinions or even accusations are treated as fact. &quot;It was particularly concerning that Harvey Boulter, present at the Dubai meeting and subsequently the defendant in a blackmail case, was treated so unquestioningly.&quot; Boulter met Fox and Werritty for 45 minutes in the Horizon Club business lounge, on the 41st storey of Dubai&apos;s five-star Shangri-La Hotel, on 17 June. After the meeting, Boulter emailed a lawyer from 3M, a firm with which he had been involved in a business dispute, to warn of a &quot;rather embarrassing situation&quot; over the recent knighthood for the 3M head, George Buckley. Boulter said the knighthood was not discussed at the Fox meeting, though he had discussed it with Werritty. Fox admitted that it was wrong of him to have attended the meeting with Boulter without an official present. He also accepted O&apos;Donnell&apos;s criticism that he had failed to heed warnings from Ursula Brennan, the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence, about his links with Werritty. He said: &quot;With hindsight, I should have been more willing to listen to concerns of those around me.&quot; His voice came close to breaking as he paid tribute to his wife, Jesme, who listened to him from the front row of the Commons public gallery. &quot;I would like to thank my family and friends for their love and support,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not easy to watch someone you care about being attacked in a very aggressive and prolonged way. We choose this life. They do not. Above all, I would like to thank my wife Jesme, who has dealt with this whole business with her usual grace, dignity and unstinting support.&quot; Boulter rejected Fox&apos;s criticism. He said: &quot;It is most certainly not fair or correct for Fox to again brand me as a blackmailer. He knows very well that I was trying to settle a legal dispute between 3M and Porton/Ploughshare (part of his former ministry) \u2026 How is that possibly blackmail \u2013 this is a negotiation. &quot;The fact Fox is continuing to pursue me I think makes him look more than a little silly. &quot;If Fox had not issued an incorrect statement in the first place, which the Guardian forced him to correct publicly, then he would not have exposed his adviser to scrutiny.&quot; A series of Tory MPs lined up to congratulate Fox after his statement. Desmond Swayne, the prime minister&apos;s parliamentary private secretary, who is a member of the Territorial Army, hugged him. Earlier, David Cameron accused the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, of jumping on a bandwagon when he questioned his handling of the Fox allegations. &quot;If you are going to jump on a bandwagon, make sure it&apos;s still moving,&quot; the prime minister said. &quot;The minister in question has resigned. You are just a bit late.&quot; Miliband said: &quot;This week of all weeks, show a bit of humility, eh? \u2026 He doesn&apos;t ask the tough questions of those around him and, when anything goes wrong, it&apos;s nothing to do with him.&quot;", "title": "Liam Fox faces investigation by parliamentary standards watchdog", "sentences": ["In a personal statement to MPs, Fox also hit out at a Dubai-based businessman whose confirmation of a meeting with Fox helped trigger the former defence secretary&apos;s downfall.", "He said it was wrong of the press to report &quot;unquestioningly&quot; allegations by Harvey Boulter, who met him and Werritty in a Dubai hotel in June, when Boulter is involved in a blackmail case.", "&quot;It was particularly concerning that Harvey Boulter, present at the Dubai meeting and subsequently the defendant in a blackmail case, was treated so unquestioningly.&quot; Boulter met Fox and Werritty for 45 minutes in the Horizon Club business lounge, on the 41st storey of Dubai&apos;s five-star Shangri-La Hotel, on 17 June."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-19T16:08:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/19/link-liam-fox-donors-tory", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Adam Werritty", "Party funding", "Conservatives", "Liam Fox", "Politics", "UK news", "Lobbying"], "article": "The Liam Fox affair has reached the Conservative party&apos;s high command for the first time after it was confirmed that its leading fundraiser introduced donors to the former defence secretary, who then introduced them to his best man, Adam\u00a0Werritty. In a blow to Downing Street&apos;s central tactic of distancing itself from Fox \u2013 saying that he was operating in his own way \u2013 the Conservative party admitted that its senior treasurer was the conduit for donors to the former defence secretary. Howard Leigh passed on the details of donors who wished to support Fox&apos;s campaign during the 2005 Tory leadership contest. They were later persuaded by Fox to give money to organisations that supported Werritty, according to a source, and some of the money was spent visiting Fox on lavish trips abroad. Leigh was one of party&apos;s treasurers at the time. The disclosure is an embarrassment for the Tories and will pose further difficult questions for Fox, who has been told that he faces a parliamentary inquiry into his behaviour and Werritty. In his resignation statement in the Commons, Fox attacked the media for pursuing him. &quot;Last week&apos;s media frenzy was not unprecedented, and it happens where a necessary free press and politics collide,&quot; Fox said. &quot;But I believe there was, from some quarters, a personal vindictiveness, even hatred, that should worry all of us.&quot; A Conservative spokesman confirmed Leigh&apos;s role in helping to introduce Fox to the donors whose recent support was used by Werritty to fly around the world to meet the former defence secretary. The spokesman told the Guardian: &quot;Howard Leigh introduced donors to Liam Fox&apos;s office during the 2005 leadership campaign. Some of them subsequently maintained contact with Dr Fox&apos;s office. Mr Leigh had no knowledge of Pargav and has not introduced donors to Dr Fox for some time.&quot; A source close to Leigh said: &quot;Howard Leigh was as shocked as anybody to find that donors&apos; funds were being used to fund Adam Werritty&apos;s trips. There is no way that he would have countenanced that.&quot; Leigh is now the senior treasurer of the party. He is understood to have met Werritty on a number of occasions, but does not regard him as a friend. A party source says the donors approached Leigh asking to donate money to Fox&apos;s campaign, not that they were solicited by Leigh. The Tory spokesman declined to say which donors had been introduced to Fox by Leigh, and did not expand on whether they knew of how their money had been spent by Werritty. Backers of Pargav include Mick Davis, a South African-born mining magnate known for his pro-Israel views; Tamares real estate, an investment company owned by Poju Zabludowicz, the chief funder of Israeli pressure group Bicom; and Michael Lewis, a former vice-president of Bicom, who donated \u00a313,832 to Atlantic Bridge and \u00a35,000 to Fox. Davis, Zabludowicz and Lewis would not comment on Wednesday on how their donations had been solicited or what they believed the money was to be used for. However, Lewis has stated he had no knowledge of how his donations to Fox&apos;s leadership campaign were used. A source with knowledge of some of the donations said some initial contributions were made to Fox&apos;s charity, Atlantic Bridge, and renewed in subsequent years without close scrutiny of where the money was going. He said some of the donors were also under the impression that the approaches had been approved by the Conservative party. &quot;I don&apos;t think it was core Tory party fundraising but there were core Tory party fundraisers who were willing to support it.&quot; Another source said there had been no co-ordination between the Jewish donors to fund Werritty, though some had initially felt well-disposed to help Fox because of his pro-Israel position. Both Davis and Leigh serve on the Jewish Leadership Council, a body with representatives from community and religious groups. Davis has been chairman of the council&apos;s executive committee since 2009. Leigh chairs the elite Leaders&apos; Group, which has more than 70 members who pay up to \u00a350,000 a year for the privilege of meetings with David Cameron. Tory insiders say he has helped to bring in more than \u00a32m a year through fundraising events, according to reports. He is the managing director of Cavendish Corporate Finance, which helped Cameron&apos;s wife, Samantha, collect a windfall following the \u00a318m sale of Smythson, the stationery and leather goods emporium company where she is creative dire ctor. Leigh passed the donors over to Fox in 2005. At the time, Fox was the leading candidate of the party&apos;s right in the leadership campaign against Cameron and David Davis. Tory sources claim Fox then maintained contact with the donors and was responsible for passing them to Werritty, who then funnelled \u00a3150,000 to Pargav. The parliamentary standards commissioner, John Lyon, announced that he would investigate a complaint about the former defence secretary lodged by Labour MP John Mann, after Mann asked him to examine allegations that Fox allowed Werritty to live rent-free in his London flat, which allowed him to run a business from a property funded by parliamentary allowances.

Four months after the players were introduced to the game in barefoot try-outs, Afghanistan&apos;s national squad challenged some of the best military teams around, including this year&apos;s British army champions and members of New Zealand&apos;s SAS unit in charge of quelling terrorist attacks in the capital.

Tries were accompanied by whoops and cartwheels from the players, who for the first time were wearing their new national kit, which had been flown in from Dubai in the morning.

Although Afghanistan&apos;s national sport of buzkashi, or &quot;goat grabbing&quot;, is often described as &quot;rugby on horseback&quot; there is no tradition of the sport in the country. But it has enjoyed remarkable take off this year with young men flocking to daily 5.30am training sessions in Kabul&apos;s national sports stadium. There are now about 50 players in Kabul drawn from all the country&apos;s ethnic groups, and a smaller group in the western city of Herat. Supporters of the fledgling Afghan side hope rugby will eventually rival cricket as a popular sport with a strong national team. Mustafa Sadat, a towering 24-year-old, said he had no doubt that rugby would soon eclipse cricket. &quot;One day, inshallah (God willing), we will play in the World Cup,&quot; he said. The 21 Signals won this year&apos;s Army Community Cup Championship. Yesterday&apos;s team comprised soldiers from the UK&apos;s base in Kabul and a group from Helmand who had been flown in for the m atch.

The powder is amazing, the apr\u00e8s-ski is wild, and slopeside restaurants serve caviar, smoked salmon and vodka rather than gl\u00fchwein and fondue. Seven nights B&amp;B costs \u00a31,129pp, including flights via Istanbul.     Chalet Auriane in La Tzoumaz     \u2022 Nendaz near Verbier has really developed over the past few years as an alternative base for skiing this linked area of the Swiss Alps. Now La Tzoumaz, in a valley on the other side of the mega-resort, is attempting to become the new Nendaz. As well as a 10km toboggan run and a cute town centre, it has a fabulous new place to stay, Chalet Auriane (chaletauriane.com). It sleeps 12 and is available in January and March from \u00a3825pp including all food and wine. It has a sauna and steam room, faux fur throws and even a chrome cuckoo clock. \u2022 Oh dear, please don&apos;t let this be true: Club Koh Samui (clubkohsamui.com), an indoor ski slope on the Thai island of Koh Samui, is in its first stages, part of a $40m investment in a new sports centre there. And you thought skiing in the desert in Dubai was weird. Keep it cheap \u2022 Some tips \u2026 With the euro sending the prices in the premier Alpine resorts sky-high, those looking to save a few quid might want to hit Italy and Austria where prices are slightly cheaper than France and Switzerland. Those heading to the Alps proper, where drinks can cost \u20ac10 on the mountain and a bowl of spag bol twice that, should try to get a package with as much as possible included \u2013 lift-pass, evening meal, even lunch \u2013 so you&apos;re paying in pounds rather than euros. If you&apos;re a beginner, you may as well start out in a really cheap resort outside the eurozone, which perhaps won&apos;t satisfy you later on when you&apos;re looking for steeper terrain and decent off-piste. \u2022 Early season skiing \u2013 is it worth it? You might think that going before Christmas week is way too early to find good snow, but last winter the second weekend in December had amazing dumps (though granted it was so amazing that many UK airports had to close) even in places not traditionally considered reliable as high-altitude glacier resorts (Tignes/Saas-Fee, etc). The slopes are much emptier than later in the season, flights and packages much cheaper and an early season break will get your legs ready for a bigger trip later on \u2013 hopefully by the time February rolls around you&apos;ll have saved up enough cash to go again. Expedia.co.uk has some early season deals, including a week in Chamonix at the catered Chalet Hotel Sapini\u00e8re chalet from \u00a3569pp including Stansted-Geneva flights, departing 8 December (expedia.co.uk). A week in St Anton for the same dates costs from \u00a3529pp at the Chalet Arlof including Stansted-Innsbruck flights; or in Courchevel is \u00a3499pp at the Chalet Triole, flights Stansted to Chambery. \u2022 Think you can&apos;t afford to ski the big resorts? Think again \u2013 Action Outdoors (020-3328 5443, action-outdoors.co.uk) offers bargain breaks for young people aged 18-39 in 11 resorts in France, with accommodation in UCPA hostels. These were set up by the French more than 40 years ago as a government-subsidised scheme to get more young people on outdoor sports holidays. The buildings (all very centrally located) operate as budget accommodation, and with special bargain lift-pass rates for UCPA guests. A break in Tignes, for example, costs \u00a3599 all inclusive from 30 December\u20137 January, add in 12 hours&apos; instruction for \u00a318, or under \u00a3500 for a mid-December break in Val d&apos;Is\u00e8re, both including full board and lift pass. \u2022 For a list of ski hostels all over the world, check out Hostelworld.com, which includes the Randolins hostel in St Moritz for \u00a335 a night (tinyurl.com/randolins), or the Hostel Ks House Hakuba Alps in Japan from \u00a323.90 a night (tinyurl.com/hostelks). \u2022 The Snow Express coach (snowexpress.co.uk) goes from Victoria in London to Tignes and Val d&apos;Is\u00e8re, from \u00a399 return, and takes 17 hours. \u2022 Directski.com and Igluski.com are good places to start looking for deals.     Chefs in Alta Badia    Activities \u2022 France&apos;s Haute Maurienne Vanoise (hautemaurienne.com) has gone all out for crazy new sports this winter. Cani Raquette involves snowshoers wearing big raquettes on their feet and being pulled along by a harness with a linking rein attached to some dogs (+33 4 7905 9243, \u20ac12pp). You can also do normal husky sledding. In a similar vein, &quot;free ride&quot; snowshoeing is trying to do for snow-shoeing what parkour did for walking \u2013 instructors can be booked to show participants how to slide, jump, roll, run and &quot;express their style&quot; on snowshoes (+33 6 7897 4673, half-day adults \u20ac15, children \u20ac12). \u2022 The Alta Badia region of Italy has been gaining fame for its great food and Michelin-starred restaurants. Taste For Skiing involves 11 mountain huts serving Michelin-starred food designed by top chefs, from \u20ac12-25 per dish. This year Brit chef Hywel Jones joins in and has worked with the Arlara hut in Corvara to bring suckling pig to the menu. Also on offer in what is becoming one of the world&apos;s best ski resorts for gourmets, is a wine and ski safari on 18 March (\u20ac20pp to visit four huts for wine and snacks), cookery courses and a Dolomighty Breakfast trip on a snow cat, leaving Corvara at 6.50am or 7.20am to enjoy a Tyrolean breakfast at sunrise at the Col Alto refuge at 2,000m \u2013 you then ski down before the lifts open (+39 0471 836 324, tinyurl.com/dolomighty, \u20ac28pp).

International development spending continues not to go to those who need it the most. But an experiment in Afghanistan is showing that aid money spent locally is a highly effective way to create jobs. As the Guardian has reported, tied aid remains a stubbornly persistent component of international assistance. According to the European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad), a network of 54 NGOs from 19 countries, at least 20% of all bilateral aid remains formally tied. But that number masks the larger amount of aid that is informally tied. Even when development agencies are free to spend their money wherever they want, they rarely spend it in the country that is being assisted. It is not spent in Liberia or Timor-Leste, but rather in international logistics hubs like Brindisi and Singapore. In Afghanistan, donors have disbursed more than $36bn in aid over the last 10 years. But recent economic research, conducted by the Peace Dividend Trust on behalf of the British government, revealed that even when the aid was technically untied, only 37% of it entered the local economy. Most of the aid spending went elsewhere: to fly in foreign experts, or provide bottled water and building materials. The money might have been spent on Afghanistan, but it was not spent in Afghanistan. Not surprisingly, the development technocrats and mandarins, whose salaries are paid out of these international aid budgets, have accepted this as merely a curious paradox of aid. Namely, those who give the money tend to benefit from it more than those whom it is supposed to help. However, untied aid is now starting to reach the ground because of a new &quot;Afghan First&quot; policy implemented by donors in Kabul. They believe that Afghans who are in work are less likely to join the Taliban, and have decreed that aid procurement should use local labour and local goods to rebuild Afghanistan, whenever possible. The idea heralds a conscious effort by the international community to &quot;spend the development dollar twice&quot;. By channelling aid money through Afghan entrepreneurs, donors can double their impact: if $1m is spent on building a school, an additional $1m in profits and taxes can be left behind by using a local construction company. Most important, though, this approach moves jobs from Dubai to Kabul and Kandahar. A job can be transformative, especially during a war. A single salary will feed a family, send a girl to school, and provide a mother with medical care. It will generate taxes, pay police wages, and build hope. The World Bank estimates the unemployment rate in Afghanistan is 8%, but this does not account for the high levels of underemployment. For the most part, jobs in Afghanistan are seasonal, sporadic and unskilled. Creating jobs is difficult, and expensive. For example, the $3bn Aynak Valley copper mine (the biggest foreign investment in the country&apos;s history) is only expected to directly employ 4,500 Afghans. It will be a small drop in the sea of underemployed. By contrast, the &quot;Afghan First&quot; approach to truly untie aid has supported far more jobs with far less money. In a job creation survey conducted by Peace Dividend Trust, $441m in aid contracts, ranging in size from $1,000 to $5m, created or sustained more than 118,000 new jobs. Untied aid spending, using local entrepreneurs, created jobs at a rate 170 greater than the money invested in the copper mine. The jobs being created through donor procurement are the jobs that Afghans want and that Afghanistan needs. These are skilled jobs in a wide range of sectors, including manufacturing, solar panels, bottled water, fruit exporting, logistics and construction. At the same time, since a business must be registered before it can bid on an international tender, these contracts are generating millions in badly needed local taxes. Donor contracts typically lead to businesses expanding their employee base by more than 300%, the majority of those jobs being skilled. For a typical aid contract spent locally, one month of employment is created or sustained for every $600 spent. Furthermore, the majority of businesses invest profits in both physical capital and training staff. The concept of genuinely untying aid \u2013 to allow it to be spent locally and to create jobs \u2013 has spread to other development missions, most notably to Port au Prince. There, local officials are now talking about a &quot;Haiti First&quot; policy, and are pressuring aid agencies to spend their money in Haiti, not just on Haiti. The impact can be seen on the ground already, as local entrepreneurs are allowed to compete for international contracts, to create employment, to pay taxes, and to build a peaceful future. \u2022 Scott Gilmore is the founder and CEO of Peace Dividend Trust, a social enterprise that champions entrepreneurs and builds markets in post-conflict economies ", "title": "Afghanistan: proof that untied aid really works", "sentences": ["Most important, though, this approach moves jobs from Dubai to Kabul and Kandahar."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-24T08:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2011/oct/24/qatar-buying-fashion", "tags": ["Fashion", "Qatar"], "article": "Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon &apos;em. In the case of the tiny, oil-rich Gulf country of Qatar, some are acquiring greatness at breakneck speed.  Last year Qatar was named as the 2022 World Cup host and its sovereign wealth fund, Qatar Holdings, bought Harrods. This year, Qatar said it wants to host the 2017 World Athletic Championships. It has become the biggest buyer of contemporary art in the world. A few weeks ago, a Qatari sheikh was unveiled as the principal backer of a \u00a33m racing event at Royal Ascot. The state&apos;s ambitions tower over London&apos;s skyline in the form of the Shard, in which Qatari investors have a majority stake. Astonishing to think this former pearl-fishing centre used to be one of the poorest states in the region. Unsurprisingly, it doesn&apos;t end there. The country&apos;s lifestyle vehicle, the Qatar Luxury Group is expanding into fashion, hospitality and development. Think of it as an Arab LVMH. On steroids. QLG will host Qatar Fashion Week in 2012, when it will launch a new fashion brand that has been designed by St\u00e9phane Rolland. These developments make perfect sense when you consider that, as reported in a recent article by Reuters, women in the Gulf region are the world&apos;s biggest buyers of high fashion. QLG is the brainchild of Sheikha Mozah, who has caused something of a stir with her style. During a state visit to the UK last year, Sheikha Mozah&apos;s propensity for wearing haute couture- including these heels-made-of-ice Chanel boots- attracted plaudits from fashion commentators and the designer Julien MacDonald compared her look to that of Jackie O. QLG declined to be interviewed about its activities, saying it was &quot;working on the development of our fashion brand which is to be launched in 2012&quot; and that to &quot;speak of a brand six months before launch sounds premature&quot;. It has been more open about its acquisition of the French leather goods company, Le Tanneur, though. Its CEO, Gregory Couillard, said the company &quot;was targeted as part of QLG&apos;s strategy to create timeless luxury goods made to the highest quality standards&quot; and that the group is &quot;committed to the luxury fashion sector in the larger sense&quot;, with leatherwork, shoemaking, jewellery and couture workshops especially set up in Doha.     Qatar's emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani has a long-term vision for Qatar's future Photograph: Karim Jaafar/AFP/Getty Images    So what are we to make of the spending spree? The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, has a long-term plan, called Qatar Vision 2030, for how he wants the state to be seen and recognised internationally. &quot;It&apos;s all about legacy,&quot; says Graham Hales, CEO of Interbrand London. &quot;It seems to be sincere.&quot; Hales says that while the trail of acquisition is &quot;hard to penetrate&quot; it is also &quot;brave and audacious&quot;.  But signs that Qatar was a juggernaut of ambition, chutzpah and wealth surfaced in 2008, when it coaxed &quot;starchitect&quot; IM Pei out of retirement to design the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha.  &quot;The Qataris can learn lessons from Dubai, but to the naked eye it seems similar,&quot; says Hales. &quot;They get involved in landmarks. If they can get involved in something first they will, and the type of brands they&apos;re buying are iconic.&quot; Hales doesn&apos;t know where all the purchasing and construction will lead but says the next decade will be &quot;very exciting&quot;. &quot;We&apos;re in the middle of a paragraph rather than the end of it,&quot; he adds. In 2008, arts writer Georgina Adam told the Guardian that Gulf states were beginning to see culture as a missing part of the puzzle. &quot;They have the ritzy airports, big towers and financial institutions, but they want to get culture and they&apos;re very competitive. Qatar wants to distinguish itself from Dubai, which is seen as brash.&quot; John Martin, director of Art Dubai, said: &quot;Doha and Dubai represent a new type of city and culture, they don&apos;t have the cultural baggage. Nobody has written any rules and anything can happen.&quot;", "title": "Qatar's bid for global promience hits the fashion world", "sentences": ["&quot;The Qataris can learn lessons from Dubai, but to the naked eye it seems similar,&quot; says Hales.", "Qatar wants to distinguish itself from Dubai, which is seen as brash.&quot; John Martin, director of Art Dubai, said: &quot;Doha and Dubai represent a new type of city and culture, they don&apos;t have the cultural baggage."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-24T13:11:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/oct/24/luke-donald-tops-pga-money-list", "tags": ["Luke Donald", "PGA Tour", "European Tour", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Luke Donald is regarded by some as steady rather than enthralling but his closing round in Florida belied the theory that the Englishman cannot produce box-office golf. The 33-year-old&apos;s successful consistency, sought by every player, is demeaned by those who would rather he endorsed his talent with major championship wins. But his fourth victory of the season, in the Children&apos;s Miracle Network Hospitals Classic, handed him the not insignificant title of the PGA Tour&apos;s leading money winner. It was hardly done in straightforward fashion; a closing-round 64 included six birdies in succession. Even his sternest critics surely cannot question his winning mentality now. &quot;I read the media as well,&quot; Donald said. &quot;It was pretty clear to me that from what everyone thought, I needed to win this week to be able to sway some people&apos;s votes. I think as golfers it&apos;s nice to win, but much more pleasing when things really mean something a little bit extra. &quot;It&apos;s just knowing that I had to do it and being able to do it, and all of it kind of went along with picking up the first place. It&apos;s very, very special. I answered a lot of critics&apos; questions coming here knowing I had to win, and doing it.&quot; The votes to which Donald referred are for the PGA Tour&apos;s end of season awards. Yet he was also aware of American scepticism towards his record, which until Sunday showed no stroke play tournament victory in the US since 2006. In this season alone, Donald made 16 cuts from 19 events in the US. On 14 of those occasions, he finished inside the top 10. Total earnings of $6.68m (\u00a34.18m) edged Webb Simpson into second place in the final PGA cash list. Before the Classic, Donald trailed Simpson by $363,000. Donald now stands on the brink of making history. If \u2013 as is likely \u2013 he maintains his position at the top of the European Tour&apos;s money list, he will become the first player to top those charts in both continents in the same season. Donald&apos;s earnings of \u00a33.34m are \u00a31.14m clear of Rory McIlroy. It almost seemed typical that news of the Northern Irishman&apos;s change in management company overshadowed Donald&apos;s bid to finish in the top two in Florida, as was necessary to clinch his money list position. As matters in Europe come to a head, Donald&apos;s schedule depends to a large extent on the timing of his wife, Diane, going into labour. The couple&apos;s second child is due within the next fortnight, while eight events remain on the European Tour&apos;s Race to Dubai. &quot;I think it&apos;s exciting to be able to do something that nobody has done officially, and that&apos;s win both money lists,&quot; Donald says. &quot;I&apos;ve had a few players coming up to me and wishing me luck. &quot;I&apos;ve met most of my expectations, and exceeded them probably. Getting to No1 [in the world] and holding on to it and extending my lead and winning four times now, obviously that&apos;s a pretty good year. &quot;I didn&apos;t expect to play quite that well. But as a player, you always feel that you can do more than you actually are doing. I always believed that I had the ability to have a year like this. &quot;There were times where I didn&apos;t have my best golf but I still contended, and that excites me for next year. If I can just sharpen up a little bit here and there, obviously more of those being in contentions will turn into wins. The only disappointing part of the year I suppose is not winning a major.

Darren Lockyer and Tim Sheens, their outstanding captain and distinguished coach, were as polite and professional as ever, but there seemed a steelier edge to them than on some recent tours. &quot;We still have the Four Nations final from 2010 on our minds,&quot; said Sheens, referring to New Zealand&apos;s shock 16-12 win at Brisbane&apos;s Suncorp Stadium. That means the Kiwis hold international league&apos;s two major honours, having ended Australia&apos;s domination of the World Cup in Brisbane two years earlier, and two convincing victories over New Zealand already this season will mean nothing to the Kangaroos unless Lockyer lifts the trophy in Leeds on 19 November. That should add a real edge to Friday&apos;s first game of the series, as the trans-Tasman rivalry is transported to Cheshire. Warrington&apos;s intimate Halliwell Jones Stadium will provide a rare chance for British rugby fans of either code to get up close and personal to such greats of the southern hemisphere as Lockyer and the Kiwi captain, Benji Marshall, and the physical collisions between such players as Keith Galloway and Fui Fui Moi Moi will not be for the fainthearted. New Zealand also have a point to prove, having flopped on their past two trips to the northern hemisphere, failing to reach the final of the Four Nations in 2009 and enduring a 3-0 whitewash by Great Britain two years before that. Fears about a lack of experience in key positions seemed to be reinforced by the heavy defeat they suffered against Australia in Newcastle two weeks ago, but they can only be strengthened by the introduction of Kevin Locke at full-back and Kieran Foran at stand-off, and unsung mainstays of previous successes such as Simon Mannering and Jeremy Smith are all around to lay a platform for the brilliant Marshall \u2013 complete with his new beard. However one glaring weakness in the Kiwis&apos; ability to adjust to English conditions emerged at Elland Road. It took Marshall, his coach, Stephen Kearney, and the long-serving media man Richard Becht five attempts to manoeuvre their four-wheel drive out of the car park, as the Rugby Football League&apos;s chairman Richard Lewis looked on with growing amusement. They may remember that if they return for the final three weeks on Saturday \u2013 provided they survived the return trip to their Liverpool base along the M62. 2) Chase the ace? Stick or twist? So what are England&apos;s chances of beating either Australia at Wembley on Saturday week, or the Kiwis in Hull seven days later, which they will have to do to have any chance of preventing a repeat of last year&apos;s final? Logically you&apos;d say less than 50%, mainly because of the quality of the opposition and the stuttering warm-up win against France in Avignon last Friday didn&apos;t provide any reliable evidence to change those odds. As some have already been discussing since the weekend, there were some good bits \u2013 the first two minutes, the last 10 in the first half, and a couple more cracking tries after the break. But the majority of the performance was unconvincing and arguably left the coach, Steve McNamara, with more questions than answers, particularly surrounding the crucial half-back positions. Rangi Chase, the Maori who has been converted in Castleford, did some brilliant things, and his combination with Sam Tomkins offered particular promise. But then Chase clocked off horribly in the last quarter, making the man of the match award that had been determined after 60 minutes pretty embarrassing \u2013 not least to Chase himself \u2013 when it was announced shortly before the final hooter. McNamara&apos;s other new recruits, Jack Reed and Chris Heighington, had less fluctuating, more solid debuts. But their presence in the England setup, alongside Gareth Ellis and Gareth Widdop \u2013 two Yorkshiremen who have excelled in the National Rugby League this season \u2013 does seem to have secured greater respect from both Australia and New Zealand. England have the perfect chance to hone their combinations before Wembley as they face Wales in their first Four Nations game at Leigh on Saturday. It will be fascinating to see whether McNamara makes any changes. 3) A cheer in Provence It is equally intriguing to speculate on the likely result should the Wales team sent out by Iestyn Harris on Saturday face the France side coached by his former Great Britain half-back partner Bobbie Goulding that pushed England so hard in Avignon. It was Wales&apos;s unexpected, and by all accounts thoroughly deserved, victory in Albi in last autumn&apos;s European Cup that earned this debut in the Four Nations at the expense of a France team who have been underachieving at international level for years. The home team&apos;s performance in Provence merely confirmed that, but at least it gives Goulding the chance to go out on a high, assuming he and the French federation choose to move on at the end of his three-year contract after games against Scotland and Ireland in the next two weeks. The progress made by the Catalan Dragons over the past 12 months since the arrival of Trent Robinson has offered huge encouragement to the French ahead of the 2013 World Cup, in which they have been drawn in an attractive group with New Zealand, Samoa and Papua New Guinea \u2013 and will surely now play at least one match in Avignon, after the success of Friday&apos;s fixture. 4) From the streets of Philadelphia \u2026 Now that the kick and clap has finished in New Zealand \u2013 only joking, union folk, from this distance it&apos;s been a hugely impressive event, just a shame about the rugby \u2013 it&apos;s quite exciting to think that the next rugby World Cup will be the league version in 2013. The prospect seems even more real, and appealing, following confirmation that the United States have qualified for the first time, with Italy shaping as favourites to join them as debutants if they beat Lebanon in Belgrade next weekend. Both offer huge opportunities for the game, effectively articulated by the Americans&apos; former Bradford Bulls coach Matthew Elliott in a preview of their last qualifier against Jamaica in the Philadelphia Inquirer. But there is not much time to capitalise before 2013. It is a major challenge for the International Federation, and the clubs of the Super League and especially the NRL. Do they have the vision and ambition to respond to a unique opportunity? 5) Vegas, Dubai \u2013 or Headingley? The evidence of the World Club Challenge would suggest probably not. Every year there are suggestions that the game may be played in Australia. Russell Crowe also came up with an imaginative scheme to stage a World Club Championship in Las Vegas. Now Manly, having been either unable or unwilling to follow through on initial suggestions that the Super League champions (Leeds) may finally be invited to Australia, have revived the idea of using Dubai as a lucrative halfway house. But still, nothing has actually been done, meaning that the game now looks likely to be played at Headingley, which should be a cracking occasion but is a damning indictment of limited ambition. 6) Saints in good shape That is in stark contrast to the good folk of St Helens, who don&apos;t like blowing their own trumpet but have an impressive record of getting on with the job. They have again sent their best young players on a tour of Australia and maintained their 100% record with an impressive win against Cronulla last week, with the former stand-off Tommy Martyn clearly refusing to allow his new role as a coach to cramp his style off the field. Thatto Heath, one of the town&apos;s strongest amateur clubs, will also be flying the flag overseas this weekend as they represent the National Conference League against the cream of France&apos;s amateurs in a curtain-raiser before the France-Scotland international in Perpignan. Meanwhile the first team will move into their new stadium at the start of next season in an enviable financial position thanks to the long-serving chairman, Eamonn McManus, and Mike Coleman, a more recent addition to the board and another local boy made good in south-east Asia, in his case running hedge funds in Singapore whereas McManus was based in Hong Kong as the head of corporate finance for HSBC. Perhaps St Helens may be one of the few northern towns with a not wholly negative view of bankers.

Labour called on the prime minister to address &quot;extremely serious&quot; allegations that ministers may have been seeking to profit from their relationship with Werritty, Fox&apos;s best friend and former flatmate who has now been linked to three defence ministers. Stephen Crouch, a defence industry lobbyist, said he paid Werritty a flat fee in the hope that Werritty, who posed as Fox&apos;s official adviser, would set up high-powered meetings for him. Fox arranged for Crouch to meet Gerald Howarth, the arms sales minister, and Werritty at the Commons. No civil servants were present at the meeting \u2013 an apparent breach of the ministerial code. John Mann, the Labour MP who first raised questions about Werritty&apos;s role at the heart of government, has demanded an investigation into Howarth&apos;s apparent breach of ministerial rules. No record of the 27 September meeting was kept, but the MoD said the three men talked about &quot;the economic and political landscape in Iraq&quot;. Crouch, who secretly donated \u00a320,000 to support Werritty, runs an organisation called the Iraq Research Group and has extensive business interests in Iraq and Kurdistan. IRG Ltd has been identified as one of six organisations that paid money into Pargav Ltd, a company set up as a &quot;slush fund&quot; to pay for Werritty&apos;s first-class flights to meet up with Fox at exotic locations across the globe. Police will widen a preliminary investigation into allegations that Werritty acted fraudulently by handing out business cards that described him as an &quot;adviser to the Rt Hon Dr Liam Fox MP&quot;. Detectives from City of London police&apos;s economic crime unit will interview Harvey Boulter, the Dubai-based businessman who first raised concerns that Werritty was passing himself off as an official government adviser. The police have already interviewed Mann and another unnamed person. Fox resigned as defence secretary earlier this month after a stream of revelations about his improper business relationship with Werritty. The police&apos;s decision to question Boulter may cause some consternation among Fox&apos;s supporters. In Fox&apos;s resignation speech, he singled out Boulter, the businessman whom he and Werritty met in a Dubai hotel to discuss a military product without any civil servants present. Fox criticised the &quot;unquestioning&quot; coverage of Boulter&apos;s revelations, pointing out that he is the defendant in a blackmail trial. The MP for North Somerset was later found to have breached the ministerial code, following an investigation by Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell, the cabinet secretary. Boulter told the Guardian he was flying into London at the request of detectives. &quot;I was asked if I could make myself available and I presume it is because they will want to know how Werritty claimed to be a representative of Fox and how he may have been making money through this,&quot; he said. Kevan Jones, shadow defence minister, said revelations over Howarth&apos;s meeting with Crouch showed the PM had allowed wrongdoing to take place on his watch. &quot;The prime minister has for weeks said all questions would be answered but instead we have only had new allegations,&quot; Jones said. &quot;It appears another defence minister may have broken the ministerial code and has links to Adam Werritty. We need a full explanation as to how this meeting was arranged and why no civil servants were present. If it was discovered that anyone was profiting from these connections this would be extremely serious.&quot; Separately, Mann has written to Sir Philip Mawer, the independent adviser on ministerial interests, demanding he launch an investigation into Howarth&apos;s meeting with Crouch and Werritty, to establish whether there has been a breach of the ministerial code. &quot;Your investigation should also seek to confirm once and for all that no other breaches have occurred in relation to the activities of Adam Werritty or other unofficial advisers within government.&quot; An MoD spokesman said Howarth &quot;did not believe an official was required&quot; for his meeting with Crouch and Werritty. &quot;Mr Howarth informed his office after the meeting had taken place. No substantive issues were raised, no confidential information was disclosed and there was no follow-up to the meeting,&quot; the spokesman said. Werritty has also met Lord Astor, defence minister in the Lords, on &quot;social occasions&quot;. Crouch told the Guardian that he paid Werritty a &quot;flat fee&quot; after the pair met socially, in the hope that Werritty could provide commercial introductions to British energy companies. He denied that he was acting on behalf of any defence companies in helping fund Werritty&apos;s Pargav company via his Iraq Research Group. In the 1990s Crouch was part of British trade delegation calling on sanctions against Saddam Hussein to be eased. Crouch, a Tory donor and activist, has links with former special services officer-turned businessmen, including Tony Buckingham. Buckingham, who previously made money from mercenary operations in Africa, is now the boss of Heritage Oil, which operates in Kurdistan and recently sealed a deal in Libya. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 October 2011.

Funded by Image Nation, Abu Dhabi&apos;s nascent film studio, it was eagerly anticipated as one of the company&apos;s long-promised local productions. But things went off-script. There were reports of strife between the Emirati and foreign crews, and &quot;cultural consultant&quot; Nayla al-Khaja, a feted local talent, left the production. &quot;Djinn is not Emirati,&quot; she later told Time Out Dubai, &quot;The script? Written by an American. The producer? German-American. The director is American. Not even the sound recorder [is Emirati], not even the makeup artist, not even the wardrobe. Don&apos;t we have anyone here who can design clothing?&quot; Grassroots passion and international aspirations: Djinn is a perfect example of the tensions that have dogged the UAE&apos;s early attempts to build a cinema industry. Image Nation was born three years ago in a blaze of publicity, on the back of a mammoth $1bn deal with Warner Brothers to make movies, videogames and a theme park. But it has produced disappointingly little since \u2013 let alone raised the fortunes of the fledgling Emirati industry. Michael Garin, who took over as CEO in February, is fighting to manage expectations. &quot;If we were pretending we&apos;d be the Arabic Bollywood,&quot; he says. &quot;People would ask us what we&apos;d been smoking.&quot; Self-deprecation isn&apos;t part of the normal Emirati way of doing business: that usually errs on the side of divine intervention, like bringing the Louvre to Abu Dhabi, or turning the English Premier League on its head with Manchester City&apos;s petrodollars. But Image Nation does actually seem to be quietly getting on with film-making. It has just split, amoeba-fashion, into two parts \u2013 Image Nation International and Image Nation Abu Dhabi \u2013 which cover the studio&apos;s twin functions: to finance global hits like Contagion (which opened in the UK last week) and to produce local films, such as the coming-of-age drama Sea Shadow, which premiered there this month. The hope is that Sea Shadow, as well as Djinn, will gee up Emirati audiences to the idea of seeing homegrown films (even if no one agrees on what makes them homegrown). Buzz-commanding international titles such as Contagion and The Help \u2013 for which Image Nation put up 50/50 financing with US studio Participant Media \u2013 are clear progress on Robert Rodriguez&apos;s Shorts, the sole piece of cinema to come out of the Warner deal. Garin, though, points out that &quot;the movies we finance in our partnerships would&apos;ve got made anyway&quot;. The company&apos;s real purpose, he says, is to nurture a film-making culture within the UAE, by creating opportunities for promising local candidates to tap into the globalised network of mainstream film. &quot;That&apos;s very hard to do when you&apos;re living in London or Los Angeles. It&apos;s almost impossible in Abu Dhabi. In London or LA, people get jobs as taxi drivers or waiters when they&apos;re waiting for their first break.&quot; Image Nation is aiming to place its people on training schemes on its international productions; opportunities they wouldn&apos;t get in other, more self-contained Arab film hubs such as Beirut and Cairo. Nayla al-Khaja remains cautious: &quot;There&apos;s been too much talk, but no results in the past. I just hope Image Nation stick to their promises. They need to find a balance between international productions and supporting local culture.&quot; It&apos;s true that fathoming the company&apos;s intentions isn&apos;t straightforward. The original Warner deal was motivated, as with so many things in this part of the world, as much by real estate as film-making (the theme park on Yas Island is still going ahead, says Garin). Image Nation&apos;s chairman, Mohammed al-Mubarak (brother of Khaldoon, the Manchester City chairman) is also the chief commercial officer at Aldar, Abu Dhabi&apos;s largest real-estate company (which runs the Yas Island development); this is typical of the prevailing culture, with members of the power-broking Emirati families often holding multiple board posts. If this sub-plot in the Image Nation soap opera remains unresolved, the big-picture story arc is obvious to see. With China and India on the rise, Abu Dhabi is neatly situated between east and west, and pursuing film-making relationships with both. Garin is glowing about the partnership with Hyde Park Entertainment, run by the Indian-American mogul (and former professional tennis player) Ashok Amritraj, with whom they are setting up offices in India and Singapore. But ask him about Image Nation&apos;s prospects on the tricky Chinese turf, and Garin moves quickly back into downplaying mode: &quot;We&apos;re not going to have the same problems as other companies in China. It&apos;s not because we&apos;re smarter than they are. It&apos;s because our financial approach to film-making is completely different. The studios are so big, that&apos;s if a film&apos;s not a giant success, it doesn&apos;t really have any impact on their financial performance. The problem is that when you have giant successes, you have giant failures. Most recently, I guess, you had Cowboys and Aliens. That&apos;s the studio game, but it&apos;s not our game.&quot; The notes of realism are refreshing. Whether they&apos;re smokescreen, bluff, U-turn or clarion call is yet to emerge. Image Nation are due to announce future plans in a few weeks&apos; time, and one group of people \u2013 the UAE&apos;s thirsty young film-makers \u2013 will be the first to know for sure.", "title": "UAE's film industry \u2013 all talk no action?", "sentences": ["&quot;Djinn is not Emirati,&quot; she later told Time Out Dubai, &quot;The script?"], "publicationDate": "2011-10-27T14:02:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/27/100-hopefuls-olympics-richard-faulds", "tags": ["Olympics 2012: shooting", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Progress towards 2012 It&apos;s been quite a good year actually.

The retailer, best known for its brightly coloured polo shirts and chinos that are the off-duty uniform of City professionals, said sales jumped from \u00a358m to \u00a375.6m in the year to March, while profits rose from \u00a33.6m to \u00a34.3m. Its co-founder and chairman Jeremy Hackett said it was &quot;another successful year&quot; for the brand as it exported its &quot;distinctive British style&quot; to new markets such as the Middle East. Trading on that heritage, it has opened a high-profile store, inspired by the facade of No 10 Downing Street, in the shopping centre within Dubai&apos;s Burj Khalifa, the world&apos;s tallest building. It is also looking for growth in European markets such as Germany and Italy. Hackett enjoyed &quot;positive&quot; underlying sales in its stores and strong online growth during the year. It also saw a near 40% surge in orders from wholesale customers such as department stores John Lewis and Harrods. &quot;The retail business saw healthy trading throughout the year and like-for-like growth resisting the impact of recession as this niche market continues to be robust against retail weakness,&quot; said Hackett, who has become a well-known commentator on men&apos;s fashion and even answers his customers fashion dilemmas via its website. With the weak pound boosting tourist numbers in London, he said that its Sloane Street store had achieved &quot;record sales&quot; during the year. Despite the strong performance the retailer did not pay a dividend. The company noted: &quot;The retail weather continues to be uncertain and vulnerable to the economic uncertainty with a mood of austerity in the UK and Europe. The increase in VAT rates across Europe and decrease in disposable income is an uncertainty that the directors consider constantly.&quot; Hackett, which sponsors the British Army polo team and Aston Martin Racing, has humble origins, starting life as a stall on London&apos;s Portobello Road market in 1979. Hackett and his partner Ashley Lloyd-Jennings had spotted a demand for second-hand traditional men&apos;s clothing and accessories and the stall soon acquired a cult following. It began opening stores in the 1980s and the business continued to expand until 1992, when it was snapped up by luxury brand Richemont.

Poquelin was being niggled along from the end of the back straight. Nacarat, last year&apos;s winner, was a spent force by the turn for home after making much of the running. Chicago Grey ran in snatches, briefly threatening to get into the argument before being left behind as the front two fought it out. Weird Al&apos;s last win was in an intermediate chase at Carlisle in October 2010. He missed the rest of that season with a setback, was eighth in the Hennessy last year, had a wind op and was then pulled up in Long Run&apos;s Gold Cup, when he was reported to have bust a blood vessel.  In September, he was reported to have joined McCain from his previous trainer, Ian Williams, who may possibly be feeling a bit sorry for himself at this moment. 2.53pm Restless Harry (7-2) hacks up in John Smith&apos;s Hurdle Chris Cook: A lovely run from the star of Robin Dickin&apos;s stable. Always well thought of, he hadn&apos;t won since April 2010 but had been very highly tried and nearly always runs with credit. Here, he tracked Fair Along, took it up down the back and was in no damger for most of the straight. Other fancied runners like What A Friend and Carlito Brigante were under pressure from the back stretch and never got into the argument. Cantlow, Paul Webber&apos;s unexposed six-year-old, travelled well before seeming to blow up in the straight. Fair Along (11-2) was second, 20 lengths off the winner, with What A Friend (4-1) 15 lengths further back in third. Restless Harry is now expected to go chasing. By my reckoning, today&apos;s haul of \u00a318,000 is almost half his previous career earnings of \u00a361,000. He&apos;d have another \u00a310k to his name if he hadn&apos;t come down in a scary fall at the last flight in the 2010 Albert Bartlett when third. 1.10pm Diamond Harry a non-runner Will Hayler: Diamond Harry will miss today&apos;s Charlie Hall Chase after being found to be slightly lame in his box at the racecourse this morning. His trainer, Nick Williams, brought his stable star up yesterday from his Devon base and stabled him at the racecourse overnight. However, Williams was left wondering whether he had made the right decision. &quot;It was a risk bringing a big horse up overnight, but we thought it better than trying to do it all in one day,&quot; he said. &quot;Big horse; small stable; stone walls. At home, he&apos;d have had six inches of straw, wooden walls and more space.&quot; Williams added that he would now hope to bring Diamond Harry back up north for Haydock&apos;s Betfair Chase, where he would face the Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Long Run, or to aim for another Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup at Newbury, which he won last year. Today&apos;s TV races, by Will Hayler Time For Rupert (3.20) can emerge as one of Long Run&apos;s greatest dangers in next year&apos;s Cheltenham Gold Cup by taking an interesting and high-class renewal of the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby today. Paul Webber, Time For Rupert&apos;s trainer, has enjoyed plenty of success in recent weeks and confidence is high in the stable that the lung infection which laid Time For Rupert low at last year&apos;s Cheltenham Festival is well behind him. Indeed it speaks volumes about the horse that, despite being barely able to lift a leg for most of the way in the RSA Chase and finishing with a burst blood vessel, he was still beaten little more than half a dozen lengths into fifth place. A high-class hurdler with stamina in abundance, he lacks a little in chasing experience compared with these rivals but has looked every inch a natural so far. With the beating of Chicago Grey also in the book from last season, everything appears in place for him to triumph. Last year&apos;s winner, Nacarat, could enjoy having things his own way in front and that is a clear positive pointer for his chances. He is a bold jumper, who likes to attack his races and that could prove problematic for Poquelin, about whom there must be stamina concerns despite his formbook claims. Diamond Harry has a particularly fine record when fresh and those suggesting he might be found lacking for pace in this contest must be forgetting the effortless manner in which he cruised around Newbury en route to victory in last year&apos;s Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup. His trainer, Nick Williams, has not yet had a winner this month, however, and several of his team have been disappointing in defeat, so there are niggling concerns as to what Diamond Harry is capable of on this occasion. Nevertheless he has to be considered a major player. Newmarket 2.05 Having taken a while to reach top gear, Ecliptic was flying in the final stages when accounting for some fair yardsticks with ease on his belated comeback at Salisbury earlier this month. This is tougher but the move up to a mile must suit and he could yet prove a very smart performer. Wetherby 2.15 Dominic Elsworth knows how to get the best out of Alasi, who is a standout selection on her best form. Her finishing effort is sometimes weaker than ideal but she knows how to win and very rarely fails to give her running. Ascot 2.30 Returned to racing under Rules refreshed by a spell in hunter chases, Takeroc took advantage of a drop in his handicap mark to win with authority at Aintree six days ago. He is not the easiest ride, having more than once downed tools under maximum pressure, but he has struck up a fine understanding with Harry Derham who clearly offers excellent value for his 7lb claim. Wetherby 2.45 A recent spin on the all-weather should have helped bring Carlito Brigante to the boil for this contest. He is a strong traveller with a turn of foot that could prove all important against rivals who may lack his acceleration. Ascot 3.00 On decent ground Tarkari is capable of springing a surprise at a decent price. He lost his way last season but caught the eye coming from off the pace at Market Rasen last month and may just be finding his form again for Evan Williams. Ascot 3.40 Brought along steadily by the champion trainer, Paul Nicholls, Promising Anshan looks fairly treated against some exposed rivals and may have more to offer if the likely decent pace in this big field brings his stamina fully into play. The fitness of Balthazar King is guaranteed and he will like this fastish ground. Newmarket 3.55 Exceeding market expectations on her racecourse debut, Oojooba was well on top by the finish at Haydock last month. That was only a fair maiden but she has a likable attitude and ought to be capable of finding the necessary improvement to take a hand at this tougher level. Horse sense Charlie Mann could do with a good season after a couple of fallow years, but the signs in recent weeks have been encouraging and those looking for a lively long shot could do worse than consider Air Force One (3.40) in the big race at Ascot today. An act of faith is admittedly required. It is now three and a half years since the horse won a race and most of that time has been spent on the injured list. But Noel Fehily visited Mann&apos;s yard recently to partner Air Force One in an exercise spin and was encouraged by the progress of his old ally, who has also been taken for a day out to Kempton to try and bring him forward. The handicapper has played a part too, dropping the horse by a stone in the weights to a mark of 132. At his peak, he would have easily exploited that rating. A winning point-to-pointer in his younger days, Micheal Flips (4.50) appeared to improve for the return to fences last time out when chasing home the classy Cue Card. He has come on for that run and should prove tough to beat. Jet Away (4.25) has not always been the easiest to predict, but he was an impressive winner at York on his latest start and worked so well on Tuesday that his rider was unable to pull him up at the end of the Al Bahathri all-weather gallop. He lines up at Newmarket and is clearly firing on all cylinders at a time when others are crying enough at the end of a long season. Ed Dunlop flew out to Australia on Wednesday to supervise the final preparations of Red Cadeaux for the Melbourne Cup but not before he had seen Snow Fairy work well under Ryan Moore. She is taking her campaign well and heads to Japan ready to produce another big effort as she bids to win next month&apos;s QEII Cup at Kyoto for the second year running. Seen and heard Rumblings of discontent from jockeys over excessive kickback from Lingfield&apos;s all-weather track could hardly be more interestingly timed. In 2001, Lingfield made the pioneering move to replace their Equitrack all-weather surface with Polytrack, manufactured and installed by Martin Collins. Polytrack has gone on to establish itself as the leading artificial surface in equestrian sport around the world. A number of major United States racecourses have replaced their dirt surfaces with Polytrack and a new Polytrack course is set to open next March at Chantilly. Next month sees the 10th anniversary of the opening of Lingfield&apos;s Polytrack course. Lingfield officials have already announced that the Polytrack is to be replaced next year \u2013 however, there has been no confirmation as to what it will be replaced with. Indeed, the former master jumps trainer Michael Dickinson has been previously spotted at Lingfield promoting the Tapeta surface he developed and now in use at Meydan in Dubai. Will Hayler&apos;s best bet Wolf Moon 5.05 Wetherby  Martin Keighley is right among the winners while other trainers are still struggling to find top gear and a return to form from Wolf Moon would make him very hard to beat against ordinary opposition. His form and jumping went to pieces at the end of last season, but he has smart form in the book over hurdles and the booking of the leading Irish rider Alan Cawley takes the eye.", "title": "Talking horses | Will Hayler", "sentences": ["Indeed, the former master jumps trainer Michael Dickinson has been previously spotted at Lingfield promoting the Tapeta surface he developed and now in use at Meydan in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-29T10:56:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/31/liam-fox-hopes-return-government", "tags": ["Liam Fox", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Conservatives", "Politics", "Adam Werritty", "UK news"], "article": "The former defence secretary Liam Fox has revealed that he hopes to return to government after taking &quot;personal responsibility&quot; for his mistakes.

He did good work while he was defence secretary, but he resigned only a few days ago.&quot; Fox quit after revelations about his links to close friend Adam Werritty and prior to the publication of a report from the cabinet secretary, Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell, which found he had breached the ministerial code. The report revealed that Fox had blocked civil servants from attending key meetings alongside Werritty, had failed to tell his permanent secretary that he had solicited funds to bankroll Werritty, and had ignored private office requests to distance himself from him. Asked about the events that led to his resignation, Fox said he had taken responsibility for what had happened. He admitted it had been a mistake to meet a defence supplier in Dubai without a Ministry of Defence official present, even though someone from his private office had offered to attend. &quot;We were sitting in a coffee lounge in a hotel \u2013 it was hardly a high-security meeting,&quot; he said. &quot;But nonetheless, given this was a potential defence supplier \u2013 not, as it turns out, an actual defence supplier \u2013 it still should have had somebody there. It&apos;s very easy to be careless, but you pay a price for it.&quot; And he acknowledged that allowing Werritty, whom he met 40 times in the MoD and on trips abroad, to function as an independent adviser was a breach of the ministerial code, saying: &quot;I should have kept a better separation there \u2013 with hindsight, it seems easy.&quot;  He added: &quot;You should be able to be at the highest level of government and say you have made a mistake. &quot;I take responsibility for it and I have always been very keen, all my political life, that people should shoulder personal responsibility. That is key to a decent society. If you say it, you should also be able to do it.&quot; Fox reiterated his criticism of elements of the media coverage of his situation, which he said had been &quot;quite disconcerting&quot; and had made it difficult for him to do his ministerial job. &quot;One of my nephews, who is aged 14, was being doorstepped \u2013 and that was unacceptable,&quot; he said. &quot;I do think that we need to understand that we have to have a free press \u2026 but a free press doesn&apos;t mean the press can do what they want.&quot; He said he felt there was no rumour or innuendo that had not been written about him, but stressed he was only going to comment on &quot;substantive issues&quot;, explaining: &quot;Gossip is for gossipers.&quot;  He defended his practice of arranging &quot;downtime&quot; with Werritty and other friends during official visits overseas, saying: &quot;I would finish ministerial work and then we would very regularly, in places like Dubai, meet up with friends in the region. So there wasn&apos;t any lack of separation between ministerial and private time. &quot;Some of this coverage, you would think ministers weren&apos;t allowed to have private time which is, of course, absurd.&quot; Asked whether he had embarrassed the government, Fox said: &quot;Under this government, ministers make a mistake, ministers admit a mistake and ministers resign. That is quite different from clinging to office at all cost, which was what we saw under the previous government.&quot; Jim Murphy, shadow defence secretary, said important questions relating to Werritty remain &quot;unanswered&quot;. &quot;There&apos;s no-one to blame for Liam Fox&apos;s downfall but Liam Fox,&quot; said Muprhy. &quot;There remain many unanswered questions about this murky business.

Facing England at Lord&apos;s in August 2010, only his 14th Test, Amir was well on the way to confirming that potential. The teenager&apos;s catapult of a left arm soon made him the bowler to take 50 wickets in the fewest Tests, a distinction underscored with an inscription on the bowling honours board at the home of cricket, where he would achieve career-best figures of six for 84 in England&apos;s first innings. This was Amir&apos;s apogee: England&apos;s batsmen bewildered by the ball swinging from his fingers, and a scorebook that took on the appearance of Morse code \u2013 all dots and Ws. In one 13-ball spell Amir had accounted for Alastair Cook, Kevin Pietersen, Eoin Morgan and Paul Collingwood without conceding a run. But as Lord&apos;s bore witness in typically understated awe, none present could have known that the two &quot;massive&quot; no-balls Amir delivered were signs that he and two of his Pakistan team-mates were leading double lives as bookmakers&apos; marionettes. Depressingly, that fact was confirmed at Southwark crown court on Tuesday as Amir&apos;s then captain, Salman Butt, and his own bowling partner, Mohammad Asif, were convicted of a conspiracy to cheat at gambling and to accept corrupt payments. It is now possible to report for the first time that Amir had pleaded guilty even before the case reached court. &quot;People who had paid good money to see a professional and exciting game of cricket on the famous ground at Lord&apos;s had no idea that what they were watching was not a true game but one where part of the game had been pre-determined for cash,&quot; said Sally Walsh, a senior Crown Prosecution Service lawyer in its Special Crime and Counter-Terrorism Division. &quot;Butt and Asif denied any wrong doing but the jury has decided after hearing all the evidence that what happened on the crease that day was criminal in the true sense of the word.&quot; The lengthy trial told tales of a sophisticated criminal operation. The court heard how tens of thousands of pounds in currency was being carried across borders in attache cases concealed within locked suitcases, it learnt of &quot;safe&quot; telephone lines for speaking in secret, and of dealings with the Indian criminal underworld. But for all of this to be of any use, there needed to be a fix on the field of play. That, the prosecution argued during the course of the trial, was organised by Mazhar Majeed, conveyed to Butt and delivered by Amir and Asif under their captain&apos;s direction. As Mr Justice Cooke noted in his summing-up, there was an &quot;unusual&quot; weight of evidence in this case, since the charges arose as a result of a sting by the News of the World&apos;s fake sheikh, Mazher Mahmood, this time posing as an Indian match-fixer. His testimony, taken from behind identity-protecting screens and over two days of occasionally fiery exchanges with defence lawyers, was corroborated by the secret recordings he had made of meetings and telephone calls with Majeed. It meant the jury was afforded a fly-on-the-wall view of the operation, Majeed&apos;s voice heard as he told Mahmood the precise moments when Amir and Asif would deliver three no-balls during the first two days of the Test at Lord&apos;s. The toss had not yet even taken place to ascertain who would bat first, but Majeed confidently predicted: &quot;Whenever Pakistan bowl \u2026 these balls are definitely happening. It&apos;s going to be Amir, he&apos;s going to be bowling the third over. First ball of the third over ... [And] whenever he goes round the wicket \u2013 last ball of that over will be a no-ball.&quot; Then, in four words that would also condemn Asif, since his foot also overstepped the mark when he bowled the sixth ball of his own fifth over, Majeed added: &quot;Tenth over \u2013 last ball.&quot; Echoes of Majeed&apos;s words resounded in all that was heard in Court Four by London&apos;s south bank last month. David Kendix, the ICC&apos;s scorer at Lord&apos;s, mathematician, insurance-company risk-director and key prosecution witness, estimated that there was a 1,500,000-1 chance that Majeed could innocently have alighted on his accurate prediction. As Justice Cooke stated, it is enough to convict a man of conspiracy if there can be no other logical explanation for an event, but the jury had much more at hand. It could watch tapes of the meeting at the Copthorne Tara hotel in west Kensington, on the night before the fourth Test started at Lord&apos;s, when the agent received \u00a3140,000 in marked notes from the journalist. But when police searched the hotel three days later they found 30 of the NoW&apos;s \u00a350 notes in Amir&apos;s room. An attache case hidden in a locked suitcase under the bed in Butt&apos;s room also contained \u00a32,500 in marked notes. Butt explained that this was a 50% down payment on the \u00a35,000 he was due for the &quot;grand opening&quot; of Afters, Majeed&apos;s ice-cream parlour in Tooting, south London, but his version of events was rejected by the jury. &quot;These guys wouldn&apos;t deal with anyone,&quot; Majeed had said to Mahmood. &quot;The only reason they deal with me is because they know my background. I&apos;ve been dealing with them, the Pakistan team, for about two-and-a-half years, and we&apos;ve made massive amounts of money. I deal with an Indian party and they pay me.&quot; Majeed had all the trappings of wealth: a \u00a31.8m house in a leafy south London suburb, an Aston Martin and even a non-league football club, Croydon Athletic. But this may have been a facade as the court heard Majeed had debts of \u00a3704,000. Majeed needed the help of Butt \u2013 who told the court he counted Majeed as a &quot;close friend&quot; \u2013 since it is the captain who dictates who bowls when. During a 13-hour stint in the witness box \u2013 longer than the former Pakistan batsman has spent at the crease in any Test match \u2013 Butt was asked to explain a text he received from Majeed while both were at the World Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies during May 2010. It had been recovered from telephones by police, and showed Majeed saying: &quot;Other thing in 7th and 8th over one [wicket] fall in each this will only work if you score in the first two overs and no wickets.&quot; Butt is a fluent English speaker, but at that point in the proceedings he switched to Punjabi to speak through an interpreter. He claimed to have challenged Majeed over his message, and to have threatened to report him to cricket&apos;s anti-corruption authorities. &quot;[Majeed] said I am just checking if you are doing something dodgy or not,&quot; claimed Butt. &quot;I took his word for this explanation.&quot; Yet within three months of that supposed confrontation, the court heard Majeed was taking thousands of pounds from Mahmood, a man he understood to be a match-fixer, and was planning ways for Butt to demonstrate he was &quot;in on the fix&quot;. Although the indictment against the cricketers related only to the events at Lord&apos;s, Majeed had taken an initial \u00a310,000 from the journalist in return for the promise of two prearranged no-balls in the preceding Test at The Oval. The arrangement was apparently intended as &quot;proof&quot; of Majeed&apos;s ability to control events on the pitch. The court heard how, on the morning of the third day&apos;s play, Majeed had aborted this plan, changing it instead to a scheme in which Butt would bat out a maiden over. While in the journalist&apos;s presence Majeed called Butt, putting him on speakerphone. Unbeknown to either man, Mahmood was recording everything in the meeting, allowing the court to hear how Butt knew of plans previously concocted. As a batsman he had bowled none of the no-balls, but Majeed proved an unwitting witness against his friend with his references to how &quot;the captain knows&quot;, how Butt is &quot;one million per cent trustworthy&quot; in delivering fixes and how he was one of six players he had &quot;groomed&quot; for fixing. Added to that anecdotal testimony were the patterns of telephone calls and texts involving Butt and Majeed \u2013 who was also in contact with his bookmaking contacts in India and Dubai at the time \u2013 at key points while fixes were being arranged. All this, along with the \u00a32,500 found in Butt&apos;s room, proved enough to convict him. The prosecution made no attempt to accuse Asif of receiving illicit money from the no-ball he bowled, since no cash was found in his room. But there could be no denying he bowled it exactly as Majeed had said he would. His explanation that it was &quot;an accident&quot; brought on by the &quot;sledging&quot; he received from his own captain did not wash with the jury. Jafferjee at one stage asked Butt, who turned 27 during the trial, if he considered it a &quot;tragedy&quot; that a player might be corrupted. &quot;It&apos;s the worst thing that can happen to any player of this level,&quot; he said. Butt knows the true significance of those words today.", "title": "Cricket spot-fixing: How the Pakistan three fell into a trap", "sentences": ["Added to that anecdotal testimony were the patterns of telephone calls and texts involving Butt and Majeed \u2013 who was also in contact with his bookmaking contacts in India and Dubai at the time \u2013 at key points while fixes were being arranged."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-01T16:07:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/01/darkmarket-misha-glenny-review", "tags": ["True crime", "Books", "Culture", "Cybercrime", "Computing", "Technology"], "article": "I&apos;ve just received an email from &quot;Co-operative Bank&quot; informing me that a &quot;message regarding &apos;payment on hold&apos;&quot; is waiting for me in my &quot;Secure Message Center&quot; and inviting me to log into my account to retrieve it. Even if I did bank with the Co-op, I&apos;d like to think I wouldn&apos;t be foolish enough to fall for the scam. But in DarkMarket, Misha Glenny describes meeting Brazilian hackers who ran a phishing operation along these lines and &quot;secured tens of millions of dollars for themselves from bank accounts in Brazil, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the United States&quot;. As Glenny observes, &quot;if a hacker sends out several million spam emails, he does not need a high response rate in order for it to be worthwhile&quot;. This morning&apos;s phishing bait dropped into my inbox from an anonymous address in Denmark; the hyperlinks to the supposed banking log-in page redirect to a site registered in Poland. A few years ago, the British anti-spam website spamhaus.org exposed a Polish hacker, Pavel Kaminski, who went by the nickname &quot;Master Splyntr&quot;, as one of &quot;the world&apos;s top five spammers&quot;. In 2006, Master Splyntr was made one of the administrators of DarkMarket, a website dedicated to facilitating the exchange of information \u2013 above all, stolen credit card details, extracted either through phishing scams or illegal &quot;skimming&quot; machines piggybacked on to cash dispensers \u2013 between hackers, &quot;carders&quot; (credit card fraudsters), spammers and other cyberthieves. Glenny&apos;s riveting and comprehensive account of DarkMarket&apos;s rise and fall shines a disconcerting light into some of the dingier corners of the internet. Glenny conducted more than 200 hours of interviews to gather the material for DarkMarket, speaking to most of the major players on both sides of the law. The book is structured like a thriller, though the story&apos;s gripping enough not to need it. Glenny begins on the outer fringes of the DarkMarket web, where its tendrils reach out into daylight, with a West Yorkshire clergyman whose bank account has been hacked into. He then more or less follows the money, which leads him first to the Nigerian chemical engineer in Scunthorpe who was robbing Rev John, and on to DarkMarket&apos;s adminstrators: an unlikely alliance, possible only on the internet, of a Tamil crack addict in north London, a middle-class teenager in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, a representative of a Turkish crime syndicate, and Master Splyntr the Polish spammer. At least, that&apos;s who they appeared to be: one of them was in fact a deep cover FBI agent, who had infiltrated the site and who engineered its demise in 2008. DarkMarket covers more physical territory than a Bourne movie. One of the reasons cybercrime is hard to police is that it&apos;s so widely distributed geographically. As Glenny puts it, money can be &quot;stolen by a Russian in Ukraine from an American company and paid out in Dubai \u2013 and the whole transaction need last no longer than 10 minutes&quot;. Even if law enforcement agents are able to penetrate the sophisticated firewalls that the criminals hide behind, they often find prosecution difficult or impossible, either because of a lack of hard evidence \u2013 one hacker, Roman Vega, has been imprisoned without trial in the United States for seven years \u2013 or because their quarry is outside their jurisdiction. A lot of the biggest carding operations have been run out of Russia and Ukraine, neither of which has an extradition treaty with the US. All Russian internet service providers are required to send a copy of every packet of data that passes through their servers to the secret police, and encrypting computer files is illegal. In theory, this means that all internet activity in the country is monitored by the FSB. In practice, this means that Russian gangsters could have a hard time ripping off their compatriots, but as long as they confine their activities to cardholders in the US and western Europe, the authorities are happy to turn a blind eye. A bigger threat to cybercrooks may come not from law enforcement agencies but from other criminals. For a long time DarkMarket was subject to hacking attacks from Iceman, aka Max Ray Vision (n\u00e9 Butler), the mastermind behind a rival website called CardersMarket, until his arrest in September 2007. Last year he was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Vision used to be a patriot, seeking out and patching up holes in the Pentagon&apos;s cyber defences. The trouble was, he didn&apos;t see the need to tell the Defense Department what he was doing, and in 1998 he was arrested on suspicion of infecting them with a virus. Glenny points out that the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on cyber security are almost all &quot;invested in technology&quot;, but &quot;there is virtually no investment in trying to ascertain who is hacking and why&quot;. However, it&apos;s hard to go along with his suggestion, following a hazy summary of Simon Baron-Cohen&apos;s (much contested) work on autism and sex difference, that it could &quot;be possible to identify hacker personality types among children who are still at school&quot; and &quot;offer them ethical guidance so that their abilities can be channelled in positive directions&quot;.

Theirs was an unprecedented case, exposed by the now defunct News of the World, and everyone in the game must hope the outcome reverberates around every dressing room in the world, not just those containing Pakistan cricketers. In the past, any sort of fixing in the game has been desperately hard to nail. Previous misdemeanours have been either undetected or unproven. But not this time. Now that Butt and Asif have been found guilty at Southwark crown court (a third cricketer, Mohammad Amir, admitted the charges prior to the trial), the crucial effect is that players from every continent will know. Because fixing is so difficult to establish beyond reasonable doubt, the best weapon available to the cricket authorities is a combination of deterrence and education. And this case should both deter and educate every young cricketer who hankers after a professional career. The trio&apos;s guilt comes as no surprise to former players. Indeed, a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict from Southwark would have been far more depressing for the game. A simple photo from that Lord&apos;s Test match of August 2010 was as eloquent as any barrister&apos;s summing up. There was Pakistan&apos;s captain, Butt, at mid-off as his bowler entered his delivery stride. Any cricketer knows that a mid-off fieldsman would be focusing on the batsman at this moment, in anticipation of the ball being hit in his direction. Where was Butt looking? At his bowler&apos;s feet, checking, presumably, that he would indeed bowl a no-ball, as had been agreed with the News of the World&apos;s &quot;fake sheikh&quot;, Mazher Mahmood. For many of us, what Butt \u2013 newly appointed as captain of his country \u2013 did was especially hard to forgive, partly because we felt hoodwinked. Back in 2010, Pakistan cricket \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 had seemed to be in turmoil during its tour to England. Shahid Afridi, after one Test match in charge against Australia at Lord&apos;s, had suddenly resigned. Up stepped Butt, urbane, articulate and impressive in his soft-spoken exchanges in front of a microphone. Just as South Africa&apos;s disgraced captain, Hansie Cronje, had once seemed like a very good thing and a fine role model for young cricketers, so did Butt. And then this. It might be possible to argue that the Pakistan cricketers have been hard done by. Nobody died. Did anyone except the News of the World lose any money? The two Pakistan bowlers delivered three no-balls, which were never going to affect the outcome of the Test match. Moreover, who among us could easily reject the prospect of being given great wads of cash for carrying out seemingly inconsequential, trivial acts \u2013 overstepping by just a few inches? There may be some validity to some of these arguments, but they cannot be allowed to prevail. It has to be demonstrated that spot-fixing (fixing a particular event within a match), as well as full-on match-fixing \u2013 of which there is no evidence in this case \u2013 is regarded with the utmost gravity. On the rare occasions when it is possible to make an example of those who cross the line, it should be done with vigour. If we cannot trust the players, then the game itself becomes meaningless. There is no point watching it or playing it, and we might as well stick to the fakeries of wrestling. For some nations, the conviction of three of their most prominent cricketers would be a huge body-blow. But that does not seem to be the case with Pakistan. While this trial has been taking place, in the Middle East \u2013 currently the adopted home of Pakistan cricket \u2013 their side has been dominating a Test series against Sri Lanka, seemingly unperturbed by all the deliberations in Southwark. There may be a self-destructive streak within Pakistan cricket and there is also the inability to host home Test matches at the moment because of the threat of terrorism. But there is also an equally strong survival instinct, bolstered by an amazing conveyor belt of young cricketers. In two months&apos; time, England will be Pakistan&apos;s opponents in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. Something is bound to happen \u2013 it always does when these two sides meet. But the outcome of this trial at least makes it less likely that that something will involve fixing of any sort.", "title": "Pakistan spot-fixing: A crucial test for cricket", "sentences": ["In two months&apos; time, England will be Pakistan&apos;s opponents in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-01T19:40:11Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/01/pakistan-cricket-trio-convicted-conspiracy", "tags": ["Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal", "Pakistan cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport", "Gambling", "Crime", "UK news"], "article": "Test cricket suffered one of the darkest days in its 134-year history on Tuesday when three former Pakistan internationals were convicted in an English court of spot fixing during a match at the home of cricket, Lord&apos;s, in August last year. The former Pakistan captain Salman Butt and his opening bowlers, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir, face up to seven years in jail after the trial closed at Southwark crown court. Asif, who at the time of the match against England was ranked the world&apos;s second-best bowler, Amir, who was one of the sport&apos;s most exciting prospects, and Butt had been charged with conspiracy to cheat at gambling and to accept corrupt payments. Amir had not been a defendant in the trial but, with the convictions of Butt and Asif on both charges, it is now possible to report that he entered a double guilty plea on 16 September this year, a fact of which the jury was unaware. The evidence against the two bowlers was clear: they delivered no-balls (where the bowler&apos;s foot illegally crosses a line on the pitch) at the times predicted by Butt and Amir&apos;s agent, Mazhar Majeed, in conversation with the undercover News of the World journalist, Mazhar Mahmood. Majeed believed Mahmood was an Indian match-fixer. Asif and Butt were impassive as the verdicts were read at the culmination of a trial lasting four weeks. For Butt the impact was particularly depressing. His wife gave birth to his second son in Pakistan only 30 minutes after the verdicts. That Amir was a co-conspirator will be difficult for cricket to swallow. At only 18 he already had it all: good looks, flowing locks and the cricketing potential to exceed the exploits of the Pakistan great left-arm fast bowler, Wasim Akram. The teenager had already taken 50 wickets in the fewest Tests, a distinction underscored with an inscription on the bowling honours board at Lord&apos;s. In the match that became the focus of the court case, England&apos;s batsmen were bewildered by Amir. In one 13-ball spell he accounted for Alastair Cook, Kevin Pietersen, Eoin Morgan and Paul Collingwood without conceding a run. What none in the crown could have known was that two &quot;massive&quot; no-balls Amir also delivered were signs that he and two of his teammates were leading double lives as bookmakers&apos; marionettes. &quot;People who had paid good money to see a professional and exciting game of cricket on the famous ground at Lord&apos;s had no idea that what they were watching was not a true game but one where part of the game had been pre-determined for cash,&quot; said Sally Walsh, a senior lawyer in the Crown Prosecution Service&apos;s special crime and counter-terrorism division. &quot;Butt and Asif denied any wrongdoing but the jury has decided after hearing all the evidence that what happened on the crease that day was criminal in the true sense of the word.&quot; The court heard of a sophisticated criminal operation.

The jury watched tapes of a meeting at the Copthorne Tara hotel in west Kensington, on the night before the Lord&apos;s Test, when the agent allegedly received \u00a3140,000 in marked notes from the journalist.

As Aftab Jafferjee QC, for the prosection, noted: &quot;That, for Majeed, was to prove a costly mistake. But for others with an interest in the integrity of cricket, it proved to be good fortune.&quot; During a 13-hour stint in the witness box, longer than any the former Pakistan batsman has spent at the crease in a Test match, Butt was asked to explain a text he received from Majeed while both were at the World Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies in May 2010.

He claimed to have challenged Majeed over his message, and to have threatened to report him to cricket&apos;s anti-corruption authorities. &quot;[Majeed] said I am just checking if you are doing something dodgy or not,&quot; claimed Butt. &quot;I took his word for this explanation.&quot; Yet within three months of that supposed confrontation, Majeed was taking thousands of pounds from Mahmood, a man he understood to be a match-fixer, and was planning ways for Butt to demonstrate he was &quot;in on the fix&quot;. Added to anecdotal testimony were patterns of phone calls and texts involving Butt and Majeed \u2013 who was also in contact with bookmaking contacts in India and Dubai at the time - at key points while fixes were being arranged. These, along with the \u00a32,500 found in Butt&apos;s room, proved enough to convict him. Asif&apos;s no-ball came exactly as Majeed had said it would. His explanation that it was &quot;an accident&quot; brought on by the &quot;sledging&quot; he received from his own captain did not wash with the jury, and although no cash had been found in his room it was clear he had been motivated by a criminally corrupt conspiracy. At one stage during the trial, Butt was asked if he considered it a &quot;tragedy&quot; that a player might be corrupted. &quot;It&apos;s the worst thing that can happen to any player of this level,&quot; he said.

Stephen Fry was on board a Qantas A380 superjumbo diverted to Dubai that landed safely on Friday after an oil problem forced pilots to shut down one of its four engines. &quot;Bugger. Forced to land in Dubai. An engine has decided not to play,&quot; he tweeted. The flight crew noticed a problem with the oil level, forcing it to shut down the engine, according to a Qantas spokeswoman, Olivia Wirth. Flight QF31, heading from Singapore to London, landed safely with its 258 passengers and 25 crew unhurt. A year ago another Qantas A380 suffered a midair engine explosion after takeoff from Singapore. In that case a defective engine pipe leaked oil, sparking a fire that destroyed a turbine disc and sent pieces of the disc into the plane&apos;s wing, an Australian safety report said. A380s around the world were grounded so the engine-maker Rolls-Royce could replace the part. Wirth said the anniversary was a coincidence and the events were unrelated. &quot;This is a one-off incident,&quot; she said of the latest engine problem. &quot;Obviously it will be a priority of ours to work out what the particular problem is in this engine.&quot; Engineers were inspecting the plane in Dubai to see whether it could continue to London. The airline was finding hotels or alternative flights for passengers, Wirth said. Qantas grounded its entire fleet last weekend and threatened to lock out unions that had been staging months of strikes. The move stranded thousands of passengers around the world and enraged Australian government officials, who ordered an emergency tribunal hearing. On Sunday, the tribunal ordered the airline to end the lockout and the unions to halt their strikes. Flights resumed on Tuesday. On Wednesday officials said police were investigating the suspected sabotage of the entertainment system on a Qantas plane. Qantas said engineers noticed several wires were cut on the plane&apos;s in-flight entertainment system on 26 October, at the height of the labour dispute. The engineers&apos; union said it was unlikely the plane was sabotaged because of anything to do with the dispute. As passengers were kept waiting on the tarmac at Dubai for more than an hour, according to Fry, the comedian tweeted his frustration: &quot;@abcnews24 So either Sydney send another one out or they come to an accommodation with Emirates. Either way not a great week for #qantas !&quot; The airline was finally moved to reply via its own Twitter account after Fry tweeted that he had left his wallet on the plane and was considering &quot;taking up smoking again.

According to Cartier-Bresson, a photograph recorded a &quot;decisive moment&quot;, and that instant could mean, as it does for the heroes of novels by Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, the difference between life and death. Magnum photographers specialised in catching such moments of truth. Capa huddled with an American infantryman who was picked off by a Nazi sniper in Leipzig just before the allies declared victory, and Elliott Erwitt saw the cold war almost ignite as Nixon, touring an exhibition of American domestic appliances in Moscow, jabbed Khrushchev&apos;s bullish chest with an angry, accusing finger. More light-hearted and light-headed, Marc Riboud watched a painter with no safety harness recklessly dance on the iron girders of the Eiffel Tower like a Nietzschean superman on a tightrope above the abyss. Single gestures could show a world falling apart, or undergoing a tectonic shift: a demonstrator photographed by Bruno Barbey in Paris in 1968 hurls a rock with the elegant energy of a bowler in a cricket game, a hallooing punk photographed in 1989 by Raymond Depardon rides the suddenly permeable Berlin Wall as if it were a bucking horse at a rodeo. From a safe distance, Stuart Franklin recorded another personal and political crisis as a student carrying a shopping bag faced down the tanks advancing into Tiananmen Square and, for a single breathless minute, brought them to\u00a0a\u00a0halt. Images like these conferred a Hemingwayesque bravado on the members of the Magnum coterie. They were toreadors with little Leicas, not a cape, as their only means of defence against the enemy, and they occasionally gave proof of their existential valour by being killed in action. In 1954, Capa stepped on a landmine in Indochina and Werner Bischof died in the Andes after his car plunged off a cliff. Patrick Zachmann was shot by thuggish cops in Cape Town in 1990; Cartier-Bresson commiserated, but told him to respond by using his camera as a flame-thrower. Nine years later Christopher Anderson clambered aboard a makeshift boat with a gang of Haitian refugees sailing to America. After two days it began to sink. Anderson frantically documented his own imminent death, and in a paraphrase of the Magnum creed, called the episode &quot;the single most transformative moment of my photographic life&quot;. Fortuitously, those on the leaky homemade craft were rescued by a US coastguard cutter. When a skirmish with death was not part of the assignment, Magnum photographs tended to be happy accidents. Inge Morath could not believe her luck when a llama inquisitively poked its head out of a car window in Times Square, and Martine Franck, preparing a photo-essay on Buddhist monks in Nepal, rejoiced when a pigeon fluttered into the room and settled on the bald pate of a blissfully unruffled holy man. Franck, Cartier-Bresson&apos;s widow, says that she is still &quot;pursuing the unexpected&quot; \u2013 or perhaps responding to it when it adventitiously occurs. But how far was the mystique of the decisive moment a self-glorifying fiction? Photographers compulsively overshoot, and for every image that looks definitive, there are dozens that are discarded. Kristen Lubben&apos;s anthology of contact sheets \u2013 the equivalent of cinematic rushes, a memento of the days when rolls of film were printed out to be reviewed and edited \u2013 aims to illuminate the creative process but in fact demystifies it, distracting us with irrelevant alternatives like the out-takes from films that are often so otiosely added to DVDs. Cartier-Bresson thought of contact sheets as a mess of erasures, and said that when you invited friends to dinner you spared them the sight of your messy kitchen with its buckets of vegetable peel; he mostly took the wise precaution of cutting up sheets that contained no image worth\u00a0enlarging. Very occasionally, the frames before and after the decisive one help to tell a story: it&apos;s fun to discover that the disoriented llama shared its trainer&apos;s Manhattan apartment with a freakish menagerie of performers that included a kangaroo and a miniature bull, and was on its way to a gig in a television studio when Morath saw it. Otherwise I&apos;m content not to know about images that the photographers, for good reason, chose to discard. But Lubben&apos;s volume \u2013 a coffee-table book bulky enough to double as a coffee table \u2013 valuably documents Magnum&apos;s history, and in doing so looks beyond so-called &quot;iconic&quot; shots such as Ren\u00e9 Burri&apos;s Che Guevara sucking a cheroot like a stick of dynamite or Peter Marlow&apos;s Margaret Thatcher sporting a bouffant hair-do with the adamantine consistency of spun steel. There are revelations here: in the surf at Bondi, Trent Parke gulps for air, submerges, shoots at random, and comes up with astonishing images of flailing bodies that seem to fall out of the air, and in a snowy Warsaw park Mark Power photographs a dalmatian dog that like Lewis Carroll&apos;s Cheshire cat disappears into the blank vista, leaving only its spots behind. Some of Magnum&apos;s current members doggedly pursue the humanistic mission of the agency&apos;s founders, like John Vink with his earnest agenda of &quot;aftermath situations, threats to cultural identity, development issues, the uprooted, the voiceless&quot; \u2013 a shopping list of liberal gripes. But Vink&apos;s colleague Martin Parr has forgotten that photographic moments ought to be decisive, and amuses himself by taking pictures of whatever banal scrap of reality flickers in front of his eye. (Once, in Dubai, he even unwittingly snapped me, along with the mob of other strangers who happened to be in the room.) Is digital photography all too facile, eliminating the editorial stage and licensing visual promiscuity?

Jon Moulton, a multimillionaire venture capitalist who donated \u00a335,000 to the &quot;slush fund&quot; set up to support Werritty&apos;s jetset lifestyle, has told the Guardian he will provide the police with documents proving he was misled by Werritty. Moulton said he would hand over &quot;written assurances&quot; that detail how his donation to Pargav, the company that helped fund Werritty&apos;s first-class flights to meet Fox overseas, would be spent. He said Werritty &quot;wasted&quot; the money and spent it in a way that &quot;bore absolutely no resemblance&quot; to the assurances. He told the Guardian he would &quot;of course \u2026 provide whatever the police would like&quot;. It comes as the police are considering whether to launch a full-scale investigation into allegations that Werritty may have acted fraudulently by handing out business cards that described him as an &quot;adviser to the Rt Hon Dr Liam Fox MP&quot;. The Guardian understands that detectives at the City of London police&apos;s economic crime unit have interviewed at least five people in connection with Werritty&apos;s actions. One of those is John Mann, the Labour MP who first raised questions about Fox and Werritty&apos;s working relationship. Another is Harvey Boulter, a Dubai businessman who says he was led to believe Werritty was Fox&apos;s official adviser. Werrity is not among those who has been interviewed by police, his lawyer said on Friday. &quot;Adam has not been contacted by the Police, and it follows that he has not been interviewed by them,&quot; said the lawyer. &quot;I can add that he has also not been asked to provide a written statement to the Police, nor has he done so voluntarily.&quot; The City of London police declined to comment on the progress of their inquiries, but it is understood that in cases involving politicians, the police and the Crown Prosecution Service work together to ensure they have sufficient evidence before opening a full-scale investigation. Jim Murphy, the shadow defence secretary, said: &quot;If a formal case were to open this would be very serious indeed. The prime minister has refused to reveal the facts and it may be left to the police to do so. The prime minister would be much better advised just clearing this up once and for all rather than allowing it to drift.&quot; The other donors to Pargav are Stephen Crouch, a defence lobbyist; G3 (Good Governance Group), an international investigation company staffed by former MI6 employees; Tamares, an investment company owned by the defence and retail industry tycoon Poju Zabludowicz; and the financier Michael Lewis. Moulton told BBC Newsnight this week that Fox had solicited the donation from him after he gave funds to the former defence secretary&apos;s &quot;back office&quot; while Fox was in opposition. &quot;Liam [Fox] asked me to put some money in the same general direction. I was at great pains to get written assurances as to what it was used for, which bore absolutely no resemblance to what it was used for. I can definitely say that I was mugged. In fact, if you look at the dictionary, the definition of &apos;foxed&apos; is discoloured with yellowish-brown staining, and I fear it might be reasonably appropriate.&quot; The prime minister has been called on to investigate the role of Gerald Howarth, the arms sales minister, who met Crouch and Werritty inside the House of Commons in September. Crouch, who reportedly paid \u00a320,000 to Pargav, said he paid a &quot;flat fee&quot; in the hope of introductions to British energy companies. Howarth said he was unaware that Werritty had received money from Crouch before the meeting on 27 September. It has also emerged Oliver Hylton, who had been suspended by the hedge fund CQS, is no longer employed by the company. The company is run by Michael Hintze a major Tory party donor. Hylton, Hintze&apos;s former right-hand man, allowed Werritty to work out of CQS&apos;s offices and served as the sole director of Pargav. \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 4 November at 16:00 GMT and at 18.50 GMT", "title": "Adam Werritty backer to hand police documents to back claim he was duped", "sentences": ["Another is Harvey Boulter, a Dubai businessman who says he was led to believe Werritty was Fox&apos;s official adviser."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-04T14:01:11Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/04/europe-biggest-beer-hall-berlin", "tags": ["Germany", "Europe", "Beer", "Food & drink"], "article": "Just as the Scots disparage the Sassenachs and the English make fun of the Welsh, so too do Berliners consider their Bavarian cousins to be something of a joke. &quot;To us, they are the argumentative mountain folk [z\u00e4nkisches Bergvolk],&quot; said Berliner Stefan Dadarski, &quot;and to them, we&apos;re piggish Prussians [Sauprei\u00dfn]&quot;. But despite his affectionately jaundiced view of his southern brethren, there he was on Friday lunchtime, one of the first customers in what claims to be Europe&apos;s biggest Bavarian bierhalle \u2013 in Berlin. &quot;I was curious what it would be like,&quot; said the dreadlocked 39-year-old, flagging down a lederhosen-clad waiter and ordering half a litre of Hofbr\u00e4u M\u00fcnchner Hell lager and a Munich sausage salad. When it was announced earlier this year that a gargantuan bierhalle based on the famous Munich Hofbr\u00e4uhaus was to open in the capital, Berliners were sceptical. Sure, a franchise had already opened in Dubai, but to many, the concept stood more chance of succeeding in the dry Middle East than on the north German plain. And yet the gigantic Berlin outpost, which can accommodate 2,500 punters on 2km of wooden benches, is just one part of Bavarian culture&apos;s subtle invasion of the capital. According to the Visit Berlin tourist office, Berliners in almost every district celebrated the Oktoberfest beer festival, which originates in Munich. In the past three years, the famous organic Munich bakery chain Hofpfisterei  has gone from having no branches in the capital to eight all over town. And one fashionable boutique in the central Mitte district has even started selling hipster dirndls. &quot;We&apos;re confident this is going to work,&quot; said Bj\u00f6rn Schwarz, the manager of Hofbr\u00e4u Berlin, on Friday. &quot;We&apos;ve had enormous success with our two Hofbr\u00e4uhauser in Hamburg, and we are confident the time is right for us here.&quot; Gearing up for Friday night&apos;s grand opening, Schwarz said there would be &quot;yodelling girls, a man blowing an alpenhorn and a live band playing traditional Bavarian folk tunes with a modern twist&quot;. Schwarz said he anticipated half of his customers would be locals, the other visitors from the rest of Germany and the world. But a group of young Berliners who had popped in &quot;out of curiosity&quot; were not so sure. &quot;I think this is really for tourists,&quot; said Andre Zayarni, 31, tucking into a schnitzel. &quot;They&apos;ve not decided to be near the Alex for nothing,&quot; said his colleague Steffen Irrgang, 29, referring to nearby Alexander Platz, the bleak concrete square once at the heart of East Berlin, which despite offering all the charm of a prison exercise yard is still a tourist hot spot. It&apos;s true that Berliners see themselves as very different from the Bavarians, they agreed. &quot;You know the famous phrase, Berlin is poor but sexy? Well, that&apos;s basically us. We&apos;re more modern, more independent, less traditional,&quot; said Irrgang. &quot;All of the German stereotypes come from Bavaria \u2013 lederhosen and so forth \u2013 and that breeds prejudice against the rest of us.&quot; A Berlin theme pub would never take off in Munich, said Zayarni. &quot;It&apos;s too schickimicki,&quot; he said, using the standard Berlin term for something that is &quot;a bit up itself&quot;. An older couple had popped in to see how authentic the place was. Hildegard and Heinz Brauer, 72 and 74, are originally from Berlin but fled to Munich in the 1960s after the wall went up. &quot;We wanted to see what it was like,&quot; said Hildegard. And? &quot;It&apos;s ... OK.&quot; Heinz&apos;s wei\u00dfwurst (boiled white sausage) was lukewarm rather than hot, she said, but the beer was good. On another table, a customer shook his head at the mustard he had been served with his leberk\u00e4se \u2013 a cross between a flat sausage and a slice of meatloaf that translates literally as &quot;liver cheese&quot; despite containing neither ingredient. &quot;Do you have any sweet mustard?&quot; he asked the waiter. &quot;In Munich, leberk\u00e4se always comes with sweet mustard.&quot; It&apos;s no wonder the experience isn&apos;t all that authentic. One young waitress from the Berlin district of K\u00f6penick had a guilty secret.

Over the past decade Robert Dawes has moved from a two-up, two-down terraced house on an estate outside Nottingham to a base in Dubai and finally to a villa on the Costa del Sol. Police believe he has left a trail of destruction as one of the heads of a crime syndicate that flooded the UK with millions of pounds of cocaine, heroin and cannabis. He has been identified in nine UK investigations involving large scale shipments. Dawes is wanted in the Netherlands in connection with the murder of a teacher, Gerard Meesters; in Spain, where police have identified him as &quot;the boss of an important English drug trafficking organisation&quot;; and in the UK, where Nottinghamshire detectives are seeking him over the alleged commissioning of the murder of David Draycott in October 2002. So when investigators from the Serious Organised Crime Agency, working with Spain&apos;s Guardia Civil, had Dawes secured in a Madrid prison this spring to face trial over the seizure of 200kg of cocaine, the belief was that the reign of a man described by Soca as a &quot;highly significant international criminal&quot; had ended. But the Guardian has discovered that Spanish judges have been forced to drop the trial and free 39-year-old Dawes because the British authorities had failed to respond for months to a request for assistance. Dawes is now back in his enormous villa near Benalm\u00e1dena on the Costa del Sol with his wife and three children, enjoying his freedom. After Dawes&apos;s release a few weeks ago, the Spanish courts issued a statement which made clear their hand had been forced by the failure of the British to respond to a request for documents sent in April through the highest diplomatic channels. &quot;The provincial court in Madrid has revoked the indictment of Robert Dawes ... and so he is at liberty,&quot; the statement said. &quot;The magistrates ... understand that... it is necessary to wait for a response from the Commission of Dubai, with reference to the searches in the case, and, above all, the Commission of the United Kingdom. &quot;When the judicial authorities of those countries respond with evidence the case will be taken up again, but neither of the two commissions has yet commented and there is no indication of when they might do so.&quot; Soca officials have been left embarrassed by the bureaucratic bungling. They say the request via a letter rogatory \u2013 the official method of requesting assistance between countries \u2013 was only received by the Home Office in August before being forwarded on to them in the same month. The letter rogatory was sent to the Home Office via Eurojust, an organisation based in The Hague that is supposed to speed up co-operation on major criminal investigations between EU countries. Asked by the Guardian this week about the case, Soca officials said they were planning to send an official to hand deliver the documents. A spokesman said: &quot;We are supporting this Spanish-led investigation. Upon receipt of their request for evidence we took immediate action, in conjunction with the Crown Prosecution Service, to collate the material required. &quot;This process must take into account various legal and operational issues but it is Soca&apos;s intention to provide the material to the Spanish at the very earliest opportunity.&quot; But it is not the first time that Dawes has slipped through the net, and some of his former associates have refused to co-operate with the authorities in the past because they believed he was an &quot;asset&quot; who was being protected. Dawes grew up on the Leamington estate in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, and is thought to have began his criminal career in the 1990s working as an enforcer. By 2000 his name was cropping up in investigations from Scotland to London, where he is known to have associated with some of the UK&apos;s most notorious crime syndicates including the London-based Adams family. By this time Dawes and his brother John \u2013 later jailed for 24 years for drug dealing and money laundering \u2013 had allegedly moved into large scale shipments of heroin, cocaine, amphetamines and cannabis. In the Netherlands he became known in thousands of phone taps carried out by Dutch police as the &quot;Derbyman&quot;. In 2001, fearing the police net was closing in, Dawes left the UK for the Mijas Costa area of Spain \u2013 but could not resist making fleeting trips back to his old estate where he still owned two terraced houses that had been knocked together. Soca began Operation Halbert in 2006 to target Dawes and his lieutenants. In August 2007 they seized \u00a313m worth of drugs including 65kg of heroin in a major raid in Ruddington, Nottinghamshire. A month later, after receiving intelligence from Soca, officers from the Guardia Civil drug unit seized almost 200kg of cocaine just outside Madrid that was allegedly linked to Dawes. But by then Dawes had fled Spain to set up a base in Dubai. He was eventually extradited in April this year to face trial in Madrid until his release by the Spanish a few weeks ago.

He seems impressively tough. Can he win first time on dirt and in first-time blinkers?  6.54pm Scooter Dickey is the very popular 70-year-old trainer of Flat Out. You can read a bit about him here. 6.50pm Game On Dude would be a great winner for the news journalists. In the saddle is Chantal Sutherland, trying to be the first woman jockey to win the Classic.  6.45pm The climax to the Breeders&apos; Cup is upon us. It&apos;s the 12-runner Classic (Prayer For Relief a non-runner). Betfair betting: 4-1 Flat Out, 9-2 So You Think, Havre De Grace, 13-2 Uncle Mo, 12-1 To Honor And Serve, Ruler On Ice, 16-1 Stay Thirsty. 6.26pm Freddy Head again: &quot;I&apos;ve lived great moments because of her and I&apos;m very pround and very happy. It&apos;s a nice way to finish, although she didn&apos;t win, she tried her best. Just today she wasn&apos;t good enough, that&apos;s all. She&apos;ll now go into retirement as a broodmare, hopefully all will go well and maybe she will have some foals and yearlings who will come here too.  [Olivier Peslier] said for a moment he didn&apos;t have much room [but] when she came out she really flew and he thought for a few strides he was going to win. But when the others came she didn&apos;t have any more, she was gone.&quot; Head adds that he believes the plan is to send her to Galileo. That foal will be worth a bit.  6.20pm Breeders Cup Mile result: 1. Court Vision, 2. Turallure, 3. Goldikova. Lots of head-shaking among the American journalists, no-one wanted to see her DQd on her last start, but American stewards regularly throw horses out for significantly less than that.  6.19pm Result stands. Unbelievable. 6.17pm The finish was incredibly tight between two complete outsiders.  Freddy Head is talking to the TV. &quot;I think the years have taken their toll. I&apos;m very, very proud of her.&quot; 6.15pm Think Goldikova may be disqualified on her last start. Olivier Peslier made a rash move to look for room at the top of the straight. Pat Valenzuela had to snatch up on Courageous Cat, the stewards will take a dim view of that.  6.13pm Objection at Churchill after Court Vision noses out Turalure in the Mile, with Goldikova only third.  5.59pm Eight minutes to post in the Mile, Goldikova is on the track and looking relaxed. Currently trading at 6-5, this place will go mad if she wins.  5.50pm Goldikova now leaving the tunnel for the paddock for her 27th and final race. She is six years old and the winner of 17 races and \u00a34.2m. No horse has ever won four races at the Breeders&apos; Cup and she may be minutes from becoming the first. It&apos;s more than two years since she last finished out of the first two and she&apos;s run a dozen races since then. 5.45pm It&apos;s Goldikova time.  Betfair betting for the Mile: 6-4 Goldikova, 15-2 Strong Suit, 9-1 Gio Ponti, Byword, 12-1 Courageous Cat, 14-1 Turallure. 5.45pm Midday appears likely to be retired after running 6th in the Turf. Grimthorpe again: &quot;The signs just before the race weren&apos;t very positive and I would think that would be it for a magnificent career. There&apos;s no doubt she has been one of the all-time great racemares.&quot; 5.42pm Re Sea Moon, runner-up in the Turf, Teddy Grimthorpe, representing his owner, said: &quot;Sea Moon ran a blinder, however he wasn&apos;t helped by his sluggish start. We can&apos;t complain as he got in a super position to challenge and did everything he could. He is lightly raced and still a bit babyish.&quot;  5.35pm Crusade ran respectably but Daddy Long Legs finished right out the back. Any turf horse can, of course, be excused a poor run on dirt for the first time. 5.30pm Juvenile result: 1 Hansen 7-1, 2 Union Rags evens, 3 Creative Cause 5-1. An incredibly tough effort by the winner, who made all and showed so much toughness to keep going in the straight, when he seemed sure to fold. Union Rags, the hot favourite, was pushed wide around the bends and looks like the best horse in the race. 5.22pm Union Rags is one of the few in the field with established form on dirt, some of the other American runners having raced exclusively or mainly on Polytrack or similar synthetics. He was an impressive five-length winner of the Champagne at Belmont last time, despite meeting trouble in running, and seems to hold Alpha, the ruunner-up, on that form. 5.20pm Betfair betting: 15-8 Union Rags, 15-2 Hansen, Creative Cause, 8-1 Daddy Long Legs, 11-1 Drill, 12-1 Alpha. 5.17pm So it must be time for the Juvenile, a 13-runner dirt race in which Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s night may get even better. He runs Crusade, the Middle Park winner, with Julien Leparoux on board, and Daddy Long Legs, the Royal Lodge winner, ridden by Ryan Moore. Daddy Long Legs had Wrote four lengths behind him when he won at Newmarket that day, so Wrote&apos;s earlier win is a major boost for him. 5.05pm Worth remembering the finishing order to that Guineas 18 months ago. 1 Makfi (2 G1s), 2 Dick Turpin (2 G1s), 3 Canford Cliffs (5 G1s), 4 Xtension (1 G1, earned \u00a31.2m), 6 St Nicholas Abbey (3 G1s, earned \u00a31.6m). Bit rough on the fifth, Elusive Pimpernel, who hasn&apos;t won in 6 starts since. 5pm A compliment for Joseph O&apos;Brien from Jerry Bailey. &quot;He may be tall but, when he&apos;s on a horse, he looks like a lizard on a log!&quot; 4.55pm Joseph O&apos;Brien has just given an interview to a trackside panel of TV pundits while still on horseback, chatting to them across the rail. &quot;It&apos;s a dream come true. I was very happy with my position, he was going well and he picked up where it matters. They went a nice pace, I had to be patient and wait for the gaps to come. I&apos;ve been coming to the Breeders&apos; Cup since I was very small. To ride a winner here is out of this world.&quot;  4.55pm What a moment for Aidan O&apos;Brien and his son Joseph. He brought St Nicholas Abbey with a storming run to overhaul Sea Moon well inside the final furlong.  O&apos;Brien is the youngest winning jockey in Breeders&apos; Cup history. 4.51pm Breeders&apos; Cup Turf result: 1. St Nicholas Abbey, 2. Sea Moon, 3. Brilliant Speed.  4.44pm Sea Moon suddenly unrelaxed, bucking and kicking on the track.  4.39pm Sarafina  taking a fair hold on the way to post for the Turf. Didn&apos;t seem to enjoy being ponied on the track too much either. Sea Moon on the other hand is a picture of relaxation. He has come in half a point in the betting, now 3-1, just a point behind the favourite.  4.31pm Sarafina is favourite on the tote for the Turf at 2-1, even though the firm ground shouldn&apos;t really play to her strengths. Sea Moon very solid at 7-2, Midday next in at 6-1 with St Nicholas Abbey.  4.21pm Getting very serious now. Four races left, two each on turf and dirt, and potentially huge stories in every one. The Turf is next, with Midday running her last race, Joseph O&apos;Brien hoping to win a $3m for his father on St Nicholas Abbey, and Sea Moon, Sarafina and Await The Dawn also in the mix for Europe.  The Juvenile could well decide the winter favourite for the Kentucky Derby, and Daddy Long Legs must have a serious chance for Aidan O&apos;Brien after Wrote franked his Newmarket form in the Juvenile Turf. And then it&apos;s on to Goldikova in the Mile, and So You Think versus Uncle Mo et al in the Classic. Just over two and a half hours of outstanding action ahead. 4.11pm That was quite a stretch run by Caleb&apos;s Posse, who beat Uncle Mo, one of the favourites for the Classic later one today, by a nose in a Grade One at Saratoga earlier this year. Shackleford set off for home coming out of the final turn, but Caleb&apos;s Posse simply blew past him just inside the last furlong.  4.05 pm Dirt Mile result: 1 Caleb&apos;s Posse 6-1,2 Shackleford 5-1, 3 Tres Borrachos 30-1. 3.54pm Even the British press syndicate managed to find Regally Ready in the Turf Sprint so we are still in the Pick6, though our four-strong team in that race also included Country Day, the 33-1 runner-up, who would have knocked out most of the rest of the pool in one go. We&apos;ve got the two favourites here. 3.52pm Ten minutes to post for the Dirt Mile, Wilburn and Trappe Shot the joint-favourites at 5-2 on the pari-mutuel.  3.31pm The turf course is now officially firm, as indeed it looked when they winged around in that sprint race just now. 3.24pm Turf Sprint result: 1 Regally Ready 2-1, 2 Country Day 33-1, 3 Perfect Officer 10-1. The winning jockey is Corey Nakatani and the trainer is Steve Asmussen. They also combined to win the Juvenile Fillies last night with My Miss Aurelia. 3pm Aidan O&apos;Brien was asked in the post-race interview whether he will be signing up Ryan Moore as stable jockey next season, but just repeated the mantra from earlier in the week that there will be a meeting at the end of the year when everything will be up for discussion and nothing will be decided until then.  Update on A U Miner: track vet says that the original diagnosis has been confirmed. &quot;He stayed in the ambulance and was transferred to Lexington. He will be under observation for a couple of days, then tentatively will have surgery on Monday or Tuesday.  &quot;We do the surgery to save their life. The prognosis is relatively open, 50-60% of them do well.&quot; 2.55pm And so to the Turf Sprint, featuring 14 runners, including the last two winners of this race, Chamberlain Bridge and California Flag. Betfair betting: 4-1 Regally Ready, 6-1 Havelock, 7-1 Caracortado, 10-1 Chamberlain Bridge. 2.46pm Force Freeze, the Sprint runner-up, was formerly trained in Dubai by Doug Watson and was last of nine under Kieren Fallon there in the Golden Shaheen on World Cup day in March. He is a thrilling first runner at the Breeders&apos; Cup for his new trainer Peter Walder, just getting run down in the final half-furlong after leading from the top of the straight. 2.42pm Sprint result: 1 Amazombie 7-1, 2 Force Freeze 6-1, 3 Jackson Bend 5-2. &quot;Very fortunate and lucky,&quot; says the winning trainer Bill Spawr when asked how it feels. The winning jockey was Mike Smith, taking him to 14 successes at the Breeders&apos; Cup, one behind the record-holder, Jerry Bailey. 2.38pm Aidan O&apos;Brien in the post-race press conference after winning the Juvenile Turf with Wrote: &quot;He got a bit unbalanced coming down the hill at Newmarket, which can happen the first time they do it, and he had a temperature for a while afterwards and had to have a break. This is his first run back, and he&apos;d been working very well.  &quot;Ryan [Moore] said to Derrick [Smith, his part-owner] after the race that he felt he would stay a bit further, so I&apos;d imagine that he could be trained for the Classics next year.&quot; Wrote is 25-1 for the Derby with Boylesports.  It&apos;s two minutes to post for the Sprint, which seems nothing like the race it once was these days.  2.35pm At around 16-1, Hamazing Destiny is running for D Wayne Lukas, the most successful trainer in Breeders&apos; Cup history with 18 wins, including two in the Sprint. 2.31pm Next up is the Breeders&apos; Cup Sprint with nine runners, none of them with any evident European connection.  Betfaiir betting: 100-30 Jackson Bend, 4-1 Big Drama, 13-2 Euroears, 7-1 Giant Ryan, 8-1 Amazombie. 2.23pm Some quotes from the Marathon earlier Cornelio Velasquez, jockey of Afleet Again, on his winning run: &quot;He has one pace all the way. I stayed behind the speed and at the quarter-pole I put him in the clear. And I had a lot of horse. At the three-eights, I pulled the trigger.&quot; Dave Lanigan, trainer of Meeznah, eased to a walk in the same race: &quot;According to Tom Queally, she took a bad step and she was never going after that.&quot; 2.21pm A confidence-boosting win for Aidan O&apos;Brien and Ryan Moore after some near-misses and complete blowouts over the meeting so far. Wrote is only O&apos;Brien&apos;s second winner at the Breeders&apos; Cup since High Chaparral - the sire of Wrote - dead-heated for the Turf in 2003. Also interesting that last time out, Wrote finished over four lengths behind Daddy Long Legs, who will contest the Juvenile on the dirt later in the afternoon. The bookies have started to take the pinking shears to that one&apos;s price already.  2.20pm American broadcasters comparing Goldikova to other sports folk who have won top-class contests four times in a row. Apparently, she&apos;s racing&apos;s answer to Chris Evert (four US Opens). 2.11pm Ryan Moore tells Jerry Bailey in an instant TV interview: &quot;He got away well, we got a lovely run through the race and when we switched out, he galloped on real well.&quot; 2.09pm Juvenile Turf result: 1 Wrote 11-1, 2 Excaper 33-1, 3 Farraaj 8-1. 2.08pm Wrote wins the Juvenile Turf for Aidan O&apos;Brien and Ryan Moore! 2pm Worth noting that Caspar Netscher is Kieren Fallon&apos;s only mount of the day. Fallon was a distant third in the British jockeys&apos; championship, which ended today. 1.51pm Fifteen minutes to post for the Juvenile Turf, the betting is very open but the market&apos;s narrow preference is for Finale, from the Todd Pletcher stable. Caspar Netscher is the shortest price of the European challengers, though the omens aren&apos;t good after the Marathon. The three visitors were the last three horses to cross the line.  Latest Betfair odds: Finale 5-1, Caspar Netscher 7-1, Farraj 15-2, Majestic City 8-1, State Of Play 10-1, Wrote 10-1. European runners: Farraaj (Roger Varian), Wrote (Aidan O&apos;Brien) and Caspar Netscher (Newark&apos;s own Alan McCabe). 1.39pm On-course vet reports that Meeznah was eased due to fatigue. A U Miner has sustained bilateral fractures in a sesamoid joint and is currently being assessed.  1.37pm Good job that Afleet Again&apos;s race wasn&apos;t in the Pick6, as 99% of punters would be out already. The grey was returned at odds of 41-1, one of the longest-priced winners in Breeders&apos; Cup history. A U Miner appeared to be pulled up lame at the back of the field before they came into the stretch, will be checking that he&apos;s okay. Meeznah also dropped right out, she was never really going at any stage.  1.27pm Marathon result: 1 Afleet Again 41-1, 2 Birdrun, 3 Giant Oak. Winner trained by Robert Reid Jr and ridden by Cornelio Velasquez. Meeznah pulled up with just under a circuit to go. The other European runners, Brigantin (Andre Fabre) and Harrison&apos;s Cave (Aidan O&apos;Brien) have been well beaten on the Churchill Downs dirt. 1.18pm They have some cracking racing colours in the States. In this race, Eldaafer is wearing White, Jade &quot;E-RACING&quot; on Black Shark.  1.16pm Coming out onto the track for the Marathon, Tom Queally rides Meeznah for Dave Lanigan here. The quality of this race is a long way short of most of the rest of the card, but it would be a huge win for Lanigan. Think A U Miner will tack some beating though.  12.55pm The second race at Churchill - the last one before the Breeders&apos; Cup gets underway - has just been won by a filly who scooted away from her field up the rail. Overall, the condition of the track has now been changed to &quot;fast&quot;, but the dirt on the far side of the stretch looks fastest of all.  Early betting for the Marathon is very open, though A U Miner, a 5-1 chance at the moment, is expected to start favourite. All eyes will be on his jockey Calvin Borel as he goes into the stalls alonside Eldaafer, ridden by Javier Castellano. It was Castellano&apos;s perceived responsibility for A U Miner getting murdered in the straight in this race last year that led to Borel attacking his fellow jockey in the winner&apos;s enclosure with an apparently murderous intent of his own. 12.15pm Good afternoon from Churchill Downs on a simply beautiful autumn afternoon. The trees all down the far side of this historic track are a wild mixture of red, orange and yellow, and the nine Breeders&apos; Cup races on today&apos;s card will be played out in perfect conditions, culminating in the Classic at 7pm local time (11pm in London) under the Louisville light. Both the main track and the turf course are officially riding good and there are no additional scratchings, though Gung Ho had already been ruled out of the Juvenile Turf. It was a clean sweep for American-trained horses on the first day yesterday, but it will be a major disappointment if the Europeans do not get at least a couple on the board today. The Turf and Mile races in particular look ripe for the picking and the anticipation as Goldikova shoots for four-timer glory in the Mile, the penultimate race on the card, will be immense. With So You Think lined up for the Classic \u2013 and I think he has a really good chance if he handles the dirt \u2013 it could be one of those days that people talk about ever after with a misty look in their eyes. The main US contenders for the Classic are Uncle Mo, who has been drifting steadily with British bookies, the filly Havre De Grace and Flat Out, trained by 70-year-old Scooter Dickey, a local legend with a 50-year training career behind him. The British press corps is currently compiling its annual attempt to win the Pick6, which has a guaranteed pool of $2m. Here&apos;s hoping that the results are kind to all of us and, as always, all thoughts, tips and comments are most welcome. It&apos;s going to be a fantastic day&apos;s racing. Tonight&apos;s racecard is here.", "title": "Breeders' Cup 2011 \u2013 live! | Greg Wood", "sentences": ["2.46pm Force Freeze, the Sprint runner-up, was formerly trained in Dubai by Doug Watson and was last of nine under Kieren Fallon there in the Golden Shaheen on World Cup day in March."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-05T16:20:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/06/steve-williams-tiger-woods-racism", "tags": ["Tiger Woods", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "The row over racism switched from China to Australia on Sunday as the sport&apos;s administrators sought to draw a line under the &quot;entirely unacceptable&quot; remarks about Tiger Woods that were made by Steve Williams. The caddie flew to Sydney, where he may well come face to face this week with his former employer and one-time friend. It had been widely speculated that Australia&apos;s Adam Scott, who hired Williams last summer, would ask the caddie to step aside for a few weeks, or at least for as long as it takes the row, one of the most toxic to hit the sport in recent years, to die down. Instead, Scott confirmed that his bagman would be at the Australian Open in Sydney this week and at the Presidents Cup in Melbourne the following week. Woods, whom Williams called a &quot;black arsehole&quot; at an awards ceremony in Shanghai on Friday, is playing in both events. It has been rumoured for weeks that the tournament organisers in Sydney were mischievously planning to pair the two players for the first two rounds at the Lakes course. There is no chance of that happening now \u2013 at least not by design. However Woods and Scott,\u00a0and by extension Williams, could be paired if they shoot matching scores over the first two days of the tournament. There is also a possibility that they will play each other at the Presidents Cup, the biennial match between the United States and an international team. &quot;Could be an interesting dynamic,&quot; Scott said, when asked about the possibility of Williams and Wood spending around four hours in each other&apos;s company on the course. Last Saturday Woods&apos;s agent, Mark Steinberg, described the caddie&apos;s comments as &quot;sad&quot;. The former world No1 will make his own views known on Tuesday morning in Sydney, when he is scheduled to give a press conference. Woods has a long history of shying away from what could be described as &quot;social&quot; issues, preferring to stick to the subject of the game as much as possible. However, the depth of enmity between him and his former caddie has been evident for some time. In the circumstances, he may feel inclined to go beyond a bland statement of regret before signifying a desire to &quot;move on&quot;. Woods&apos;s friend and Presidents Cup captain, Fred Couples, pulled no punches when he was asked about Williams&apos;s remarks. &quot;If that was Joe LaCava [Couples&apos;s long-time caddie, who is now working full-time for Woods] he wouldn&apos;t be caddying for me today,&quot; he told Golf Digest magazine in California, where he is competing in a US PGA Champions Tour event. &quot;If [a caddie] has that kind of anger for a pretty good guy, I don&apos;t want him around me.&quot; Couples was virtually alone in the world of top-class professional golf in suggesting that Williams should face some form of sanction. The US PGA and European Tours have the power to punish any player or caddie deemed to have brought the sport into disrepute, and they frequently use it. In February last year, for instance, the European Tour fined Woods \u00a310,000 for spitting on a green during a tournament in Dubai. The US PGA tour has a policy of never publicising when a player or caddie is punished. However, it is believed that sanctions are imposed with great regularity and range from substantial fines to bans. John Daly, for instance, was suspended from the US PGA Tour for six months in 2008, for a range of offences including public drunkenness and using a beer can to tee up his ball in the pro-am before a tournament in Detroit. Williams conceded in a public apology that his remarks, which were made in front of 200 players, caddies and officials at a &quot;caddie of the year&quot; ceremony, &quot;could be construed as racist&quot; and added: &quot;However, that was not my intent.&quot; Despite this admission, a statement issued jointly by the US PGA and European Tours on Sunday made it clear that Williams will not be punished: &quot;[We feel] strongly there is no place for any form of racism in ours or any other sport. We consider the remarks of Steve Williams, as reported, entirely unacceptable in whatever context. We are aware that he has apologised and we trust we will not hear such remarks again. Based on this, we consider the matter closed.&quot; Scott, speaking after his final round at the HSBC Champions event here, endorsed that statement. When asked if the Tours were &quot;condoning racism&quot; by not taking action against Williams for appearing to bring the sport into disrepute, he said: &quot;Look, I don&apos;t [think] digging for a story out of me on this is a good idea.&quot; The Australian&apos;s desire to move on is understandable \u2013 he is after all caught up a row that is not of his own making \u2013 but his wish for the story to fade away is unlikely to be met in his home country. At least not for the next two weeks.", "title": "Steve Williams heads to Australia as Tiger Woods racism row intensifies", "sentences": ["In February last year, for instance, the European Tour fined Woods \u00a310,000 for spitting on a green during a tournament in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-06T15:27:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/06/qantas-offers-free-flights", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business", "Air transport", "World news", "British Airways", "Willie Walsh", "Ryanair", "Michael O'Leary", "Travel & leisure", "Australia news", "Qantas"], "article": "One of the world&apos;s leading airlines, Qantas Airways, is giving away free tickets in a desperate bid to win back customers hit by its decision to ground the entire fleet of aircraft in the middle of an industrial dispute. Qantas Airways, the Australian carrier which has a business &quot;alliance&quot; with British Airways, said it expected to spend $20m (\u00a312.5m) offering 100,000 return economy flights inside the country or to New Zealand. &quot;This ticket offer is one of a range of initiatives we will be launching as a way of saying sorry as we move forward into this period of stability,&quot; said Alan Joyce, the Qantas chief executive. &quot;Throughout the long period of industrial activity we have been acutely aware of the impact on our customers,&quot; he added saying this was the company&apos;s way of winning back customer loyalty. Qantas grounded its planes to force a resolution to an ongoing dispute with trade unions over pay, conditions and job security. The shutdown stranded tens of thousands of passengers and triggered a political storm. The government under the Welsh-born prime minister Julia Gillard stepped into the dispute and brought in workplace arbitration service, FairWork Australia, which then ordered an end to the industrial action. The airline said it would make further announcements about compensation packages in relation to customers based outside Australia and for members of its frequent flyer programme. The first tranche of free tickets will be available to anyone who was affected by the grounding and Qantas has promised to refund all &quot;reasonable losses&quot; for passengers affected by the drama. The Australian pilots&apos; union claims the airline is losing a &quot;pilot a day&quot; to rivals such as Middle East company, Emirates, and said it would have been &quot;a lot cheaper for them to work with their workforce&quot;. Irish-born Joyce worked at rival carrier Ansett when it collapsed in 2001, costing 17,000 jobs, and told local newspapers that the experience had scarred him: &quot;There were suicides, that was horrendous.&quot; He has been rounded on by politicians and the public alike, with the media dubbing him the nation&apos;s most loathed man, but Joyce said he was sick of what he described as &quot;racist&quot; slurs about his accent and heritage. &quot;I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any difference between attacking somebody because of their Irish accent and attacking someone because of their colour \u2013 they&apos;re all forms of racism,&quot; he said. Joyce is one of a triumvirate of top Irish aviation executives alongside Willie Walsh of BA \u2013 now part of the International Airlines Group (IAG) \u2013 and Michael O&apos;Leary, the boss of Ryanair. The trouble at Qantas is not over yet with the ground staff union saying it is considering a legal challenge to the ban imposed on any further strike action. There have also been technical problems. On Friday the airline was again hit by reliability worries when a flight from Singapore to London was diverted to Dubai after an engine was shut down and the incident occurred almost exactly one year after a mid-air engine explosion forced an emergency landing of a Qantas A380 jet in Singapore. That emergency landing resulted in Qantas yet again grounding for safety checks its entire fleet of A380 aircraft each of which is powered by four Rolls Royce engines. Many airlines around the world are struggling to cope with lower demand at a time of economic uncertainty, high fuel costs and ever increased competition and consolidation of companies continue. Last week Walsh announced his new IAG was forging a deal to buy loss-making bmi \u2013 formerly British Midlands \u2013 from Lufthansa of Germany. He rejected concerns the deal could produce an increase in fares, promising to use bmi&apos;s takeoff and landing slots at London&apos;s Heathrow as bridgeheads to cities in China, Korea, and Vietnam. The planned tie-up has alarmed rival Virgin Atlantic.", "title": "Qantas offers free flights to win back aggrieved passengers", "sentences": ["On Friday the airline was again hit by reliability worries when a flight from Singapore to London was diverted to Dubai after an engine was shut down and the incident occurred almost exactly one year after a mid-air engine explosion forced an emergency landing of a Qantas A380 jet in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-06T15:32:38Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/06/martin-kaymer-shanghai-rory-mcilroy", "tags": ["Golf", "Rory McIlroy", "Martin Kaymer", "Sport", "Luke Donald", "Lee Westwood"], "article": "Rory McIlroy climbed to No2 in the world rankings in Shanghai on Sunday but a\u00a0three-shot victory for Martin Kaymer at the HSBC Champions tournament suggested that the Northern Irishman&apos;s ascent to the top of the sport&apos;s totem pole may not be as straightforward as many assume. Kaymer, a 26-year-old German who was himself briefly No1 earlier this year, produced one of the\u00a0best final rounds of the year, making birdie on nine of the last 12 holes at the Sheshan club for a round\u00a0of 63. That was good enough to overtake the long-time tournament leader, Freddie Jacobson of Sweden, on the back nine. Kaymer finished 20-under par for four rounds. A week after shooting two rounds in the 80s at Valderrama, Spain, Northern Ireland&apos;s Graeme McDowell finished third on 16-under par. The Englishman Paul Casey and South Africa&apos;s Charl Schwartzel, the US Masters champion, finished alongside McIlroy in fourth place. McIlroy&apos;s birdie at the final hole meant that he overtook England&apos;s Lee Westwood in the world rankings, though he remains some way adrift of the current world No1, Luke\u00a0Donald. The US-based Englishman has won four times this year and will be hard\u00a0to shift. Yet McIlroy, who has not finished outside the top 10 in any tournament since the US PGA Championship, is playing to a standard that is worthy of the top spot. On the evidence of Sunday&apos;s play, however, so is Kaymer. The German won last year&apos;s US PGA Championship and followed it with victory in the season-long Race to Dubai. A runner-up finish \u2013 to Donald \u2013 at the Accenture Match Play in Arizona during February gave him the No1 spot. He then embarked on some swing changes which saw his form dip, and by his own admission he struggled to handle the additional demands that come with being the world&apos;s best player. &quot;When I became No1 my life has changed a little bit, not only mine, for the people I work with, my family, and it was a little awkward sometimes because I was just not used to being in the spotlight,&quot; Kaymer said. The upshot was that the expectation that he would remain as world No1 were proved wrong, but Kaymer&apos;s performance here have suggested that his swing changes have taken root. On Sunday , after playing the first six holes to par Kaymer, right, started his charge with a birdie on the 346-yard par-four 7th, where he holed out for birdie from a greenside bunker. He was four behind the leader but it was a deficit that vanished as he reeled off eight birdies in the next 11 holes. His five-shot charge was the largest final-round comeback in the 12-year history of the World Golf Championships and his 63 the lowest final round by a winner. &quot;I just played really good golf and I&apos;m glad that it came together,&quot; he said. &quot;The\u00a0last few weeks I played good golf but it has not happened yet. And this week it was nice that it happened here, the\u00a0World Golf Championship event.&quot; The win lifted Kaymer to No4 in the rankings, which means that European players now occupy the four top spots. It also gave the German an outside chance of overtaking Donald in the Race to Dubai. The Englishman pulled out of the event in Shanghai to await the birth of his second child. &quot;Obviously Luke is a very nice guy and he deserves to be No1 in the world,&quot; Kaymer said. &quot;He deserves to be\u00a0No1 in Europe. It will be difficult [to catch him], but that is what the sport is about, to challenge yourself, challenge the other players that you play with week in, week out. And of course I will try to give him a hard time.&quot;", "title": "Martin Kaymer wins in Shanghai and Rory McIlroy climbs to world No2", "sentences": ["The German won last year&apos;s US PGA Championship and followed it with victory in the season-long Race to Dubai.", "It also gave the German an outside chance of overtaking Donald in the Race to Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-06T18:36:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/07/the-fiver-england-krakow", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "SAUCED-UP ENGLISHMEN &quot;Hahaahahaahahahhahahaahahahahahahahahaahahaahahahhahahahaaha,&quot; wrote Twitter&apos;s Micah Richards on Sunday night, round about the same time it emerged that Fabio Capello had left him out of the England squad and picked Kyle Walker and Glen Johnson instead, and not before assessing how Paul Parker, Rob Jones and George Cohen are getting on.

Alternatively the reason Richards was rolling around as if he&apos;d spent the afternoon watching hit satirical socialite send-up Made in Chelsea was because he&apos;d found out that England will be staying in the 31st best hotel in Krakow at Euro 2012 next summer. This, it appears, is the FA&apos;s attempt to come into line with austerity Britain, after England&apos;s players spent the 2006 World Cup with the Wags in Baden-Baden, Euro 2008 with the Wags on a beach in Dubai and the 2010 World Cup in a Rustenberg enclave which was so remote that no TV and no beer and no Joe Cole and no dentist chairs and no banter made John Terry momentarily mutinous. The Hotel Stary - not, as Tabloid Wayne first assumed, named for its lack of lifts - is located slap bang in the middle of Krakow, next to a shoe shop and right on the main square, perfect for the players to immerse themselves in the local culture, pop out for a coffee, go on a bike tour, take in all the sights, become embroiled in a brawl with some sauced-up Englishmen on a stag do after a tragically inept 0-0 opener with Estonia \u2026 that sort of thing.

The case brought by the Ministry of Defence and Dubai businessman Harvey Boulter against US Post-it note maker 3M ultimately forced Liam Fox, the former defence secretary, to reveal his reliance on Werritty, his best man and firm friend of 13 years. On Monday the judge, Mr Justice Hambleden, ruled in favour of Boulter and MoD in the dispute over the development of MRSA detection technology, called BacLite, which the pair sold to 3M in 2007. The ruling found that 3M was in &quot;material breach of its obligations&quot; and awarded the MoD and Boulter&apos;s private equity firm Porton Group $1.3m (\u00a3800,000) in damages, significantly below the $40m they had sought. The case was discussed at the now infamous meeting between Fox, Werritty and Boulter at a five-star hotel in Dubai this summer. The MoD&apos;s failure to account for that meeting on the 41st floor of the Shangri-la hotel exposed Werritty as Fox&apos;s unofficial adviser and triggered a possible blackmail lawsuit which could involve the former defence secretary giving evidence to a US court. After Monday&apos;s ruling, 3M lawyers repeated the blackmail claims, alleging that Boulter &quot;participated in an illegal campaign to extort more than $34m from 3M to settle the BacLite case prior to a final judgment or else Boulter and [Lanny] Davis would use their influence with recently resigned UK minister for defence Dr Liam Fox to interfere with 3M&apos;s business in the UK&quot;. Davis is Boulter&apos;s legal and PR adviser. 3M claims an email Boulter sent in the middle of the night after the meeting in Dubai on 17 June shows that Boulter threatened to seek Fox&apos;s help to have what he described as the &quot;rather embarrassing situation&quot; of a knighthood awarded to 3M&apos;s British-born chief executive Sir George Buckley discussed by the cabinet. In the email, Boulter suggested that a settlement &quot;at a headline of $30m-plus will allow MoD to internally save face&quot;. William Brewer, a partner at Bickel &amp; Brewer and counsel for 3M, said: &quot;With the London matter now successfully resolved, 3M is anxious to press forward with its claims against Mr Boulter and his affiliates. &quot;In our view, the judgment in London demonstrates that Mr Boulter and others clearly were not entitled to the tens of millions of dollars that they sought from 3M.&quot; Boulter said he would call both Fox and Werritty as witnesses if and when 3M&apos;s claims reach court. &quot;We have got to get at the dark heart of the business and politics of lobbying,&quot; Boulter said. &quot;They are going to be forced to tell us the truth.&quot; 3M&apos;s lawyers are also considering calling Fox to give evidence in the case currently pending in Washington DC. A trial could start as early as next year. Boulter and Davis deny the allegations. With reference to the BacLite case, Boulter said: &quot;I am delighted that we have been vindicated in our attempt to force 3M to face up to their responsibilities. But the victims here are those infected with MRSA. A weapon in that fight was wrongfully abandoned by 3M. &quot;This is a question of trust and honour which in my opinion seems to have been sadly lacking in 3M&apos;s behaviour. The judge has made it quite clear that 3M did not live up to its promises.&quot; 3M bought BacLite for \u00a310m with an agreement for further payments of up to \u00a341m depending on sales performance. The technology was originally developed by the MoD&apos;s science and technology laboratory at a cost of \u00a315m. As it stands, having earned \u00a35m from Ploughshare&apos;s half of the sale price, the taxpayer has been left \u00a310m out of pocket. It comes as one of Werritty&apos;s financial backers prepares to hand the police new evidence that he claims proves Fox&apos;s best friend and self-styled adviser duped him into handing over money. Jon Moulton, a multimillionaire venture capitalist who donated \u00a335,000 to the &quot;slush fund&quot; set up to support Werritty&apos;s jetset lifestyle, has told the Guardian he will provide the police with documents proving he was misled by Werritty. Werritty is not among those who has been interviewed by police, his lawyer said on Friday. &quot;Adam has not been contacted by the police, and it follows that he has not been interviewed by them,&quot; said the lawyer. &quot;I can add that he has also not been asked to provide a written statement to the police, nor has he done so voluntarily.&quot;", "title": "Judge rules on case that exposed Liam Fox and Adam Werritty friendship", "sentences": ["The case brought by the Ministry of Defence and Dubai businessman Harvey Boulter against US Post-it note maker 3M ultimately forced Liam Fox, the former defence secretary, to reveal his reliance on Werritty, his best man and firm friend of 13 years.", "The case was discussed at the now infamous meeting between Fox, Werritty and Boulter at a five-star hotel in Dubai this summer.", "3M claims an email Boulter sent in the middle of the night after the meeting in Dubai on 17 June shows that Boulter threatened to seek Fox&apos;s help to have what he described as the &quot;rather embarrassing situation&quot; of a knighthood awarded to 3M&apos;s British-born chief executive Sir George Buckley discussed by the cabinet."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-07T17:07:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/09/fsa-fines-dubai-investor-four-million", "tags": ["Financial Services Authority (FSA)", "Regulators", "Financial sector", "London Stock Exchange", "Business"], "article": "The Financial Services Authority has imposed its biggest-ever fine on an individual, ordering a Dubai-based investor to pay \u00a36m for market abuse in a case involving Reliance Industries, the Indian conglomerate. Rameshkumar Goenka manipulated the closing share price of Reliance on the London Stock Exchange in 2010, as part of a ruse to avoid losing nearly \u00a32m. The 66-year-old trader had acquired an investment product from an unnamed European bank that paid out if Reliance&apos;s shares reached a pre-determined level by a certain date. But when the investment looked as if it would go sour, Goenka swung into action. According to the FSA &quot;[he] had arranged for a pre-planned series of substantial and carefully timed orders to be placed in the final seconds of the LSE&apos;s closing auction. &quot;Goenke held an over-the-counter structured product which matured on 18\u00a0October 2010 and for which the payout depended on the closing price of Reliance securities on that day.&quot; His action resulted in the shares rising in the final minutes of trading, allowing him to avoid significant losses. The FSA ordered him to remit \u00a32m to the bank and fined him a further \u00a34m. The fine would have been even higher, \u00a37.7m, had Goenke not settled early and benefited from a 30% discount. Tracey McDermott, acting director of enforcement and financial crime at the FSA, said: &quot;Goenka&apos;s structured product was an investment that would have made him a considerable profit had it been successful. When he saw that it was not going to produce the desired result, Goenka manipulated the market to avoid a substantial loss. &quot;The impact of such behaviour goes far beyond one counterparty. Market confidence will suffer if participants cannot be satisfied that the price of quoted securities reflects the proper interplay of supply and demand.&quot; Although Reliance&apos;s main listing is in India, the company&apos;s global depository receipts are traded internationally. The fine, about two and half times higher than the previous record, is one of the first to reflect the FSA&apos;s tougher penalty policy adopted last year, whereby punishments reflect the level of profit that wrongdoers seek for personal gain. Harvey Knight, a lawyer at Withers, which was not involved in the case, told Bloomberg that in the wake of the financial crisis, the FSA had increasingly directed its attention &quot;against individuals rather institutions. This is a real statement of intent by the FSA,&quot; said Knight. Goenka&apos;s lawyer, Stephen Gentle said Goenka &quot;doesn&apos;t accept that he&apos;s committed intentional market abuse. He was hedging a position on which he was running a significant risk. Obviously hedging activity is not unlawful, and in his view, he was simply doing what banks do every day of the week.&quot; The FSA claimed Goenka had planned a similar scam against Gazprom, but for &quot;circumstantial reasons,&quot; he wasn&apos;t able to pull it off.", "title": "FSA hits Dubai-based investor with \u00a34m fine", "sentences": ["The Financial Services Authority has imposed its biggest-ever fine on an individual, ordering a Dubai-based investor to pay \u00a36m for market abuse in a case involving Reliance Industries, the Indian conglomerate."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-09T17:30:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/10/foreign-office-strange-requests", "tags": ["UK news"], "article": "Want to know the size of Prince Charles&apos;s feet, where to have Christmas lunch or how to stop the buzzing noise in your apartment?

Years of maltreatment and neglect at the hands of the Sana&apos;a government had left many in Yemen&apos;s south querying the value of the 1990 merger between the then Marxist-led south and the tribal-dominated north. Now, with President Ali Abdullah Saleh&apos;s armed forces battling renegade soldiers and tribal militias in Sana&apos;a, the separatists are seizing the opportunity of a weakened central government to try to see through their claim to independence. In the southern port city of Aden, a former British colony built in the dusty crevices of an extinct volcano, the Hirak, who for years bristled at the region&apos;s marginalisation under northern rule, have emerged from the shadows. Bus stops draped in the blue, red, and white flags of the former socialist republic of South Yemen and kitted out with amplifiers have been transformed into makeshift protest stages and podiums for the delivery of defiant &quot;anti-unity&quot; speeches. In the suburbs, abandoned government buildings overlook alleys strewn with shattered paving slabs and heaps of smouldering rubbish, ominous reminders of the running street battles between separatist demonstrators and security forces that still haunt the city. Even the hoarding showing the president outside the airport has not survived the Hirak&apos;s blitzkrieg. &quot;Get out Ali, you dog, free the south!&quot; is scrawled in thick red paint across the ruler&apos;s eyes. Years of intimidation, floggings and midnight arrests by the regime&apos;s secret police had forced most of the Hirak&apos;s leadership abroad or underground. Now they move freely about the city, organising weekly rallies and holding round-table discussions in coffee shops and restaurants. &quot;The regime is expending all its firepower on the north,&quot; said Mohammed Omar Ahmed Jubran, an elderly Hirak leader, addressing a group of youth activists in a ramshackle tea shop in downtown Aden. &quot;We must seize this opportunity to regain our rights.&quot; Though the south is home to only a fifth of Yemen&apos;s 22 million people, it generates the majority of the impoverished Arab country&apos;s wealth. Up to 80% of oil production comes from the south, along with its fisheries and Aden&apos;s port and refinery. But southerners claim they have lost out since unity both in terms of access to local power and jobs \u2013 the governors of all seven southern provinces are from the north \u2013 and as a result of systematic land grabs by well-connected northerners. &quot;How is that a northern sheikh can own a farm in the south that is bigger than Dubai, while an ordinary southern citizen cannot find 15 square metres to build a house on?&quot; said Mohammed Al-Azaadi, a final year medical student at Aden university. &quot;They have looted the foundations of our state. Now all we have left now is our blood.&quot; Others lament the loss of the liberal culture that once pervaded Aden, blaming this on an infiltration of conservative Islam from the north. Adeni women say they had better access to education and jobs before unity. Others voice bitterness over rigid dress codes imposed by Islamists who gained influence after the 1994 civil war. &quot;In the 80s women and men here reached greater equality than many parts of Europe,&quot; said Raqiya Homeidan, 66, an outspoken defender of women&apos;s rights and the first woman in the Arabian Peninsula to become a practising lawyer. &quot;Now we&apos;ve gone back a century.&quot; The advent of Egyptian-inspired protests in February saw flurries of co-operation between protesters in the north and south. Both agreed to raise neither the Southern nor the Yemeni flag during demonstrations in order not to fracture opposition voices and undermine the immediate goal of regime change. But euphoria has given way to disenchantment. Many southerners are convinced that the Islamist-dominated opposition are more interested in its own political ambitions than addressing their popular grievances. &quot;They [the opposition] do not recognise our struggle as a political one. They speak about us as if we are an inconvenience not an independence movement,&quot; said Saleh Bin Farid Al-Awlaki, a prominent southern sheikh and wealthy businessman backing the secessionists. But the south now has religious radicals of its own to contend with. Thousands of refugees have fled Islamist militants who have captured cities in the neighbouring province of Abyan. Packed into the dingy classrooms of primary schools across Aden, they recall with terror the sight of the self-described &quot;guardians of Islam&quot; overrunning cities and plundering weapons factories after a swift retreat by army forces. But some accuse Saleh of deliberately fomenting conflict in Abyan in order to make the south seem unworthy of statehood. The southern movement still lacks unity, strong leadership and international support, said Prof Abdul Faqih, a professor of politics at Sana&apos;a University. &quot;But this problem is not about to go away.

Confirmation of the delay comes despite fears expressed by leading England figures \u2013 including the coach, Andy Flower, and the captain, Andrew Strauss \u2013 that Test cricket could face irreversible decline unless it is urgently given more relevance. A postponement was first signalled after an ICC board meeting in Dubai last month because the rights holder, ESPN Star Sports, did not see the World Test Championship, a play-off involving the top four ranked countries, as financially viable and resisted attempts to schedule it instead of the little-loved 50-over Champions Trophy. The contract with ESPN Star Sports runs until the end of the World Cup in 2015 and contracts with sponsors also proved to be a stumbling block. Lorgat admitted during a one-day international match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Dubai that there was no rescue plan. &quot;I am afraid that [the World Test Championship] is no longer going to happen in 2013,&quot; he said. &quot;We attempted to switch the Champions Trophy to become a Test Championship but that is not going to be possible.&quot; Test cricket is suffering from falling crowds in many parts of the world and India&apos;s long-term commitment to the five-day game is viewed uncertainly.

Oil companies, and their lawyers, have kept a close eye on Libya&apos;s vast reserves, which accounted for more than 95% of the country&apos;s exports before the popular uprising against former dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Nuri Berruien, head of Libya&apos;s National Oil Company, said that the country&apos;s government would &quot;favour our friends&quot; when awarding new contracts to its 46bn barrels of untapped oil reserves \u2013 the largest in Africa and eighth largest in the world. But he said it was unlikely that any new contracts would be granted before an elected government takes over from the NTC. The transitional government has said existing contracts with oil firms, including BP, Shell, Eni and Total, will be honoured unless it finds evidence of corruption in the awarding of the contracts under the former regime. Berruien said Libya&apos;s daily oil production, which stands at 600,000 barrels, is expected to hit 800,000 by the end of the year and return to pre-war levels of 1.6m by the end of 2012. Virtually all of Libya&apos;s oil is exported. Representatives of international oil groups were told the best way to exploit Libya&apos;s oil wealth is to go into partnership with a local operator.

The decision, taken by the IMF&apos;s board on Monday night, to reinstate its programme in Afghanistan brought to an end a bitter 18-month dispute and reopened the doors to vital foreign cash donations, on which the country is utterly reliant. Major donors, including the Department for International Development and the World Bank, had suspended funds for almost a year while the IMF remained dissatisfied with the response to the banking crisis. Zakhilwal said the decision marked the &quot;end of a difficult ordeal we had with our donors&quot; that would allow him to focus on recovering missing assets to repay the $825m (\u00a3520bn) Afghanistan was forced to borrow from its own foreign reserves last year to prop up the fraud-tainted bank. But so far only $75m in cash has been recovered, an amount almost wiped out by additional losses uncovered in recent months by international auditors. Officials say that in addition to the small amount recovered so far, assets worth $150m have been surrendered while an additional $250m of assets have been identified. Zakhilwal said he expected $600m would ultimately be recovered. &quot;We know the international community has its doubts but we will prove them wrong,&quot; he said. His target is ambitious figure given the extraordinary complexity of the task in a country severely lacking in the necessary legal expertise. Kabul Bank&apos;s own paperwork often gives no information as to who took out money. Many borrowers are identified as either &quot;unknown&quot; or, in some cases, &quot;Kaka jan&quot;, an Afghan term of endearment meaning &quot;dear uncle&quot;. There are also doubts whether the Dubai villas on the man-made Palm Jumeirah peninsula bought with proceeds from the scandal will ever be seized. It is feared that many are mired in negative equity and therefore worthless to Kabul Bank&apos;s receivers. Also, there are concerns that pressure may now come off the most well-connected beneficiaries of the bank&apos;s interest-free largesse, not least as the loans often benefited some of the most important people in the country, including Mahmoud Karzai, a brother of the Afghan president. The restrictions on former Kabul Bank chairman Sherkhan Farnood, and former chief executive Khalilullah Ferozi, already appear to have eased. They were arrested and imprisoned this summer, but recently have moved to a day release schedule, and have even been seen eating in Kabul&apos;s only five-star hotel. In June Ferozi told the Guardian that he would not co-operate on asset recovery if he was convicted of a crime. And in an email sent at about the same time, Farnood threatened to reveal &quot;many cases and documents regarding Mr Mahmood Karzai and Karzai&apos;s family and their businesses&quot;. &quot;Mr Hamid Karzai [knew] about these problems and deliberately did not assist to resolve, I believe he has political and financial interest,&quot; he wrote.", "title": "Afghan finance minister admits doubts over Kabul Bank's missing $1bn", "sentences": ["Serious doubts remain that Afghanistan will be able to recover nearly $1bn (\u00a3631.4m)frittered away on disastrous business ventures and now worthless Dubai properties by the disgraced former owners of Kabul Bank, the country&apos;s finance minister has said.", "There are also doubts whether the Dubai villas on the man-made Palm Jumeirah peninsula bought with proceeds from the scandal will ever be seized."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-15T18:14:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/nov/17/introducing-guardian-world-cricket-forum", "tags": ["Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "The Manor House, Uphill-into-the-Wind Inextricably linked as it is with the old British empire, the sun never seems to set on an international cricket match, never mind cricket of any sort. Someone somewhere, as Matthew Engel, once of this parish, once said, is hitting Vic Marks for six. Or at least his tweaking successors. A quick glance on Cricinfo tells me that there is a Test match just finished in Kolkata, one starting in Johannesburg where Australia will be trying to regain some esteem in the face of their Cape Town humiliation, and on Friday, another ODI in Dubai, between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, cricket&apos;s Flying Dutchmen (if the Dutch themselves aren&apos;t to be considered that). In addition, there is domestic cricket being played in Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and South Africa. There may be no England cricket, but there is an awful lot happening beyond that. The thing is this though. Working for the Guardian generally means an inevitable fact that, primarily, cricket coverage will tend towards the Anglocentric. And if this is the case, it becomes easy to ignore the rest of the world. Patently this is wrong, for several reasons. Firstly, my own experience, when budgets weren&apos;t tighter than Dale Steyn&apos;s line to Philip Hughes, of covering series neutral to me, as an impartial observer, have produced if not the best written copy, then some wonderful stories: the drama of West Indies&apos; one-run win in Adelaide followed by Curtly&apos;s seven for one spell in Perth, for example; or Australia&apos;s historic toppling of West Indies in the Caribbean; the match between Pakistan and West Indies in Trinidad that saw a world record 17 lbws, almost half of which were given by Dickie Bird; and West Indies (again: I&apos;m not totally daft) dismantling of South Africa in Bridgetown in the first ever meeting between the sides. But secondly, we now recognise that the advent of the internet, and in particular this organisation&apos;s website, means that coverage need no longer be parochial. Even the gentle cosiness of our award-winning county blog brings readers and, specifically, comments from around the world. Mention India, and, even more so, Sachin, and we can go into meltdown. Our OBO coverage sets standards unmatched anywhere. By and large, the comments online are civilised, informed, offer viewpoints from all angles, and, well, good fun. Personally, having once been a sceptic (perhaps on the back of some of the comments on football blogs) I am an enthusiastic addict. In the two-month absence of any England cricket, I don&apos;t know about you, but I feel bereft. So today we hope to begin the process of addressing that. This is intended to be a blog that is global in nature and weekly in output. It will consist of a short themed piece above the line, perhaps outlining the coming week, and then daily updated news stories intended as a catalyst for discussion. Then, having lit the blue touchpaper, we shall retire (above the line although not below, of course) and watch the discussion flow. Imagine, as someone said recently on here, a civilised dinner party conversation rather than the bear pit of a political rally. It is a forum for cricket friends around the world, a meeting place if you will. There is no name for this blog yet, and we hope that in the spirit of things, someone out there will come up with something that will ring the gong (if it was hits we were after pure and simple we would just call it Sachin Retires). Although the main piece above the line will remain weekly, we intend to refresh the news element of the page each day, late-morning GMT. We look forward to being advised of any direction we might take that we have missed. It may take a few goes to get the feel for this, but for my part I cannot wait for the banter again. Oh and by the way, I have a fantastic new way with lamb shanks. Watch this space.

No, not The Dark Knight Rises or The Amazing Spider-Man, silly. It&apos;s the \u2026 ahem \u2026 fourth Mission: Impossible film. What&apos;s that you say? Nobody&apos;s interested in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol \u2013 the umpteenth instalment of this shonky spy series? Not even when it&apos;s got global megastar Tom Cruise in it? Don&apos;t you even want to know how many times the various agents and counter-agents rip their latex faces off to reveal their true identities this time around? No? You are hard work. And probably not alone. It may prove a difficult mission to build buzz for a belated sequel no one saw coming and few clamoured for. But if the movie does turn out to be a box-office flop, that would be rather a pity. This is a series which is getting better with age, and there are indications that the new film might be the best instalment yet. MI4 sees Cruise and his team &quot;disavowed&quot; (read: outlawed) by the US authorities after the Kremlin is blown up while our hero, Ethan Hunt, happens to be on an undercover mission in Moscow. The crew have to find the true identity of the bombers while steering clear of the US and Russian agents who are out to put them in an early grave, and they don&apos;t even have the support of Mission: Impossible HQ. So a bit like the first film, then. If you&apos;re not a fan of big-budget action adventure, you&apos;re probably only reading this post hoping for the chance to have a laugh at Cruise&apos;s expense. If so, let me direct you straight to the comments section below, for you&apos;ll find nothing here that denigrates the great man. In Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol (presumably someone thought that Mission: Impossible: Ghost Protocol was one too many colons) Cruise is magnificent, the epitome of manly cool. He climbs up impossibly tall glass buildings (specifically the needle-like Burj Khalifa building in Dubai), smashes his way through glass panes at 6,000 ft and then, just when we think he&apos;s done more than enough to justify the price of entry, runs straight down said building in a sort of reverse abseil that surely defies the laws of gravity and creaky 49-year-old limbs. When this film was still a twinkle in the eye of director Brad Bird (he did The Incredibles with Pixar, you know), talk was that Ghost Protocol might see Cruise stepping aside as the series&apos; main man to allow co-star Jeremy Renner to take over the franchise. Not if the scenes we saw this morning are anything to go by. Cruise is centre-stage throughout, though Simon Pegg, Renner and another new arrival, Paula Patton, seem to be getting more dialogue than I remember from the participants in previous instalments. In fact, there&apos;s altogether more chat going on in between the explosions. One of this series&apos; constant failings has always been its gaping plot-holes: Bird and his team have discovered a wonderful way to cover these up in Ghost Protocol: the MI team simply chat them away. At one point Renner asks Cruise why he decided on a particularly spurious decoy ploy which allows the pair to miraculously escape an ambush by machine-gun-toting bad guys. Cruise replies, more or less, that machine-gun-toting bad guys are really not all that bright and will fire at the first thing you put in front of their faces. This is better than completely unexplained plot-holes, though not by much. This series (particularly the worst instalment, John Woo&apos;s Mission: Impossible II) has been largely ruined by its insistence on everyone involved ripping their latex faces off (latex faces which shortly earlier looked just like normal faces, and in fact were normal faces) every five seconds. Only one person rips their latex face off in the scenes we saw this morning, which was something of a blessed relief. There could still be more to come of course \u2013 I&apos;m quietly hoping for a sort of Spike Jonze/Charlie Kaufman take in which everybody rips their faces off at the same time and it is revealed that all the characters are in fact Tom Cruise, grinning toothily at each other as the credits roll.

That will have pricked Bloomberg&apos;s technocratic vanity, yet there he is, three months away from his 70th birthday and worth approximately $19.5bn, ordering his police chief, Ray Kelly, who has already hit 70 but is still, incidentally, a familiar figure on the Manhattan party circuit, to unleash a shocking level of force against young people who were simply agitating for a better economic system, more equity and transparency. It is not a good look in a country where, as Joseph Stiglitz revealed in Vanity Fair, 1% of the population now takes nearly 25% of the nation&apos;s income. Justly or not, Bloomberg will be lumped with that international class of rich, often kleptomaniac, elderly men who have been brought down or who are looking shaky as demands for reform circle the world in what I believe to be a surge of optimism and, crucially, reason. The Age of Downfalls, inaugurated when the 74-year-old President Ben Ali of Tunisia flew into exile and a coma, has claimed a surprising number of his generation. And it&apos;s not just the toppling of tyrants such as Ben Ali, the 83-year-old former President Mubarak of Egypt, or the 69-year-old Muammar Gaddafi, but also the demise of such men as Silvio Berlusconi (75), the former head of the IMF Dominique Strauss Khan (62) and the variety of threats faced by many Middle Eastern leaders, Rupert Murdoch (80) and the president of Fifa, Sepp Blatter (75). Obviously, the same forces are not responsible for each man&apos;s troubles, but a year ago each of them seemed bombproof. We had no inkling that the world was about to be remade in such astonishingly short order; that history would decide, for whatever reason, that these men have had their time and the pathetic fiction of the dictator&apos;s hair dye would no longer work. If neutrinos can travel the length of Italy faster than the speed of light, calling into question our most fundamental assumptions about the universe, just about anything can happen. One of the important traits of the Age of Downfalls is the exposure of myths and lies, a characteristic established in its initial months last winter by Wikileaks, which told us how things really were \u2013 that Saudi Arabia urged the US to bomb Iran; that the CIA tried to collect the UN general secretary&apos;s DNA; that China ordered the hacking of Google; that Ben Ali&apos;s family were looting Tunisia. Much more has followed \u2013 a proper understanding of Greece&apos;s fraudulent application to join the euro; the revelations about oil companies owned by the Koch brothers paying for inaccurate and misleading information on climate change; the relentless uncovering of News International&apos;s evasions about hacking and police corruption; the protests when China started burying the wreckage of a train crash; and the exposure of the hopeful falsehood of the euro project, which suggests countries with widely varying economic performance and different cultures can unite in a single currency. Whether through the market or the media, the internet or the instincts of the masses, truth has become the revolutionary weapon in the Age of Downfalls. That is surely a cause for optimism. Indeed, the reason for hope is reason itself. Across the world, millions have demonstrated for fairness and enlightenment values. The chants of young people that echoed through the cities of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Dubai, Syria, Greece, Spain, Italy, Israel, Chile, America and Britain are very similar \u2013 they are about freedom, self-determination, fairness, justice, access to education and jobs, as well as the corruption, mismanagement and greed of their elders. In Burma, demand for reforms have led to Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s announcement that she will stand in the next election. Even in Pakistan, a country generally regarded as beyond repair, Imran Khan&apos;s recent rally in Lahore struck the familiar notes of the Arab Spring. According to Tariq Ali in the London Review of Books, Khan&apos;s limited programme to end corruption, institute a strict tax regime, restore public services and terminate the servile relationship with the US was cheered as loudly by &quot;young women in jeans and T-shirts\u2026 as those in hijabs&quot;. It is now possible to believe that Khan and Suu Kyi may both end up bringing a very different eye to the government of their peoples. Reason has not won the battle against mythomaniac religions and greedy interests, particularly with the right of American politics, which embraces both these menaces as an article of national pride. Yet something deep and impressive is going on in the new generation, who have come of age. it seems. with an almost innate understanding of justice and fairness, and are \u2013 significantly \u2013 managing their religious convictions in the context of wanting improved societies. Barely a week has gone by this year when I have not thrilled at the turn of events and pinched myself at some new surprise. A small example is the latest crime survey for the US, released by the FBI in the summer. Murder, rape, robbery and other serious crimes have fallen to a 48-year low. The murder rate has halved and robberies are down 10%, following an 8% fall in 2009. Canada shows the same fall (without locking up the vast numbers the US has) and England and Wales recorded an overall drop of 4%, with violence causing injury and firearms offences both down by 9%. We are perhaps better than we know, or at least better than governments give us credit for. The key question seems to be this: will all the hopes of the year evaporate as we revert to type? Are we basically limited by human nature? Recent Swiss research published by the New Scientist suggests that each of us is programmed to behave like Ben Ali or Putin, or the corporate monsters, Berlusconi and Murdoch. If a person is given power over people and has more to gain from underhand dealings, abuse almost always follows. Yet research shows that a very few individuals will defy the pattern and set an example and that culture and institutions restrict corruption and the abuse of power. That is the vital point: millions are calling not just for fairness and justice, but a reform of the institutions that will guard against the crimes and corruption of the few against the many. This is an amazingly important step for humanity and it is one of the reasons that despite the sense of impending crisis, I take heart from the Age of Downfalls.", "title": "Odd as it may seem, 2011 is proving to be a year of rebirth | Henry Porter", "sentences": ["The chants of young people that echoed through the cities of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Dubai, Syria, Greece, Spain, Italy, Israel, Chile, America and Britain are very similar \u2013 they are about freedom, self-determination, fairness, justice, access to education and jobs, as well as the corruption, mismanagement and greed of their elders."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-20T00:02:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/20/barry-hills-happy-with-skulduggery", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Hills happy with some skulduggery The British Horseracing Authority week issued updates on a number of outstanding cases in an apparent bid to stem criticism that investigations take too long to complete.

One speaker, the famous breeder Arthur Hancock, claimed that on most racecourses in America 100% of the horses will run on the painkiller bute and 85-90% on the anti-bleeding drug lasix, both of which have been made illegal in most countries, including across Europe.

As I watch the city of Homs (where many of my school friends have been bombed in their gracious homes or killed in a Syrian city renowned for its fabulous sense of humour and its delicious cheese kunafa) turned into a latter-day Grozny, I curse Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, for helping in its wanton destruction, as he uses his veto to protect murderers, and supplies submarines and state-of-the-art weapons to kill yet more innocent Syrians. We Syrians recognise the type only too well. Vainglorious, brooking no dissent, buoyed up by financial mafias and laying on putrid cold war rhetoric, which leaves us even colder. Even the affluent neighbourhoods of Damascus are trembling from the onset of winter, because heating fuel has become as scarce as freedom; the regime&apos;s thugs have monopolised its use and are hoarding it, to give the soft, conservative capital a small taste of the discomforts and disasters for which it should brace itself if it joins the rest of the country in revolt \u2013 which it is already doing. Rebellious Mu&apos;adamiyya on the outskirts of Damascus, where most of the city&apos;s day labour comes from, has had no electricity or fuel for months, and has seen its impoverished houses emptied of their menfolk, as they are rounded up and taken away to join the 40,000 disappeared or 4,600 dead across the country. I, for one, can remember a Syria where we bought lupins or myrrh incense or green almonds in our sublime ancient souks, unbothered by the big brother stare of endless Assads; a Syria where religion was still safely lodged in the house where it belonged, along with the wine-coloured prayer rug, the amber rosary and the manuscript Qur&apos;an on its mussadaf stand. A Syria before Jamil Assad \u2013 Bashar&apos;s uncle \u2013 allowed Iranian officials to enter our borders gleefully with their sackfuls of cash to recompense conversions. In our recent misery, we have seen Revolutionary Guards aiding and abetting Assad&apos;s torturers and snipers, and Iranian oil and money \u2013 needed far more in Iran by its long-suffering people who, like us, must bear the keen whip of totalitarianism and the innumerable privations of grave economic crisis \u2013 flowing in to succour Tehran&apos;s political extension in Damascus. A military airport has sprung up on our Syrian coast, financed by Iran, to ease the flying in of those who would sow sectarian discord and hatred by such methods. The consequences of 40 years of the policies of Hafez al-Assad and then his son Bashar \u2013 which turned our national army into a sectarian mafia family&apos;s private militia, and our state&apos;s coffers into that family&apos;s piggy bank to be raided at whim \u2013 have been the tit-for-tat sectarian crime that has so revolted the vast majority of Syrians, who have seen post-occupation Iraq martyred by sectarian killing fields, and the government of Lebanon become hostage to an armed state within a state.

For the Tottenham Hotspur manager, though, there is no substitute for Premier League passions. Back in his natural habitat after a near three-week period of enforced rest, he watched his team climb to the heights of third place after this dismantling of Aston Villa. Redknapp seemed determined to remain low-key, to internalise his emotions. When Emmanuel Adebayor scored his second goal of the evening Redknapp applauded and, almost nonchalantly, turned and strolled towards his bench, hands thrust deep into his coat. His assistant, Joe Jordan, supplied the touchline histrionics. In his quiet way, though, Redknapp could revel in a command performance, which suggested that Tottenham are a decent bet for Champions League qualification. The pleasure was intensified by seeing Gareth Bale rip Villa apart. Defenders might have been massed against him but it did not matter. Adebayor supplied the cutting edge yet Bale offered the thrills, in front of the Villa-supporting prime minister David Cameron. It was no fun for him. For Redknapp, though, the return to normality was beautiful. He has been uncomfortable at the attention that has accompanied his health scare and has consistently attempted to play down the surgery&apos;s severity. He would point out that there were seriously ill people in the hospital beds beside him and it was typical of him to devote more of his programme notes to the Tickets for Troops initiative, which the club is supporting, than to the beating of his ticker. Redknapp had felt shortness of breath during one of his sessions on the treadmill at home in Dorset and, after a consultation with the Tottenham doctor, he was admitted for the procedure that did not require a general anaesthetic. He was discharged 36 hours later and he was up and about shortly afterwards, taking the bulldogs out and getting under the feet of his wife. He did not ask for his doctor&apos;s permission to return. He had Sandra&apos;s. Redknapp admitted that he found it &quot;more stressful&quot; to watch his team&apos;s away win at Fulham on television and he had stewed away from the club, enjoying a short break in Dubai but generally bouncing off the walls. He saw his squad again only at the pre-match meal in the White Hart Lane&apos;s players&apos; lounge and his arrival in the dug-out drew the lenses of the photographers, who looked a little miffed to have the first and fourth battalions of the Rifles regiment crowding their shots. The soldiers had led the teams out of the tunnel before filing along the touchline. There is something about a game under the lights at the Lane and Tottenham approached this one with form and attacking momentum behind them. Alex McLeish had made his priority clear when he named six defenders in Villa&apos;s starting line-up but Adebayor was given the freedom of the six-yard box to open the scoring in acrobatic style. Redknapp did not celebrate. He is not one for grandstanding. But he enjoyed that magical surge of emotion. Redknapp often says that he loves watching his team play. There are few more exhilarating sights in the English game than that of Bale leading a charge and there is a slickness and invention about Tottenham&apos;s passing and movement. There has been plenty made of the notion that Redknapp is Fabio Capello&apos;s successor-in-waiting but he would not leave Tottenham lightly. One suspects he would relish the invitation to manage England more than the reality. There was more to test Redknapp&apos;s cool in the second half, particularly Adebayor&apos;s gilt-edged one-on-one miss on 53 minutes. But the dramas were in front of the Villa goal rather than at the other end, where Ledley King was imperious.

Simple in appearance, tires are sophisticated products. Tire manufacture involves a complex blend of materials and assembly processes to produce the thousands of different products used on equipment ranging from bicycles to huge earthmovers. Tire industry leaders recognise that there are both opportunities and challenges associated with tire manufacturing processes, on the one hand, and sustainable development, on the other. Tire company CEOs recently announced results from an international research project studying the potential environmental and health impacts of tire materials and tire and road wear particles. The research shows that there are no adverse effects from inhalation exposures to tire and road wear particles; and that the concentration of tire and road wear particles in air and sediment were well below toxicity levels. The CEOs formed the Tire Industry Project (Tip) in 2005. Working under the umbrella of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), Tip&apos;s goal is to identify and address the potential health and environmental impacts of materials associated with tiremaking and use. Tip represents approximately 70% of the world&apos;s tire manufacturing capacity.\u00a0 After Tip&apos;s creation, a multi-year research program was initiated to examine issues related to materials used in tire manufacturing, and to examine the fate and impacts of tire and road wear particles (TRWP) generated during normal product use. Tip retained ChemRisk, a San Francisco, California based risk assessment consultant, to assist with this work. Following extensive toxicity testing of TRWP in water and sediment, additional testing on airborne TRWP has now been completed. These tests showed no adverse effects from inhalation exposure to the TRWP. Environmental sampling for TRWP was conducted globally including locations on the Seine River in France; Chesapeake Bay in the United States; and the Yodo River in Japan. The research showed the concentrations of TRWP in air and sediment were low and do not pose a health or environmental risk. Recently, the CEOs also approved the development of an industry-specific best-practices guide for the research, development and industrialisation of new nanomaterials. The CEOs have high expectations that the development of new nanomanterials in tires will benefit customers and the environment, and understand the need to ensure that any nanomaterial use is safe for humans and the environment. Potential improvements from new nanomaterials include increased car and truck fuel efficiency and durability, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions and tire weight. Tip is exploring the development of this guide in collaboration with the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). Tip has previously published information on international end-of-life tire (ELT) management, and has worked with tire industry associations to develop a manual for effective ELT management systems, released in 2010. This manual, endorsed by the Tip CEOs, is built on experiences in countries and regions where ELT management systems are in place, and has been actively distributed within the Tip companies and through national tire manufacturers&apos; trade associations. Tip is also actively involved in promoting effective ELT management in countries around the world. By taking an early look at industry issues, Tip works to more fully understand environmental and health challenges pertinent to the tire industry, and formulate an approach for making the industry more sustainable.

Mehdi Rafsanjani Hashemi, undertaking a doctorate on Iran&apos;s constitution, was found liable in absentia by a Canadian court for imprisoning and torturing a rival in the 1990s. Ontario&apos;s superior court of justice ordered Hashemi, fourth son of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran&apos;s president from 1989 to 1997, to pay total damages of \u00a33.7m to Houshang Bouzari and his family. Bouzari told the Oxford Student newspaper that it was &quot;beyond redemption&quot; that Oxford was &quot;ignorant&quot; of Hashemi&apos;s role as a &quot;torturer&apos;s accomplice&quot;. In August the court ordered Hashemi to pay \u00a32.1m to Bouzari, a Canadian citizen jailed for seven months in Iran in 1993 after he refused to pay $50m to Hashemi, then a director of the Iran&apos;s national oil company. The court also ordered him to pay millions to compensate Bouzari&apos;s family. Bouzari said: &quot;I had a $1.8bn contract, 28 people on my staff, big oil companies behind me. All of a sudden I have nothing. Their first goal was to remove me from the contract so Mehdi could move in and have it,&quot; he told the Walrus magazine in 2004. On Wednesday representatives of the Ontario court attempted to serve papers; Hashemi travels frequently to Dubai, and they could not find him, but papers were put in his pigeonhole and a copy handed to a representative of Oxford&apos;s vice-chancellor, Professor Andrew Hamilton. In a statement to the Guardian via email , Hashemi said: &quot;I learned about a judgment in absentia, in a proceeding that I did not get the chance to defend myself, through [a] Sunday Times article. I wonder why I was not served or contacted prior to the judgment in August at my current address. I categorically deny all baseless allegations, including but not limited to torture allegations, brought forward by someone motivated by greed. Claims of &apos;conspiracy&apos; are ridiculous, and I&apos;d not even entertain them.&quot; Oxford said it was only made aware of the judgment very recently. &quot;It&apos;s unclear what status a default judgment in a civil Canadian court has in the English legal system, or in the university&apos;s regulations,&quot; said a spokeswoman. The university has faced claims Hashemi made a fraudulent application and that his English was not good enough to understand his tutors. Reza Sheikholeslami, emeritus fellow at Wadham College, said in April his admission was seriously flawed. &quot;I knew Hashemi did not have the minimum English mandated at Oxford,&quot; he said, adding that he got a &quot;special waiver by the admitting tutor&quot;. Sheikholeslami also claims he told Oxford that Hashemi &quot;hired&quot; a student to help write his thesis application. Hashemi stated: &quot;I do understand, speak and write English, however I was asked by Oxford to improve my English, not unprecedented at this university. As for qualifications, I urge you to refer to Oxford&apos;s enquiry by [former vice-chancellor] Sir Peter North.&quot; The university said: &quot;Allegations that a student was paid to help him are utterly untrue.

Meanwhile, star Antonio Banderas, who voices the titular feline, was apparently asked not to refer to the original title or his character&apos;s name during promotional duties at the recent Doha Tribeca film festival. Puss in Boots, which premiered in the UK last night, topped the US chart on its release earlier this month and has creamed $178m from the global box office to date. The film sees Puss \u2013 a Zorro-esque swashbuckler with a thirst for milk and adventure \u2013 team up with Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) and Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) in an attempt to steal golden-goose eggs from a giant&apos;s castle.

Had the answer been \u00a314.9m a year then perhaps Romeo might not have shed his so lightly. Remarkably that near-\u00a315m figure is what analysts at American Appraisal estimate the naming-rights of Arsenal&apos;s Emirates Stadium to be worth if they were to renew the deal today. It makes Arsenal&apos;s ground theoretically the most valuable naming-rights property in English sport (venues such as Wembley or Wimbledon being unlikely ever to cash in). Currently the Gunners are earning only \u00a33.6m a year from their 15-year agreement with the Dubai airline. That was because the deal was discounted to generate a lump sum of cash that was instrumental in building the stadium Emirates would sponsor. The deal commenced in 2006, and since then analysts believe the rise in global interest in English football to have driven huge value in naming rights. Five years ago the Premier League&apos;s overseas broadcast rights were collectively worth \u00a3320m over three years. The current set of three-year agreements generates \u00a31.4bn, a multiple of 4.375 on the 2006 figure. That exponential trend has been tracked by the value in stadium naming rights, according to American Appraisal&apos;s managing director, Mike Weaver. &quot;The price for the equivalent media exposure in such deals can be valued relatively easily using the cost of buying the media direct, but the more intangible brand association is more difficult to quantify and can sometimes be significant,&quot; he says. Yet the media exposure is not always positive. As Newcastle United found, the proposal to sell rights to St James&apos; Park, unusually marketed by attaching the Sports Direct name to it beforehand, proved disastrous. Newcastle fans stirred up a storm of protest that led sponsorship consultants to say the announcement had reduced the value of the property. Indeed, whereas the club&apos;s managing director, Derek Llambias, hopes to raise &quot;between \u00a38m and \u00a310m a year&quot; from the deal, American Appraisal&apos;s analysis estimates it now to be worth \u00a31m. It is for this reason the same analysts gauge that Old Trafford and Anfield, despite being the homes of England&apos;s two best-supported clubs both domestically and overseas, would raise less than \u00a310m each. Local resistance to renaming a beloved community asset for a few dollars more would dissuade even the most globally focused corporate sponsor.     Potential stadium naming rights revenue that could be generated at leading Premier League clubs    Weaver suggests that if Liverpool were to move away from Anfield, they could expect at least to double the estimated \u00a39.3m a year they might raise in their present home, even more than Arsenal. &quot;There is no question that stadium rights deals are much less valuable for existing stadiums,&quot; Weaver says. &quot;The deal value for a sponsor of a new stadium comes from a close brand association and corporate partnership rather than simply the value of the airtime and column inches it generates in the media.&quot; Such are the rewards on offer that American&apos;s analysis transforms the calculus for clubs considering whether to build new stadiums. In 2008-09, their third year at the Emirates and when gross debt taken out to finance the stadium and Highbury Square construction projects peaked at \u00a3415.6m, Arsenal&apos;s total interest bill was \u00a319.3m. Since then general interest rates have fallen to historically low levels (although even at the height of the easy-credit culture Arsenal did achieve an exceptionally cheap deal). Indeed if the interest expense on a stadium project can be covered by naming rights \u2013 as Weaver&apos;s estimates suggest \u2013 then a new ground could theoretically be built at zero net cost to the club&apos;s cash account. All extra gate money from the expanded capacity would go straight to the bottom line. But there is another twist: regulatory developments could provide a further incentive to development for the biggest clubs. Uefa&apos;s financial fair play rules make allowance for infrastructure spending on capital projects like stadiums and training grounds. It means that while they have to be paid for in cash, the project-finance expenses associated with stadium development do not count towards the overall losses a club makes when they are considered by Uefa&apos;s regulations. If so, clubs will have two cash boosts: the overall sponsorship take will grow through an eight-figure naming-rights deal and the ticket revenue from executive boxes and general admissions will also improve. But, crucially, at the same time as clubs add these tens of millions extra to their revenues the losses they incur under FFP regulations would be unaffected.     Potential stadium naming rights revenue that could be generated at all Premier League clubs    So, for example, a club spending \u00a3400m to improve their stadium from 40,000 to 60,000 may pay \u00a320m a year in interest on project-finance loans. That expense could be offset by \u00a318m of naming-rights revenue while also adding an extra \u00a380m a year in match-day income, making the club \u00a378m better off each year. For the purposes of FFP, because the bank interest is allowable, the effect for regulators is that the club&apos;s income has improved by the full \u00a398m. That, for any club, is a game-changing sum. Those who may wonder why Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool and Chelsea have been considering expensive new-stadium projects \u2013 even in the face of the deepest recession in living memory \u2013 may now have their answer.", "title": "Grounds for change: why Liverpool, Chelsea and Spurs are on the move | Matt Scott", "sentences": ["Currently the Gunners are earning only \u00a33.6m a year from their 15-year agreement with the Dubai airline."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-25T19:06:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2011/nov/28/brief-history-of-illamasqua", "tags": ["Fashion", "Beauty", "Life and style"], "article": "Illamas-qu\u00e9? A relatively new British brand that has built up quite a following since its launch in November 2008. Illamasqua (a combination of &apos;Illusion&apos; and &apos;Masquerade&apos;) is the brainchild of Yorkshire marketing guru Julian Kynaston who, without any previous experience in the world of makeup, launched the brand to reflect his passion for all things subcultural. Illamasqua was edgy from day one so it felt like a natural step for Joseph Corre to join in 2010. There aren&apos;t many people with as much punk heritage in their blood as this man. The son of Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren, Corre grew up in the middle of London&apos;s punk scene. After a number of years working for his mother, he co-founded lingerie company Agent Provocateur, where he worked for 16 years before leaving to join Kynaston. The pair have created a bold beauty brand that is expanding rapidly and will soon have 13 UK stockist sites, as well as a presence in the US, Australia and Dubai. What makes it edgy? Well, they don&apos;t shy away from unconventional looks and highly pigmented colour. The core collection is based on a range created by Arnold Langer, who learned his trade in prewar Berlin among the underground clubs and cabaret performers of the time. Illamasqua certainly maintains that theatrical feel and playfulness with adventurous seasonal collections.

Located at the southernmost tip of the Korean peninsula, Busan not only boasts a mammoth department store, the world&apos;s biggest \u2013 overtaking Macy&apos;s in New York two years ago \u2013 it also plans on having the world&apos;s third-tallest building in 2013, after Burj Khalifa in Dubai and Taipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan. On Tuesday, Busan hosts the fourth high-level forum on aid effectiveness, when more than 2,000 delegates, with star turns from Hillary Clinton and Tony Blair, descend on the vast Bexco conference centre, where workers were still putting the finishing touches to its layout at the weekend. Busan and South Korea rightly take great pride in hosting this conference, and the South Korean government believes others can learn from its development experience. Echoes here of Turkey, host of this year&apos;s least-developed countries conference in Istanbul, when it banged on about the importance of the private sector in its own development. After the Korean war, South Korea was one of the world&apos;s poorest countries with only $64 per capita income. Economically, in the 1960s it lagged behind the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) \u2013 currently holding elections marred by violence . Since then the country&apos;s fortunes have diverged spectacularly. South Korea now belongs to the rich man&apos;s club, the OECD development assistance committee (DAC). The DRC has gone backwards since independence and, out of 187 countries, ranked bottom in the 2011 Human Development Index. South Korea, however, benefited from big injections of foreign aid, first from the US, then Japan. A briefing paper from KoFID, a South Korean network of civil society organisations, and ReDI, a South Korean thinktank, points out that the US offered about $60bn in grants and loans to South Korea between 1946 and 1978. In the same period, the total amount of aid provided by the US to the entire African continent was $68.9bn. Korea \u2013 considered by the US an important ally during the cold war \u2013 indisputedly used the aid well. Seoul was not afraid to stand up to the US when they differed on development strategy as well. In a foretaste of the current debate on &quot;ownership&quot;, South Korea was not prepared to play second fiddle to the US and insisted on pursuing its own course. Aid was linked to South Korea&apos;s planning and budget process, one of the principles set out in the Paris declaration on aid effectiveness in 2005 and expected to be reaffirmed in Busan. South Korea, under strongman Park Chung-Hee, focused on building up large economic champions, or chaebols (business conglomerates), against American advice to focus on small- and medium-sized companies. That policy laid the foundation for successful South Korean brands in the world market, such as Samsung and LG, although it came at a price in terms of political corruption in the close ties between business and political elites. KoFID and ReDI argue that the focus on conglomerates led to the chaebols exploiting their monopoly status, fostering increasing economic inequality. Park took a pragmatic approach to corruption. Instead of cracking down on corrupt businessmen as urged by the US, he expropriated their bank shares and assigned them to invest in import-substitution industries, such as fertilisers, a point made in Catalysing Development, a book on aid edited by Homi Kharas, Koji Makino and Woojin Jung. Whatever its faults, the South Korean regime did not squander the aid it received, unlike Mobutu in the DRC&apos;s previous incarnation, Zaire. As the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank looked the other way, Mobutu looted the country, building himself palatial follies in his mother&apos;s home village in the remote bush in Gbadolite, complete with an airport that could accommodate Concorde for shopping trips the Mobutu clan would make to Paris or New York. While the DRC stands out as a model of development to be shunned, South Korea, as well as Vietnam provide pointers on how development should be done. Once again, Vietnam underlines the importance of ownership. The government, rather than donors, set out the poverty reduction agenda and at times has rejected the advice of international institutions. Vietnam allowed its programme with the IMF to lapse over disagreements with the pace of financial sector reform and audits of the central bank. Ownership cuts both ways, however. Vietnam, like a number of developing countries that have overseen considerable progress, has a strong authoritarian streak, recently jailing a French-Vietnamese blogger. Rwanda, Ethiopia and Cambodia also spring to mind in this context. A primary concern of civil society groups in Busan is the increasing use of legislation to crack down on NGO activity. Cambodia is discussing an NGO law that civil society groups fear could further stifle dissent in a society with minimal political opposition, although there are signs the regime is backtracking under international pressure. Meanwhile, some Ethiopians say civil society has been virtually strangled since the introduction of an NGO law in Ethiopia in 2009. Campaigners are hoping to hear a strong message of support from Clinton for civil society when she speaks on Wednesday. As for South Korea, KoFID and ReDI say the government has not given enough importance to the role of civil society in the country&apos;s successful path to development. &quot;Decades of suffering and sacrifice were endured by most of the population: the small business people, labourers and farmers,&quot; KoFID and ReDI argue. &quot;It was their push for a democratic civil society in Korea that lay behind the stable development of the country.&quot; It is an assertion open to debate, but Tunisia, Egypt and the Arab spring show the dangers of not spreading the benefits of economic growth evenly.", "title": "South Korea: a model of development? | Mark Tran", "sentences": ["Located at the southernmost tip of the Korean peninsula, Busan not only boasts a mammoth department store, the world&apos;s biggest \u2013 overtaking Macy&apos;s in New York two years ago \u2013 it also plans on having the world&apos;s third-tallest building in 2013, after Burj Khalifa in Dubai and Taipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-28T12:27:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/28/willie-walsh-cameron-aviation-taxes", "tags": ["UK news", "British Airways", "Airline industry", "Travel & leisure", "Business", "Willie Walsh", "David Cameron", "Politics"], "article": "Willie Walsh, the chairman of International Airlines group, the parent company of Iberia and British Airways, last night lambasted David Cameron for having &quot;no policy for aviation&quot;. Walsh said that if the prime minister were serious about reviving the British economy he would not be allowing UK airports to be overtaken as they are by competitors around the world. Aviation should be a building block to growth, said Walsh. He accused Cameron of letting the British airline industry be undermined by foolish decisions such as allowing air passenger duty to go up by twice the level of inflation, so turning British aviation into the most taxed aviation industry in the world. The tax applies to almost every ticket on a flight originating in the UK. Green campaigners say the tax is necessary to curb greenhouse gas emissions. In some of the harshest criticism made by a leading British businessman of the Cameron government, Walsh said: &quot;When Cameron went to China, he said we need to establish trade links and announced a Rolls-Royce deal worth \u00a3740m for engines to a China Eastern airline. But while he rightly praises Rolls-Royce, he fails to recognise that Rolls-Royce&apos;s success and growth is on the back of China&apos;s investment in aviation. &quot;The Chinese see aviation as a building block of growth. But this government has no policy on aviation. Cameron will not even acknowledge the link between Rolls-Royce and British aviation (it is as if one is divorced from the other).&quot; He points out that all round the world other governments are massively expanding their air industry base. Walsh said: &quot;China has built 45 airports and, by 2020, it will have built a further 52. Or look at the Middle East: Dubai was 99th in the league table of world airports; last year it was 14th; today it is 4th and, by 2014, it will leapfrog Heathrow for the No 1 slot. China, Dubai, Brazil \u2013 wherever you look, they are taking advantage of our lack of ambition. These economies are investing in aviation the way the Victorians invested in railways.&quot; In a last-ditch bid to persuade the government to rethink its proposed rise in aviation duty, he said: &quot;If the chancellor really wants to boost our economy, he should recognise the value of aviation. And the first step would be to scrap air passenger duty, a tax that is driving business and tourism away from the UK. [Tourism is another major commitment of Cameron&apos;s.] &quot;If the double inflation rise goes ahead, tomorrow we will see the tax burden on a family of four travelling in economy to Australia rise from the already prohibitive \u00a3680 to \u00a3979 by 2015. The Chinese and the Middle Eastern carriers do not have APD for good reason. &quot;This year, passengers flying from the UK will pay \u00a32.2bn in APD, the highest aviation tax of anywhere in the world.

Mansour, a prominent member of Abu Dhabi&apos;s ruling Al Nahyan family, has remained largely in the background, attending only one match since his \u00a3210m takeover of the club in 2008. However, the man who has spent \u00a3800m and counting on establishing City among football&apos;s elite has chosen now, through the pages of the Al Ittihad newspaper, to deliver his verdict on the team&apos;s progress and his ambitions for the rest of the season. His view will make pleasant reading for Mancini, with more evidence that Mansour and his Abu Dhabi colleagues have reasonable expectations of what the Italian should be delivering and will not be prone to knee-jerk reactions if there are disappointments along the way. The Champions League is a case in point, with City in serious danger of being eliminated at the group stage. While the Abu Dhabi United Group has made it clear the aim is to win the European Cup, Mansour emphasised the need for patience and made it clear that Mancini has his full backing. &quot;Sometimes I meet City supporters who criticise the work of the manager,&quot; he said. &quot;In my opinion, his plans are on the right path. We need to reflect upon where the club has been and what we have achieved so far, and realise that what we have accomplished to date is formidable.&quot; City have established a five-point lead over Manchester United at the top of the league and when Mansour was asked about the 6-1 thrashing of United, he offered another insight into the strength of optimism in Abu Dhabi, revealing that the well-done messages started to arrive before a ball had even been kicked. &quot;The first person who congratulated me \u2013 even before kick-off \u2013 was His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum [the United Arab Emirates vice-president and Dubai ruler],&quot; he said. &quot;I saw him five minutes before kick-off and he was confident that City would win.&quot; City&apos;s 1-0 defeat of Arsenal on Tuesday has also put them into the Carling Cup semi-finals, but they will drop into the Europa League unless they can beat Bayern Munich in their final Champions League group match next Wednesday and Napoli fail to do likewise at Villarreal. Mancini rates City&apos;s qualification chances as only 30% but, again, there is no hint of impatience from the club&apos;s owner. &quot;It is a new experience that the team has earned. They deserve to be there because they didn&apos;t reach this position by chance, but with hard work. However, we also need to be patient with the team at this point. We must not forget that our main objective is to win the English Premier League. &quot;If we can achieve this, the outcome will impact the team and the club as a whole. This will instil us all with the confidence to look ahead and achieve even greater success.&quot; This did not sound like a man who is liable to become bored if the club do not win the European Cup quickly enough and ditch City for another &quot;plaything&quot;, as the Napoli president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, commented last week. &quot;Ultimately, we are satisfied with the progress that is being achieved, but we must continue to have patience,&quot; Mansour continued. &quot;Hard work is still required and it needs to be delivered with patience.&quot; Mansour also talked of City facing new challenges now they have established themselves as the team who everyone in the Premier League have to catch. &quot;We must be aware that results like this [the United win] can be a double-edged sword. Other teams begin to regard us differently, and therefore prepare themselves the best way they can. But to win championships and trophies you must adapt and be ready to face those kind of challenges.&quot; His only appearance at the stadium that is now named after Etihad Airways, the airline of the UAE, came in August 2010, when he saw City beat Liverpool 3-0, but there was a pledge that he would return to Manchester later in the season. &quot;God willing, I will visit again soon.

Given the county&apos;s fame as a retail pioneer \u2013 Marks &amp; Sparks, Burton&apos;s, Meadowhall&apos;s pioneering mall \u2013 it is out of character for so many city and town centres to be struggling to avoid the blight of empty premises. It didn&apos;t seem a problem yesterday, when the strike day off for thousands saw Leeds city centre almost as packed with shoppers as demonstrators, and the White Rose mall&apos;s usual 30,000 visitors on a midweek day going up by 10,000. But the figures say otherwise; The Town Centre Rejuvenation campaign has used data from DirectGov and the British Retail Consortium to list 14.3 percent of high street shops standing empty nationally, rising to 18 percent in Bradford. The effects are bad and sad, and also very costly, according to Kate Hardcastle , the consumer specialist behind the campaign. She calculates that the lost wages of those who would/should be working in the empty shops like this:  The average wage of a shop worker, close to minimum wage is \u00a312,000. With Tax and National Insurance withdrawn the take home pay is on average \u00a310,500. That money is spent in the economy on food, clothing, mortgages and other small businesses. Combine that total with the business rates figure on each empty shop, the UK average in 2010 was \u00a311,432. There are 286, 680 retail outlets in the UK and if the figure is calculated based on the percentage empty across the whole of the UK, it comes to a staggering \u00a3899,107,603.68. The figure in fact could be higher if each individual then applies for Jobseekers allowance, which is \u00a33510 a year per head.  Town Centre Rejuvenation is targeting eight Yorkshire centres and using a system somewhat similar to the various TV shows which come to the aid of faltering businesses, restaurants etc. Hardcastle&apos;s outfit Insight with Passion has got together a panel of retail specialists who will offer advice on the virtues of a central shop \u2013 as opposed to malls or online buying \u2013 for free. The first areas chosen are Batley, Bingley, Birstall, Doncaster, Hull, Rotherham, Wakefield and Commercial Street in Leeds. The idea was piloted earlier this year in Huddersfield, Hardcastle&apos;s home town. She says:   It&apos;s not true to say consumers just want to shop online. We crave human interaction in our shopping experience and we have worked with clients in Dubai, Australia and the UK showing that if you change how you interact with customers you can see real results in your turnover. The project is based on what we call &apos;retail theatre&apos;. It&apos;s about making businesses stand out, understanding what the consumer wants, how you can appeal to them and also show them how you&apos;re meeting their needs. It&apos;s not about small businesses spending loads of money and getting in expensive consultants. It&apos;s about delivering a better service and better products.      Cheering things up temporarily: empty shops used as art galleries down south in Margate.     Who wants to go somewhere where staff are rude, don&apos;t answer your questions properly, can&apos;t tell you about the product they&apos;re selling. No one wants that. Customer service is the central thing I want to bring back to the high street. It doesn&apos;t cost a penny and it&apos;s easily done. Interesting notion. It&apos;s easy to attack online shopping, but some of the extraordinary computer skills of sites such as Amazon \u2013 automatically scanning your book choice, for instance, and suggesting similar ones \u2013 can be replicated in the &apos;little shops&apos; about which we sentimentalise.

Although the recession has technically ended, the country is only beginning to crawl out of the pit into which it fell after the credit crunch. In the past three months, 1,400 people were becoming unemployed every day; one in every seven shops on the British high street is vacant. Unemployment stands at over 8% and confidence has been this low only three times in the past 40 years \u2013 but the other two times were in 1990 and 2008, when we were heading into a recession, not supposedly heading out of one. And yet, if you live in central London, you could be forgiven for not noticing any of that. One of the things that happens to you if you write about restaurants \u2013 one of the reasons restaurant critics are the real heroes \u2013 is that whenever anyone has a grievance about any aspect of the business, they tell you about it. At the moment, what we critics are mainly responsible for is the fact that everywhere is full \u2013 everywhere in central London, that is. In the purest form of this lament, one I&apos;ve heard four or five times, a couple gets a late-notice babysitter, excitedly makes plans for an impromptu dinner out, calls five restaurants in a row, gets knocked back by every one and ends up at the local Indian. Then they complain to me about it. The grumblers aren&apos;t imagining things. I &quot;have to&quot; \u2013 in the special sense of that verb used by critics \u2013 eat out in new London restaurants regularly, and the single most striking thing about them is how amazingly full they always are. There is, right in the middle of the capital, an unmistakable boom in the high-end restaurant business, even as the rest of the country sinks further into gloom and inactivity. The trend is going to become even more marked, because a huge wave of big new openings is about to hit. Jeremy King and Christopher Corbin, creators of the Caprice, the Ivy and the Wolseley, and the most admired restaurateurs of their generation, are opening a big new restaurant called the Delaunay on Aldwych. The Russian restaurateur Arkady Novikov has opened not one but three restaurants in a huge single site in, yet again, Mayfair. The nice lads who run the Hawksmoor steak joints, Will Beckett and Huw Gott, have just\u00a0opened an enormous new restaurant in Guildhall. That&apos;s open all day, as will be the huge new American restaurant Karpo in King&apos;s Cross (at time of writing, due to open any day now). Richard Caring, the clothing magnate who owns a range of well-run fancy restaurants and clubs (Scott&apos;s, Annabel&apos;s, Soho House, among many others), has just opened 34, a swanky steakhouse in Mayfair. &quot;Calling it a boom is probably slightly exaggerated,&quot; Caring says, but he does concede that &quot;London restaurants are generally up on last year, which was up on the year before. Business is strong, and there&apos;s pressure on bookings, but it&apos;s not phenomenal.&quot; 34 is Caring&apos;s most expensive opening ever and he is super-bullish about the top end of the market: &quot;If we were to find good sites, we would take them. That&apos;s how confident we are.&quot; It is an extraordinary flurry of activity for a country on the edge of a double-dip recession. These places aren&apos;t cheap. Food guide Harden&apos;s performs a useful annual survey of trends in eating out, which reports that the average cost of a meal for two in London \u2013 three courses, wine, service \u2013 has gone through \u00a390. That&apos;s a lot, and a lot more than people elsewhere in the country are willing to pay. In addition to his high-end places, Caring owns mid-market chain restaurants with branches outside London, including the 29-branch brasserie C\u00f4te. &quot;It&apos;s well-priced and value for money, so it&apos;s doing well across the country, but the price point is different. People outside London will spend \u00a320, or \u00a322, or \u00a325, but not \u00a340.&quot; In addition, people outside London tend to save up their eating out for treats on Friday and Saturday night. Put those two trends together and you have a classic downturn in consumer demand: people spending less, and less often. &quot;We wouldn&apos;t open a high-end place outside London,&quot; Caring says. The high-end restaurants in the capital are places where you blow past \u00a3100 for two with no sensation of effort; don&apos;t pay attention to the price of what you&apos;re ordering, and get frisky with the wine list, and that will easily double. It&apos;s a lot of money in a country where the median household income is \u00a3350 a week after housing costs, and where the annual fuel and food bill is \u00a31,000 more than it was a year ago. So who are all these people doing all this eating out? Occasionally the answer is easy \u2013 if you&apos;re just off Grosvenor Square, say, they&apos;re probably hedge funders, based in and around Mayfair, and tie-less, to distinguish themselves from City-based bankers. Tourists are also easy to spot: the 20% drop in the value of sterling has made the UK a\u00a0more attractive place to visit, and quite a few of these better-off visitors are taking the chance to see what the London restaurant fuss is about. According to Niall Howard, CEO of the Hakkasan group, &quot;There is a kind of unofficial list of places to go in London. If you find a niche where people know other people will go, that&apos;s a key.&quot; A number of these aren&apos;t tourists in the old sense, but a new kind of global citizen \u2013 one Howard knows well, since when I spoke to him he was in Dubai opening the chain&apos;s sixth restaurant. &quot;The other thing is what I call global residents,&quot; he adds. &quot;People living in different cities at different times of the year. London is very much on those people&apos;s radar.&quot; In this view, the boom in high-end restaurants is linked to the other thing in London that&apos;s unquestionably booming: high-end property, most of whose buyers are foreign nationals. As for the other customers, it&apos;s strangely hard to tell who they are. They might be anybody. And that, says Russell Norman, is part of the point. Norman is a veteran of the trade: he started as a waiter at Joe Allen, the famed Covent Garden burger joint, in 1990, then graduated through waiting, bar and management jobs until he became director of operations at the Caprice group in the noughties. Then he took a deep breath, quit, and opened his first restaurant, Polpo, in September 2009 \u2013 &quot;A year to the day after Lehman Brothers went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy,&quot; he says with a laugh. &quot;It was a\u00a0slightly crazy thing to do, but I\u00a0felt sure we&apos;d be able to make a go of it.&quot; He was\u00a0right: Norman now owns four funky, lively small restaurants, all offering good value and deceptively professional service. His fifth, Mishkin&apos;s, a London version of a\u00a0New York Jewish deli, opened last week in Soho. He agrees that central London is different from anywhere else in the UK. &quot;I spend most of my waking life in Soho and Covent Garden, and there is an atmosphere that doesn&apos;t match the woes of the rest of the country and the rest of the world.&quot; In Norman&apos;s view, there is a bubble in central London inside which people are still carrying on as if these were boom times. &quot;I think that bubble is a very real and very strong protector of that part of central London. I&apos;d be terrified to open a restaurant in a place that didn&apos;t have that feeling.&quot; As for the question of who the customers are, Norman has an interesting and surprising answer: they&apos;re Londoners. That might sound obvious, but it was by no means always true: &quot;The people I see going out to restaurants, I don&apos;t see that many out-of-towners. I&apos;ve been waiter and barman and manager in lots of restaurants in London, and not so long ago the core customer came from out of town. Now they don&apos;t. I guess they have to economise, and economy starts with things you feel you don&apos;t need, and for them that includes restaurants. What we see instead is that people are travelling from Hampstead, Notting Hill, Regent&apos;s Park. They&apos;re Zone 1 and 2 people&quot; \u2013 tube-map shorthand for the city centre. &quot;They are more wealthy, with more disposable income, because they live closer to the middle of town.&quot; Some of the consequences of that are positive. London never used to have a\u00a0large discerning public with an interest in food; it had one with an interest in fashion, and in going to the latest cool-hot place, which is a\u00a0different thing. That might sound like a\u00a0negative factor, but Howard argues that it&apos;s\u00a0a great strength for London. Hakkasan, for instance, &quot;see ourselves more as a\u00a0lifestyle brand than as a\u00a0restaurant. When we communicate, it&apos;s more through lifestyle than restaurant media. We are very much an experience \u2013 a place to be seen, to enjoy all of the senses. Things are changing in the restaurant business. Even at Michelin level it&apos;s not about sitting in very quiet rooms where everything is about the plate. People want a bit of fun.&quot; Caring, Norman and Howard all use the same two words: &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;experience&quot;. London restaurants were always more about those things than about temple-of-gastronomy food worship; in that sense, they were ahead of the global curve. Competition helps, and the fact that money is a little tight can, too. In economics this is called a &quot;flight to quality&quot;: when people are being careful with their cash, they take more trouble over their choices. The early-80s recession was good for good restaurants, not least because it put bad ones out of business. I agree with Norman that &quot;the quality of London restaurants now is higher than ever&quot;. The idea that people want to go to these places to escape thinking about harder times elsewhere is easy to understand, too. As Norman says, &quot;Things are bleak and people need to forget that. It&apos;s a bit like the way the Great Depression spawned a lot of interesting entertainments \u2013 we think of soup kitchens, but there were also speakeasies, cabarets and ridiculous cocktails. In central London, there seems to be a resurgence in fun. Going to a good restaurant is a guaranteed way to have a good night out and to forget that your job isn&apos;t safe and you haven&apos;t had a pay rise in three years.&quot; From his dual perspective as boss of Hakkasan and resident of Edinburgh, Howard sees something similar. &quot;The people who go out want to treat themselves when they do, they want to spend. I\u00a0see it in London, and in Edinburgh \u2013 there are five Michelin-starred restaurants here and all are doing well. The mid-market is where they&apos;re struggling.&quot; A flight to quality, rising standards and escapism are all contributing factors to the London boom, and none is a bad thing. The trouble with the current phenomenon, however, is connected with its underlying causes, and especially with the big dark one underlying all the others: inequality, and the fact that the affluent customer base in central London is largely cut off from the hard times afflicting the rest of the country. The Office for National Statistics reports that the UK banking industry took home \u00a314bn in bonuses last year; while it is true most financial sector jobs in the UK are not based in London, most of those that pay stratospheric amounts are. Almost all the international super-rich in the UK have their main residence in London. The money they spend circulates through the local economy, and is part of what you see when you look at that boom. Put these things together and what we are looking at is the Manhattanisation of London. Manhattan is a literal island, whereas London is a\u00a0metaphorical one, but other traits are shared: both are the basis for their country&apos;s financial industry; both, partly as a result, have their country&apos;s largest concentrations of rich people; in both, property prices are so high, they are almost radioactive, forcing people on normal pay farther and farther out from the centre; both are much more international and cosmopolitan than the rest of the country, and looked on with wariness and resentment by it. All of these are not superficial details of manners or mores but profound structural differences. The bubble really is a bubble: it really does cut things off. That&apos;s the problem. If you live somewhere else in the UK, the most troubling thing about the boom in London&apos;s restaurants is that it has nothing to do with you. In Caring&apos;s words: &quot;I&apos;ve been through so many recessions. Is this one worse than the others? Yes, it is a bit. But it&apos;s a little overdone, all the banner headlines about the growth rate. If\u00a0it&apos;s 0.5% as opposed to 1%, it won&apos;t make a huge difference to restaurants at the top end.&quot; That is almost certainly true, and it is a double-edged truth. Just before Silvio Berlusconi was forced from office, he said that talk of a crisis was ridiculous because &quot;the restaurants are full&quot;. It&apos;s the same in London, and it means just as much. \u2022 Capital, a novel by John Lanchester, is due to be published on 1 March next year.", "title": "Recession?

Very few of us worry too much about tweeting our personal opinions on politics or chatting with a new social network &quot;friend&quot; on the other side of the world, whom we barely know and often forget in a matter of a few hours or days. Yet all these interactions have become fodder for a new industry that secretly vacuums up the data and preserves it forever on high-end servers that hold many petabytes (a million gigabytes) of information. This industry offers new tools to search that data and reconstruct our past, and even our real-time movements via our mobile phones, in a way that could well come back to haunt us. WikiLeaks has just released the Spy Files \u2013 a trove of almost 300 documents from these companies that shine a light into this industry. At the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, where I work, we trawled through these documents, and tracked down yet more material which our research team \u2013 Matthew Wrigley, David Pegg, Christian Jensen and Jamie Thunder \u2013 used to create an online database that will soon cover over 160 companies in some 25 countries. It&apos;s worth spending some time browsing through this material because what this new industry offers to do is nothing short of Orwellian. &quot;We all aware of traditional spy stories of intelligence agencies like MI5 bugging the phones of one or two people,&quot; Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, told the Bureau. He continued:  &quot;In the last ten years, something else has happened. We now see mass surveillance, where computer systems of an entire country are infected by surveillance programs, where the entire phone calls of a nation can be and are recorded by a company. &quot;Previously, we had all thought, why would the government be interested in me, my brother? My business is not interesting; I am not a criminal. Now these companies sell to state intelligence agencies the ability to spy on the entire population at once and keep that information permanently. In five or six years&apos; time, if your brother or someone becomes of interest to that company or the government, they can go back in time and look to see what you said or what you emailed.&quot;  For example Glimmerglass, a company in Hayward, California, offers &quot;non-intrusive intercepts of any fiber asset&quot; such as &quot;submarine landing stations&quot;, which this slide presentation demonstrates. Eric King, a human rights adviser to Privacy International, told me that means that Glimmerglass equipment can help government agencies secretly tap into the undersea cables that convey all the data and phone traffic between continents. WikiLeaks also released a brochure from SS8 of Milpitas, California, touting its Intellego product that allows security forces to &quot;see what they see, in real time&quot; including a &quot;target&apos;s draft-only emails, attached files, pictures and videos&quot;. Yet others, like Blue Coat of Sunnyvale, California, sell web filtering tools that allow countries to block websites &quot;to meet cultural and regulatory requirements&quot; \u2013 a tool much sought after by authoritarian governments to make sure that citizens do not access dissident sites. Not too long ago, Syria bought some Bluecoat machines via a reseller in Dubai. (The company is not allowed to sell directly to Syria because of US sanctions.) Government authorities and the makers of these products argue that there is an urgent need for these tools \u2013 to track down criminals and terrorists, to block child pornography and computer viruses \u2013 a practice known as &quot;lawful interception&quot;. This is big business for i2, a company based in McLean, Virginia, which sells two major products \u2013 CopLink and Analyst&apos;s Notebook \u2013 software that allows law enforcement to make sense of reams of data. Government Computer News ran a story earlier this week about the &quot;Digital Dragnet&quot; \u2013 extolling the benefits of data analysis. The magazine quoted Bob Griffin, the CEO of i2: &quot;When we started this more than ten years ago, we talked about things like information-sharing and gathering as much data as you could,&quot; Griffin said. &quot;In those days, people would look at you like you&apos;re a green banana. Why would I want to share information? Why would I want to bring information from business licenses or hunting and fishing licenses into the policing environment?&quot; Police authorities are excited about the potential: Jason Scheiss, analytical services division manager at the Durham police department in North Carolina, told Government Computer News that they were hoping to expand the data-collecting to include data on water and sewage billing, visitor logs from parks and recreation facilities and correlate it with the daily jail list. &quot;So we could say, &apos;Hey, look here. All of these crimes only occur when this one guy&apos;s not in jail,&apos;&quot; he told the magazine. Therein lies the rub: apart from the massive violation of individual privacy, or the risk of abuse by corrupt officials, these tools could easily allow security agencies to jump to the wrong conclusion. Indeed, these tools have the potential to make computer cables as dangerous as police batons. &quot;What we are seeing is the militarisation of cyberspace. It&apos;s like having a tank in your front garden,&quot; says Assange. You have been warned and you have a choice: you can avoid the wonderful world of the internet (unlikely, since you are reading this online) and digital data (virtually impossible if you pay for electricity or go camping) \u2013 or you can join the movement to say there need to be limits to how government authorities use our information against us. And if you choose the latter, check out WikiLeaks and Privacy International.", "title": "The new cyber-industrial complex spying on us | Pratap Chatterjee", "sentences": ["Not too long ago, Syria bought some Bluecoat machines via a reseller in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-02T23:59:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lawrence-donegan-golf-blog/2011/dec/03/luke-donald-golf", "tags": ["Luke Donald", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Venture into the realm of sporting fiction for a moment and imagine Andy Murray had ascended to the top of tennis&apos;s world rankings; that he was widely acknowledged by his peers to be the best in his sport; that whenever he turned up to play in an event he would be the man to beat. Would the Scot not be a national hero? Would he not be a fixture on gossip pages, unable to stroll down the nearest high street without being pestered by autograph hunters? Would he not be an absolute shoo-in for Sports Personality of the Year? The answer on all counts is yes. Now ponder the world of Luke Donald, an Englishman who does not possess Murray&apos;s natural gifts or, more to the point, public profile, but who nevertheless has climbed to the top of golf&apos;s mountain. World No1. Winner of four tournaments in 2011, including the flagship event of the European Tour and the World Matchplay. Leading money winner on the PGA Tour and, unless there is an electoral injustice on a Bush-Gore scale, PGA Tour player of the year. This week&apos;s Dubai World Championship, the finale of the European Tour season, should also confirm him as the leading money winner on this side of the Atlantic. That is a remarkable haul for Donald, but what is just as remarkable is his relative anonymity. Murray struggles to fulfil his potential and a nation waits in hope. Donald exceeds every expectation and a nation yawns. Not only could the English golfer walk down the nearest high street unmolested, he could probably walk down Hemel Hempstead&apos;s, where he was born 33 years ago, and not be recognised. BBC Sports Personality of the Year for the world&apos;s No1 golfer? Not\u00a0a chance. Donald can count himself\u00a0lucky he made it on to the shortlist of 10. To point this out is not to indulge is that dreary festive tradition of SPOTY special pleading. Donald has his family, his jetsetting lifestyle and his multimillion pound bank balance. Should he never win the favour of the British viewing public, it is safe to say he will survive. Nor is it to diminish Murray&apos;s achievements in the era of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, two of the best there has ever been. Still, a question worth asking is this: what has Luke Donald done to deserve our indifference? After all, it is not as if golf is on the fringes of professional sport. It is mainstream fare \u2013 played by millions, watched by many millions more. On the Richter scale of national obsessions, it does not come close to football or rugby, but it is at least on a par with tennis and professional cycling. Inevitably, the issue then becomes Donald himself, his personality and his competitive record. Being boring is a charge often lobbed at professional golfers and few have been so regularly traduced as Donald. It depends on your definition of boring, of course. If it is means being dedicated, understated and better-read than, say, John Daly, then he is probably your man. But then that is hardly a reasonable definition of the word. As it happens, Donald is a more complicated character than many take him to be. Publicly, he is sanguine about\u00a0his peripheral place in British sporting life, but the suspicion is he is privately angry about it. Certainly, one of the greatest pleasures of his annus mirabilis in 2011 is that it has made twits of those who had him labelled long ago as little more than a well-remunerated nearly man. Did he take satisfaction in shutting up his critics, he was asked by a certain Observer sportswriter after winning the World Matchplay in Tucson this year? &quot;I&apos;ve noticed a few of your stories, Lawrence,&quot; he said, &quot;a few of yours, now and again, yeah. I try not to pay too much attention. And I think, unfairly at times, I&apos;ve kind of been depicted as someone that is very happy contending, picking up cheques, but doesn&apos;t care about winning. That is as far away from the truth as it can be.&quot; Touch\u00e9. Yet for all that Donald has put the hacks in their place there remains one gaping hole in his CV. Unlike Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, both of whom are also on the SPOTY shortlist and are more highly fancied, he has not won a major championship. There is no getting around this, except to say that, in golf, major championships have become too highly valued, the be-all and end-all in fact. It was not always this way. Before Tiger Woods set off in realistic pursuit of Jack Nicklaus&apos;s record of 18 majors, the world of golf was not so myopically focused on just four weeks of the year. There is something to be said about decorating the sporting calendar with the centrepiece of a major championship, but there is also something unfair about it too. After all, does the US PGA Championship, won this year in Atlanta by the American journeyman Keegan Bradley, really amount to more than what Donald has done this year? Of course not. Likewise, Clarke&apos;s Open victory at Royal St George&apos;s was a wonderful effort, but is the big man from Dungannon more worthy than the pride of Hemel Hempstead? Many will\u00a0say he is and, from the standpoint of pure human drama, they are probably right. But that does not take from what Donald has achieved or lessen the fear that, in brushing aside his consistent sporting brilliance, we really are losing the plot.", "title": "Britain's No1 sportsman?

Westwood shot a third-round 62 on his way to retaining the Nedbank Golf Challenge, while McIlroy carded 65 in Hong Kong to finish two shots clear of Gregory Havret. McIlroy finished at 12 under par after a bogey-free last round. On the final hole, he chipped in from a greenside bunker. McIlroy admitted keeping hold of his world No2 ranking ahead of Westwood was as much on his mind as the battle to finish top of the European money list. The latter issue will be resolved at next week&apos;s Dubai World Championship. &quot;One of the goals going out today was to win this tournament to keep myself in with a shout next week,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;It&apos;s very dependent on what Luke does because he&apos;s got such a big lead but if I can somehow get myself into contention next week, you never know. &quot;Another little bit of motivation was that I woke up this morning and saw Lee Westwood shoot 62 in Sun City and I thought I really needed to win to stay above him in the world rankings. It was nice to be able to do both. &quot;I had a lot to play for, trying to keep my hopes alive for the Race to Dubai and seeing that I needed to go out and produce a really good score if I wanted to keep my No2 ranking.&quot; The odds are still in favour of Donald, who has also finished first in the US PGA money list, retaining his position and becoming the first golfer to finish top in both the US and Europe. For McIlroy to leapfrog him, the 22-year-old will have to win in Dubai and hope Donald finishes 10th or worse. Donald will have been distracted recently by the sudden death of his father and birth of his second child. McIlroy was especially pleased to win for the first time in Hong Kong. On two earlier occasions, he had finished second. &quot;It feels like it was a long time coming, it&apos;s fantastic,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve loved the tournament ever since I played my first one in &apos;07. I had to wait a few years for it to finally happen but to win this tournament is very special. &quot;No matter how prestigious tournaments are, you always have your favourites and this is definitely one of my favourites and to be able to win it is fantastic. I couldn&apos;t be happier.&quot; McIlroy is still to confirm his schedule for next year but it appears almost certain Hong Kong will be among his destinations. &quot;I&apos;ll always come back to the tournaments that I love and Hong Kong is one of those tournaments,&quot; he said. &quot;I absolutely love it here and it will be great to come back next year and defend this title.&quot;Ian Poulter and Scotland&apos;s Richie Ramsay were among three players tied for fourth place, four shots adrift of McIlroy. Poulter expressed his unhappiness. &quot;Disappointing, I came to defend and I&apos;ve come up shy,&quot; said the 2010 winner. Westwood&apos;s 62 left him seven shots clear of the field before his fourth round in South Africa. He closed out the competition by signing for a 73, one over par, to win by two strokes. But for a recent lull in form, Westwood could also have been involved in the Dubai shoot-out alongside McIlroy and Donald. &quot;I&apos;ve been coming here a long time, this is the ninth time, and it&apos;s special every time I come,&quot; Westwood said. &quot;I love playing this course and yesterday was probably the best round I&apos;ve ever played. It set me up to play conservatively today. It&apos;s very satisfying. &quot;It&apos;s all right when things go well and you are top of the rankings but when you drop to 270 you find out more about the real person. So to get invited back here and win back-to-back titles is a bit special. &quot;Yesterday was very special. I drove well and made a few putts, which you&apos;ve got to do round any course when you make 10 under.&quot; he said.

Tiger Woods is back in the winner&apos;s enclosure, fist pump and all, and do not think that players such as Rory McIlroy and Lee Westwood have not taken note. The Northern Irishman and the Englishman matched the American&apos;s victory in California on Sunday with impressive victories of their own, in Hong Kong and South Africa. A successful (and lucrative) weekend for all three makes for an enticing prospect \u2013 for us, and for them. &quot;Usually December is the month in the golfing calendar when nothing happening so it was great to see Tiger back,&quot; said McIlroy, who was positively licking his chops at the prospect of taking on his boyhood hero. &quot;Even the way he won was very impressive, with back-to-back birdies on the last two holes. I think you could see by his reaction how much it meant to him. If I was to come up against Tiger on a Sunday it would be something to look forward to. Not many players of my generation have experienced it yet, and it would be great to have the opportunity to do it. It looks like next year really could be something, with lots of players playing well. I&apos;m just happy to be involved in it.&quot; Also happy to be involved is Westwood, who won the Nedbank Challenge at a canter after taking a seven-shot lead into Sunday&apos;s 18 holes courtesy of a third-round 62 \u2013 an effort he described as &quot;about as good as I have ever played&quot;. The Englishman is one of life&apos;s great stoics, so to hear him deliver such a paean of self-praise suggests he is in the right frame of mind to accept a challenge, from McIlroy, Woods or anyone. &quot;If I can take this kind of form into next year then obviously I&apos;m excited,&quot; he said. &quot;With Tiger getting back into the winner&apos;s enclosure, that&apos;s great for golf. I think everyone wants to see the best players in the world play well, and Tiger, who has been that kind of player, might well get back there.&quot; The only disappointment is that Woods, Westwood and McIlroy will have to wait until next month&apos;s Abu Dhabi Championship to measure themselves against each other. Throw in Luke Donald, the world No1, and Martin Kaymer, world No4 and twice a winner around the Abu Dhabi course, and it adds up to one of the most keenly awaited (non-major) tournaments in recent memory. In the meantime there is this week&apos;s Dubai World Championship, the finale to the European Tour&apos;s Race to Dubai \u2013 or the Order of Merit, as it is known in old money. A couple of years ago Westwood and McIlroy arrived here neck-and-neck in the season-long race, with the Englishman eventually prevailing. McIlroy is involved again, although this time his opponent is Donald and his chances of finishing in front rank somewhere between not great and none. The Northern Irishman needs a victory on Sunday and the Englishman needs to finish no higher than 10th. Were his opponent anyone other than Donald McIlroy might have a decent chance, but the Englishman has become a byword for consistency in recent times, finishing outside the top 10 about as often as he throws a temper tantrum. &quot;It&apos;ll be tough,&quot; McIlroy conceded. &quot;But if it was to happen it would be a great achievement, a great way to finish my most successful year to date.&quot; His task has been made even tougher by a virus which saw him hooked up to a drip for three days during a holiday with his girlfriend, the world No1 tennis player Caroline Wozniacki. He was back in hospital on Monday for tests. The world No2 has been on the road since the start of October, winning twice and racking up an estimated \u00a34m in prize money and appearance fees. He was not complaining about his lot in life but, looking at him, a degree in advanced medicine was not required to see he is utterly spent. His test results will come back later in the week. Those who have purchased tickets to see him play in Thailand next week may wish to check the refund policy. &quot;I&apos;m not energy-wise where I want to be, but I took a day off yesterday and took it easy. I&apos;ll really try and conserve my energy and focus it all into the four tournament days. I&apos;m not 100%, but I&apos;m still able to go out and play 18 holes and try and give it my all,&quot; he said. With that he disappeared off to the 1st tee of the pro-am event.

Some of his more high-profile colleagues would as soon be buried under the Fibresand as take a ride on it. But the Brazilian is perfectly happy to be here, paying his dues to the owner Roger Fell, a long-standing patron who had asked him to be here. &quot;I couldn&apos;t say no,&quot; De Sousa says, with every appearance of cheerfulness, despite the unusual experience of having to be at a racecourse in time for a noon start. &quot;I&apos;ve been having great support from him. He said, &apos;I&apos;ve got three entries, what about some work, I want you to ride.&apos; So I came here more to please him than to please myself.&quot; Fell puts a slightly different gloss on it. &quot;He was sat at home, so I said, &apos;Get your arse in gear, do some riding out and come back riding.&apos; I think he were a bit fed up, sitting at home with the wife.&quot; De Sousa will admit no such thing and insists he needed &quot;a good break&quot; after the way his season ended, when he was taking a dozen rides a day and made a flying visit to Australia for the Melbourne Cup. &quot;It takes a lot out of you, especially mentally, because your mind focuses only on [each] race and how to ride the race and how the form of the horse is and what the horses are around you. The last two weeks, at the end of the season, I was flat out.&quot; Now that he has been coerced into returning to action, De Sousa plans to have a few more rides over the weekend before flying to Brazil on Monday to introduce his wife and four-year-old son to his family. It will be his first return to his native country in five years, since the days when he was an unknown here. &quot;I&apos;m excited, looking forward to it, see the family, my parents and friends, just hopefully have a good time,&quot; he said. &quot;They&apos;ve been following me and they&apos;re very proud of what I&apos;ve been doing.&quot; But he does not expect to make it a working holiday by taking any rides at the tracks where he chomped through his apprentice&apos;s claim in just 16 months early in his career. &quot;I&apos;ll be completely off. I might go to the press and do a bit of talking but it&apos;s nothing fancy.&quot; From Brazil, he will travel to Dubai in the new year, having been invited by Godolphin to take part in the Carnival races there in January and February. De Sousa rode four winners in the famous royal blue silks this year and, though it would be a mistake to read much into this (Hanagan also had four for Godolphin), it would surprise no one if Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s team made more use of him in future. That would produce mixed emotions in Fell, pleased to see De Sousa succeeding even while he is &quot;a bit pissed off&quot; that he can no longer secure his services as readily as in the summer of 2006, when the jockey won four times on his Blue Maeve. It is an association that Fell believes helped to kick-start De Sousa&apos;s career in Britain. &quot;He wouldn&apos;t be the most stylish jockey in the world,&quot; Fell says, &quot;but he just gets a tune out of them.&quot; Next year is likely to see the Brazilian having another go at the title, though he insists that you need a certain amount of luck and a flying start just to get into contention. But he does not echo Hanagan&apos;s reservations about the fatigue involved in chasing the championship. &quot;I don&apos;t have to waste. I wake up every morning, eight stone.

A government adviser said Zardari had suffered a &quot;minor heart attack&quot;, but this was at odds with the official spokesman for the president, who said the president had gone for routine tests for a pre-existing heart condition. Rumours of a coup or a resignation forced by the military consumed the media and the internet, fuelled by a report in Foreign Policy magazine that said Zardari was &quot;incoherent&quot; on Monday night during a telephone conversation with Barack Obama. Zardari&apos;s son and political heir-apparent, Bilawal, met prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani in Islamabad, adding to media hysteria about imminent change.

Most talented golfer in the world \u2013 Tiger Woods or Rory McIlroy? &quot;Rory,&quot; said the world&apos;s No1 golfer. &quot;I know Tiger is very, very close and obviously I think Tiger&apos;s work ethic has always been tremendous, and his mindset as well. But in terms of talent? I think Rory has more talent.&quot; Donald has played against both on countless occasions so he should know what he is talking about, not that his opinion invalidates all others. Plenty will disagree, including, one suspects, a certain Mr T Woods of Jupiter Island, Florida. In other words, let the debate begin. But not before the small matter of the Dubai World Championship, and with it the season-long Race to Dubai, two contests in which Donald has more than a passing interest. The world No1 was happy to pay homage to McIlroy&apos;s gifts but the munificence ended there. Nor will it be much in evidence over the next four days as the two golfers, ranked first and second in the Race to Dubai, sort out who will end 2011 as the Europe&apos;s leading money winner \u2013 a contest that remains alive only because of the Northern Irishman&apos;s outrageous victory in Hong Kong on Sunday, where he holed a bunker shot on the final hole to\u00a0win. Anything other than a victory for McIlroy, and Donald would have been crowned the king of European golf, and the Dubai World Championship, for all its hefty prize fund and grandiose title, would have been nothing more than a victory lap. &quot;A bit of me thinks it would have been nice to be sitting on the beach right now with a cocktail in my hand and not worrying about things too much,&quot; the Englishman conceded. &quot;But there is nothing easy in life. You have to earn success and I fully expected Rory to play well [in Hong Kong] and put pressure on me. &quot;I am not surprised at the year he has had. He has probably not won as much as he thought he would but he has got plenty of time for that. I see him winning lots of tournaments and lots of\u00a0majors.&quot; This was a fair and gracious assessment of McIlroy&apos;s talents in general and his effort at the weekend in particular. But there is exerting pressure, and then there is exerting serious pressure. For all McIlroy&apos;s brilliance at the weekend, the Englishman still holds a \u00a3680,000 advantage heading into the final counting event, leaving the Northern Irishman needing to win on Sunday to give himself a chance of winning the order of merit. Even then, he would require Donald to finish outside the top nine places. Everything is possible, but recent experience suggest Halley&apos;s Comet comes round more often than the world No1 has an off-week on the links. Yet there is at least a suspicion around that he might be vulnerable for reasons that have been beyond his control. Donald has endured an emotional few weeks away from the course, with the death of his father, Colin, and the birth of his second daughter coming within four days of each other. It has been a sad time and a reaffirming time for the normally reticent golfer, who spoke movingly on Wednesday about his personal journey over the past few weeks. &quot;There was a wide range of emotions, especially with my dad&apos;s passing coming just a few days before my daughter was born,&quot; he said. &quot;I think the birth did spread a little grace on the situation. It wasn&apos;t easy but I think I was able to concentrate my efforts on a new life and my kids and family. &quot;I lost a good friend in dad, who was someone who I think brought me up in the proper way. He was never really concerned about my golf because he was more concerned with bringing me up as a decent person with good morals and to treat people like I would want to be treated\u00a0myself.&quot; Donald will tee off alongside McIlroy in Thursday&apos;s opening round at the Earth course on the Jumeirah Golf Estates, aiming to become the first player to win the money list on both sides of the Atlantic, albeit that Tiger Woods would have achieved it a number of times had he ever taken up membership of the European Tour. It would be yet another landmark in what has been a career-best year for the Englishman, who has won four times on his way to the top of the world rankings \u2013 much to the chagrin of those who believe a player should secure a major to lay justifiable claim to being the game&apos;s leading performer. If there has been any hint of failure about Donald&apos;s year it has been that he did not really contend in the majors, although he did finish fourth at the Masters. The player has heard the case against himself countless times. &quot;If people want to complain about me not winning a major then that&apos;s fine. But when you say being world number one means you have to win a major \u2026 I don&apos;t understand that. The world rankings are a statistic-based ranking and always have been,&quot; he said. &quot;It doesn&apos;t necessarily get under my skin.

He said: &quot;The opening of London Gateway in just two years&apos; time will transform the UK&apos;s maritime port infrastructure. It will help Britain to maintain its competitiveness, drive productivity, and crucially strengthen our links with Asia and beyond. The importance of this project cannot be overestimated.&quot; But behind the scenes, some industry experts are questioning the wisdom of this grandiose scheme at a time when rival facilities are springing up all over northern Europe and the shipping industry has been tipped into crisis. DP World, partly owned by a Dubai sovereign wealth fund, has promised to create Britain&apos;s &quot;first 21st-century major deep-sea container port&quot; as well as Europe&apos;s largest logistics park. But Felixstowe&apos;s container port on the Suffolk coast has just opened two major new berths while Rotterdam, Antwerp and others are also busy building huge amounts of extra cargo-handling capacity. Meanwhile, the big container ship operators expected to use this capacity are squealing with financial pain and cutting back services. AP Moller-Maersk, owner of the world&apos;s biggest container line, has just announced a 78% fall in third-quarter profits. The current level of liner rates was &quot;totally unsustainable,&quot; said its chief executive, Nils Andersen. Meanwhile Israel&apos;s Zim has followed Chile&apos;s CSAV and South Korea&apos;s Hanjin in raising new cash in desperate bids to keep their shipping businesses afloat, while MISC Berhad of Malaysia has announced plans to pull out of container transport completely. The Kuala Lumpur company is selling allof its 30 vessels after running up nearly $800m (\u00a3510m) of losses since 2008. Even the Chinese are in trouble. A host of ship owners who have leased vessels to Grand China Shipping have been complaining about how the company, which recently closed a trans-Pacific service on the grounds that rates were too low, has been late in making payments on contracts, something it has promised to rectify. The liner (container) sector is the victim of a big downturn in world trade due to the latest sovereign debt crisis and soaring fuel costs, but has also brought trouble on itself by ordering too many new ships \u2013 many very large \u2013 on the back of previous good times when trade between the far east and Europe was booming. Chinese exports to Europe dropped 9% this October compared with the same period in 2010. Foreign trade director Wang Shouwen told the BBC on Wednesday: &quot;There won&apos;t be fundamental improvement in Europe or the United States, and costs at home will stay as high as this year, so the foreign trade situation will be severe next year.&quot; Even the rather more genteel cruise-liner travel business has been pulling in its horns, with one of Britain&apos;s most illustrious names, Cunard, putting its fleet of vessels, including the Queen Mary, under the Bermudan flag in an attempt to improve revenues. You might expect the tanker sector, meanwhile, to be benefiting from increased global demand for oil, especially for supertankers from the Middle East to service emerging economies such as China. Instead the last few weeks have seen a torrent of bad news, with one of the world&apos;s most flamboyant new tanker owners, Peter Georgiopoulos, seeking protection from bankruptcy for his New York-listed General Maritime Corporation. This business was once valued at more than $5.3bn, but its shares have plunged by more than 90% this year as the cost of hiring vessels began to fall to well below operating costs. Frontline, the owner of the world&apos;s biggest tanker fleet, headed by Norwegian billionaire John Fredriksen, is also in trouble, with its shares also down 90% in 2011. The company admitted it could run out of money early next year and this week announced plans to inject $500m from the Fredriksen-controlled and privately owned Hemen Holdings into Frontline, while hiving off the loss-making side of the business into a new company, &quot;Frontline 2012&quot;. Surge Torm, a Danish-based tanker owner, said recently that it expected to run up pre-tax losses of up to $210m for the current financial year and was investigating a rights issue. Statistics from Shipping Intelligence Weekly, a publication by London-based shipbroker Clarkson, show the cost of hiring a 280,000-ton supertanker has plunged in recent years. Earnings per day in 2010 for vessels moving from the Gulf to Europe averaged $26,000, but have fallen to $3,100 this year so far, and hit $1,500 at the start of November. The cost of building a new 320,000-ton tanker has fallen from $150m in 2008 to $100m by the end of 2010 and has declined further since. It is not all disaster. Owners of chemical carriers, who have not been ordering massive amounts of new tonnage as have their counterparts in tankers and containers, have seen a 65% surge in freight rates in some trades over the last six months, while operators of offshore vessels serving the oil industry and liquefied natural gas ships are also in good shape. But the maritime storm hitting the main part of the market is not good for London as a port city, or as a centre for shipbroking, maritime law and shipping finance. This week ACM Shipping, one of the few shipbrokers quoted on the London Stock Exchange, reported that its profits had tumbled in the first half of the year from \u00a33.2m to \u00a32.3m compared with 2010. Richard Fulford-Smith, former chief executive of Clarkson and now a director of RS Platou, a Norwegian-owned broker with offices in London, confirmed that many shipowners could not pay their bills and said bad debt levels were rising. &quot;Financial engineering and an endless supply of debt is now a thing of the past. We are going back to basics and for us sourcing new maritime capital is a nice new challenge \u2013 but I doubt much of the money will come from London,&quot; he said. Meanwhile 25 miles east, down the Thames at the London Gateway, work continues and a steady flow of dignitaries \u2013 Prince Philip, Lord (Chris) Smith and others \u2013 continue to be shown around. DP World says the port is different from rivals because it will be able to handle the new generation of enormous container vessels being built by Maersk and others. A spokesman added that its close proximity to such a large consumer market as London would also &quot;allow both cargo owners and shipping lines a unique opportunity to take significant costs out of their supply chains&quot;. The facility will not open until late 2013, but critics say that allows little time for the problems besetting its customers \u2013 the shipping lines \u2013 to float away.", "title": "Cable sees salvation in London's Gateway port amid shipping crisis", "sentences": ["DP World, partly owned by a Dubai sovereign wealth fund, has promised to create Britain&apos;s &quot;first 21st-century major deep-sea container port&quot; as well as Europe&apos;s largest logistics park."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-07T16:29:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/07/pakistan-president-asif-zardari-resignation", "tags": ["Asif Ali Zardari", "Pakistan", "World news", "Benazir Bhutto"], "article": "Pakistan&apos;s embattled president, Asif Ali Zardari, is determined to resist pressure to quit, say his close aides, after speculation about his resignation was ignited by his sudden hospitalisation in Dubai. Zardari was flown out of Pakistan on Tuesday night following what one government adviser, Mustafa Khokhar, described as a &quot;minor heart attack&quot;. His departure triggered speculation and rumours that he was about to step down under coercion from the military, or even that a coup was in the offing. Zardari, who has been hounded by the media, courts and the military since he took office in 2008, is under pressure over allegations that he offered Washington a deal whereby he would rein in his own military in return for American support for his government. He is due to address a special sitting of parliament over the\u00a0issue. After first causing further confusion by claiming that the president had gone for routine tests, the government later admitted that he sought treatment &quot;following symptoms related to his pre-existing heart condition&quot;. Zardari fell ill on Sunday but refused treatment. His son and political heir-apparent, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, chairman of the ruling Pakistan Peoples party, flew in on Monday to persuade his father to see doctors abroad, according to a close aide of the president. Bilawal, 23, who graduated from Oxford University, is being groomed to take full leadership of the Pakistan Peoples party, which was previously headed by his murdered mother, Benazir Bhutto, and his grandfather before that. Rumours about the seriousness of Zardari&apos;s condition seemed to be confirmed by a US media report that claimed the Pakistani leader was incoherent while speaking to Barack Obama on Sunday, when the US president called to offer his &quot;condolences&quot; over the recent accidental death of 24 Pakistani soldiers manning a post on the border with Afghanistan after US helicopters shelled them. A US official told the Guardian that the Pakistan leader was &quot;not focused&quot; during the conversation with Obama. Zardari will &quot;never ever&quot; resign, said a close aide to the president. &quot;He is not a weak man. He doesn&apos;t crumble under pressure,&quot; said the confidante. Pakistan has been ruled by the military for half its history, and for the rest of the time the armed forces have exercised power behind the scenes \u2013 meaning it does not take much for the nation to become convinced a fresh coup is imminent. The military establishment has long sought to remove Zardari, though they appear to want to keep a civilian government in place for now. The WikiLeaks diplomatic cables revealed that Pakistan&apos;s army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, had discussed removing Zardari with the then US ambassador back in 2009. Dr Asim Hussain, a government minister and doctor who accompanied Zardari to Dubai, told Pakistan&apos;s Geo News channel last night that the president was stable but had been moved to an intensive care ward to get some rest, as he was &quot;getting too many visitors&quot;. Zardari has a history of heart trouble, and he received treatment for it in London earlier this year. &quot;The doctors have yet to determine whether the president&apos;s condition was due to an adverse reaction to the medication he was taking or a development related to his pre-existing cardiac condition,&quot; said a statement from office of the prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilanii, following a meeting between him and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. &quot;The president will remain under observation and return to resume his normal functions as advised by the doctors.&quot; The president is under extreme pressure from the &quot;memo-gate&quot; scandal in Pakistan, where he is accused of being behind a written offer delivered to the US military leadership in the days after the Osama bin Laden raid in May this year. The anonymous memo offered to disband part of the military&apos;s notorious spy agency in return for American support. Pakistan&apos;s US ambassador and close Zardari aide Husain Haqqani has already been forced to resign over the issue, and faces possible treason charges. Ali Dayan Hasan of Human Rights Watch, the international campaigning group, warned against any military intervention. &quot;Constitutional rule of law must be followed and civilian supremacy must be maintained,&quot; he said.", "title": "Asif Ali Zardari 'determined to resist pressure to quit'", "sentences": ["Pakistan&apos;s embattled president, Asif Ali Zardari, is determined to resist pressure to quit, say his close aides, after speculation about his resignation was ignited by his sudden hospitalisation in Dubai.", "Dr Asim Hussain, a government minister and doctor who accompanied Zardari to Dubai, told Pakistan&apos;s Geo News channel last night that the president was stable but had been moved to an intensive care ward to get some rest, as he was &quot;getting too many visitors&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-07T18:40:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/07/memogate-pakistans-terrible-mess", "tags": ["Asif Ali Zardari", "Pakistan", "World news", "Nato", "US foreign policy"], "article": "The war in Afghanistan, as I argued a decade ago, was a potential threat to the stability of the system in Pakistan. Events have long confirmed this view. The US raid on a Pakistan border position a few weeks ago that killed 24 soldiers was only the latest disaster. Motives for the attack remain a mystery but its impact is not. It will create further divisions within the military, further weaken the venal regime of president Asif Ali Zardari, strengthen religious militants and make the US even more hated than it already is in Pakistan. Was it intended as a provocation? Is Barack Obama seriously thinking of unleashing a civil war in an already battered country? Some commentators in Islamabad are arguing this but it&apos;s unlikely that Nato troops will occupy Pakistan. The death of soldiers stirred the mind of the nation to new activity. &quot;Save us from our friends&quot; is a growing sentiment even within the ruling elite. The overall effect has been a growth of dissent within the military and the uncovering of related scandals. It was one of these, described as &quot;memogate&quot;, that may have led a frightened President Zardari to flee the country to Dubai, supposedly for health reasons. Though why Pakistani doctors in the country are considered inferior to their kin in the Gulf is a question posed by many in the country. Army doctors who, according to some reports, did examine him said he was &quot;fine&quot;. A US government official is reported to have said that Zardari was &quot;incoherent&quot; when he spoke with Obama last weekend. His own official admitted he was unfocused. This too is nothing new. What of &quot;memogate&quot;? One of Zardari and his late wife&apos;s trusted bagmen in Washington, Husain Haqqani, has been forced to resign. Haqqani, Pakistan&apos;s ambassador to the US, appears to have been caught red-handed: he allegedly asked Mansoor Ijaz, a multimillionaire close to the US defence establishment, to carry a message to Admiral Mike Mullen pleading for help against the Pakistani military and offering in return to disband the Haqqani network and parts of the security service, the ISI, and carry out all US instructions, including the possibility of de-nuclearising the state. Mullen denied that he had received any message. A military underling contradicted him. Mullen changed his story and said a message had been received and ignored. When the ISI discovered this &quot;act of treachery&quot;, Haqqani, instead of saying that he was acting under orders from Zardari, denied the entire story. Unfortunately for both men, the ISI boss, General Pasha, had met up with Ijaz and been given the BlackBerry with the messages and instructions. Haqqani had no option but to resign. Demands for his trial and hanging are proliferating. Zardari was, until the flight to Dubai, standing by his man. The military wanted his head. Haqqani&apos;s passport has been seized, but his wife, Farahnaz Ispahani, who is also a presidential aide, accompanied Zardari to Dubai. Exhausted by war and the resultant suicide terrorism within its borders, in the opinion of many bled white economically by Zardari, his cronies and the bubble class that lives in its own world \u2013 Pakistan is in a terrible mess, worse than at any time in its recent history. Zardari&apos;s status as a widower of the slain Benazir Bhutto propelled him to the presidency. His main function appears to have been to carry out US instructions and make a lot more money. With the amounts he has accumulated over the years he should not be unduly despondent, unless the pending corruption case in Switzerland is re-opened. There is little doubt that the army want him out. Will they replace him with the prime minister, Yousuf Gilani, as the frontman until the February 2013 elections? Or order a behind-the-scenes dissolution of the existing assembly and install an emergency national government for a year? Two developments are worth bearing in mind. The Chinese foreign office issued (for them) a sharply worded denunciation of the US attack on the Pakistani border post. The party that is currently leading the opposition is Imran Khan&apos;s PTI, whose most popular pledges are independence from the USand a war on corruption.

I have to concede that I didn&apos;t watch a ball of the one-day series in India, and the prospect of three Tests against Pakistan in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, followed by a couple more in Sri Lanka, is not much more attractive. The fact that the opponents for England&apos;s pair of three-day warm-up matches for the Pakistan series next month have still to be confirmed sums up the unavoidably underwhelming nature of the whole business. The lack of interest is such that the BBC only agreed to carry an interview with Andrew Strauss on their website if it was recorded at the cheapest possible location, so hats off to the England captain for agreeing to go through with it in a shed while various workmen continued their carpentry in the background. Fortunately for those of us in need of a spot of cricket to enhance the winter mix of football, rugby union, darts and snooker, there is salvation at hand. The last of Australia&apos;s two-Test series against New Zealand this weekend is in no way a blockbuster, but it does at least come from picturesque Hobart, a location which also provides added interest as this could well be Ricky Ponting&apos;s last Test in Tasmania. But even a poignant Punter ton on home territory beside the Derwent would be comprehensively upstaged if Sachin Tendulkar seizes his moment on Boxing Day at the MCG. All that sentimental guff about him scoring his 100th international century at Lord&apos;s last summer was far too anglocentric. Tendulkar has a better record in Australia than he does in England, going way back to his first tour in 1992 as an 18-year-old, &quot;back when dinosaurs roamed the earth&quot;, according to Peter Lalor in the Australian \u2013 when he helped to ruin Shane Warne&apos;s debut Test in Sydney, and added another century in a badly beaten team in Perth. According to Lalor, Merv Hughes, who was getting quite a pasting during the latter innings, said to his captain, Allan Border: &quot;This little prick&apos;s going to get more runs than you, AB.&quot; It was this assessment, Lalor suggests, that got Hughes a job as an Australian selector. Having sat out the one-day series against West Indies, Tendulkar has already flown to Australia to begin his preparations for Boxing Day, and the first of four Tests that could hardly be set up more intriguingly, irrespective of individual milestones. India clearly have plenty to prove on the road after their miserable performances in England last summer, and must see a youthful and still convalescing Australia as eminently beatable. Yet the Aussies also have reason for optimism after winning a series in Sri Lanka and coming from behind to draw in South Africa, then sweeping the Kiwis aside in Brisbane last week. It might not be the Ashes battle we were all relishing this time last year, but it&apos;s certainly a good enough reason for staying up beyond midnight on Christmas Day, nonetheless. Yorkies look away now Any thoughts on England&apos;s squad for the Pakistan series which is announced on Friday morning? The expectation is that they will name 16, which leaves plenty of room for debate about the balance of the party, and peripheral roles such as extra spinners and a reserve wicketkeeper. I&apos;ve got 13 certs \u2013 Strauss, Cook, Trott, Pietersen, Bell, Morgan, Prior, Bresnan, Swann, Broad, Anderson, Finn, Bopara. Probably Tremlett as the extra seamer, unless they go for Graham Onions. Jonny Bairstow to cover for Prior? Or will Steven Davies get the nod? Panesar as the second spinner? Maybe even Lancashire&apos;s shooting star Simon Kerrigan as the third? If that sounds too parochial, regard it as a convenient link to the launch this week of a book to celebrate Lancashire&apos;s Championship triumph that has been 77 years in the making. Champions \u2026 About Blooming Time (Max Books, \u00a316.99, maxcricket@btinternet.com) has been rushed out in time for Christmas. As one journalist tweeted this week: &quot;An ideal present either for relatives who love Lancashire, or people in Yorkshire you don&apos;t like very much.&quot; The match reports are enhanced by interviews and a few offbeat anecdotes, including a couple from Jim Cumbes, the club&apos;s long-serving chief executive. After speculating on future career options including driving a tram and working in a zoo, the former Aston Villa goalkeeper reflects on that dramatic and excruciating last afternoon at Taunton, which he followed from Old Trafford having decided not to make the journey to Somerset. &quot;It was on TV in the offices,&quot; Cumbes recalls, &quot;and by 4pm there must have been 25 people there watching \u2013 and one giraffe.&quot; Cumbes does not explain why Lanky, the club mascot, was present at Old Trafford on a Thursday afternoon in September. But the Reverend Malcolm Lorimer, the club chaplain and historian who has published the book, must have been tempted to change the title to 25 People and a Giraffe. &quot;In my line of work, you have to have faith,&quot; the Reverend explained at Tuesday&apos;s Old Trafford launch, which was attended by most of the players who are already back in full training for their 2012 title defence. &quot;But I must admit, it was tested at times.&quot; The county have also launched a double DVD, Lancashire&apos;s Magical Season \u2013 available from the club shop at \u00a315, reduced to \u00a312 for members \u2013 featuring match coverage, interviews, the eventful trip to Buckingham Palace to meet the Duke of Edinburgh, and even commentary from Gordon Burns, formerly of The Krypton Factor. Sorry, Yorkies, but these celebrations are going to last a while yet. Oh brother Elsewhere this week, the former Lancashire all-rounder Andrew Symonds has been confirmed as an entrant for India&apos;s latest series of Big Brother, and much more seriously, there was a possible case of umpire stoning after Bangladesh&apos;s defeat by Pakistan in Chittagong. &quot;It&apos;s true a stone hit the window of their car,&quot; said Mesbahuddin Serniabat, security chief of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Another five, and presumably one of the umpires would have called &quot;Over&quot;. Wednesday 14 December 3pm GMT update \u2022 Is there a more universally respected and admired player in world cricket today than Rahul Dravid? writes Rob Bagchi. When India toured England in 2002 he was a regular visitor to Sportspages bookshop on Charing Cross Road, bought a copy of Ken Dryden&apos;s The Game, a searing account of the exhilarations and propensity for violence in the National Hockey League and he purchased several more books from the section we used to call &quot;Reflections on the Game&quot;. Last night it was time for his reflections on his own game when he delivered the annual Bradman Oration at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, and he outlined a vision for the future and the path administrators should follow which was full of wisdom. &quot;Cricket must find a middle path,&quot; Dravid said. &quot;It must scale down this mad merry-go-round that teams and players find themselves in: heading off for two-Test tours and seven-match ODI series with a few Twenty20s thrown in.&quot; &quot;Test cricket deserves to be protected, it is what the world&apos;s best know they will be judged by,&quot; he said. &quot;Where I come from, nation versus nation is what got people interested in cricket in the first place. When I hear the news that a country is playing without some of its best players, I always wonder, what do their fans think? &quot;People may not be able to turn up to watch Test cricket but everyone follows the scores. We may not fill 65,000 capacity stadiums for Test matches, but we must actively fight to get as many as we can in, to create a Test match environment that the players and the fans feed off. Anything but the sight of Tests played on empty grounds. &quot;For that, we have got to play Test cricket that people can watch. I don&apos;t think day-night Tests or a Test championship should be dismissed. In March of last year I played a day-night first-class game in Abu Dhabi for the MCC \u2013 and my experience from that was that day-night Tests is an idea seriously worth exploring. There may be some challenges in places where there is dew but the visibility and durability of the pink cricket ball was not an issue. &quot;Since about, I think 1985, people have been saying that there is too much meaningless one-day cricket,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s finally time to do something about it \u2026 Anything makes more sense than seven-match ODI series.&quot; Moving on to corruption, he argued for players to be willing to take lie-detector tests: &quot;Even if it means giving up a little bit of freedom of movement and privacy, if it means undergoing dope tests, let us never say no,&apos;&apos; he said. &quot;If it means undergoing lie-detector tests, let us understand the technology, what purpose it serves and accept it. Now lie-detectors are by no means perfect but they could actually help the innocent clear their names. Similarly, we should not object to having our finances scrutinised.&quot; Dravid said players &quot;must take pride in belonging to a sport that is professional and progressive. When the first anti-corruption measures were put into place, we did moan a little bit about being accredited and depositing our cell phones with the manager. &quot;But now, we must treat it like we do airport security because we know it is for our own good and our own security,&quot; Dravid said. Hopefully the ICC will heed the advice of someone who has the good of the game in his heart.

China Central Television hopes to win millions of viewers in the US and Africa with English-language services produced in Washington and Nairobi. It is the latest in a multibillion-pound soft power push, as Beijing searches for a &quot;cultural aircraft carrier&quot; to extend its global influence. &quot;Global competition nowadays is not just political and economic, but cultural \u2026 Countries that take the dominant position in cultural development and own strong cultural soft power are the ones that gain the initiative in fierce international competition,&quot; argued an essay in Chinese journal Leadership Decision-Making Information last month. Beijing has created almost 300 Confucius institutes around the world, teaching Chinese language and culture, and spent a reported \u00a34bn on expanding state media. It has created a new English language newspaper, Russian and Arabic TV channels and a 24-hour English news station run by the Xinhua state news agency. In a sign of how far the Chinese media reaches, you can buy the European edition of the English-language China Daily in a Sheffield and read Xinhua&apos;s Kenyan &quot;mobile newspaper&quot; on your phone in Nairobi. In Boston, China Radio International has claimed the frequency previously owned by WILD-AM \u2013 &quot;home for classic soul and R&amp;B&quot; \u2013 to the surprise of listeners. Beijing has also attempted to harness the credibility of established western media, distributing 2.5m copies of China Daily&apos;s China Watch supplement in the Washington Post, New York Times, and Daily Telegraph. The China Central Television (CCTV) expansion is arguably the most ambitious, although the broadcaster declined to answer queries about the plans. According to its website, it had 49 staff posted abroad in November 2010 \u2013 with 10 more in Hong Kong and Macau \u2013 and wants overseas staff to increase to 280 by 2012. That number should rise to 500 by 2016, across 80 bureaus. At the heart of operations will be six hubs: two probably in London and Dubai and others in South America and the Asia Pacific region. It is understood to have hired some 150 people, with Washington gaining 60 staff. Most will be working for the English- and other foreign-language channels. Zhong Xin, a journalism professor at Renmin University in Beijing, said Chinese media had long wanted to expand and that incidents in 2008 and 2009 \u2013 such as protests during the Olympic torch relay and riots in Xinjiang \u2013 persuaded the government of the need, because it wanted China&apos;s voice to be heard. Dong Tiance, a journalism professor at Jinan University in southern China, said: &quot;Official bodies, media organisations and academia have agreed that our previous external publicity has had problems. These overseas initiatives are improving this, for example, by hiring senior local journalists and experts.&quot; CCTV has hired Jim Laurie, a former ABC and NBC broadcaster turned consultant, to advise it and has offered generous salaries for local staff. According to his website, CCTV will broadcast at least an hour of programming daily by early 2012, and four hours by June, from its new studios. It has leased 3,300 sq m (36,000 sq ft) at a central Washington address for a reported $1.5m (\u00a3953,000). In Nairobi, the Kenyan vice-president has said Chinese officials plan to increase CCTV&apos;s staff from 12 to 150. It has poached high-profile anchors from local networks for CCTV Africa. Whether these efforts will be repaid in viewing figures remains to be seen. One challenge has been delivery: Xinhua&apos;s CNC World news channel was originally available only online, although it can now be watched via Sky in the UK and Time Warner Cable in the US. CCTV services are now available via non-profit broadcaster MHz Networks in Washington and it hopes adding unconventional means of delivery \u2013 perhaps showing programmes in shops \u2013 could extend its audience. The second challenge has been persuading people to watch. Even at home, commercial rivals often trounce state offerings and there is widespread cynicism about news content. Chinese internet-users last week reacted angrily to remarks by CCTV&apos;s new boss, who said journalists&apos; primary responsibility was to be a &quot;mouthpiece&quot;. Hu Zhanfan, who gave the speech earlier this year as editor-in-chief of the official Guangming Daily, said &quot;news workers&quot; who defined themselves as journalism professionals instead of in terms of Communist party propaganda work were making a fundamental error. While foreign-language state media are allowed to go further than those intended for a domestic audience, there are still tight constraints on their work. &quot;In general people are perhaps still suspicious about the quality of some of the news programmes,&quot; acknowledged Dong Guanpeng, a former CCTV anchor who teaches journalism at Tsinghua University in Beijing and has advised officials on media policy. But he said CCTV could reach an audience of opinion-formers on China to begin with and that non-news programming, such as cultural shows, would increase its appeal. Arnold Zeitlin, a veteran correspondent turned consultant who teaches journalism at the Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, said numerous countries had attempted similar media pushes unsuccessfully. He questioned the point of spending &quot;huge gobs of money&quot; on the media expansion without addressing issues such as China&apos;s human rights record. &quot;I would be surprised, if not disappointed, if most people buy it,&quot; he said. &quot;To change China&apos;s image it is necessary to alter Chinese policy and outlook.&quot; Additional research by Han Cheng", "title": "Chinese state TV unveils global expansion plan", "sentences": ["At the heart of operations will be six hubs: two probably in London and Dubai and others in South America and the Asia Pacific region."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-08T14:01:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/lawrence-donegan-golf-blog/2011/dec/08/paul-lawrie-dubai-world-championship", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Despite scurrilous claims to the contrary Paul Lawrie \u2013 an Open champion in 1999 and multiple winner at the highest level \u2013 has always been a very fine golfer.

Their method is simple enough and successful with it: bat the opposition into oblivion and then bowl them out with pace, bounce, swing and reverse swing at one end, and Graeme Swann at the other. They win by big margins and, in the first overseas tour since the Ashes success last winter, they are unlikely, even in a novel part of the world for them, to want to deviate from a tried and tested path to which even Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s would struggle not to give a AAA\u00a0rating. Indeed there is a good chance that with the exception of Paul Collingwood, from whom they would have moved on had he not pre-empted them and retired from Tests after the Sydney win, and Ajmal Shahzad, who was a later, if pre-planned, addition to the original party, the trip to Dubai and Abu Dhabi next month to play three Tests against Pakistan will be nothing more than an Ashes reunion. And England, regardless of the balance of the side that Pakistan put out in winning their recent three-Test series against Sri Lanka in the United Arab Emirates (they played two specialist spinners and frequently bowled a third, although the seamers enjoyed equal success), will look to win with their usual recipe of pace and reverse swing allied to Swann once more, rather than change tack. It leaves few debating points for selectors once the strategy has been settled: a reserve batsman to replace Collingwood now that Eoin Morgan is fit again following his shoulder operation; some chatter about a reserve spinner; the need or otherwise for a second specialist keeper; and whether some clever tinkering with a 16-man squad could just give them the option of playing a second spinner if either of the venues appears as if the Sahara has encroached on to the pitch. The reserve spinner is readily settled. Monty Panesar remains one of the world&apos;s best spinners, has a fine Test record over 39 matches, has been creating an excellent impression in Sydney grade cricket following another fine year for Sussex, and is the only credible candidate as a single replacement for Swann should he become ill or injured, capable of versatility in his role. Playing him as one of two spinners remains less persuasive given the weakening of the batting that would be required as a result. The other three issues could be interlinked, however. As it stands, Ravi Bopara, who played two Tests last summer when Jonathan Trott was injured, is the next in line, the only concern being whether already he has not been given sufficient opportunity to show some consistency and has failed to do so. Behind him probably come Nottinghamshire&apos;s new signing James Taylor and Jonny Bairstow of Yorkshire. With regards the wicketkeeping, it was Steven Davies who toured Australia as the second keeper during the Tests, before he was jettisoned during the one-day series. England found him a little too diffident. He may well be selected again, although there is a strong argument which suggests that the second wicketkeeper gets a game only on the rarest occasions \u2013 less so than reserve batsmen or bowlers \u2013 and unless an indisposition occurs on the morning of a match, as happened to Brad Haddin at Edgbaston two years ago for example, can readily be accessed from reserve squads on the subcontinent. Here Bairstow could play a part. He is seen as a future England batsman rather than batsman-keeper, and his glovework can border on the rustic, while his outfielding is as good as any in the England squads of which he has been part. But on the successful tour of India in 1976, Tony Greig had Roger Tolchard \u2013 a hamfisted keeper but an excellent player of spin \u2013 rather than Bob Taylor as Alan Knott&apos;s deputy, and he ended up playing as a batsman. Likewise, in selecting Bairstow now rather than Bopara as the reserve batsman, and letting it be known that he could keep in an absolute emergency, it would free up a place for an all-rounder who bowled spin \u2013 Samit Patel, for example, whose avoirdupois continues to frustrate the management but who showed recently in India that he is as good a player of spin as anyone they have, or the leg-spinner Scott Borthwick, either of whom could play in extreme circumstances that would see Matt Prior move up to six. All of which may be overcomplicating things. England do not want Prior at six and that is an end to the matter.

One day after paying the ultimate compliment to the natural gifts of Rory McIlroy, Luke Donald was on the receiving end of them in the opening round of the Dubai World Championship. More talent than Tiger Woods? It would be hard to disagree after watching the Northern Irishman shoot 30 on the back nine of the Earth course at the Jumeirah golf estate, a virtuoso effort that bested the world No1 over the stretch of holes by nine shots. That was the bad news for Donald, who is seeking to become the first player to win the official money list on both sides of the Atlantic. The good news is that he beat McIlroy by three shots on the front side. Still, a level-par round of 72 for Donald placed him 26th in a field of 58 players, six shots behind McIlroy, whose 66 left him in third place after the opening day, two shots behind the tournament leader Peter Hanson and one behind the former Open champion Paul Lawrie. The Swede and the Scot both produced wonderful rounds but it was inevitable that most of the attention would focus on the world&apos;s two top-ranked players, Donald being No1 and McIlroy No2. Those rankings will not change whatever the result on Sunday. But the Race to Dubai standings may. If McIlroy wins and if Donald finishes outside the top nine, then McIlroy will finish 2011 as Europe&apos;s leading money winner. In the context of that personal battle six shots is a mighty advantage to hand to a player who is in the form of his life and could hardly be more motivated. &quot;I made three silly mistakes on the front nine but stayed patient and the back nine was pretty much flawless,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;It was the perfect start for me and really sets me up for the next three days. I didn&apos;t expect Luke to play the way he did.&quot; Of those three mistakes the most glaring was his decision to take a swipe at his ball with a five-wood from the rough at the 2nd \u2013 a poor shot which saw said ball disappear into a thick bush. It was never found and McIlroy ran up a double-bogey seven. It is typical of his form that he hit his approach shot at the next to tap-in distance and then did the same thing at the 5th. Not only did the two birdies repair the damage, they restored the sheen on his reputation. Nothing seems beyond the 22-year-old these days. He won in Hong Kong last weekend with a holed bunker shot on the final hole of the tournament. Mr Invincible? &quot;Definitely not,&quot; he said. &quot;But every time I tee it up on the golf course I feel like I have a good chance of shooting a good score. My game is in good shape. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve finished outside the top four since the US PGA [eight events ago]. I don&apos;t feel like I have to think about very much; everything is sort of stress-free. I don&apos;t want to say it&apos;s easy but it is nice when you get on a run like this. It&apos;s not going to last forever, I&apos;m sure.&quot; All in all, it must have been a chastening experience for Donald, who was paired alongside McIlroy for the day after he compared him favourably with Tiger Woods in terms of pure talent, though not as an all-round player. How could he when the American has won 83 times around the world, including 14 majors, and McIlroy has won only five times? Alas for Donald, his comments went round the world and were misinterpreted from Tallahassee to Timbuktu. It was a distraction he could probably have done without, though to his credit he said he was untroubled by the fuss. His greater concern was an inability to find the fairway consistently, especially at a course where the rough has been allowed to grow and the shrubbery is both abundant and nasty. Twice on the back nine Donald had to take a penalty drop after leaving his ball in an unplayable lie. &quot;I felt very much in control and then I lost it but this course can do that to you. There are a lot of hazards in the middle of fairways, so you aim for one side and, if you miss it, you can be in the bushes,&quot; he said before heading off to the driving range to work on his swing. &quot;I have got to take care of my own business.

The Surrey wicketkeeper will travel as cover for Matt Prior having been selected ahead of Yorkshire&apos;s Jonny Bairstow, who misses out completely as Ravi Bopara retains his place as reserve batsman. Davies has been neglected since his surprising omission from England&apos;s World Cup squad in January, shortly before he became the first international cricketer to come out as gay. However, the 25-year-old will have more relevant experience of playing in the UAE than most of the rest of the squad, as he was included in the MCC side who faced Nottinghamshire in Abu Dhabi in March. He made 64 in that game, sharing a partnership of 121 with Rahul Dravid, and then top-scored with 48 from 30 balls in a t20 match in Dubai \u2013 with fears that his sexuality might become an issue in the Emirates, where homosexual behaviour is illegal, proving unfounded. He also had a good summer with Surrey, passing 1,000 first-class runs and playing a key role in their late-season surge to promotion from Division Two of the County Championship. &quot;He&apos;s continued to progress in domestic cricket and showed what a quality player he is,&quot; said Geoff Miller, England&apos;s national selector, when he explained Davies&apos;s recall on Sky Sports News. &quot;There are one or two other keeper-batters knocking on the door, which is great for us. But Steven has shown what he is capable of doing so remains as the second wicketkeeper.&quot; Davies&apos;s occasional county team-mate Chris Tremlett also returns after recovering from a back injury sustained in the first Test of England&apos;s 4-0 whitewash of India last summer. Tremlett is currently training in South Africa with James Anderson and Stuart Broad, two more of the quintet of fast bowlers selected by England. Broad is also returning after injury, in his case to a shoulder, and Tim Bresnan has had an elbow operation, while Steve Finn has been playing domestic cricket in New Zealand. Monty Panesar is selected to provide spinning support to Graeme Swann, and Miller agreed that the surfaces in the UAE could lead to his first Test appearance since the 2009 Ashes series, adding: &quot;Monty had a super season with Sussex last year and he could play a very good part.&quot; Eoin Morgan returns after shoulder surgery. He is currently preparing in India with Prior and the captain, Andrew Strauss.

We&apos;ve had a few niggling injuries but they have been rectified now.&quot; So it was no surprise to find the England national selector announcing a 16-man squad for the forthcoming Test series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates that, with the singular exception of Paul Collingwood, who retired from Test cricket after the win in Sydney almost a year ago, is unchanged from the one that retained the Ashes in Australia last\u00a0winter. It means the inclusion of Ravi Bopara, as Collingwood&apos;s replacement, and the retention both of Monty Panesar as the second spinner to Graeme Swann and Steven Davies as reserve keeper. Bopara was involved in the Tests against India towards the end of last summer when Jonathan Trott was injured and made one half-century. There are still doubts about whether he can put in the consistent performances that England are seeking from their batsmen now. Alternatives that would have been debated include James Taylor, who will be transferring from Leicestershire to Nottinghamshire this coming season, and Jonny Bairstow, who might conceivably have gained a place instead of Davies, as a potential emergency stop-gap wicketkeeper. An important element in Bopara&apos;s selection, though, as it once was with Collingwood, is that he is capable of bowling some good fill-in overs. Going into the relative unknown of Test cricket in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, England will be mindful that although Pakistan seamers achieved success in a recent series in UAE against Sri Lanka, there may be a situation in which they want to play two spinners. In this case, it is unlikely in the extreme that they would want to weaken the batting by moving Matt Prior up the order. So with a four-man attack in that situation, Bopara would come in as a key element. Following what Miller described as a super season with Sussex, Panesar has been playing and enjoying grade cricket in Sydney, where he has found a mentor in the former Australia spinner Greg Matthews, who has mainly been encouraging him to bowl a tighter line. Panesar&apos;s strength lies in his ability to tie batsmen down, especially those with a more attacking bent, and he has an excellent Test match record over 39 games. There is evidence, too, that he is more confident in his ability now to act on his instincts, where previously, for example, he was subservient to captains who did not understand his field-placing needs. As a pair, Swann and Panesar would be as good as any in the game. Having opted not to risk Bairstow as a second keeper, which might have freed up a spot for an additional spin-bowling all-rounder such as Samit Patel, there was little doubt that England would return to Davies, who was omitted only from the one-day plans in the lead-in to the World Cup early this year. In Australia, he was largely a peripheral figure, and one touring while in the process of deciding to come out as gay. The response to that has been all that he might have hoped, and he is said to be a more outgoing person as a result. His keeping, though, has yet to reach the sort of levels that many expected during his early career with Worcestershire, although the manner in which Bruce French, the England wicketkeeping coach, has helped elevate Prior&apos;s game to the extent that he is now the world&apos;s leading wicketkeeper-batsman will provide further encouragement as England look not just to the immediate future but beyond that. Now it remains to be seen whether England can bring the level of intensity to their preparations that they managed against excellent quality opposition leading into the Ashes. As yet there is no indication of whom they will be playing in their warm-up matches, but Miller was quick to make clear that the days of Duncan Fletcher&apos;s 12- and 13-a-side games are long gone. &quot;Whichever opposition they come up against, they still have to get used to the conditions,&quot; Miller said. &quot;We get our house in order rather than worry about others. We have got to No1 in the world and now we have got to maintain it. This trip is vital to that.

Here is a man who can talk with equal facility about the regional tensions of the Arab spring and his unlikely devotion to John &quot;Budgie&quot; Burridge, English football&apos;s grand goalkeeping eccentric of the 1980s. Habsi had the worst game of his Premier League career last weekend, ushering into his own net two distinctly soft goals as Wigan got back to losing ways against Arsenal at the DW Stadium, a defeat that left Roberto Mart\u00ednez&apos;s team bottom of the table. But West Bromwich Albion are likely to see a more familiar Habsi on Saturday afternoon, something closer to the balletically gymnastic, unexpectedly imposing figure who was voted Wigan&apos;s player of the year last season, has 70 caps for Oman and has been goalkeeper of the tournament at the last four Gulf Cups. Habsi is known for his bounce \u2013 this is the most self-propelling of footballers, a gentle soul with a planetary-sized well of quiet self-belief who emerged from rural Oman to become a regional superstar in the petrodollar-inflected Premier League. This is the other thing about Habsi, who turns 30 at the end of this month: despite the sense of being little more than a peripheral curiosity in five largely anonymous years at Bolton Wanderers prior to his emergence at Wigan last season, he is unquestionably a superstar. &quot;You can&apos;t imagine how happy people are when they see me on the TV playing,&quot; Habsi says, reclining after a morning&apos;s solo training in the hail and sleet at Wigan&apos;s suburban training complex. &quot;All Arab countries, they are really, really crazy about the Premier League. Three years ago Man United played against Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia and there were 70,000 people there. They know every player in the Premier League, they follow everything with the internet and TV. They just talk about football, football, football.&quot; It is an enthusiasm that is often overlooked when talk turns to Qatar&apos;s successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup, an object of unanimous scepticism in this country. &quot;I think it&apos;s great to give a Middle East country the chance to have the World Cup,&quot; Habsi says, genuinely gripped by the prospect of a World Cup in his nation&apos;s near neighbour. &quot;When South Africa got the World Cup everyone was shocked. How would it be? How would the security be? But it was fantastic. Knowing the people in Qatar, it&apos;s going to be one of the best World Cups ever. &quot;Many people talk about the heat. At the World Cup in 1994 in America the semi-final was played in 45C. Nobody talked about the heat then. What is the difference between the heat in America and the heat in Qatar? I&apos;ve played in the stadium in Qatar. Outside the heat is 45C but when you go inside on the pitch it&apos;s 26C, because everywhere inside has got AC turned on. It&apos;s an open stadium, but all the seats and everywhere is AC and it spreads to the pitch. It won&apos;t be a problem.&quot; Raised in a village close to Muscat, Habsi &quot;started like all people in the Middle East, playing in the street in my village. You don&apos;t have a grass pitch, you play on sand or on stones. I started as a striker, but when I got to 16 my brother said, &apos;Ali, why don&apos;t you try to be a goalkeeper?&apos; But I was just playing for fun, I never even dreamed I&apos;d be in the national team, let alone the Premier League.&quot; It was as a fringe player with the Oman Under-17 team that Habsi experienced his first great bounce up the footballing ladder, and the start of an enjoyably odd-couple involvement with the ever-popular Burridge, a man who reportedly slept in his goalkeeping gloves and once instructed his wife to throw fruit at him when he wasn&apos;t expecting it, in order to sharpen his reflexes. Habsi was a fringe player and a part-time fireman at Muscat airport when he caught the eye of Oman&apos;s new goalkeeping coach with a single penalty save in a training match. &quot;Budgie said: &apos;I saw how you saved that penalty and I can see in you that you can go very far. Concentrate, train hard and I will promise you I&apos;ll get you to England.&apos; I said: &apos;What?&apos; I was playing in the third division in Oman at the time.&quot; Habsi dissolves into giggles at the thought. Burridge&apos;s version is a little more to the point. Earlier this year, he told the Independent: &quot;I looked at the size of him and thought: &apos;Shit!&apos; I tested his jump. He had a metre standing jump. His father has a Tanzanian heritage and you see that in him. He&apos;s got that African jump. He could bounce!&quot; That bounce took him through a successful trial at Bolton as an 18-year-old, with the man he refers to with delightful sense of due respect as &quot;Big Sam&quot;. From there he went to Norway for three years, playing for Lyn Oslo, in order to get a work permit and qualify to play in the Premier\u00a0League. &quot;I was so happy,&quot; he says. &quot;I was the first player from the Middle East to sign and play in Europe. To be honest I didn&apos;t know anything about Norway. When I arrived there I was shocked, the snow\u00a0and the dark all day. But when you have a dream you forget everything else. It was a fantastic three\u00a0years.&quot; Habsi joined Bolton in 2006. His dedication, a sense of professional asceticism, stands out. Habsi is an extremely rare thing: a devout Muslim in a Premier League that offers a welter of ungodly distractions. &quot;Being a Muslim has really, really helped me a lot,&quot; he says. &quot;Islam is a lot of dedication. Don&apos;t drink, train hard. It makes me very proud. I&apos;m not playing in this country for myself, I&apos;m playing for Oman and also for the region and for my faith.&quot; He also has nothing but praise for the tolerance of the Premier League. &quot;You hear many things, but my personal experience here and in Bolton is just support. Everything is halal here, in the canteen and in the hotel. It is brilliant. Even when it is time for prayer, the other players respect that. When we go to away games before kick-off there is a special place for me to go and pray.&quot; Outside football, Habsi mixes with the north-west&apos;s expat Omani community via his wife, a student at Salford University, and frequents the Indian restaurants of Rusholme. Oman, with its thriving port capital, Muscat, and its Persian-Portuguese roots, is a relatively soft-edged sultanate. It remained largely untouched by the recent Arab spring. It is a subject on which Habsi chooses his words carefully. &quot;In Oman it is calm. Yes there&apos;s a little bit [of unrest] but our majesty is doing all the things for the people. And there is a very good relationship with England. When you hear about these things on the news it is different sometimes to what is really happening. What is happening in Libya, the people feel not everything is right and that&apos;s why they need to change. The same with all the countries. I hope they are going to have a better future. They are happy now but it&apos;s not going to be easy. What happens next is the question.&quot; Habsi is also well-placed to comment on Manchester City&apos;s recent makeover at the hands of Sheikh Mansour and his associates, natives of Oman&apos;s grand neighbour, the United Arab Emirates. &quot;They are fantastic people, safe people,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m not just talking about football. When you go to Abu Dhabi and Dubai you see how people respect them. Sheikh Mansour has the money but they don&apos;t just buy the club, they buy it and they do it properly. People in the Middle East follow Manchester City now.

Now Rory McIlroy has to overcome the biggest hitting player in the world too. And just to make matters worse, McIlroy is low on energy having been suffering from what could be a mild case of dengue fever. McIlroy, for whom it is victory at the Dubai World Championship or bust, heads into the weekend with a comfortable three-shot advantage over Luke Donald, the leader of the season-long Race to Dubai. Less comfortably McIlroy finds himself in third place in the tournament, five shots behind the leader, Alvaro Quir\u00f3s. The Spaniard&apos;s eight-under-par 64 on Friday was two shots better than anyone else in the field. McIlroy is not a man to be intimidated but there was a hint of trepidation as he contemplated the two rounds ahead. He needs to win on Sunday to give himself any chance of topping the European Tour&apos;s money list for the first time in his career. Even then he will need Donald to finish no higher than 10th. After 36 holes Donald was in 12th place. &quot;I have got a bit of an uphill battle ahead of me but it is still possible,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;I am only five shots behind Alvaro, which you can make up in nine holes. I&apos;ve just got to be patient and bide my time and play as good as I can. I&apos;m going to see a doctor again tomorrow night. They said it could have been dengue fever [an illness transmitted by a mosquito bite], food poisoning or a number of different things. My immune system is a little low and it&apos;s taking my body more time to recover.&quot; The 22-year-old holed a bunker shot on the final hole to win in Hong Kong last week so, as he says, everything is possible. Yet Quir\u00f3s is in a rich vein of form and the Earth course at the Jumeirah Golf Estates \u2013 a bomber&apos;s paradise if ever there was one \u2013 might have been designed with\u00a0him in mind. No one hits the ball further. His weakness lies on the greens, where his putting might best be described as streaky. He can be good or he can be bad with the flat stick. On Friday he was exceptional, running in six birdies\u00a0over the opening 17 holes. His very best came at the par-five 18th. Two mighty hits left him 30 feet\u00a0from the hole, from where he rolled in the putt for eagle to reached the halfway point of the tournament on 12\u00a0under par, four shots ahead of Sweden&apos;s Peter\u00a0Hanson. So much for the organisers&apos; hopes of a two-man contest between McIlroy and Donald, the top-ranked players in the world. After his round Quir\u00f3s took an obvious delight in upsetting the apple cart. &quot;Rory and Luke are not the only two players in the tournament,&quot; he said with a big grin. &quot;I mean, the rest of us are here trying to ruin the party, otherwise the competition wouldn&apos;t be as stiff. That&apos;s a good thing, right?&quot; It is, although there will not have been many murmurs of agreement in the sponsor&apos;s luxury box. Dubai Properties has endured a torrid time in the global economic downturn and, having put up a prize fund of $15m (\u00a39.5m) (half of which will be distributed in bonus money to the top 15 players in the Race to Dubai), the last thing they want is a battle royal between Quir\u00f3s and Hanson\u00a0\u2013\u00a0not that they would ever say such a thing in\u00a0public. The dream scenario is for McIlroy to turn in another storming weekend and for Donald to stay exactly where he is until the denouement. This is asking a lot, especially of Donald, who has comprehensively buried his reputation as a reliable plodder over the course of this season. These days he plays to win, not keep the bank manager happy, although he did confess to feeling a bit twitchier than he has for a long time after the second round. &quot;When there is such a lot on the line you feel a bit more nervous but sometimes that can be a good thing. I know what&apos;s at stake and it&apos;s a big deal to me. You try not to let those nerves affect your form, you try to use it to your benefit. Compared to some other tournaments, the first and second rounds have been a little bit more nervous,&quot; he said. Not as nervous as some European Tour officials, who spent Friday checking and rechecking the exact amounts of money won by Donald and McIlroy during the course of this year. &quot;We are sure the money list is right but we just want to have peace of mind,&quot; one said. No wonder.

Overturn set the running as always, but while he managed to shake off most of the field on the run down the hill, Geraghty was always going easily on Grandouet, who was third in the Triumph Hurdle at Cheltenham back in March.  He joined Overturn at the last and stayed on well up the hill to win by four lengths. Quantativeeasing wins Spinal Research Chase at Cheltenham 2.45pm: Quantativeeasing, the mount rejected by Tony McCoy, stormed up the Cheltenham hill to snatch victory in the Spinal Research Chase The Atlantic 4 Gold Cup at 6-1. Ridden by Barry Geraghty, Quantativeeasing beat Medermit (11-1), who also finished well, with Roudoudou Ville (10-1) third after jumping the last with a clear lead.  Fourth was I&apos;msingingtheblues (25-1). McCoy&apos;s choice, the heavily-backed favourite Sunnyhillboy, never got competitive. Woolcombe Folly was a late withdrawal, on a technicality relating to cheekpieces, leaving 16 runners.  Deireadh Re wins Albert Bartlett Hurdle at Cheltenham 2.10pm Greg Wood at Cheltenham: Deireadh Re was a winning 2-1 joint-favourite in the Grade Two Albert Bartlett Novice Hurdle, but only thanks to the last-flight fall of Sea Of Thunder, who had sprinted clear of the field in the home straight.  Ruby Walsh&apos;s mount had been held up early on before launching a challenge down the hill, but he was a distant second when he was left in a narrow lead by the departure of Sea Of Thunder. The impressive performance of Sea Of Thunder to that point is a compliment to Hazy Tom, who beat him at Wetherby last time out and is due to run at Ascot next Friday. Today&apos;s best bets, by Tony Paley David Pipe can win his second major Saturday prize at Cheltenham this season with the well-handicapped, bold-jumping Salut Flo (2.30) in the Spinal Research The Atlantic 4 Gold Cup . Great Endeavour won the Paddy Power Chase for the Somerset trainer last month and will be a popular choice again but it his stablemate who catches the eye. Salut Flo&apos;s form of a couple of seasons back could not have worked out better and his long absence, caused by injury, is never a major worry where this yard is concerned. 1.55 Cheltenham Paul Nicholls had a strong number of entries lined up for this prize and relies on Deireadh Re. A reproduction of his second to Valid Reason at Ascot last month should be good enough in this company. 2.45 Doncaster Kie will provide tough opposition here, but Ranjaan was all the rage prior to finishing runner-up on his hurdling debut at Newbury in what will no doubt prove a hot race. His jumping could be improved but he has plenty of potential and earns a narrow vote. 3.05 Cheltenham A tight contest in prospect but Grandouet has been talked of as a Champion Hurdle candidate and there was an awful lot to like about his Haydock victory last month. 3.20 Doncaster In the Hennessy Gold Cup the stamina of Tullamore Dew gave out but he ran well for a long way and today&apos;s drop in class can see him back to winning ways. He is back on the same mark as when third at the Cheltenham Festival in a competitive novice handicap in March. 3.35 Cheltenham Third place in the Champion Hurdle to two high-class performers in Hurricane Fly and Peddlers Cross in March was clearly no disgrace for Oscar Whisky and a subsequent victory in the Aintree Hurdle at the Grand National meeting proved he would be even better suited by this sort of trip. He was conceding Overturn 8lb and in with every chance when tipping up at the last flight at Ascot on his reappearance and this looks his chance for compensation. Horse sense Tony McCoy&apos;s choice of Sunnyhillboy for Saturday&apos;s feature race at Cheltenham was not just a surprise to punters. Quantitativeeasing (2.30) has been going well at Nicky Henderson&apos;s yard since he was second in a similar race last month and is fancied to go one better. An each-way alternative may be Ghizao, whose owners have been radiating confidence this week. Henderson&apos;s Grandouet (3.05) turned in an exceptional piece of work this week and connections are hoping for a big run in the International Hurdle, especially if the going stays on the fast side. This is basically a trial to see if he copes well enough with Cheltenham to be a genuine Champion Hurdle contender. Oscar Whisky (3.35) crashed out at the final flight at Ascot when challenging Overturn and possibly getting tired, but he is believed to be significantly fitter for Saturday&apos;s Relkeel Hurdle. Tanks For That (1.20) and Mossley (12.45) may make this the first Saturday of the core jumps season when Henderson creates a really big splash. Dubai Crest (1.40) could score for the yard at Doncaster. Highly Efficient (12.10) is capable of causing an upset in Cheltenham&apos;s opener.

An overblown story, implied the BBC&apos;s cricket correspondent, Jonathan Agnew, only to discover that criticising the Mail&apos;s sports desk on the day of their Christmas party was bound to invite some enthusiastic sniper fire in return. Agnew&apos;s protest was well meant, originating in the belief that Davies, having publicly come out as gay after England&apos;s tour of Australia last winter, should now be allowed to pursue his career in peace. And if you are a reserve wicketkeeper facing six weeks of inactivity in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, barring injury to Matt Prior, the man in possession, then peace \u2013 and rather too much of it \u2013 is what he is soon likely to get. Suspect the Mail of prurience and you are normally on pretty safe ground, but on this occasion the interest in Davies&apos;s selection was valid. There were tempting cricketing reasons to omit Davies and had England&apos;s selectors taken that course his international career might have quietly come to an end. His selection after a summer spent entirely with Surrey felt like a reaffirmation of his talent. All manner of unfounded, yet understandable, suspicions would have lingered had he been omitted. The excitement and sense of belonging among young gay men when Davies came out could just as quickly subside if his England career melts away. It would not have been long before somebody had chided that beneath English cricket&apos;s impressive show of support for Davies, who, lest we forget, was only the second professional to come out in a major English team sport since the tragic death of Justin Fashanu, lay a low-burn yet deep-seated preference to return to conventionality. The cricketing argument against Davies was a tempting one: the tour party would have been more adaptable without him. The only reason for having a deputy wicketkeeper of Davies&apos;s class on tour was in case Prior was injured in\u00a0practice. Any injury more than 36 hours before a game and Davies could easily have been flown in to deputise. Accept that and England could have covered Prior&apos;s position on tour with Jonny Bairstow, who remains very much the new kid on the block despite an unproductive one-day tour of India. England have still to give Bairstow the gloves in one-day cricket, recognising his limitations, but he keeps regularly for Yorkshire and there have been worse emergency keepers on England tours in the past. Bairstow, furthermore, could have doubled up as England&apos;s reserve batsman, which in turn would have allowed the omission of Ravi Bopara and created a place instead for Samit Patel. This would have addressed England&apos;s perennial problem of how to balance the side when, as the Middle East might demand, two spinners are imperative. The choice between supporting Graeme Swann with an out-and-out spinner such as Monty Panesar or an all-rounder with more modest spin-bowling credentials in Patel offered appealing flexibility. England&apos;s selectors stuck with Davies, a cricketing decision made on cricketing grounds. The way to respond to changing social norms is never to allow then to enter the debate. &quot;From a continuity and consistency point of view, he gets the nod,&quot; said the chief selector, Geoff Miller. It is good to see that these days even &quot;the nod,&quot; the oldest selectorial cliche in sport, is without prejudice. Davies could fairly contend that his statistics for Surrey last season stacked up in all three forms of the game. He made more than 1,000 first-class runs at 40 last season, scored at more than a run a ball in averaging 30 in the 40-over game and his strike rate in Twenty20, in averaging 30-plus, was above 150. But his career path might have narrowed. The nod that came for the Test tour is unlikely to be repeated for the one-day series that follows when Bairstow and Craig Kieswetter, both seen as more powerful strikers, are likely to gain preference. England also believe that Davies has been too diffident in the past to act as the energiser of the side, which the coach, Andy Flower, sees as essential to the wicketkeeper&apos;s role. He knows that he needs to assert himself. He cannot be fairly expected to act out of character, but it might yet be that his greater contentment will allow his character to come to the fore.", "title": "Steve Davies's selection for Pakistan series could allow him to flourish", "sentences": ["And if you are a reserve wicketkeeper facing six weeks of inactivity in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, barring injury to Matt Prior, the man in possession, then peace \u2013 and rather too much of it \u2013 is what he is soon likely to get."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-10T14:41:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/10/luke-donald-rory-mcilroy-dubai", "tags": ["Luke Donald", "Rory McIlroy", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "The contest has been settled, surely, and the concession speech made. Now come the formalities. Luke Donald may be the last man in town to accept the inevitable but when the Englishman completes the final round of the Dubai World Championship on Sunday he will almost certainly have achieved an historic treble: leading money winner in the United States; leading money winner on the European Tour; best player in all four corners of the globe. That is quite a haul for a man who was once dubbed the archetypal underachiever. Rich but unambitious. A perennial presence in the top 10 but could not win a tournament to save his life. &quot;Luke Donald disease&quot; it was famously called by an American critic. There is not a player in the world today who would not mind coming down with a dose of that particular affliction. Alas for Rory McIlroy, the only player who arrived here in the desert with a mathematical chance of beating Donald in the season-long Race to Dubai (as the European Tour&apos;s money list is known these days). The only disease he is suffering from is a mild case of suspected Dengue fever. That is no laughing matter and the Northern Irishman deserves credit for battling on these past few weeks, for keeping interest alive in the contest to finish as Europe&apos;s leading money winner with a stunning victory in Hong Kong last weekend. But enough is enough, even for the outrageously talented McIlory, and the young genius of Holywood finally came undone over the opening nine holes of Saturday&apos;s third round here. While the rest of the field was moving forward McIlory went into reverse gear, hitting a succession of weary shots that cost him what slim chance he had of achieving the victory he needed to have a chance of overcoming Donald on the money list. At the long 7th hole, he carved his second shot into bushes and was forced to take a penalty drop. He then took three shots to get down from the edge of the green for a double-bogey seven. In the greater scheme of things that mistake left him eight shots behind the tournament leader, Alvaro Quir\u00f3s, and, more significantly, mired in 20th place. The big Spaniard always gives his opponents hope with his free-hitting way. However, it is one thing to beat a solitary opponent but quite another to overhaul 19, one of whom is Donald. The Englishman got off to a slow start to the tournament. Indeed, he received something of a lesson in Thursday&apos;s opening round, in which McIlroy took nine shots out of him over the back nine. But since then he has been his usual immaculate self, particularly on and around the\u00a0greens. Saturday&apos;s third round summed up his year. By his own admission, he did not strike the ball particularly well but a few loose drives and occasional off-line approach shots hardly matter when you can chip and putt like he does. The Englishman&apos;s haul of 12 pars and six birdies, for a score of 66, tells its own story. He will begin the final round in fourth place, four shots behind the leader. Who would bet against him winning this tournament? The Spaniard perhaps, and maybe the two former Open champions, the Scot Paul Lawrie and Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa, who are tucked in behind the leader, two and three shots behind respectively. But that is it. McIlroy, to his eternal credit, battled back over his back nine, perhaps buoyed by the arrival on the course of his girlfriend, the world No1 tennis player Caroline Wozniacki. He had four birdies in nine holes to finish on eight-under par for the tournament, six behind Quiros and two adrift of Donald. Did he fancy his chances? Did he heck. &quot;Yes, definitely,&quot; he said when asked if he thought Donald had done enough to ensure he would win the Race to Dubai. &quot;I fully expect him to go out tomorrow and shoot another very solid round. He has played great all year. To go out and win the money list in the States, then come over and do it here. And then be the world No1 \u2013 I don&apos;t think he has been given enough credit for the golf he has played. He&apos;s been incredible and he deserves everything he has got this year.&quot; You cannot say fairer than that. Nor could you be any closer to the truth. Donald, whose sense of self has developed enormously over the past 12 months, is always happy to take the plaudits that come his way, though never before the final ball is struck. Was he ready to claim the title of Europe&apos;s leading money winner on Saturday night? Of course not. &quot;You never know what could happen,&quot; he said. &quot;But obviously I&apos;m in a pretty good position.&quot; Obviously, he is.", "title": "Luke Donald is closing in on an historic treble in Dubai", "sentences": ["Luke Donald may be the last man in town to accept the inevitable but when the Englishman completes the final round of the Dubai World Championship on Sunday he will almost certainly have achieved an historic treble: leading money winner in the United States; leading money winner on the European Tour; best player in all four corners of the globe.", "Alas for Rory McIlroy, the only player who arrived here in the desert with a mathematical chance of beating Donald in the season-long Race to Dubai (as the European Tour&apos;s money list is known these days).", "&quot;Yes, definitely,&quot; he said when asked if he thought Donald had done enough to ensure he would win the Race to Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-10T19:58:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/11/luke-donald-us-europe-double", "tags": ["Luke Donald", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Alvaro Quir\u00f3s eagled the final hole on Sunday to win the Dubai World Championship and the prize for best supporting actor. Such is the power of Luke Donald these days: he can make the heroics of others look smaller than they are. Yet do not feel sorry for the big Spaniard, who left the Middle East with a \u00a3793,000 winner&apos;s cheque and the expectation that even better days lie ahead, including almost certainly a place in Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal&apos;s Ryder Cup team next year. He is not the first giant to be outdone by the little guy and he was hardly the only golfer to be pushed off the stage by Donald in this, his year of golfing years. Donald&apos;s third-place finish on Sunday behind Quir\u00f3s and Scotland&apos;s Paul Lawrie confirmed a historic double for the world No1, who became the first player officially to top the money lists on both the European and PGA Tour. Unofficially Tiger Woods also headed both lists during his prime, albeit that he was not a member of the European Tour at the time and therefore his achievement is not in the record books. But the world came to expect such outlandish achievement from the 14-times major champion. Donald is an altogether different animal from Woods \u2013 a less imposing figure and, until now, a less dominating one, too. Yet if the world outside golf is surprised to discover an Englishman with a quiet disposition at the top of the sport&apos;s totem pole, those within the game, especially his peers, are not. Over the past 12 months Donald has transformed himself physically \u2013 he proudly flexed his bulging biceps on Sunday \u2013 and mentally with startling effect. He won four times, including at the world matchplay championship and the BMW Championship, the flagship event of the European Tour, and was seldom outside the top\u00a010 in any tournament in which he played. Rory McIlroy arrived in Dubai as the only player with a chance of denying Donald his prize. For that to happen the Northern Irishman needed to win and Donald needed to finish no higher than 10th in a field of 58 players. Except after the first round, in which McIlroy forged a six-shot advantage over his rival, that never looked like happening. In the end he was steam-rollered aside by the world No1, finishing seven shots adrift of the Englishman and just outside the top 10. The US Open champion took his disappointment like a man. &quot;Every time Luke teed up, he finished in the\u00a0top\u00a0five or top\u00a010. That&apos;s incredible mental strength. I have played with Luke and he works extremely\u00a0hard on his game. This is great reward for that consistency and hard work,&quot; he said. Once upon a time Donald might have blushed at such praise but he is a more self-assured figured these days. It comes with the territory. &quot;Being the world No1 brings expectations for everybody and it brings expectations for myself. But I think I have proven quite a few times that I have been able to deal with pretty extreme pressure,&quot; he said. &quot;Hats off to Alvaro. He played well coming down the stretch and to make an eagle on the last is a pretty spectacular way to finish the event. [But] I got what I came for and that was to win the Race to Dubai, do the double and create history.&quot; The Englishman will play in his final event of the year in Australia this week, then head back to his US base to prepare for 2012, when his principal ambition will be to fill the one gap in the CV, a major championship victory. In these modern times some remain unconvinced by a world No1 who is yet to win one of the sport&apos;s four biggest prizes and Donald appears set on silencing the sceptics one more time \u2013 or maybe even four more times. &quot;I&apos;m not going to be greedy. I would love to win one major championship but I guess winning the grand slam in one calendar year would be something. No one has ever done it, so I guess that would be the ultimate goal,&quot; he said. Bold words indeed and, if the instinctual response is to say &quot;steady on cowboy&quot;, there is the evidence of 2011 to consider. No\u00a0one has been more consistent than Luke Donald and, most importantly in an era where the short game is even more important than ever, he drives like God, chips like Jesus and putts like the Holy Ghost.

The title was prompted by a man she met during another of her scoops, when she was one of the first reporters to get inside Gaddafi&apos;s Bab al-Aziziya compound and met a man who was wearing the colonel&apos;s hat, filched from his bedroom. The programme and book meant she was not in Libya for the final act of the drama \u2013 the death of the colonel \u2013 and missing the denouement rankles.

She has attacked the &quot;mother-of-four who went to war&quot; line as sexist, but at the same time she accepts that her commitment to the job and the fact that she leaves her family for months at a time does have an element of selfishness. &quot;Sometimes I feel selfish because I enjoy the job so much,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m doing what I want to do, and I&apos;m leaving my family behind. Obviously I love them with all my heart \u2013 they&apos;re the reason to be alive \u2013 and I feel selfish because I&apos;m leaving them to go and enjoy myself.&quot; She doesn&apos;t pretend her children are pleased about her absences. &quot;They give me stick all the time. Children just want you there. They don&apos;t really compute \u2013 although the older ones do now \u2013 that I might be in a dangerous position. They just know I&apos;m away from them, and not available to take them to the cinema or bake cupcakes with them, and of course I completely overcompensate when I get home.&quot; This is tricky territory. I try to ask diplomatically whether it&apos;s fair to run the risk of leaving four little cupcake-less orphans. &quot;Are we saying no parents can cover hostile environments?&quot; she says. &quot;I can see why people feel angst-ridden about it, and obviously I don&apos;t want to leave my children. I don&apos;t want to be without them. I don&apos;t want to die and miss out on all the things that go with being a mother. But I&apos;m not deliberately being reckless or thrill-seeking. I&apos;m just trying to do a job as well as I can. I try to narrow down the risks as much as possible, and then just adapt and react to what&apos;s happening, but at the end of the day I want to be able to look my children in the eye and that they feel we&apos;ve done something worthwhile.&quot; Crawford, who is 49, has worked as a reporter for Sky since the network was launched in 1989, having previously worked in local papers and for TV-am and the BBC. She had always wanted to be a foreign correspondent, but was rejected for four jobs and didn&apos;t get her first posting, in Delhi, until 2005. &quot;I think I just wore them down,&quot; she says. &quot;Eventually they thought: we&apos;re not sure we can get anyone else to cover India, let&apos;s give her a chance.&quot; You can understand how she got on that rebel truck heading for Green Square. She is blessed with a very understanding husband, racing journalist Richard Edmondson. He had been with the Independent for 20 years and just been named racing journalist of the year, but chucked in his job to go to India and look after their young family. &quot;It was a massive decision for him and for us as a family unit. He knew I wanted to do it because I kept on applying and being turned down, and the only way I could do it was if he gave up his job. It was a huge sacrifice.&quot; Edmondson wrote a revealing piece for the Independent immediately after his wife&apos;s Green Square coup, and as she was being feted by satellite link at the Edinburgh TV festival. &quot;When Alex told me she had landed the India job I tried not to let her see me gulp,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I had enjoyed a fabulous run at the Independent, but I had seen this look in Alex&apos;s eye before. We were off. There are elements of Alex&apos;s character which frighten some people, especially men. But she doesn&apos;t scare me \u2013 a point I once made to her through a crack in the door. The reality is that she has come to this foreign life late and has no time to waste. In fact, she has very little nonsense time at all. Her job has become a way of life, and those who do not demonstrate the same commitment are shown limited tolerance.&quot; He traced her determination and bravado to her upbringing in Africa. Her parents met and married in Nigeria \u2013 her father was a civil engineer and her mother worked for a construction company \u2013 and their daughter had experienced two coups by the age of five. They spent a short time in the UK before heading back to Zambia and Zimbabwe, where Crawford went to school. Soon after she was installed in boarding school, the then Rhodesia declared unilateral independence and she found herself practising terrorism drills as well as fire drills. She took it all in her stride. &quot;I had a fantastic childhood,&quot; she says, &quot;full of sport and sunshine.&quot; Her own children are getting something similar, having gone from India to Dubai and now Johannesburg, which has been the family&apos;s home since August. &quot;It meant my horizons were wider, and I know my children feel that too.&quot; Crawford accepts that being a foreign corespondent is a combination of a base competitiveness and a lofty desire to bear witness to the sufferings of the world. &quot;I&apos;m very competitive,&quot; she says, &quot;and anyone I&apos;ve ever worked with or against who&apos;s any good is also extremely competitive. It&apos;s not always just about being first. They want to do something that&apos;s good, and if good is being better than your rival or your colleague that&apos;s what competition is. I honestly wasn&apos;t consciously thinking I must beat the BBC and ITN to get into Green Square before them. I just realised that we were at the centre of a massive story that was unfolding in front of us. We were just very lucky, and the primary thing was not about hammering them [Sky&apos;s rivals] into the ground \u2013 that was a small by-product.&quot; She does not gloat over her triumph. Indeed, she sticks up for the BBC reporter, Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, who was left trailing in her wake as the rebels advanced. &quot;I&apos;d worked alongside him in all the revolutions. He&apos;s a really nice guy and a good reporter.&quot; But she doesn&apos;t leap to defend the BBC itself. &quot;The BBC is much bigger than us, has got much more money than us, many, many more people. Sky has eight foreign bureaux. The BBC has seven in India alone. We are completely outnumbered and outflanked and outmoneyed by them, so I think we do quite well and we punch way above our weight.&quot; Crawford says it&apos;s impossible to be completely detached when reporting from war zones. &quot;I don&apos;t think you can go through what we did this year without being a bit scarred. I&apos;m definitely scarred from having seen far too many people who&apos;ve died and, worse than the people who are dead, the terrible injuries and watching people&apos;s agony.&quot; She was caught in a battle at a mosque in the besieged town of Zawiya in March, and feared for her life. &quot;There was fighting all around. We went into the mosque because we thought we would be safe there, but the fighting came into the mosque. A massive battle was going on, with tanks being fired. A field hospital was set up in the mosque, and lots of the injured came in. There was fighting and firing everywhere, and it went on for at least three hours.&quot; She was doing telephone interviews with Sky during the battle, and her husband twigged that she was in severe danger. They texted each other, and she says he realised they weren&apos;t the normal texts. &quot;We [she and her colleagues] were doing our best not to collapse into tears. We were just trying to keep it all together, and lots of other people weren&apos;t keeping it together. They were crying and being sick and praying. The praying is really off-putting. You feel like saying: &apos;PLEASE STOP PRAYING, WE&apos;RE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.&apos;&quot; As the bullets flew, she kept reporting. &quot;I thought: if I&apos;m going to die, I want everyone to know what happened,&quot; she says. Did it ever cross her mind during those torrid hours that it might have been wiser to specialise in, say, fashion. &quot;No, not once,&quot; she says. &quot;I still feel feeling privileged to do it.&quot; After Zawiya she was worried about getting back to war reporting, but when it came to it her nerve was intact, and so was her desire. &quot;Foreign correspondents are incredibly passionate, committed journalists,&quot; she says. At a time when journalism is being put through the mangle at the Leveson inquiry, Crawford represents a more edifying side of the trade. Was she pitching for the rebels? No, she says, you avoid taking sides, but you inevitably identify with the human stories of those caught up in the drama. &quot;It&apos;s a bit like sitting in a room and watching someone get tortured. How can you not react to that?&quot;", "title": "Alex Crawford: 'I'm scarred by seeing too much death'", "sentences": ["&quot;I had a fantastic childhood,&quot; she says, &quot;full of sport and sunshine.&quot; Her own children are getting something similar, having gone from India to Dubai and now Johannesburg, which has been the family&apos;s home since August."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-12T20:29:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/dec/12/luke-donald-brutes", "tags": ["Luke Donald", "Tiger Woods", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "A few years ago an American magazine published a picture of the UCLA men&apos;s college golf team naked, the point of which was not to titillate but to suggest that in future the sport would be dominated by brawn. That only muscled-up behemoths like the lads from UCLA need apply. This was always Tiger Woods&apos;s fault. Or at least it was his biceps&apos; fault. The American was stick-thin in his teenage years, with all the attendant self\u2011esteem issues, so he was hardly likely to complain about his reincarnation as a modern\u2011day Adonis. Yet Woods and those who launched the notion of golfer as pure athlete were peddling a myth built upon a misconception. What made the American great was not that he could bench press 350lb but that he could putt like God and had an unmatchable competitive will. Sure, it helped that he was built like the proverbial brick outhouse but did Johnny Weissmuller ever win a major? Still, as long as Woods dominated his sport the new orthodoxy was unchallenged. A generation of golfers hit the gym, albeit that John Daly and Darren Clarke didn&apos;t get the memo. But then Woods began to falter and people began to wonder. The man himself did not look any different but his game cast a shadow of its former self. He began to lose, most tellingly on the final day of the 2009 PGA\u00a0Championship against a hitherto obscure Korean called YE\u00a0Yang, and then came the scandal. Suddenly, the muscled-up beach bully was getting sand kicked in his face on a weekly basis. The era of Tiger Woods seemed over. The future of golf was now, even though no\u00a0one was exactly sure of what shape it would take. Most informed opinion was that he would be in the mould of Woods, only bigger and more muscular. Not for the first time in history informed opinion was less informed than it imagined it could be. Instead of a Tiger Woods Mark\u00a0II we have the unlikely figure of Luke Donald, who after a long and lucrative spell as that most mocked of golfing staple \u2013 the well\u2011remunerated loser \u2013 has emerged as the most dominant figure in the game. On Sunday the Englishman added the Race to Dubai (the European Tour Order of Merit, as it was once known) to a long list of honours in 2011. He won four events \u2013 three of them from the rank just below the majors. The other came at the PGA\u00a0Tour&apos;s Disney Classic, a tournament he needed to win to end the season as the US Tour&apos;s leading money winner. Ask a top-class professional golfer what is the hardest thing of all to do and they will tell you: win on demand. No wonder Donald&apos;s peers were queuing up on Sunday to praise him to the hilt. &quot;I hope he gets the credit he deserves,&quot; said the Englishman&apos;s Ryder Cup team\u2011mate Graeme McDowell. This was a fair request, given that Donald will never go short of sceptics regardless of what he does. The question is what should the Englishman be given credit for? Money lists are all well and good but many people still regard the major championships as the only true measure of golfing achievement. There is an unresolvable argument to be had about that, with both camps immovable in their belief that they are right and the other side is as daft as a brush. Donald could put everybody out of their misery next year and win the Masters or, as he giddily suggested on Sunday night, the grand slam of all four majors. In the meantime, there is a beautiful solution for those in search of middle ground. Luke Donald should be given credit for this \u2013 he has changed the way we think about the game of golf. He has taken that infamous photograph of the UCLA golf team and torn it to shreds. The future of golf is now and it is not the 6ft\u00a05in &quot;bomber&quot;. Donald is no skinny runt. He is fitter than your average Joe Blow, and he is certainly fitter than he used to be, but he is hardly likely to be mistaken for an Olympic weightlifter. He is a 5ft\u00a010in Englishman who is versed in the sport&apos;s subtler skills; who has thought deeply about what it would take to dominate; who has developed a plan and who has executed that plan to stunning effect. The parallels between football and golf are hardly obvious but in some ways it is possible to imagine Donald as the Barcelona of the Royal and Ancient game; proof positive that the least important weapon in the armoury of the modern athlete is physical stature, that skill allied with intelligence is an irresistible combination, regardless of the sport. While Lionel Messi and his team\u2011mates have transported football into an uncharted and wondrous place, Luke Donald has performed an equally valuable service for his own sport. He has saved golf from the brutes. He has reminded its practitioners and its spectators that nothing matters more than skill. &quot;I think people are taking notice of what I have done and how I have done it,&quot; he said when I asked him if he thought he had redefined the way that professional golf is played.

An associate of the president told Associated Press that the 56-year-old politician would stay in the Gulf emirate of Dubai for further medical tests but insisted there was no question of Zardari being too ill to return to office. Fauzia Wahab, an adviser to the president and former information secretary, told the Guardian that Zardari &quot;remained and would remain in power&quot; and would be back &quot;soon&quot;. However, the president and his close circle remain worried about the possibility of a military coup. Much attention is now being focused on Zardari&apos;s son, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who spent much of his youth overseas but returned to Pakistan last year. &quot;Bilawal is here [in Pakistan] to show that the family and the party are going nowhere. There is no question of anyone running away,&quot; Wahab said. A plan for the 23-year-old to participate in a series of rallies and visits across Pakistan in coming weeks has been put on hold due to security concerns, but it is clear that the recent Oxford graduate, whose mother, the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, was assassinated four years ago, is being prepared for power. &quot;His father has only ever seen himself as a transition leader. Bilawal is the blood heir to a family of political martyrs so he is the political future,&quot; said one observer close to the Bhutto family. A &quot;mass contact campaign&quot; to launch Bilawal, who succeeded his mother as chairman of the Pakistan People&apos;s party (PPP), as a major national figure was mooted by senior figures in the organisation last month. Bilawal will play a major role in a big commemoration of the death of Benazir, killed on 27 December 2007. Since Zardari&apos;s departure for Dubai, every engagement of his son has been publicised by government and party spokesmen. Bilawal&apos;s agenda resembles that of a head of state, rather than a recent history graduate. Over two days last week, he had meetings with the top leadership and young activists of the ruling PPP, was briefed by a top parliamentarian on national security and held series of receptions held for the PPP&apos;s coalition allies. He also issued an order that the party follow a harsher line on US-Pakistan relations, currently at a nadir following the death of 24 Pakistani soldiers in a border clash with Nato troops, officials said. Recent days have been filled with similar public and political appointments. &quot;It is inevitable that when they are feeling insecure \u2013 as many senior PPP people and particularly the close circle around the president do right now \u2013 they rally around their greatest asset,&quot; said Prof Osama Siddique, a political scientist in Lahore. Since Zardari took power after the resignation of the former military general Pervez Musharraf in 2008, deep economic problems, extremist violence and events such as the US special forces raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May have put his administration under immense pressure. Even before the recent publication of a memo supposedly penned by a key ally, the ambassador in Washington, asking for US help to hold off a military coup following the Bin Laden raid, relations with the powerful Pakistani security establishment were poor. Senior judges are now probing the memo and have ordered that corruption investigations overseas be reopened. Some suggest Zardari is staying out of Pakistan to avoid a confrontation after being summoned to give evidence before the supreme court in the memo inquiry. However, the rumours gripping Pakistan of an imminent army coup were &quot;overblown&quot;, said Siddique. &quot;Zardari remains the elected president and in this day and age, any attempt to unseat him by coercive means is likely to backfire,&quot; he said. Once dismissed as a political lightweight and dogged by graft charges, Zardari has consistently outmanoeuvred political opponents. The PPP, which he leads in tandem with his son, heads a broad coalition. Though he is still too young to stand for parliament, the eventual succession of Bilawal appears inevitable. His grandfather, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, founded the PPP, became one of the country&apos;s most controversial leaders and, after being ousted, was hanged on the orders of the military dictator General Zia-ul-Haq, who usurped him from power. Bilawal was educated at private schools in Pakistan and, after his mother went into self-imposed exile in 1999, in Dubai. Appointed party chairman in accordance with his mother&apos;s wishes, he remained in the UK until he graduated last year. Until now he had has kept a relatively low profile. &quot;The point is not that he is 23 years old or head of a political party but is the blood price that the Bhuttos have paid for power,&quot; said one observer. &quot;Bilawal has accepted the possibility, even certainty, of a violent premature death.&quot; Wahab, a presidential aide and Bhutto family friend, said Bilawal carried &quot;a heavy burden&quot;. &quot;He has the Bhutto genes,&quot; she said.", "title": "Zardari treated for stroke as son Bilawal is groomed for power in Pakistan", "sentences": ["An associate of the president told Associated Press that the 56-year-old politician would stay in the Gulf emirate of Dubai for further medical tests but insisted there was no question of Zardari being too ill to return to office.", "Since Zardari&apos;s departure for Dubai, every engagement of his son has been publicised by government and party spokesmen.", "Bilawal was educated at private schools in Pakistan and, after his mother went into self-imposed exile in 1999, in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-13T16:12:53Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/13/zardari-power-pakistan-party-presidency", "tags": ["Asif Ali Zardari", "Pakistan", "World news"], "article": "Formally, the Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, exercises few powers in a position that is now supposed to be largely ceremonial. However, he derives his authority from his position as the joint head, with his son Bilawal, of the ruling Pakistan People&apos;s party (PPP). From his party position, Zardari controls the government, including the appointment of the prime minister. When the PPP was elected in 2008, he chose the party veteran Yousuf Raza Gilani as the prime minister. Gilani, who is theoretically the one in charge of day-to-day government, has proved fiercely loyal to his party and the president so far. Zardari and his cronies in the presidency are immersed in all aspects of the government, as the regular press releases issued from his office make clear, with updates on him dealing with everything from flood control measures to foreign affairs. No doubt the orders to the government are continuing to flow from his hospital bed in Dubai. If Zardari becomes incapacitated then a real power vacuum could follow, as the government is run by few ministers of any ability or initiative. Indeed they appear to have been chosen for that reason. &quot;Even in his absence, the government is being run by Zardari. Gilani is a front showman,&quot; said Rasul Bakhsh Rais, professor of politics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. &quot;The prime minister is a nonentity, except as the appointee of Asif Ali Zardari.&quot; After coming into office, Zardari shed the few powers that the presidency still enjoyed, which included the authority to dismiss the government. His position in the PPP, along with his sister Faryal Talpur and his son Bilawal, is what guarantees his supremacy. The contours of power in Pakistan are further complicated by the overwhelming role played by the military in politics and affairs of state. Even when Pakistan has had elected governments, the armed forces retain a virtual monopoly on foreign and security policies. The current government has been repeatedly slapped down and humiliated by the military when it has tried to take some control over foreign affairs and the working of the security apparatus of the state. Early on in Zardari&apos;s tenure, it was announced that the military&apos;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency was to be made accountable to the civilian government, only for the decision to be reversed hours later when the armed forces simply refused. Whoever is in charge, the four years of the current government have been marked by an almost total absence of policy and implementation on bread-and-butter issues, including taxation, energy supply, health and education, while corruption scandals constantly brew. Seeing the lack of action, an activist judiciary, headed by an implacable opponent of Zardari, the chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, has tried to take over important functions of the executive.

He has a history of heart trouble. His children are based in Dubai, though his son and political heir-apparent, 23-year-old Bilawal, flew into Pakistan to stand in for his father as head of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party when his father became unwell. The president, ill since early December, apparently collapsed in the presidency on Tuesday last week and was flown to Dubai that evening. Alarm over his health was heightened by a press leak in Washington saying he had been &quot;incoherent&quot; during a telephone call with the US president, Barack Obama, on 4 December. Zardari&apos;s health problems have deepened the country&apos;s political crisis, amid speculation that he is seriously ill or that he may not return. There have also been rumours that Zardari has suffered a mental breakdown.

The letter, signed by a doctor, Khaldoun Taha, and dated 13 December, says Zardari was admitted to hospital &quot;with a chief complaint of left-arm numbness and twitching with a transient episode of loss of consciousness that lasted for few seconds&quot;. Tests at the hospital had found that &quot;all investigations were within normal range&quot;, and he was advised to now rest at home and continue his regular heart medications, the letter said. On 19 December, the supreme court will take up an explosive case in which Zardari&apos;s close confidante, Husain Haqqani, Pakistan&apos;s former US ambassador, is accused of being behind a &quot;treacherous&quot; offer made to Washington to rein in Pakistan&apos;s military in return for US support for the government in Islamabad. Some believe the treason accusations will reach all the way up to the president. The offer was delivered in an anonymous memo by a Pakistani-American businessman, Mansoor Ijaz, to the then top US military official in May, but it only became public knowledge in October. The former Washington ambassador, who was sacked over the issue, denies having any role in crafting the message, but Ijaz claims he was acting on Haqqani&apos;s instructions. Islamabad remains abuzz with talk that the government will be dismissed, possibly by the courts acting under pressure from the powerful military, which has long wanted to oust Zardari. Some saw the president&apos;s hospitalisation as a possible prelude to his going into exile. The controversy over the memo gives the military new grounds to be suspicious of Zardari.

Or at least Los Angeles did. I was reminded of this last week when one of the characters in the sci-fi film In Time tumbled from the Sixth Street bridge and into the shallow slop of the LA river. The arches of the bridge, the epic concrete flood-channel, the endless sight lines, the bleary light: all of it was familiar. Point Break, Terminator 2, Chinatown, Them! all sprang to mind. Andrew Niccol&apos;s thriller was saying the same thing about its casually iconic backdrops as its unageing parade of cheekboned 25-year-olds were saying about their lives: we shouldn&apos;t die. But, in the real world, things move on. These days, the Hollywood action blockbuster is as likely to come in Rain-lashed Business-District flavour as Sun-baked Urban Western: that&apos;s because lots of them, like Watchmen, I, Robot, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes, now film in Vancouver. Runaway production \u2013 films deciding to shoot abroad \u2013 has been a hot issue for the US film industry for more than a decade. In 2003, 66% of studio films were still shot in California; six years later, it was only 38%. Another measure of this decline is the PPD (Permitted Production Day) figure \u2013 one PPD being permission granted for a single film crew to film for a single project at a single defined location in a 24-hour period. Between 1996 and 2009, Los Angeles PPDs dropped from almost 14,000 a year to under 5,000. Part of the unease about runaway production is due to its effects on the thousands of people employed in entertainment in California; part of it is plain national pride. But productions have been running away since cinema began, part of the allure being, of course, the occasional brush with the exotic. If you&apos;re making a film about, say, an international playboy spy, it&apos;s inevitable that you&apos;ll want to drop him at some point into a smoky Cantonese speakeasy, or a remote Alpine hotel (and the old studio-backlot substitutes don&apos;t really cut it any more). If there&apos;s a justifiable reason in the script for location-shooting abroad, this is known as a &quot;creative runaway&quot;. What&apos;s really hurting California&apos;s feelings is the &quot;economic runaway&quot; \u2013 films that relocate for financial reasons, like tax incentives, reduced labour costs and upfront budget contributions. Vancouver was quick to establish itself as &quot;Hollywood North&quot; in the late 90s by offering a tax rebate on film production \u2013 currently set at 33%. Other countries, like Australia \u2013 where The Matrix and Moulin Rouge! were filmed - have followed suit. Such come-hither pouting was often seen in smaller countries keen to lure big-budget activity as a way of saying, as they launched their own fledging industries, &quot;Cinema happens here&quot;. Romania (Cold Mountain, Ghost Rider) was one; Dubai \u2013 as the sight of Tom Cruise clinging to the Burj Khalifa like the world&apos;s most expensive window-cleaner in the new Mission: Impossible reminds us \u2013 is another. With the emirate offering no special help to film-makers, this looks on the surface like a creative runaway. Actually, Dubai is desperate to be seen as a credible cinema centre, and one Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol insider tells me that, confidentially, incentives were on the table for Paramount on a one-off basis. So Ghost Protocol is really an economic case; this blurring between the two must surely be common, with scripts getting hastily re-written as countries jostle for position and offer competing terms. That&apos;s globalisation, and it seems na\u00efve for the California industry to carp too much about the process. Perhaps the trade guilds would be better off focusing their energies on campaigning against states like New Mexico and Louisiana promoting competition within the US with tax credits: there is a more reasonable argument, with some short-term profiteering going on, that this is balkanising and weakening the American film industry from within. California can&apos;t win on economic terms: as the first to build a global cinema, it was always going to be underbid on production costs further down the line. Perhaps, to win back some of the \u00e9migr\u00e9s, it needs to think local again \u2013 start more projects that have a firm connection with America, and so have a reason to actually be set there (Collateral is a good example). And it needs to remember something: it was itself once the competition \u2013 a group of rebellious film-makers who escaped west from the protectionist cartel of the Motion Picture Patents Company in New York, set up in 1908. There wasn&apos;t much there then, long before the downtown LA skyline became the stand-in for the anywhere city. A few farms, dusty roads, the new telegraph poles, and the sweet aroma of the acacias, Hollywood was nothing but a place. \u2022 This article was corrected on 15 December 2010.

Under the proposal, a transit tax or fee will be imposed on every shipping container sent through Pakistan, senior military and civilian officials have told the Guardian. The move follows the death of 24 soldiers shelled by a US helicopter at a checkpoint last month. The tax is likely to add tens of millions of dollars a year to the cost of the decade-long war. It is thought that the government would levy around $1,500 (\u00a3970) per shipping container sent through Pakistan, along with separate charges for each fuel tanker that goes through to Afghanistan. Islamabad suspended the movement of Nato supplies to the landlocked country altogether after the deaths on 26 November. The tax on Nato supplies would provide Pakistan with a face-saving way of reopening the route. Following the deaths at the border, Pakistan also terminated the American use of a small airbase, Shamsi, and boycotted an international conference on Afghanistan. The international coalition in Afghanistan has benefited from free transit of goods through Pakistan for nearly a decade, under agreements forged with Islamabad soon after the overthrow of the Taliban regime. Although the coalition has reduced its logistical dependence on Pakistan over the last few years, around a third of supplies are still trucked through Pakistan, which is the cheapest route to Afghanistan. A senior Pakistani official said that the free transit of US and Nato military supplies was allowed under two agreements signed in 2002, when dictator General Pervez Musharraf was ruling the country. &quot;Under the agreement, Nato got to use our transport infrastructure for no cost, but what we got in return, we don&apos;t know. It is high time to revisit the agreement,&quot; said the official, who did not want to be named, as the new policy has not yet been announced. &quot;The agreement appears to be one-sided.&quot; The levy would also confirm the dramatically changing nature of Pakistan&apos;s ties with its western partners, from a strategic alliance to a transactional relationship, with deep suspicions on both sides. The prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, said on Wednesday that &quot;tougher&quot; new rules of engagement were being worked out with Nato, &quot;with the aim of providing more respect to our sovereignty&quot;. There is intense anger in the Pakistani military over the deaths, which it believes were deliberate in an attempt to see how far the country could be pushed. An outraged public is demanding an end all co-operation with the US-led coalition. The supplies to Nato&apos;s 150,000 troops are shipped to Karachi and then trucked across Pakistan, entering Afghanistan either in its south, through the Chaman border crossing, or via the Khyber pass to eastern Afghanistan. A much longer and more expensive supply route has been developed through Europe and central Asia, which enters northern Afghanistan, while the rest of the goods are flown in, the most costly option. Four years ago, around 80% of the supplies went through Pakistan, but Nato now claims that only a third comes that way. It is estimated that some 4,000 containers a month carry sustainment supplies to Nato troops from all three of the routes, meaning that about 1,300 containers would pass through Pakistan. In addition, some 1,000 fuel tankers also go from Pakistan each month to Afghanistan. Pakistan complains that the heavy trucks have ruined its roads, while it charges nothing for the transit facility. However, the containers are transported by Pakistani companies, earning valuable foreign exchange for the country and employing some 40,000 people in the industry. The trucks, which do not have any security escort, are frequently the target of militants and robbers. A further problem for the industry is the bureaucracy at Karachi port, which means the paperwork for each container takes a week or longer to clear. A spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul, Colonel Gary Kolb, said that negotiations with the Pakistani government over the supplies issue were ongoing. &quot;It would be inappropriate of Isaf to comment on those discussions at this time,&quot; said Kolb. Nadeem Khan, chief executive of Raaziq International, one of the major Pakistani companies involved in carrying Nato supplies, said that the imposition of a transit fee would actually benefit the trade if it were accompanied by streamlined clearance at Karachi port and protection for the trucks. &quot;If Pakistan provides speed of passage and security too, then everyone would be a winner,&quot; said Khan.

To the western ear this ancient invocation \u2013 literally &quot;God willing&quot; \u2013 can be disconcerting: you pray the crew are relying on more than divine providence to set down safety. But these days it&apos;s about right \u2013 Pakistan, a country buffeted by mysterious if not entirely holy forces, seems to have surrendered to its fate. Viewed from the outside, Pakistan looms as the Fukushima of fundamentalism: a volatile, treacherous place filled with frothing Islamists and double-dealing generals, leaking plutonium-grade terrorist trouble. Forget the &quot;world&apos;s most dangerous country&quot; moniker, by now old hat. Look to recent coverage: &quot;Hornet&apos;s Nest&quot; declares this week&apos;s Economist; &quot;The Ally from Hell&quot; proclaims the Atlantic. Western condemnation has a moral quality, the tinge of wounded betrayal. Much of it is rooted in Afghanistan, where many blame Pakistan for the Taliban resurgence. Some years ago a senior UN official in Kabul warned me the US could launch unilateral airstrikes if Pakistan didn&apos;t get into line. Surely it would be unwise to destabilise a nuclear-armed country of 170m people, I said. &quot;Well,&quot; he shot back grimly. &quot;Maybe they deserve it.&quot; Yet for all the stone-throwing, hard facts are elusive. Did the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency really shelter Bin Laden? Does it control the notorious Haqqani network? Did it play a role in the 2008 Mumbai attacks? If smoking guns abound, the Pakistanis are remarkably good at wiping their fingerprints from the trigger. Instead, we are left with a murky stew of allegations, coincidences and the steamy whispers of western spies. Perhaps the embodiment of this conundrum is Pervez Musharraf, the former military ruler once beloved of the west. In a recent interview the BBC&apos;s Stephen Sackur harangued him about Pakistani perfidy. What of the Taliban safe havens? Sackur demanded. Or the Quetta Shura? Or reports that the monocular Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, resides happily in Pakistani suburbia? Musharraf sat through the mauling, visibly bristling, then shot back. &quot;You say it is true. I say it is all nonsense,&quot; he said, wearing his trademark wounded-puppy face. &quot;This is a mirage. This is what people say. This is what you think.&quot; [My italics]. But what should we think \u2013 conspiracy, cockup or thinly veiled chaos? Puzzling out the answers to that question has been central to my seven years reporting from Pakistan for the Guardian. Much of it was dominated by the banner dramas: bombs and political heaves, spy scandals and shootings. But there were also, I discovered, truths to be gleaned from the smaller things \u2013 such as the way people drive. Pakistanis swerve into heavy traffic without looking, don&apos;t stick to their lane or indicate, which makes it hard to predict where they are coming from or going to. Social graces are rare \u2013 horns honk, headlights are impatiently flashed \u2013 but social hierarchy is observed: hulking four-wheel drives (increasingly armour-plated) barge through the swarms of matchbox cars. Off to the side, the police are taking bribes. But pull off the road and everything changes. Pakistanis are welcoming, generous and voluble. They insist you stay for tea, or the night. They love to gab, often with glorious indiscretion \u2013 national politics and local tattle, cricket scandals, movie stars and conspiracy theories. This is fun, and good for the business of journalism. While Islam is technically the glue of society, you learn, the real bonds are forged around clans, tribes, personal contacts. To get anything done, the official route is often pointless \u2013 the key is sifarish, the reference of an influential friend. Journalists use sifarish a lot; occasionally they are called on to dispense it too. Late one night, shortly after the last election, I got a surprise phone call from a ruling party official. Previously chatty and relaxed, he spoke in a loud and oddly deliberate voice. &quot;Do you remember that place you mentioned last night \u2013 the &apos;Cat House&apos;?&quot; he said. I remembered no such thing. &quot;Well, the police have turned up,&quot; he continued. &quot;And I was hoping you might have a word with them.&quot; Seconds later the line dropped; I didn&apos;t call back. Two days later the papers carried reports of a police raid on a speakeasy-cum-brothel in a smart part of Islamabad, called the Cathouse. They arrested Russian and Chinese women, dozens of bottles of liquor and a number of punters \u2013 including a newly elected ruling party MP and his entourage, including my friend. But they were released without charge, the reports noted, after a phone call from a &quot;higher-up&quot; in government. I thought that was the end of the matter until a police video of the raid surfaced on the internet some months later. It showed officers storming into the Cathouse, arguing with Russian women and at, at one point, a middle-aged man in a crowded corridor, shouting into his phone. &quot;Do you remember that place you mentioned last night?&quot; says my friend &quot;The Cathouse?&quot; Such laughs have been regrettably rare. When I arrived in 2004, Islamabad was a somnolent, reliably dull city. By night, the sons of the rich drag-raced their daddies&apos; cars along deserted streets, swerving to avoid wild boar ambling from the bushes. Foreigners mocked the capital for its provincial feel. &quot;Islamabad \u2013 half the size of a New York graveyard but twice as dead&quot; went the diplomats&apos; tired gag as white-gloved waiters served gin and tonic on manicured lawns. Then the Taliban came to town. It started with the bloody siege of the Red mosque complex in July 2007, just before Pakistan&apos;s 60th birthday. Bullets zipped through the leafy streets; I dusted off my flak jacket. Then came the bombs: at markets, checkposts, the Naval headquarters, UN offices, the five-star Marriott hotel. Up the street from my house, Benazir Bhutto gave speeches from behind barbed wire, during a brief-lived house arrest. Weeks later she drove out to Rawalpindi, where she was assassinated. Today the blasts have stopped, mostly, but the city is cloistered in concrete. Fortified walls rise over the streets, vehicles slalom through elaborate checkposts, hotel entrances resemble prisons with gold-buttoned guards. Embassies are retreating into a sandbagged, Green Zone-style enclave; the presidency and even ISI headquarters are similarly isolated. That, however, is just the cosseted capital \u2013 the real pain has been felt elsewhere. Pakistan has paid a high blood price for what my guardian colleague Jason Burke calls the &quot;9/11 wars&quot;. Since 2001, up to 5,000 Pakistanis have died in more that 300 suicide attacks; the victims range from toddlers to three-star generals. Another 13,000 have been wounded. This is partly the legacy from the military&apos;s decades-old dabbling in Islamist extremism, but for most Pakistanis the culprit is America. Television shows fizz with anti-American anger; many say the &quot;Ally from Hell&quot; epithet applies to the US, not them. Things have never been worse: outrage at the killing of 24 Pakistani soldiers in a murky border incident triggered a blockade on Nato supplies, the closure of a CIA drone base and the boycott of a conference on the future of Afghanistan \u2013 and that&apos;s just in the last week. Washington, meanwhile, is moving to restrict $700m (\u00a3450m) in aid. The relationship is beset by frustrations and misunderstandings on both sides, but the net effect is that Pakistanis are more profoundly isolated from the outside world than they have been in decades. This cannot be good.     Women dancing at the Sehwan Sharif festival, Pakistan, one of the largest Sufi gatherings in South Asia. Photograph: Declan Walsh    Many Pakistanis \u2013 educated, ambitious, modern \u2013 resent being lumped in with the terrorists. &quot;Why don&apos;t you write about the other Pakistan?&quot; is a frequent refrain \u2013 &quot;other&quot; being the country of software companies, pizza dinners, effervescent art shows and quality literature. When I could, I did, with a tendency towards the counter-intuitive: the booming brewery across the street from military headquarters; the transvestite civil rights movement, the punk rock bands and oxygen bars and rambunctious polo tournaments in the heights of the Hindu Kush. But perhaps the most memorable experiences were rooted in the rich cultural and religious heritage. One of my best trips was in Sehwan Sharif in Sindh, a glorious Sufi festival on the banks of the Indus with a mesmeric mix of party and prayer \u2013 a spectacle to make the head spin and the heart sing. Still, there&apos;s no getting around it: Pakistan is beset with problems that no amount of jolly beer stories or whirling dervishes can remedy. It is, as a psychologist might say, a country with serious issues. Most are decades old \u2013 the overweening army, the confused place of Islam, the covert support for jihad, deep-rooted corruption, the poisoned bond with America. Resolving them has never been so urgent. One reason is Afghanistan. As western troops draw down by 2014, Pakistan can help construct a stable future for the war-ravaged country \u2013 or spoil a deal it dislikes. But beyond that, it is the internal stability of Pakistan that is more worrying. The country is riven by ethnic, tribal and political faultlines, which, in turn, are being exacerbated by galloping population growth and deepening poverty. Turmoil in a country with at least 120 nuclear warheads and a projected population of 300m people by 2030 could make Afghanistan look like a walk in the park. Talk of a &quot;nuclear Somalia&quot; is overstated, but you get the point. Yet there is little sign of revolution. As the Arab spring swept the Middle East, Pakistan was quiet because, in a sense, it already has what others are demanding: elections. The problem is that few like the results. Asif Ali Zardari, the accidental president, suffers a crippling legitimacy deficit driven by perceptions of corruption and a more fundamental struggle for supremacy. Just a few years ago the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, mused to the US ambassador about the possibility of a coup. Last week, Zardari suddenly flew to Dubai, triggering fresh speculation that such an upset was about to happen. The hype seems unfounded, and Zardari says he will soon return. But few doubt Kayani is the real power. Will ordinary Pakistanis tire of this power game? While there is no sign of a spring tide, millions of tiny waves are lapping the shores of despair. In October, Raja Khan, an unemployed man from Sindh province, travelled hundreds of miles to Islamabad. Standing outside parliament he doused himself in kerosene then struck a match. Hours later, racked with pain, the 23-year-old died. Poverty had ground him down, Khan said in a farewell note. As his coffin was nailed shut, his wife gave birth to their third son. His elderly father cried out: &quot;Oh, Zardari, where are you?&quot; It&apos;s not just Pakistan \u2013 over the seven years foreign correspondence changed drastically, too. In 2004, the Guardian focused on UK readers; today, through the internet, our audience is at once global and intensely local. Pakistanis leap on every story, scrutinising and commenting, particularly on Twitter, a medium many have embraced with gusto. It helps to project less obvious stories, such as a feature on the appalling wave of alleged state-sponsored killings in Balochistan earlier this year. But the intriguing feedback I received came in the form of an old-fashioned letter. Charles Burman was 92 years old, a former British army signals sergeant who had fought a long forgotten colonial campaign in the tribal belt in the 1930s and 40s. In wobbly handwriting he sent a fascinating account of his experiences; Waziristan was pretty dangerous back then, too, it turns out. Not everyone liked the coverage. Fatima Bhutto, niece of the assassinated Benazir, once suggested I was &quot;on the PPP payroll&quot;, referring to the government party; pro-government blogs suggested I was peddling the ISI line; the ISI monitored my phone calls and occasionally rang to voice its own displeasure. The US military in Afghanistan blacklisted me briefly; the Taliban called with a ransom demand for a kidnapped hostage; Pervez Musharraf threatened to sue. That was all fine \u2013 multi-directional criticism is a compliment \u2013 but sometimes the story came a little too close. In 2008 a Guardian fixer was abducted and tortured while investigating a story on intelligence agency abduction and torture. Last year, for a few nail-biting hours, a close friend&apos;s father was caught up in a brutal gun-attack on a mosque belonging to the minority Ahmadi community in Lahore. He survived but more than 100 others died. The bombings took a toll. A few minutes after the 2008 suicide bombing of the Marriott, a hotel where I got my hair cut and had coffee with contacts, I found myself standing in the rubble, dazed by the enormity of the atrocity. A giant crater occupied the park, staff in bloodstained uniforms stumbled through the lobby, hunting for survivors, orange flames licked the ash-laden sky. Blood squelched underfoot. Retreating outside I found a preppy looking young man sitting on the verge, staring numbly into the inferno. His name was Ehsan Peerzada and he was 19 years old, articulate and educated, the son of a senior civil servant. In other circumstances, I might have interviewed him for a story on savvy, westernised Pakistanis. Now he railed in a stream of invective against everyone \u2013 Islamist extremists, Americans, drone strikes \u2013 struggling to make sense of it all. &quot;It&apos;s not fair,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;It&apos;s not fair.&quot;     Pakistani hijras, or transgender men, at a function on the outskirts of Rawalpindi, the garrison city that is home to the headquarters of  Pakistan's powerful military. Photograph: Declan Walsh    It&apos;s not all darkness; away from the bang-bang, life in Pakistan can be richly rewarding. I&apos;ve been humbled by inspiring figures, traversed jaw-dropping landscapes and attended some wild parties, on one occasion with a roomful of transvestites. Where else can you find yourself with a bearded, joint-rolling characters, as I once did in Peshawar, nicknamed &quot;Mullah Omar&quot;? Even the news can be fun. Some years ago the cricket board issued a press release detailing &quot;genital warts&quot; of its errant star, Shoaib Akhtar. These days, bomb stories vie for space with Veena Malik, a daring actress who appeared topless wearing nothing but a tattoo that read &quot;ISI&quot;. Malik has denounced the pictures, claiming \u2013 but of course \u2013 that they are the product of conspiracy. I hoped that my reporting portrayed the rich complexity of a society that, below the surface, defies its stereotypes. But on some occasions there was just nothing to be said. A few months ago I visited a house in Rawalpindi with a giant poster over the windows, depicting a heroic warrior on a gallant white steed. The warrior was Mumtaz Qadri, the police bodyguard who gunned down the Punjab governor Salmaan Taseer, last January, and this was his house. Outside, young children shouted slogans for Qadri, a curly-bearded extremist who killed Taseer because he championed the case of a poor Christian woman who had been prosecuted under the country&apos;s notorious blasphemy laws. Others joined them, protesting against Qadri&apos;s prosecution for murder. The air was thick with talk of persecution. &quot;Qadri is a great martyr,&quot; said one man. &quot;What he did is permitted by Islam.&quot; Then the crowd poured through the streets and on to the highway leading to Islamabad. The police closed the road and watched. The celebration of Qadri, a deluded fanatic, was deeply depressing. So was the fact that nobody dared raise their voice against his supporters, not even the government. Instead, the judge who sentenced Qadri has fled Pakistan. Aasia Bibi, the Christian at the heart of the furore, remains in jail. And Taseer&apos;s son, Shahbaz, has been kidnapped \u2013 probably by Qadri sympathisers. An ugly spectacle, it betrays questions about something deeply unhealthy at the core of Pakistani society. Still, many Pakistanis have similar doubts. There is a striking amount of national introspection in a hearteningly vibrant press. But which way out of the quagmire? Imran Khan, the cricket star turned political sensation, says he has answers. He exudes the confidence of a man who believes his time has come.But his ideas are controversial and, critics say, naive. His stance against &quot;politics&quot; echoes that of Musharraf a decade ago \u2013 a perception he will have to work hard to dispel. People often ask the most basic question about Pakistan: will it survive? The question has been going round for decades; the naysayers inevitably silenced. Is the current situation any more precarious? The country has deep stores of resilience, but is more vulnerable to external shocks than ever before. One thing, however, is clear: inshallah may have worked until now, but it is no longer enough.

Network Rail is carrying out some repairs between 27 and 31 December, with the most significant disruption in parts of Reading, Birmingham, Edinburgh and east London. But rail works will be fewer than previous years, with 54,000 more trains expected to run than last year, and far fewer replacement buses. The AA predicts a staggered getaway for the 18m cars on the road this Christmas, with some schools having broken up yesterday and 25 December falling on a Sunday. The busiest days are expected to be Thursday and Friday 22 and 23 December, when journey times could double in the busiest spots. A survey of its members shows that most plan to stay home but one in four will drive, with 10% set to undertake a journey of more than 100 miles. People in the north-east are most likely to stay put, the AA says. Londoners are most likely to travel. Hot spots include the M1 between the M25 junction and Milton Keynes, the M4 between Chiswick, west London, and Newbury, and parts of the M25. The M6 in the West Midlands and from Stoke to the M62, and the perennially busy M4/M5 junction. While there will be fewer commuters and lorries on the roads, last-minute shopping could mean busy traffic around out-of-town shopping centres. The Highways Agency plans to complete the majority of current roadworks by 23 December \u2013 more than 500 miles of roadworks on motorways and A roads. Some other works will be suspended for the holiday period (easing lane restrictions) but works will continue on the M1 and on widening the M25. The AA warns drivers that even if the current weather forecast is not bad, road conditions can be unpredictable. It said: &quot;Drivers should do the basic checks on your car and pack the essential winter kit including, warm clothing, food, water, de-icer, ice scraper and a fully-charged mobile in case you run into difficulty.&quot; Abta, the travel association, estimates that 4.25 million Britons will be heading overseas over the holiday period, slightly more than last year. Some 780,000 expected to pass through Heathrow airport from 15 December \u2013 its peak day \u2013 until the end of Sunday, the busiest forecast period of the pre-Christmas getaway for air travel, with New York and Dubai the top destinations. A total of 3.35 million passengers are expected at Heathrow during the school holidays. Gatwick will handle 1.3 million departures and arrivals, with traffic peaking on 23 December. For those who see no escape from the reunion of distant relatives, there is a sliver of hope: the bookies are still talking up the odds of incoming snow and an icy blast. Aberdeen is the 5-2 favourite to see snow on Christmas Day, and London&apos;s odds tightening from 8-1 to 5-1 against. But punters \u2013 and anyone travelling \u2013 should note that their most likely scenario is temperatures reaching 6-9C.", "title": "Smooth Christmas getaway in prospect with UK transport links working well", "sentences": ["Some 780,000 expected to pass through Heathrow airport from 15 December \u2013 its peak day \u2013 until the end of Sunday, the busiest forecast period of the pre-Christmas getaway for air travel, with New York and Dubai the top destinations."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-16T20:10:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/dec/16/raithwaite-hall-yorkshire-hotel-review", "tags": ["Hotels", "Travel", "Yorkshire holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Europe holidays", "England holidays"], "article": "Set back on the clifftops at Sandsend, 19th-century Raithwaite Hall was once a local shipping magnate&apos;s country pile. Now, it is owned by property and leisure group Skelwith, which has spent \u00a330m turning it into a 45-bedroom hotel. It describes itself as a &quot;country retreat&quot;, but Raithwaite is also a spa and a wedding venue, with business conference facilities. Quaint it ain&apos;t. It is a well-oiled machine, a hospitality hub aiming \u2013 and this isn&apos;t necessarily pejorative \u2013 to be all things to all people. There isn&apos;t much, from mountain biking to a day&apos;s shooting, that the hotel can&apos;t organise for guests. Depa, &quot;the world&apos;s largest interior contractor&quot; (it worked on the Savoy and Dubai&apos;s Burj Khalifa), styled the hotel, which, like the Raithwaite Rolls-Royce parked outside, conforms to a wealthy, middle-aged idea of contemporary good taste. The restaurant&apos;s glass-walled wine store, itself a big-city cliche, is as edgy as it gets. That said, while there were details in my entry-level bedroom (mustard carpet; gilt-frames; antique-style furniture) that weren&apos;t to my taste, it is spacious and very well-equipped. It was clearly conceived by somebody with an astute grasp of what guests value in a hotel bedroom. The bed is huge and luxuriously comfortable, with high-quality linens. The heating is easily adjusted, the Wi-Fi/TV idiot-proof. There is a well-stocked tea tray, fruit bowl, iron, hairdryer and iPod dock, plus a balcony that overlooks Raithwaite&apos;s manicured gardens. In the bathroom, there are Molton Brown toiletries and a handsome Villeroy &amp; Boch suite. Being a bar rather than spa man (people pad the corridors in bath robes, like it&apos;s a sanatorium), I head to the lounge, where, as Sinatra croons over the PA, Raithwaite&apos;s well-drilled staff pamper guests, without getting too obsequious. Everyone knows your name, Mr Naylor. Which is a little disconcerting, Mr Naylor. But the staff are personable, natural, at ease.     The pool at Raithwaite Hall    The restaurant majors, unadventurously, on steaks, from Yorkshire-bred Limousin cattle. My 300g 45-day aged rib-eye, mapped with fat and grilled, bone-in, over wood, to a precise medium rare, is sensational. It should be for \u00a328. The chips, however, are slightly underdone and a pork belly and black pudding fritter starter is OK, but needs streamlining, refining. The elaborate breakfast (there&apos;s chorizo, smoked salmon, all sorts) is a self-service buffet, sadly. Why buy high-quality local sausages then leave them hanging around in a warmer? After breakfast, I follow a path through woodland towards Sandsend, pheasants fleeing as I approach. It&apos;s a magical little route that gives way to great sea views. If you want to treat your dad for his 60th, take him to Raithwaite. He&apos;ll love it. If a friend&apos;s getting married here, stay. You&apos;ll enjoy it. But will it set your pulse racing?

Yet looking backwards causes terrible neck wrinkles, you know. So seeing as I&apos;ve just run out of my daily essential, Sisley Advanced Extra Firming Neck Cream, I shall keep my gaze steadfastly forward and my throat wattle-free. Instead, I shall plop a stylish turban upon my head \u2013 star and Saturn patterns are just so now \u2013 and carefully remove my crystal ball from my Mulberry Alexa bag \u2013 it&apos;s not an It bag; it&apos;s an heirloom \u2013 as I gaze into the future, looking at how certain stories that began in 2011 pan out in 2012. Strike up the futuristic music! The Republicans ban women from having sex (except with them) In 2011 America&apos;s right wing, and especially the Christian right wing, at last let slip what their problem is with contraception and abortion: it&apos;s not squeamishness, morality or a fondness for hanging outside Planned Parenthood clinics toting misspelt placards \u2013 they just don&apos;t like women having sex. At all. As Amanda Marcotte wrote this week, in 2011 the anti-choice movement &quot;stopped trying so hard to manage mainstream perceptions of themselves as somehow just great lovers of fetal life, and are coming out with their anti-sex agenda&quot;. This was borne out in their frankly unhinged attacks on Planned Parenthood, the HPV vaccine, insurance coverage of contraception and, as I discussed last week, the puritanical mood they created that encouraged President Obama to restrict access to Plan B, or the morning-after pill, none of which have much to do with abortion and everything to do with women&apos;s temerity to have sex. Thus, in 2012 the Republicans propose the female anti-sex bill, in which women are expressly forbidden from having sex with anyone other than the occasional lecherous politician who happens to hurl himself, bodily, sweatily, in her lucky, lucky path. Newt Gingrich becomes the face of the family values party And here&apos;s one Republican politician who definitely doesn&apos;t mind women having sex, as long as it&apos;s with him. And there does seem to be a surprising number of candidates for the job, considering he looks like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man in Ghostbusters, and his name is Newt. For those of you who haven&apos;t had the pleasure \u2013 of meeting him, I mean, of course, of meeting him \u2013 here is a crash course in the Republican party&apos;s current presidential front runner. This champion of family values cheated on his second wife with a woman 22 years younger than him at precisely the same time he was attempting to impeach Clinton for \u2013 and maybe you saw this part coming \u2013 cheating on his wife with a woman 22 years younger than him. Gingrich claimed that his actions stemmed from &quot;how passionately I felt about this country&quot; and, truly, nothing says &quot;patriotism&quot; more clearly than taking your pants off and banging a congressional aide \u2013 as long as you&apos;re Newt Gingrich, of course. He declined to attend the wedding of his lesbian half-sister, Candace Gingrich-Jones, having referred to gay marriage as &quot;a temporary aberration&quot; and, really, there is no one better placed to sound off on the sanctity of the institution of marriage than Newt Gingrich. Sadly, space prevents me from getting too deeply into other subtleties of Newt&apos;s character \u2013 that he condemned Freddie Mac for its part in the housing collapse while omitting to mention that he had received $1.6m from them as a consultant, say \u2013 but let&apos;s just say that he is the perfect summation of all the ticklish and self-serving contradictions one now expects of a party that argues for tax breaks for the rich while pretending to be a friend of the working man. Newt for 2012! It emerges that the News of the World bugged Kate Middleton&apos;s womb I mean, we all know it already, don&apos;t we? But it&apos;s not until early February 2012 that conclusive proof is proffered in the form of an email, dated the day after the royal wedding, addressed to James Murdoch and News International executives, assuring them the &quot;device&quot; is now sitting in &quot;KM&apos;s cervix&quot; and is under 24-hour surveillance. They all issue statements insisting they never in their lives saw that email, even though responses from each of them range from &quot;Great\u2013 splash when it fertilises&quot;, &quot;Get a camera up there, too, yeah?&quot; and a smiley emoticon (from Murdoch). Shane Warne literally becomes Elizabeth Hurley While Warne attributed his Marvel Comics-like transformation in 2011 to &quot;happiness&quot;, it emerges in 2012 that actually this was all part of a plan by Hurley to turn him into her clone. It&apos;s hard work being Hurley, you know \u2013 all that bathing-suit designing and talking to Grazia magazine about one&apos;s latest diet \u2013 so no wonder she needed an avatar. When Warne burnt his hand he claimed this was &quot;a cooking accident&quot;, sparking comparisons to Michael Scott in The Office: An American Workplace when he burns his foot while making bacon. In fact, he was recovering after a hand transplant as Warne&apos;s natural hands were clearly unacceptably calloused and appeared to have done more in their life than flick his hair and not eat. Photos of Hurley and Warne (left), looking like identical twins, strolling down Sloane Street together looking for the perfect cashmere V-neck jumper become tabloid staples in 2012.

When the discrepancy emerged, an Inland Revenue inspector said he would &quot;let me off&quot; with no more than the tax, the interest and, as I recall, a \u00a31,000 fine. After reading today&apos;s Commons report on tax avoidance, I realise my mistake. I should have told the inspector I worked for Goldman Sachs, invited him to Le Gavroche and suggested a hundred quid would settle the business, plus a partnership when he retired. It is the old story. When you owe the Revenue a thousand pounds you have a problem. When you owe it a billion pounds, the revenue has a problem, but also a solution. In good times such stories merely water the envious eye. In bad times they induce blind rage. Why the hell should people be expected to lose their jobs, their houses, their lifestyles, when the government is a soft touch for the rich and powerful? This is not a matter of left or right, socialist or capitalist. Britons are now embarking on a journey into a dark night of economic gloom. Nothing will make them less inclined to co-operate than the sight of a lucky few rowing to safety in gold-plated lifeboats. The coalition government has made a wholly justified attempt at fairness in certain areas of its spending. Those on phoney sickness benefit should not take money from those in honest work. Those on public salaries should not enjoy pension rights beyond the dreams of those in the private sector. Those who choose large families should not live subsidised in smart houses at the expense of those who cannot afford such places. But fairness cuts both ways. Today&apos;s report on the tax leniency shown by the Revenue towards big corporations indicates that toughness towards the poor is not replicated by toughness towards the rich. The estimate was of some \u00a325bn in taxes gone missing, the bulk of it concealed by an insistence on &quot;commercial confidentiality&quot;, otherwise known as incompetent secrecy. Goldman Sachs appeared to have paid \u00a320m less than it should on bonuses alone, and was excused with a \u00a310m payment ex gratia and a &quot;handshake&quot; with the boss of the Revenue. Vodaphone paid just \u00a31.25bn towards a tax bill that should have been some \u00a36bn. The reasonable assumption is that these cases were tips of an iceberg. Meanwhile the relevant inspectors were being wined, dined and offered jobs by the grandees of the accountancy firms overseeing the scams. This government, so draconian towards spending in public, is proving as casual towards dodgy money in private as were Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Earlier this month the Olympics boss, Lord Coe, moseyed into Downing Street and said that his opening and closing ceremonies were looking a bit mean at \u00a340m. Could he double it to \u00a381m for more tinsel? Rather than scream and kick him downstairs, David Cameron said: my dear chap, but of course. I wonder what the prime minister would have said if his lordship had been asking for a care home, a library or a clinic. Much of the trouble comes down to the inexperience of ingenue ministers, and their susceptibility to the pestilence of lobbying now infecting Westminster. On this occasion the hapless Olympics minister, Hugh Robertson, claimed that the extra \u00a341m was &quot;worth \u00a32-5bn in advertising revenue alone&quot;, a rate of return so fanciful as to suggest a lobbyist&apos;s lunch beyond all imagining. Robertson also claimed to need another \u00a3271m for games security (not to mention 10,000 troops, warships and surface-to-air missiles), despite it being &quot;not in response to any specific security threat&quot;. It was just money. This was merely the climax of naivety. In their first month in office, ministers were told \u2013 and believed \u2013 that it would be &quot;more expensive&quot; to cancel two new aircraft carriers than to build them. Ministers were told it would cost \u00a32bn to cancel Labour&apos;s crazy NHS computer rather than dump it in the nearest skip. Chris Huhne, darling of the renewables industry, wants to give it \u00a38bn a year to rescue the planet, one of the quickest ways of transferring money from poor consumer to rich landowner yet found. The chancellor, George Osborne, was told by lobbyists he could save \u00a33bn a year by giving away commercial planning permissions. All this was statistical rubbish. If local government behaved as credulously as Whitehall it would be summoned before the audit commission and subject to surcharge. When ministers pay out such sums it is &quot;in the national interest&quot;, and the Treasury and national audit office nod in sage agreement. It may be a corny adage, but it remains glaring that almost no holder of high office in Britain at present has ever met a payroll, run a business or cut a corporate budget. They are children playing with sweets. Osborne is the scourge of public sector unions and condemns tax avoidance, yet he refuses to end the scandal of crown tax havens, from Jersey to the Caymans, that enjoy the benefits of British citizenship while enabling individuals and corporations to evade British tax. Last week the European Union lectured Britain on financial regulation, while harbouring on its borders such fiscal black holes as Monaco, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. The thesis, accepted by governments of all parties, that the rich should be allowed to escape tax for their &quot;wealth-creating potential&quot; has surely been exploded by the credit crunch. It is not the kind of wealth Britain can afford. If Goldman Sachs dislikes paying British taxes it should go to Dubai, not just the first-class lounge at Heathrow. The control of public expenditure is never perfectly equitable. It is war by other means. But when large sections of the public are being asked to bear the burden of cuts in their standard of living \u2013 largely through the action and inaction of government \u2013 they are entitled to see at least a semblance of fair play. Just because lobbyists say bonuses and tax havens are &quot;essential to Britain&apos;s recovery&quot; does not mean they are. The government&apos;s tolerance of both is more than stupid. It induces cynicism in the public realm and recruits fair-minded people to the cause of St Paul&apos;s protesters and public sector strikers. Nothing is more crucial to national wellbeing at a time like this than a sense of equality of misery.

There is no better walk in the world than the Boxing Day stroll across Fitzroy Gardens to the G and this year with India in town there is lots to contemplate. As Boxing Day morning dawns in Australia, and Christmas Day in England has had its energy sapped, I will be wondering if Ricky Ponting will still be an Australian Test cricketer by the end of the Test series, whether Sachin Tendulkar will choose the MCG as the place for his 100th India century (my money is on Adelaide), and whether the old curmudgeon Duncan Fletcher, now coach of India, will gain revenge for the 5-0 Australia whitewash that hastened his removal as England coach. The headlines might tempt you to imagine that not much has changed in the years since Fletcher&apos;s England reign turned sour. Then Shane Warne was talking about how he had bowled out England. Now Warne is still talking about taking wickets, only these days he has taken the art a stage further and is predicting his wickets on microphone. Such is Warne&apos;s allure that, as I write, the most read sports story on guardian.co.uk is how during a match between Melbourne All Stars and Brisbane Heat at The Gabba in Australia&apos;s Big Bash Twenty20 League, Warne predicted how he might dismiss New Zealand&apos;s Brendon McCullum \u2013 and did just that. McCullum, who a couple of days earlier had his nose broken by a bouncer from Brett Lee, seems cast in the role of New Zealand fall guy. Ponting&apos;s retention for the Melbourne Test, or the indeed the dropping of Phil Hughes, both far more significant stories for the purist, have not even warranted a mention. It is the glam of the Big Bash that gets the attention. Warne&apos;s ability to drum up publicity for the Big Bash by burning his hand while cooking a bacon sandwich and announcing himself doubtful for the opening match just shows there is no end to the happy gullibility of journalists eager for a celebrity story. The Big Bash approaches the end of its first week in reasonable shape. If the size of the crowds has been just the good side of modest, with some fans no doubt enticed by the return of full-strength beer, the viewing figures have been impressive. Warne&apos;s presence helped the match between Melbourne Stars and Sydney Thunder in the opening round draw an average of 488,000 viewers for the subscription channel, Foxtel, with an overall reach of 900,000. These do not sound overly large, but in the history of Australian pay-TV only three programmes have ever drawn a larger audience. There again, statistics can be used to prove all manner of things \u2014 you could also contend that nearly half the people failed to watch the whole match. It remains to be seen whether the momentum can be maintained. By staging the tournament from 16 December to 28 January, Cricket Australia has pitted it directly against the Test series with India. &quot;Different audiences \u2014 and different cities,&quot; says Cricket Australia&apos;s chief executive, James Sutherland, and he has a point, but that will mean an absence of Australia&apos;s Test players for the bulk of the tournament. England&apos;s domestic Twenty20 must also survive with minimal involvement from its international stars, with coverage on a subscription channel and lukewarm media interest. But indications are that Australia is making a better effort of marketing an eight-team franchise than England is of promoting an 18-team county tournament. Steve Elworthy, the ECB&apos;s marketing and communications director, will have an all but impossible task to promote England&apos;s domestic T20 to its maximum extent as long as the England international fixture list is so overcrowded that the domestic circuit suffocates for lack of breathing holes. I made that point to David Morgan this autumn in a hotel in Leeds as he carried out research into the future of county cricket. &quot;It&apos;s all about breathing holes, David,&quot; I repeated at polite, five-minute intervals. Eventually, by force of repetition, I persuaded him to write it down, very neatly at the corner of his notebook, although I&apos;m not convinced that he ever wrote it up again. It is vital that lovers of Test cricket embrace Twenty20 not fear it. Without the commercial success that Twenty20 can bring, and a broader interest among future generations that it will encourage, Test cricket&apos;s chances of long-term survival are reduced. The game cannot survive for ever on half a dozen decent international sides and domestic set-ups in permanent financial crisis. There are dangers that Twenty20 will develop its own stars, wedded entirely to the instant game, and further dangers that senior players such as Chris Gayle will retire prematurely from Test cricket, in the words of the American blues singer Jonny Lang, to wander this world all alone, dragging their feet from continent to continent in search of another easy pay day. But the dangers are far greater if cricket refuses to serve the needs of a more impatient, more loosely committed audience. The walk to the MCG on Boxing Day will feel stranger this year. It will be a walk that brings not just memories of the past, or anticipation of the present, but trepidation about the future, but for all that it remains one of the great walks in the world.The World Cricket Forum is taking a Christmas break and will return on Thursday 5 January Wednesday 4 January, 2pm update \u2022 Michael Clarke&apos;s transformation from pup to big dog continues apace. Scorned by some for an apparent un-Australian effeteness, captaincy appears to have produced a distinct stiffening of the sinews in a wonderfully talented player. Clarke&apos;s 251 off 342 balls overnight against India provided confirmation not just of fine form and an ability to respond positively to pressure, but of a more assertive presence at the crease. Clarke has four hundreds in his last 7 tests as captain, all of them vital scores. Plus there is a fascinating sense of role-reversal \u2013 in this hemisphere at least, after our Athers and our Stewie and our furious Nasser \u2013 to see an Australian captain in charge of a reconstructive team leading by admirable example. Clarke looks like the right man at the right time. Even better: at this rate Ricky Ponting might even be back on these shores in 2013. \u2022 Jacques Kallis may have a few more hairs on his chest than Clarke (and even one or two on his head these days) but that only makes scoring a Big Daddy hundred even more appropriate. The ursine South African had already notched his 41st Test century yesterday, and he went on to convert that into his second double ton on the way to a new best score of 224. AB de Villiers also recorded a hundred before South Africa declared on 580 for four; though Sri Lanka made a solid start to their reply, captain and opener Tillakaratne Dilshan motoring to his fifty off just 41 balls. \u2022 And Ian Bell has been talking about using the practice facilities at the International Cricket Council&apos;s global academy in Dubai, ahead of England&apos;s series against Pakistan: &quot;It&apos;s nice to have had a break.

With schools finished for the year and many workers taking additional days off to get away early, the AA says it is expecting 18m cars to take to the roads over the holiday period. Journey times on major routes are likely to double on Thursday and Friday, it said. An AA spokesman said on Thursday: &quot;Today and tomorrow will be the two busiest days. However, because it&apos;s a normal working day, we are expecting Friday lunchtime and early afternoon to be very busy. &quot;Lots of people will take half a day or employers will exercise goodwill so people will leave early.

A total of 4.25 million Britons are due to travel overseas between 16 December and 3 January, compared with just under four million for the festive period in 2010/11. This year, around 1.7 million festive travellers will be leaving from Heathrow airport, 425,000 from Stansted, 750,000 from Gatwick and 210,000 from Luton. A further 340,000 will take off from Manchester airport, 165,000 from Birmingham and 120,000 from Glasgow, while many thousands will be crossing the Channel or travelling through the Channel tunnel. Heathrow&apos;s most popular destinations this Christmas are New York, Dubai, Dublin, Amsterdam and Paris. Other hotspots include the Canary Islands, Cuba and Mexico. For those heading to the continent, there was misery on Thursday as a 24-hour strike by Belgian workers meant Eurostar&apos;s trains from London to Brussels had to start and terminate in Lille. Services to Paris were operating normally and were not affected by the strike. On the roads, it is anticipated that getaway traffic will be heavy on major routes, including the M1 in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, the M4 between London and Newbury in Berkshire, the M25 around London, and the M4 and M5 in the West Country. The Highways Agency, which is responsible for England&apos;s motorways and major A-roads, said it planned to complete more than 500 miles of roadworks before Christmas while a further 60 miles will be suspended from Friday until 3 January. In total, 118 sets of roadworks should be finished by Christmas, with works staying in place at 26 locations, including a 32-mile section of the M1 near Luton in Bedfordshire. Other areas where works will still be in place include a 15.5-mile section of the M25 near St Albans in Hertfordshire, a section of the M4 near Wokingham in Berkshire and a 12-mile section of the M62 near Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. At the Trafford Centre in Manchester, the Christmas getaway led to an increase in trade in the last few days before shops shut. &quot;The Trafford Centre has been exceptionally busy over the last few days and there are no signs of it letting up as we head into the home straight,&quot; said Gordon McKinnon, operations manager. &quot;The fact that there&apos;s a full week before Christmas this year coupled with people&apos;s desire to hold on to their money for as long as possible makes this year&apos;s last-minute rush even more intense and we expect this to continue right up until we close at 6pm on Christmas Eve \u2013 getaway or not. Everybody wants a bargain this year and so the post-Christmas sales are going to be huge.&quot; The centre has extended its Boxing Day opening hours in anticipation for the demand for a bargain, from 9am to 10pm this year. Some stores will be opening even earlier to get the sales started. The Bluewater shopping centre in Kent was also experiencing an equally big influx of shoppers. On the rail network, buses are replacing trains on many routes over Christmas and new year. However rail officials have said that the number of replacement buses has halved compared with the 2010/11 festive period, and about 54,000 more trains will be running this year compared with last. As much as \u00a3109m of work is being done on the network over the holiday period, with projects including work at Birmingham New Street station and Reading station in Berkshire. Travel will be free on tubes and London buses from 11.45pm on New Year&apos;s Eve until 4.30am on New Year&apos;s Day. Those hoping for a white Christmas are likely to be disappointed, with a wet and mild one predicted instead. Temperatures could reach as high as 14C (57F) on Christmas Day, not far short of the 25 December record of 15.6C set in 1896 at Leith near Edinburgh. There will be similar temperatures on Boxing Day, which will see Scotland and Northern Ireland having more rain while in England and Wales it will be dry, but cloudy. The number of people taking the whole of the Christmas and new year period off work in the UK was expected to be higher than last year&apos;s figure of about five million, said the Centre for Economics and Business Research.", "title": "Christmas travel: AA warns that journey times could double", "sentences": ["Heathrow&apos;s most popular destinations this Christmas are New York, Dubai, Dublin, Amsterdam and Paris."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-22T12:49:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/22/inquiry-us-airstrike-pakistan-troops", "tags": ["US military", "Pakistan", "World news", "US news"], "article": "A US military investigation into the deaths of 24 Pakistani soldiers in repeated air strikes by American warplanes on two border outposts last month has found that both sides were to blame after a chain of misunderstandings led to a &quot;tragic result&quot;. But a key finding of the inquiry \u2013 that Pakistani troops fired first \u2013 is likely to infuriate Pakistani military authorities and provoke a new row. In statements hastily issued on Thursday after elements of the secret report surfaced in the American press, Pentagon spokesmen blamed the incident on poor co-ordination between Pakistani troops, a joint US-Afghan special forces unit targeting a Taliban training camp and the Nato personnel who called in the air strikes. Mapping errors compounded the mistakes. But crucially, a Pentagon statement read: &quot;The investigating officer found that US forces, given what information they had available to them at the time, acted in self defence and with appropriate force after being fired upon.&quot; Pakistani officials have repeatedly claimed their men were deliberately attacked, saying that it was impossible that they were mistaken for insurgents. In the aftermath of the clash, General Ashfaq Kayani, the chief of the army staff and the most senior soldier in Pakistan, publicly pledged to &quot;defend the sovereignty of the country at all costs&quot; and reportedly gave ground commanders permission to return fire against any &quot;aggression&quot; across the border from Nato forces operating in Afghanistan. The Pentagon statement said the inquiry had found &quot;there was no intentional effort to target persons or places known to be part of the Pakistani military, or to deliberately provide inaccurate location information to Pakistani officials&quot;. Pakistani military officials were not available for comment on Thursday. The report comes at a difficult moment for the deeply unpopular Pakistani civilian government, which is already under pressure from the military and elements of the senior judiciary. President Asif Ali Zardari, who is also co-chairman of the ruling Pakistan People&apos;s party, recently travelled to Dubai for medical treatment, sparking rumours of an imminent coup. He has now returned to Pakistan but the sense that his hold on power is slipping is still strong. On Thursday Yousuf Raza Gilani, the Pakistani prime minister, told an audience in Islamabad that there was a conspiracy to oust the country&apos;s civilian government. &quot;Conspiracies are being hatched to pack up the elected government,&quot; Gilani said. Though he did not specifically blame the powerful military, which has ruled Pakistan through much of its 64-year independent history, the prime minister later insisted in a speech to parliament that the army operate under the authority of elected politicians. &quot;They cannot be a state within a state,&quot; he said. Gilani&apos;s comments came as the supreme court began a hearing into a secret memo sent to Washington earlier this year asking for help in averting a supposed military coup. The affair has already led to the resignation of Pakistan&apos;s ambassador to the US and threatens the president. Analysts say it is unlikely any coup would see &quot;tanks rolling down the street&quot; but is more likely to see the ousting of Zardari, 56, through &quot;the manipulation of constitutional mechanisms&quot;. The prospect of further political instability will not cheer Washington, however disillusioned US policymakers are with the current administration. Relations between the Pakistani security establishment and their American military and intelligence counterparts have deteriorated over recent months and years. In the immediate aftermath of the Afghan war of 2001, co-operation on a range of issues was good and America supplied about $1bn (\u00a3638m) worth of military aid each year through the past decade to the Pakistani army. But distrust is now deep on both sides. Dr Humayun Khan, a former Pakistani foreign secretary, said the report made any improvement in the near future unlikely. &quot;Our side were very categoric about what had happened and will simply deny credibility of the findings of this investigation,&quot; Khan said. &quot;The incident was a humiliation for them as it makes it look like they can&apos;t protect our borders.&quot; The Pakistani army is still smarting from the American raid in which Osama bin Laden was killed in May. The al-Qaida leader was found by US intelligence in a northern Pakistani garrison town, leading many in Pakistan to question the military&apos;s competence and others in America to question their allies&apos; loyalties. Pakistani authorities were not informed about the operation in advance. In the aftermath of last month&apos;s border incident, Islamabad demanded that US forces quit a base in the west of the country where unmanned drones were based, significantly reduced intelligence co-operation and closed important border crossings used by Nato to ship fuel and other supplies to coalition forces in Afghanistan. Last week, unhappy at the apparent inability of Pakistani forces to stem the flow of components for bombs used to kill international forces in Afghanistan, the US Congress proposed freezing a $700m tranche of American aid. The Pentagon statement did however offer &quot;deepest regret&quot;. Pakistani authorities have demanded, but not recived, a personal apology from President Barack Obama. Khan, the former diplomat, said at some stage relations would have to improve. &quot;Pakistan can&apos;t really afford to annoy the US permanently and will have to cool down a bit at some stage,&quot; he said.", "title": "Inquiry into US airstrike on Pakistan troops finds both sides to blame", "sentences": ["President Asif Ali Zardari, who is also co-chairman of the ruling Pakistan People&apos;s party, recently travelled to Dubai for medical treatment, sparking rumours of an imminent coup."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-22T17:16:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/22/mission-impossible-ghost-protocol-review", "tags": ["Tom Cruise", "Simon Pegg", "Thriller", "Action and adventure", "Film", "Culture"], "article": "Cinema's most respectable hoodie Tom Cruise is back, slouching moodily out of the poster for the latest enjoyable Mission Impossible caper, directed by Brad \"Incredibles\" Bird. He is Ethan Hunt, leader of the International Missions Force or IMF \u2013 wiry, taut, fiercely focused, unfeasibly buff for a man of any age, never mind 49. He must now lead his crew in disguise, in disgrace, in the shadows, because an event repeatedly forewarned in his mission briefing has come to pass. His team has been disowned by the US government who have invoked something solemnly called \"ghost protocol\". They have been stitched up for a bombing at the Kremlin and are now on their own, needing to restore their good name in the action-adventure community and, unaided, recapture a nuclear activation device invented by a crazy terrorist (Michael Nyqvist) intent on Armageddon. \nIn Hunt's team is the gorgeous Jane (Paula Patton), the beta-plus warrior male Brandt (Jeremy Renner), and the comedy one, Benji, played by Simon Pegg, who really rather often manages to steal the movie.

That's a very woozy experience on Imax. There's some great gadgetry: particularly a portable gauze camouflage screen that permits Ethan and Benji to creep up a Kremlin corridor invisibly \u2013 a very surreal moment. The film sags a little during later scenes in India, and Ethan has a slightly baffling kissing moment with Jane, leaving us unsure exactly how much sexual chemistry we are supposed to expect between Cruise and Patton, given that this tragic widower is still supposed to have tender memories of his departed wife.

As for the film itself \u2013 the first act&apos;s a blast, the second is gripping, the third is \u2026 meh, proving it&apos;s not just the title that suffers from an anticlimactic tail-off. But would you look at me, talking in &quot;acts&quot; like that. Anyone would think I was an action movie screenwriter! At one point Ethan Hunt (if only they&apos;d called him Derek) and his buddies are accused of blowing up the Kremlin. (Not a spoiler since it&apos;s in the trailer.) I started thinking: &quot;Heh heh, how on earth are those scallywags going to get out of Russia now?&quot; But then, suddenly, they&apos;re in Dubai! The film skips from one act to the next other without even bothering to join up the dots and tell us how they got there! I&apos;m not saying this is necessarily a Bad Thing; there&apos;s only so much amusement to be had from watching people trying to sneak through airport lounges or past border control. But if that&apos;s the case, why bother paying lip service to plot at all? Why not just serve up three action setpieces with chapter headings, the way Quentin Tarantino sidestepped the pesky narrative-flow problem in Inglourious Basterds? Why not just give us Act I: Moscow; Act II: Dubai; Act III: Mumbai? You could probably extend this policy to all the other action movies ever made. For example, you&apos;d have Act I: Trapped in an Elevator! Act II: Trapped on a Bus! Act III: Trapped on a Runaway Tube Train! (Speed being an exemplary title that had no need of pesky punctuation.) You wouldn&apos;t even need to go through the motions of developing your characters since they&apos;re all archetypes anyway \u2013 Hero, Villain, Girl, a Disposable Sidekick or two. If there were problems telling them apart, you could give Villain a big moustache. It&apos;s true that the three-pronged narrative seems natural, since what all stories have in common is a beginning, middle and end (if not necessarily in that order). But I&apos;m not sure Syd Field had this reductio ad absurdum in mind when he first outlined the setup-confrontation-resolution paradigm in screenwriting guides that have convinced generations of would-be William Goldmans that the three-act structure is the only way to go. But after Ghost Protocol I got to thinking, why not junk the third act altogether? Action films would end on a high and we&apos;d go home feeling satisfied, instead of underwhelmed and slightly fractious, like children fed on too many E numbers. Do we really need to see the narrative resolved? Don&apos;t make me laugh; there is no narrative, just a series of action setpieces strung together with sundry MacGuffins and wisps of back story. Just as there are no characters, only Cruise and a bunch of stooges handpicked to make him look good. Come to think of it, many 2011 blockbusters would have worked better if they&apos;d had their third acts lopped off: X-Men: First Class, Captain America: The First Avenger, In Time, Contagion, Source Code are just some that spring to mind. Losing the third act would not only prevent films from overstaying their welcome, it would also bypass that inevitable post-action tristesse when the third act fails to live up to its predecessors by delivering a coup de grace that is bigger and better than anything we&apos;ve seen in the film so far, and by extension anything we&apos;ve seen in the cinema, ever. You&apos;d go home thinking &quot;Wow, I wish I could get more of that,&quot; instead of &quot;That would have been good, if only it had been 20 minutes shorter.&quot; The makers of action movies seem to think what we want is more spectacular action and faster running and bigger explosions, whereas no, those are things we know we&apos;ll be getting anyway. What we&apos;d really like is for them to work a bit harder on the nuts and bolts that are supposed to be holding the action and running and explosions in place \u2013 character, motivation, plot.

In a season usually \u2013 or at least largely \u2013 dedicated to tony prestige pictures \u2013 the annual casting of Oscar bait \u2013 there are no less than three mass-market Hollywood franchises hogging all the attention and, inevitably, ticket sales: Steven Spielberg&apos;s The Adventures of Tintin, David Fincher&apos;s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Brad Bird&apos;s Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol. Though major investments are on the line and the box office won&apos;t share the wealth evenly, these aren&apos;t exactly risky bets. The first two are lavishly mounted adaptations of beloved best-selling books, directed by auteurs as bankable as they are revered; and the last film is the fourth instalment in a longstanding series, as well as the first live-action film from a prince of Pixar. And though all three titles would have made sense on sun-dappled marquees, they distinguish themselves from last summer&apos;s superhero fantasies and frat-house comedies on one crucial front: they&apos;re actually good. Of course, there&apos;s still a surfeit of awards aspirants crowding into theaters this weekend, including Angelina Jolie&apos;s Balkan war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey, the Glenn-Close-in-drag offering Albert Nobbs, and Wim Wenders&apos;s 3D dance doc Pina (all opening on Friday), Spielberg&apos;s War Horse and Stephen Daldry&apos;s 9/11 inspirational weepie, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (opening on Christmas Day). But late December isn&apos;t quite what it used to be, at least not since James Cameron altered the landscape by conquering all comers at Christmastime 2009. Prestige is all well and good (and if Oscars are in the offing, potentially profitable), but Avatar reminded the industry of what it&apos;s always known but infrequently achieved: that there&apos;s nothing like the gift of a blockbuster for the holidays. With annual grosses down nearly $1 billion from 2010 heading into the year&apos;s final week, Hollywood has a lot riding on this season&apos;s pop trinity. Considering his last two films (The Social Network and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, David Fincher&apos;s latest might be mistaken for a prestige film. But The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has less in common with those recent forays into respectability than it does with his 1995 breakout, the low-lit, high body count pop thriller, Se7en. If the masterful Zodiac systematically frustrated what we came to expect from clever serial killer riddles like Se7en, Dragon Tattoo reverts to form, connecting the dots to arrive at a comparatively comforting (and familiarly sado-masochistic) conclusion. Yet the director remains more interested in procedure than payoff. The film can&apos;t shed its source material&apos;s rape-revenge-fantasy dubiousness \u2013 heinous homicides aren&apos;t shown, but sick and twisted sexual assaults are \u2013\u00a0but it doesn&apos;t take time to wallow, and instead drives ceaselessly forward, showing us as many shiny things from as many clever angles as it can (and at 160 minutes, it shows a lot). For all the attention paid to piercings, tattoos, leather and chains, Fincher, like his fastidious heroes, most ardently fetishizes his own craft. While his War Horse assumes the posture of an old-fashioned Hollywood epic, Spielberg&apos;s CGI-animated The Adventures of Tintin, which weaves together elements of three of Herg\u00e9&apos;s beloved graphic novels, simply goes for a ride. Spielberg hasn&apos;t had this much fun since Jurassic Park, and hasn&apos;t made a film this exuberantly single-minded since Raiders of the Lost Ark. Whereas Fincher finds momentum in an accumulation of perfectly realized shots, Spielberg takes advantage of CGI&apos;s elasticity and puts the &quot;camera&quot; in constant motion, making the sweeping, tracking and dollying \u2013 over land, sand and sea \u2013 into a language of exploration. Though it helps heal the psychic scars left by the likes of The Polar Express, for all of its impeccably realized environments Tintin still can&apos;t solve for CGI&apos;s dead-eyed soullessness. So Spielberg just keeps going, never slowing down for personal identification or existential contemplation, making Tintin (voiced by Jaime Bell) less a character than a conduit for the boyish adventurer in us all. The most seasonally disorienting release of the week is Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, the only instalment in Tom Cruise&apos;s spy thriller franchise to not receive a May release. The season&apos;s changed, but not the series. Brad Bird&apos;s film sticks to the MI template, offering up breathless, touristic, ludicrously staged action (while thankfully giving short shrift to protagonist Ethan Hunt&apos;s irrelevant love life). What makes this the most enjoyable instalment since Brian De Palma&apos;s florid original is Bird&apos;s utter lack of pretension. Release date aside, there&apos;s nothing self-serious or Oscar-aspiring about the film at all. It&apos;s as spirited, single-minded, and cheekily adolescent as Tintin, and nearly as elastic. Cruise and company escape an exploding Kremlin, scale the outside of the 206-story Burj Khalifa in Dubai, drive cars into rivers, into sandstorms, and head-first into the ground, and avert nuclear holocaust with nothing but pluck \u2013 and implausibility. A spy thriller hasn&apos;t felt this gratifyingly far-fetched since the Cold War days. They call it Mission: Impossible for a reason, and Bird never lets you forget it. There were far better films to see in 2011 (from The Tree of Life to Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives), and far better movies are opening this holiday season (Pina is the real standout), but Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol exhibits a rare and appealing kind of self-assurance.

The 56-year-old president told tens of thousands of people gathered at the Bhutto family shrine at Garhi Khuda Baksh in the southern Sindh province that the best way to pay tribute to his late wife, killed while campaigning in elections in 2007, was &quot;to defend and protect democracy and democratic institutions in the country and foil all conspiracies against it&quot;. The speech was Zardari&apos;s first public appearance since returning last week from Dubai where he had been receiving medical treatment for a suspected minor stroke and comes amid a welter of speculation that Pakistan&apos;s powerful military, which has ruled the country for much of its 64-year independent existence, is about to step in. Zardari told the crowd that Bhutto&apos;s assassins &quot;may have succeeded in eliminating her physically but [her] ideas and ideals \u2026 shall never be killed&quot;. Relations between Zardari, who became president in the wake of his wife&apos;s death, and the military have always been tense but have deteriorated significantly in recent months. Senior officers believe Zardari or close aides penned a leaked unsigned \u2013 and unauthenticated \u2013 memo appealing to Washington for aid in heading off a military coup earlier this year. Hearings into the affair are being held by Pakistan&apos;s supreme court and could seriously destabilise the government. Aides of Zardari privately claim the senior judiciary are acting in concert with senior military officers to force the president out. In a jibe at judges, Zardari raised the unsolved case of his wife&apos;s assassination in his speech. Both elected and military officials have appeared to back away from confrontation in recent days however. General Ashfaq Kayani, the chief of army staff and the most senior soldier in the country, has, via a military spokesman, denied any intention to mount a coup. On Monday Yusuf Raza Gilani, the prime minister, denied domestic media reports that he was planning to sack both Kayani and the head of the main Pakistani military spy service, the ISI, saying the military supported democracy. One senior official in the ruling Pakistan People&apos;s party, founded by Benazir Bhutto&apos;s father, said on Tuesday that there was no question of the president resigning, whatever the pressure. &quot;He&apos;s a fighter. He&apos;s not going anywhere,&quot; the official said. Zardari is deeply unpopular in Pakistan where he is blamed for failing to contain violent extremism, take measures to improve a corrupt and inefficient bureaucracy or act to halt rapid economic decline. Imran Khan, the cricketer turned conservative politician, has capitalised on this widespread disaffection. At least 100,000 people demonstrated their support for his Tehrik-e-Insaaf (Movement for Justice) party at a weekend rally in Karachi that cements his standing as a serious political force and increases pressure on the government. However, Khan will have to contest with the power of the Bhutto name, which though diminishing remains strong in Pakistan. The introduction of Bilawal Bhutto \u2013 the political crown prince of the dynasty \u2013 to voters has been accelerated since the illness of his father. In an article published in a local newspaper on Monday, the 23-year-old Oxford graduate called on his countrymen to &quot;remain committed to the evolution of a democratic Pakistan and reject the calls for confrontation between institutions&quot;. The instability in Pakistan comes at a bad time for Washington. America&apos;s own relations with the Pakistani military are at a low ebb after a series of crises in the last 12 months.", "title": "Zardari issues rallying cry for democracy in Pakistan amid coup fears", "sentences": ["The speech was Zardari&apos;s first public appearance since returning last week from Dubai where he had been receiving medical treatment for a suspected minor stroke and comes amid a welter of speculation that Pakistan&apos;s powerful military, which has ruled the country for much of its 64-year independent existence, is about to step in."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-27T18:39:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/28/guardian-sport-quiz-2011-answers", "tags": ["Sport", "Football"], "article": "Round one 1 On a cruise liner in Dubai;

The Ligue\u00a01 leaders are expected to confirm on Thursday that he has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract which will establish him as the highest paid manager in the French league. Ancelotti, who will replace Antoine Kombouar\u00e9, spent Tuesday night in Paris before arriving at Parc des Princes on Wednesday afternoon alongside the French club&apos;s sporting director, Leonardo. The former Chelsea manager, who was sacked at Stamford Bridge last May despite winning a league and cup Double in his first season in the Premier League and finishing as league runners\u2011up in his second, will earn a net annual salary of around \u20ac6m (\u00a35m). The Italian won two Champions League titles during a successful eight\u2011year spell in charge of Milan but, having initially been placed on gardening leave after leaving his position at Chelsea, he has now reached agreement over compensation for the final year of his contract in London and is free to join another club. Ancelotti&apos;s instinct had been to remain in England, preferably in the capital, though PSG, backed as they are by Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), represent a tantalising and ambitious alternative. The French club still hope to secure the free transfer signing of David Beckham once his contract at Los Angeles Galaxy expires at the end of the month and they could confirm the arrival of the former England captain while he is on a five-day mid-season training break in Qatar and Dubai next week. Ancelotti worked with Beckham briefly at Milan during the midfielder&apos;s first loan spell at San Siroand will seek to be reunited with a number of his former players in the mid-winter transfer window as he adds to PSG&apos;s options. Interest has already been expressed in Milan&apos;s Alexandre Pato, a player pursued by Chelsea during Ancelotti&apos;s time in London and costing around \u20ac50m, and there remains the chance that QSI could sanction a move for Real Madrid&apos;s Kak\u00e1. Florent Malouda is another who could move to PSG \u2013 who were eliminated from the Europa League under Kombouar\u00e9 but are three points clear at the top of their division \u2013 after expressing frustration at his bit-part role at Stamford Bridge. Ancelotti, who is likely to be unveiled on Friday or Saturday, will be joined in France by Giorgio Ciaschini and Giovanni Mauriin his backroom staff, both of whom worked with him at Chelsea, along with the former France international Sabri Lamouchi. Meanwhile PSG are formalising the details of Kombouar\u00e9&apos;s departure. The new manager&apos;s first game in charge will be a French Cup match against the amateur club Locmin\u00e9 Saint-Colomban who play in CFA2, the equivalent of the French fifth division, on 8\u00a0January.", "title": "Carlo Ancelotti poised to return with Paris St-Germain", "sentences": ["The French club still hope to secure the free transfer signing of David Beckham once his contract at Los Angeles Galaxy expires at the end of the month and they could confirm the arrival of the former England captain while he is on a five-day mid-season training break in Qatar and Dubai next week."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-28T19:50:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/29/fantasy-minute-by-minute-olympic-stadium", "tags": ["Olympic Stadium", "Tottenham Hotspur", "West Ham United", "Olympic Games 2012", "Football", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Preamble We&apos;re live from London as the Olympic Park Legacy Company sits down to decide finally whether West Ham United should get control of the Olympic Stadium when people stop running round it, or if Tottenham Hotspur should get the pleasure. For those unfamiliar with the situation the two clubs&apos; positions could barely be more different and look something like this: West Ham, whose team aren&apos;t currently very good but hope to build a new, better one pretty soon, think the stadium is great already; Tottenham, whose team are great already, think the stadium isn&apos;t very good but hope to build a new, better one pretty soon. Will the OPLC want to consign their stadium to the dustbin of history? Will they get into bed with a club haunted by the dread spectre of relegation? There&apos;s only one place to find out and that&apos;s, well, that&apos;s Committee Room Nine of Locog&apos;s Canary Wharf headquarters. But if you&apos;re not in that one place, this is the next best place, or if not exactly the next best, at least quite a good place. There are many worse places than this one. Can we agree on that, at least? 1 min Baroness Ford, chair of the OLPC, has just called the meeting to order. Looking around the room I don&apos;t recognise anyone at all but, according to some information I found on the internet, the OPLC board also contains several politicians, entrepreneurs and business executives. What, I hear you ask, do they know about athletics and football? Well, they number a certain Liz McMahon. She&apos;s actually a professional marketeer but she shares the first five letters of her name with the Olympic medallist Liz McColgan, and her entire surname with a former England midfielder. 3 min Ford is running through the five criteria they will use to make their decision. They will be looking for: 1) A reasonable, value-for-money long-term solution for the stadium; 2) Something that will be open as quickly as possible after the Games; 3) A tenant who will establish links with the local community and schools; 4) Something that isn&apos;t too complicated; 5) There isn&apos;t really a fifth, but it was thought that, if they had only four criteria, it wouldn&apos;t look as if they&apos;d actually put much effort in. 8 min The OPLC board is examining the two bid documents, starting with West Ham&apos;s, with each member reading a paragraph before passing it on. &quot;My grandparents, who tragically passed away when I was 12 in an accident involving a wet floor, a staplegun and a packet of Kellogg&apos;s Frosties, were called Opie and Elsie,&quot; writes Stuart from Lewisham. &quot;Every time I read the abbreviation of the Olympic Park Legacy Company&apos;s name I burst into tears.&quot; I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re going to have to suffer, Stuart. 11 min &quot;Point of information,&quot; interrupts a bloke in Committee Room Nine. &quot;What will happen if we award the stadium to West Ham?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; says Ford, &quot;Tottenham will certainly launch a legal challenge, Leyton Orient might launch one, too, and the decision will be reconsidered at a later date.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; says the bloke. And they carry on reading from the bid documents. 13 min &quot;Point of information,&quot; says a different bloke. &quot;What happens if we award the stadium to Tottenham?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; says Ford, &quot;West Ham will almost certainly launch a legal challenge, Leyton Orient might launch one too and the decision will be reconsidered at a later date.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; says the bloke, and they carry on reading from the bid documents. 18 min &quot;Hang on,&quot; says the first bloke. &quot;We give it to Spurs, West Ham will appeal. We give it to West Ham, Spurs will appeal. Whoever we give it to the other lot will call in the lawyers, so it doesn&apos;t matter who we give it to. Sod it, I&apos;m off for a fag.&quot; He wasn&apos;t kidding, either. He&apos;s gone. 21 min There has been considerable discussion of the first bloke&apos;s point, with the consensus being that it&apos;s a very good one. The rest of the OPLC have stopped reading the documents and are having a cup of tea and a bit of a chinwag. 25 min First bloke having returned, they have restarted reading the bid documents in the same way as before, only from now on anyone whose paragraph includes the word &quot;legacy&quot; has to drink a shot of vodka. 31 min Further rule: anyone who reads the word &quot;community&quot; has to run twice round the table. It&apos;s a big table. 33 min After discovering a box of official London 2012 Wenlock &amp; Mandeville bouncy balls, two committee members have erected a makeshift net across the table using pages ripped from the Spurs bid document and have started playing table tennis using iPads as bats. 36 min &quot;The thing is,&quot; slurs one committee member, &quot;I was expecting a little bit more from this process.&quot; &quot;Howdyamean?&quot; asks another. &quot;Well, I read about that Fifa lot and I was expecting at least a trip to the Caribbean and maybe even a private holiday island in Dubai. When I look back at this, what will I have got? An effing hangover.&quot; 41 min Everything&apos;s gone very quiet, I think the microphones may have been accidentally switched off. There seems to be some kind of problem, as one of the OPLC members just whirled round several times before collapsing to the floor. 42 min They&apos;ve fixed the microphones and it turns out they were playing charades and she was doing You Spin Me Round by Dead or Alive. 45 min The OPLC has just voted on a procedural motion to go straight to lunch, which passed unanimously. &quot;Should we at least skim-read Tottenham&apos;s offer document before we go?&quot; asks someone. &quot;We can&apos;t \u2013 I tore it up and used it as a table-tennis net,&quot; says someone else, shovelling the ripped remnants into a bin. &quot;Well, West Ham&apos;s looked OK. Shall we go for that one, then?&quot; There&apos;s a quick show of hands and it looks like good news for West Ham! And Tottenham&apos;s lawyers!", "title": "MBMs we wish we'd done in 2011 \u2013 No5: Olympic Park stadium decision", "sentences": ["&quot;Well, I read about that Fifa lot and I was expecting at least a trip to the Caribbean and maybe even a private holiday island in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-29T23:01:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/31/england-pakistan-barmy-army", "tags": ["England cricket team", "Cricket", "Pakistan cricket team", "Sport"], "article": "Despite the unlikely setting, England will be followed to the United Arab Emirates by &quot;thousands of fans&quot; keen to watch Andrew Strauss&apos;s team in a new location, according to Paul Burnham, the co-founder of the Barmy Army. &quot;We are very much looking forward to it,&quot; Burnham said. &quot;This is the first tour the Barmy Army have done with Thomson Sport.

{"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/dec/31/england-pakistan-test-series-emirates", "tags": ["Pakistan v England 2011-12", "England cricket team", "Pakistan cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "If ever a location appears designed to try to take the heat out of the first meeting between Pakistan and England since the match-fixing scandal, it is the United Arab Emirates. The aggravation and bitterness that still lingers after events that led to three Pakistani players receiving jail sentences could be hard to maintain in what to date has been international cricket&apos;s most stultifying location. Test cricket does not need a stalemate, but an anticipated combination of low crowds, draining heat and benign pitches could have such a tranquillising effect on proceedings that recriminations could feel just too much like hard work \u2013 at least until the first cry of &quot;no-ball&quot;. Pakistan have made quiet improvements since a News of the World sting during their Test series in England in the summer of 2010 led to three of their players, the captain Salman Butt among them, receiving lengthy bans from the International Cricket Council and jail sentences in Southwark crown court. In their adopted home in the United Arab Emirates, as the Fake Sheikh has given way to real sheikhs, there has been a more controlled aspect to their play that England will have noted. The new chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, Zaka Ashraf \u2013 although his appointment was criticised as more of the same political patronage \u2013 has so far appeared to be a steadier hand than the man he replaced, Ijaz Butt. This three-Test series, which will be followed by four one-day internationals and three Twenty20 games, may be first versus fifth in the world, but England, after the rare luxury of a five-month break since their last Test, will have to be at their best to win it. Last autumn, as the debate sounded about falling Test crowds in many parts of the world, a colleague said it would not be long before spectators in some venues would be paid to watch Test cricket, so ensuring a more appealing backdrop for the TV cameras. It was an interesting thought. If they were paid to attend, would they be paid even more to cheer?\u00a0Would they be fined if they were caught yawning on camera or watching Premier League highlights on their iPhone? In Abu Dhabi in October something similar occurred. Spectators were not paid to attend a Pakistan Test against Sri Lanka, but they were let in free and even then they did not exactly rush there in their thousands. The Emirates Cricket Association has yet to confirm whether the same policy will apply for England&apos;s visit, but it would be no bad thing. This Test series would be better fought not as an imagined moral crusade, but as an important contribution to ensuring the survival and, ultimately, regenerationof Pakistan cricket while fears of terrorism cause them to play &quot;home&quot; internationals outside their own country. The more the stadiums in Abu Dhabi and Dubai feel like a Pakistan home occasion the better. Mick Newell, as well as being a past coach of England Lions, is also coach of a Nottinghamshire side that have experienced cricket in the Middle East. Notts, as champion county, met MCC in a no longer so traditional curtain raiser in Abu Dhabi in March played under floodlights with experimental pink balls. Even those unusual circumstances left them keenly aware of the task that England face. &quot;England are not used to playing in front of the sort of low Test crowds they might encounter in the Middle East,&quot; Newell says. &quot;The best way to counter it is by doing nothing different, ensuring that warm-ups and preparation are approached with the same intensity and thoroughness. Maybe England will get their support staff around the boundary a bit more, talking to bowlers at fine leg, gingering people up a bit. Although it appears that nobody is interested, you don&apos;t think like that because there will be millions watching around the world.&quot; Memories of match fixing should ensure enough zest remains even in the flattest of stalemates. Wahab Riaz, back in the Pakistan squad, was mentioned in passing in match-fixing evidence, but never charged with an offence. He was dropped for Pakistan&apos;s tour to Bangladesh and said at the time: &quot;To insinuate I have been dropped because of some spot-fixing allegations is not acceptable.&quot; Shoaib Akhtar also told, in his autobiography, Controversially Yours, of his despair when one England player made accusations against Riaz during a net session. England&apos;s response to Riaz on the field will be keenly studied. &quot;I don&apos;t think there will be much need to turn them on against Pakistan,&quot; Newell concedes. &quot;There are enough memories there. If it was England v Bangladesh in front of an empty crowd in Abu Dhabi, then maybe that would be more difficult. There should be enough feeling for it to be a hard-fought series. The pitches we played on were slow with not much carry and didn&apos;t deteriorate massively over the four days. Conditions were also pretty warm, so it was quite tough for bowlers and fielders. What you don&apos;t want are three dead games. That would be a nightmare for Test cricket.&quot; The ICC will feel the same way. Plans are afoot for the UAE to have 10 good-class cricket grounds by 2014. Twelve countries applied last year for ICC development funding and only the UAE received it. It was quite a gift to one of the richest regions of the world.", "title": "New setting and new test for England and Pakistan in Emirates | David Hopps", "sentences": ["The more the stadiums in Abu Dhabi and Dubai feel like a Pakistan home occasion the better."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-31T23:00:02Z"}], "sentences": 1016}
